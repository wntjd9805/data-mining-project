We consider using untrained neural networks to solve the reconstruction problem of snapshot compressive imag-ing (SCI), which uses a two-dimensional (2D) detector to capture a high-dimensional (usually 3D) data-cube in a compressed manner. Various SCI systems have been built in recent years to capture data such as high-speed videos, hyperspectral images, and the state-of-the-art reconstruc-tion is obtained by the deep neural networks. However, most of these networks are trained in an end-to-end man-ner by a large amount of corpus with sometimes simulated ground truth, measurement pairs.
In this paper, inspired by the untrained neural networks such as deep image pri-ors (DIP) and deep decoders, we develop a framework by integrating DIP into the plug-and-play regime, leading to a self-supervised network for spectral SCI reconstruction.
Extensive synthetic and real data results show that the pro-posed algorithm without training is capable of achieving competitive results to the training based networks. Further-more, by integrating the proposed method with a pre-trained deep denoising prior, we have achieved state-of-the-art re-sults.

Introduction
Recent advances in artiﬁcial intelligence and robotics have led to high demands to capture multi-dimensional high resolution data, such as high-speed videos, hyperspectral images, etc. This brings unprecedented challenges to exist-ing imaging devices. On the other hand, compressive sens-ing (CS) [9,10] has provided us an alternative way to devise imaging systems to capture these high-dimensional data. As one representative technique based on CS, snapshot com-pressive imaging (SCI) [22, 33, 49] employs the multiplex-ing technique to impose the modulation in the optical path and captures the 3D spectral or temporal data-cube using a 2D detector in a compressed way. An SCI system is thus

Figure 1. Reconstructed real data of Plant (upper) and Dog ol-factory membrane section (lower), captured by the spectral SCI systems in [26] and [27], respectively. We show 5 out of 28 (up-per) and 5 out of 24 (lower) spectral channels of the two scenes and compare our proposed self-supervised method (PnP-DIP that does not need training data) with two supervised algorithms (need training data), respectively. composed of a hardware encoder to capture the compressed measurement and a software decoder to reconstruct the de-sired 3D data-cube. In this paper, we consider the spectral
SCI system, where the pioneering work is the coded aper-ture snapshot spectral imager (CASSI) [12, 40], in which a physical mask and a prism are utilized to implement the multiplexing modulation. This work focuses on the algo-rithm design and thus the aforementioned software decoder in SCI. Speciﬁcally, we develop a reconstruction framework that integrates the untrained neural networks as priors [38] into the plug-and-play (PnP) algorithms [37, 39]. 1.1. Motivation
It has been over a decade since the CASSI being built in the lab and one main bottleneck as in other CS systems was the reconstruction algorithm, which was usually based on it-erative optimization. These algorithms are either slow [22]
or low quality [4]. Thanks to deep learning, both the speed and quality have been improved signiﬁcantly during the past few years as various deep networks [16, 26, 29, 41, 42, 52] have been built to implement the software decoder. How-ever, there is one challenge that needs to be addressed: the training data. It is well known that sufﬁcient training data are very important to the performance of the deep networks.
Unfortunately, for the hyperspectral imaging considered in this work, very limited data are available that can be used for training and most existing networks are still based on the
CAVE [30], ICVL [2] and KAIST [8] data. Though good results have been obtained on synthetic and some real data, we have noticed that for some spectra that were not existed in the training data, these networks can not reconstruct the desired spectral cube well. For example, the recovered re-sults of λ -net [29] in the Bird data [19] show big errors in the spectral accuracy due to the mismatch between the train-ing data and the real data. The short of training data might have limited the generalizability of existing networks.
To address this challenge, one main breakthrough of us-ing deep learning in inverse problem is the untrained neural networks such as the deep image prior (DIP) [38] and deep decoder [15], which utilize the neural networks to learn the priors from the raw measurements directly and thus does not need any training data. Both DIP and deep decoder have shown promising results in some image restoration results such as image denoising, inpainting and super-resolution.
One straightforward way is to directly use these networks in the SCI reconstruction problem; however, after exten-sive experiments, we found it is difﬁcult to obtain good results in this manner. Please refer to Table 2 for a de-tailed comparison, where we call this direct usage as the
“sole DIP”. Since the goal of the untrained neural network is to learn a prior, in this work, we apply this prior (learn-ing during reconstruction) into the recently advanced PnP framework [37, 39, 50, 54], with an optionally different kind of prior to solve the spectral SCI reconstruction. The net-work is optimized as the iteration in PnP going on during the reconstruction, and thus leading to a self-supervised deep learning framework. 1.2. Contributions
The goal of this work is to develop a self-supervised neural network for the spectral SCI reconstruction, which enjoys the strong learning capability of deep networks but does not need any training data. Speciﬁc contributions are:
• A self-supervised framework is proposed for spectral SCI reconstruction.
• An alternating optimization algorithm is developed to solve the joint network learning and reconstruction.
• Extensive results on both synthetic and real datasets ver-ify the superiority of the proposed approach.
• Our proposed algorithm is robust to the Poisson noise, which happens in real measurements.
Importantly, our model does not need any training data, but with ﬁne tuning on parameters for each dataset, competi-tive results are obtained with similar quality to the recently proposed supervised deep learning algorithms. Please refer to Fig. 1 for two real data results captured by two differ-ent spectral SCI systems. Furthermore, by integrating our proposed approach with the pre-trained HSI deep denoising prior [56], we have achieved state-of-the-art results. 1.3.
