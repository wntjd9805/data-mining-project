Abstract
The goal of the alignment problem is to align a (given) point cloud 𝑃 = {𝑝1, · · · , 𝑝𝑛} to another (observed) point cloud 𝑄 = {𝑞1, · · · , 𝑞𝑛}. That is, to compute a rotation matrix 𝑅 ∈ R3×3 and a translation vector 𝑡 ∈ R3 that minimize the sum of paired distances between every trans-formed point 𝑅𝑝𝑖 − 𝑡, to its corresponding point 𝑞𝑖, over every 𝑖 ∈ {1, · · · , 𝑛}. A harder version is the registra-tion problem, where the correspondence is unknown, and the minimum is also over all possible correspondence func-tions from 𝑃 to 𝑄. Algorithms such as the Iterative Closest
Point (ICP) and its variants were suggested for these prob-lems, but none yield a provable non-trivial approximation for the global optimum.
We prove that there always exists a “witness” set of 3 pairs in 𝑃 × 𝑄 that, via novel alignment algorithm, deﬁnes a constant factor approximation (in the worst case) to this global optimum. We then provide algorithms that recover this witness set and yield the ﬁrst provable constant fac-tor approximation for the: (i) alignment problem in 𝑂(𝑛) expected time, and (ii) registration problem in polynomial time. Such small witness sets exist for many variants in-cluding points in 𝑑-dimensional space, outlier-resistant cost functions, and different correspondence types.
Extensive experimental results on real and synthetic datasets show that, in practice, our approximation con-stants are close to 1 and our error is up to x10 times smaller than state-of-the-art algorithms. 1.

Introduction
Consider the set 𝑃 of known 3D landmarks mounted on a car, and the set 𝑄 of the same 3D landmarks as currently ob-served via an external 3D camera, say, a few seconds later.
Suppose that we wish to compute the new car’s position and orientation, relative to its starting point. These can be de-duced by recovering the rigid transformation (rotation and translation) that align 𝑃 to 𝑄. In this alignment problem, we assume that the correspondence (matching) between ev-Figure 1: Registration visualization using the Armadillo model with 𝑛 = 1000 points and 𝑘 = 20% outliers.

P-ICP-Refined(𝑃, 𝑄, 𝛾, cost). cost is the SSD with a threshold M-estimator and 𝛾 = 3000; see Section 3.2. ery point in 𝑃 to 𝑄 is known. When this matching is un-known, and needs to be computed, the problem is known as the registration problem. It is a fundamental problem in computer vision [33, 28, 40, 47] with many applications in robotics [27, 37, 13] and autonomous driving [51].
Alignment. In the alignment problem the input consists of two ordered sets 𝑃 = {𝑝1, · · · , 𝑝𝑛} and 𝑄 = {𝑞1, · · · , 𝑞𝑛} in R𝑑, where 𝑑 = 3 in the previous application, and the goal is to minimize

Here, the sum is over the distance between every point 𝑝𝑖 ∈ 𝑃 to its correspond-ing point 𝑞𝑖 ∈ 𝑄. This correspondence may be obtained using some auxiliary information, like point-wise descrip-tors e.g., SIFT [25], visual tracking of points [36, 44], or the use of predeﬁned shapes and features [32, 39].
To our knowledge, the only provable approximation to the optimal global minimum of (1) is for its variant where
𝐷(𝑝, 𝑞) is replaced by ℓ(𝐷(𝑝, 𝑞)) = ‖𝑝 − 𝑞‖2, i.e., squared

Yes is unique and easy to compute: 𝑡 is simply the vector con-necting the two centers of mass of 𝑃 and 𝑄, and 𝑅 ∈ R𝑑×𝑑 can be computed using Singular Value Decomposition [14] as described in [22]. There has been a long line of work to handle this problem also in the presence of outliers; see e.g., [6, 52, 49]. Many of those works are RANSAC-type algorithms [12]. This paper gives the ﬁrst provable non-trivial approximation algorithm for (1), while also handling an even wider range of functions.
Registration. The registration problem does not assume the correspondence between 𝑃 and 𝑄 is given, that is, we do not know which point in 𝑄 matches 𝑝𝑖 ∈ 𝑃 . Therefore, be-sides the rigid motion, the correspondence needs also to be extracted based solely on the two given point clouds, result-ing in a much more complex problem with a large number of local minima; see Fig. 1. Formally, it aims to minimize

Here, a natural selection for ℓ is ℓ(𝑥) = 𝑥2. The set 𝑄 here is assumed to be of size 𝑛 for simplicity only, but can be of any different size.
Unlike (1), we do not know a provable approximation to (2), even for ℓ(𝑥) = 𝑥2. The most commonly used solu-tion for this problem, both in academy and industry, is the
Iterative Closest Point (ICP) heuristic [4]. Our main contri-bution is a provable alternative to the ICP which approxi-mates the global optimum of this harder problem.
More complex cost functions. When dealing with real-world data, noise and outliers are inevitable. One may thus consider alternative cost functions, rather than the sum of squared distances (SSD) above, due to its sensitivity to such corrupted input. A natural more general cost function would be to pick e.g., ℓ(𝑥) = 𝑥𝑟 for 𝑟 > 0, which is more robust to noise when 𝑟 ∈ (0, 1]. Alternatively, for handling outliers, a more suitable function would be ℓ(𝑥) = min {𝑥, 𝑇 } for some threshold 𝑇 > 0, or the common Tuckey or Huber losses, or any other robust statistics function [17].
To completely ignore these (unknown) faulty subsets of some paired data we may consider solving min (𝑅,𝑡)

In this paper we suggest a general framework for prov-ably approximating the global minimum of the alignment and registration problems, including formulations (1)–(3). 1.1.
