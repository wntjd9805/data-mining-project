Abstract
We consider the deep point cloud analysis tasks where the inputs of the networks are randomly rotated. Recent progress in rotation-invariant point cloud analysis is mainly driven by converting point clouds into their respective canonical poses, and principal component analysis (PCA) is a prac-tical tool to achieve this. Due to the imperfect alignment of PCA, most of the current works are devoted to develop-ing powerful network structures and features to overcome this deﬁciency, without thoroughly analyzing the PCA-based canonical poses themselves. In this work, we present a de-tailed study w.r.t. the PCA-based canonical poses of point clouds. Our investigation reveals that the ambiguity problem associated with the PCA-based canonical poses is handled insufﬁciently in some recent works. To this end, we develop a simple pose selector module for disambiguation, which presents noticeable enhancement (i.e., 5.3% classiﬁcation accuracy) over state-of-the-art approaches on the challeng-ing real-world dataset.1 1.

Introduction
Deep learning is thriving in point cloud analysis owing to its excellent performance in various tasks. As a primi-tive representation of 3D data that can be directly obtained from sensors, point clouds are widely employed as the direct inputs of modern neural networks [17, 30, 31].
However, there exists a fundamental problem when point clouds are used in high-level applications, such as classiﬁca-tion, retrieval, and segmentation. In such applications, we expect the networks to present consistent inferences w.r.t. varying afﬁne transformations on the point clouds. While the effects of scaling and translation can be eliminated ef-fectively by normalization and centralization [17], achieving rotational invariance remains an open problem.
Various methods have been proposed to tackle this is-sue. There are attempts to learn to align shapes in an op-timal pose [7, 9], or robustify the networks via equivari-ant properties [6, 20, 21]. However, these methods are not strictly rotation-invariant and require the rotational space to be densely sampled for data augmentation. Some works also attempt to handcraft rotation-invariant geometric fea-tures [4, 24, 36], although they inevitably suffer from infor-mation loss compared to directly using the Cartesian coordi-nates of the point clouds.
Some recent works propose to use intrinsically deter-mined canonical poses to avoid information loss. As a practi-cal tool, PCA enables us to intrinsically determine 3 orthogo-nal bases (i.e., the principal axes) of a given point cloud and align them to the world Cartesian coordinate. Despite the effectiveness of PCA-based canonical poses, we observe that some recent works are devoted to developing more powerful networks without clearly studying the canonical poses them-selves [10, 34, 35, 37]. Consequently, these works have not explicitly tackled the ambiguity problem of the PCA-based canonical poses, which hinders their performance.
In this work, we analyze in detail the PCA-based canoni-cal poses in point cloud analysis. We study the actual number of ambiguities of the PCA-based canonical poses, explore the effects of PCA in point cloud analysis, and propose a pose selector module for disambiguation. Our investiga-tion reveals that the accurate identiﬁcation of ambiguities can lead to noticeable performance boosts than the recently developed networks and features. I.e., state-of-the-art ap-proaches would be outperformed by a large margin on the challenging real-world dataset if ambiguities are properly identiﬁed. We summarize our contributions as follows:
• We study the actual number of ambiguities of the PCA-based canonical poses, showing that it has not been fully addressed in recent works.
• We demonstrate the actual ability of PCA-based canon-ical poses by distinct experiments and detailed analysis, hoping to prompt future works in the context of rotation-invariant point cloud analysis.

• We propose a pose selector that can effectively disam-biguate the canonical poses and boost performance.
