Abstract
The proliferation of deepfake media is raising concerns among the public and relevant authorities. It has become essential to develop countermeasures against forged faces in social media. This paper presents a comprehensive study on two new countermeasure tasks: multi-face forgery detec-tion and segmentation in-the-wild. Localizing forged faces among multiple human faces in unrestricted natural scenes is far more challenging than the traditional deepfake recog-nition task. To promote these new tasks, we have created the first large-scale dataset posing a high level of challenges that is designed with face-wise rich annotations explicitly for face forgery detection and segmentation, namely Open-Forensics. With its rich annotations, our OpenForensics dataset has great potentials for research in both deepfake prevention and general human face detection. We have also developed a suite of benchmarks for these tasks by conduct-ing an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art instance de-tection and segmentation methods on our newly constructed dataset in various scenarios. 1.

Introduction
Continuing advances in deep learning have led to impres-sive improvements in deepfake methods (i.e., deep learning-based face forgery), which can change the target person’s identity [32, 1, 64, 42]. Emerging techniques such as au-toencoder (AE) models and generative adversarial networks (GANs) enable transferring one person’s face to another person while retaining the original facial expression and head pose [68, 67, 56, 66]. The realistic appearance syn-thesized with deepfake methods is drawing much attention

Moreover, falsified AI-synthesized images/videos have raised serious concerns about individ-ual harassment and criminal deception [6, 62, 12]. To ad-dress threats posed by spoofing and impersonation attacks, it is essential to develop countermeasures against face forg-eries in digital media.
Conventional face forgery recognition methods [2, 54, 53] require the input of given face regions. Therefore, they can process only one face at a time, and processing multiple faces sequentially is time-consuming. Moreover, their per-formance greatly depends on the accuracy of the indepen-dent face detection method used. Given that these methods have been evaluated only in laboratory environments using images with a simple background and a single clear front face [31, 78], they are not ready for deployment in the real world, where the contexts are much more diverse and chal-lenging than simple staged scenarios.
It has thus become essential to develop methods that can

Fake Identity
GT Type effectively process multiple faces simultaneously from an input image. To our best knowledge, no methods have been proposed for face forgery detection and segmentation offi-cially. We attribute this partially to the lack of a large-scale dataset for training and testing. To encourage more studies in this field, we present four contributions in this paper.
First, we present a comprehensive study on tasks related to massive face forgery in-the-wild. Particularly, we intro-duce two new tasks: multi-face forgery detection and seg-mentation in-the-wild. This is the first formal exploration of these tasks to the best of our knowledge. Previous work has explored only single-face forgery recognition.
Second, we propose generating an infinite number of fake individual identities using GAN models for non-target face-swapping without repeatedly training a deepfake AE.
Our proposed forgery workflow reduces the cost of synthe-sizing fake data.
Third, using the proposed forgery workflow, we intro-duce a novel image dataset to support the development of multi-face forgery detection and segmentation tasks. Our newly constructed OpenForensics dataset is the first large-scale dataset designed for these tasks. It consists of 115K unrestricted images with 334K human faces. Unlike exist-ing datasets, ours contains various backgrounds and mul-tiple people of various ages, genders, poses, positions, and face occlusions. All images have face-wise rich annotations supporting multiple tasks, such as forgery category, bound-ing box, segmentation mask, forgery boundary, and general facial landmarks (see Figs. 1 and 2). The dataset can thus support not only multi-face forgery detection and segmenta-tion tasks but also conventional tasks involving the general human face.
Fourth, we present a benchmark suite to facilitate the evaluation and advancement of these tasks. We conducted an extensive evaluation and in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art instance detection and segmentation models in vari-ous scenarios.
