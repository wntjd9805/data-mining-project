Abstract
Point cloud segmentation is a fundamental task in 3D.
Despite recent progress on point cloud segmentation with the power of deep networks, current deep learning meth-ods based on the clean label assumptions may fail with noisy labels. Yet, object class labels are often mislabeled in real-world point cloud datasets. In this work, we take the lead in solving this issue by proposing a novel Point
Noise-Adaptive Learning (PNAL) framework. Compared to existing noise-robust methods on image tasks, our PNAL is noise-rate blind, to cope with the spatially variant noise rate problem speciﬁc to point clouds . Speciﬁcally, we pro-pose a novel point-wise conﬁdence selection to obtain reli-able labels based on the historical predictions of each point.
A novel cluster-wise label correction is proposed with a vot-ing strategy to generate the best possible label taking the neighbor point correlations into consideration. We con-duct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of PNAL on both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets. In particular, even with 60% symmetric noisy labels, our pro-posed method produces much better results than its baseline counterpart without PNAL and is comparable to the ideal upper bound trained on a completely clean dataset. More-over, we fully re-labeled the validation set of a popular but noisy real-world scene dataset ScanNetV2 to make it clean, for rigorous experiment and future research. Our code and data will be released. 1.

Introduction
In recent years, the development of deep neural networks (DNNs) has led to great success in 3D point cloud segmen-tation [11, 36, 32]. Thanks to the powerful learning capac-ity, once high-quality annotations are given, DNNs-based point segmentation methods can achieve remarkable perfor-mance. However, such high learning capacity is a double-edged sword, i.e., it can also over-ﬁt label noise and incur performance degradation if there are incorrect annotations.

It is mainly be-data labels are more difﬁcult to obtain. cause: 1) the point number to annotate is often very mas-sive, e.g., million scale in annotating a typical indoor scene in ScanNetV2 [6]; 2) the annotating process is inherently more complex and requires more expertise for the annota-tors, e.g., constantly changing the view, position and scale to understand the underlying 3D structure. As a result, even the commonly used 3D scene dataset ScanNetV2 [6], which is already a version after reﬁning the label from the Scan-Net, has a large portion of label noise, as shown in Figure 1.
Based on the above considerations, there is an urgent need to study how to learn with noisy labels for robust point cloud segmentation. However, to the best of our knowl-edge, most research works about learning with noisy la-bels focus on image classiﬁcation, and no previous study exists for point cloud segmentation. More importantly, such works designed for image recognition cannot be di-rectly applied to point cloud segmentation. For example, among the most popular methods, sample selection meth-ods [12, 33, 24, 26, 17] often assume that the noise rate of all samples is a known constant value. However, the noise rates are often unknown and variable. Robust loss function methods [35, 30] cannot achieve consistent noise robustness to large noise rates. Whereas label correction methods [23, 26, 1] are designed to correct for image-level label noise, the point cloud segmentation task requires to correct point-level noises. Considering that the point labels within each instance are strongly correlated, directly apply-ing these methods to each point independently without con-sidering the local correlation is suboptimal.
In this paper, we present a novel point noise-adaptive learning (PNAL) framework, which is the ﬁrst attempt to empower the point cloud segmentation model with re-sistance to annotation noise. Speciﬁcally, to cope with unknown, possibly heavy, and varying noise rates, we designed a point-level conﬁdence selection mechanism, which obtains reliable labels based on the historical predic-tions of each point without requiring a known noise rate.
Next, in order to fully utilize the local correlation among labels, we propose a label correction process performed at

From left to right are the input (noisy instances highlighted red boxes), the manual annotation given by the real-world dataset ScanNetV2, and the prediction of PNAL (more in line with the real category). It is noticeable that this popular dataset suffers from label noise, such as mislabeling the ﬂoor as a chair, even that it is already a re-labeled version of ScanNet. Our PNAL framework is trained on this noisy dataset but still achieves correct predictions. cluster level. This is done by the proposed voting strat-egy that tries to merge reliable labels from relevant points to provide the best possible label for each point cluster, with a computationally efﬁcient implementation.
To demonstrate the effectiveness of our PNAL, we com-pare the proposed framework with various possible base-lines based on different network backbones on the syn-thetic noisy label dataset from stanford large-scale 3d in-door spaces (S3DIS) [2], which shows the great advantage of PNAL on both performance and efﬁciency. On the real-world noisy dataset ScannetV2 [6], we notice that both its training and validation set suffers from the noisy label is-sue. Therefore, we not only conducted experiments on the original training and validation set. Also, for a more rig-orous evaluation, we reﬁne the validation set by manually correcting the noisy labels and evaluate PNAL on this clean set. These results indicate that PNAL is also robust to real-world noise. To further explore PNAL, a complete ablation study, training process analysis, and robustness test were also performed.
To summarize, our contributions are fourfold.
• To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work in-vestigating noisy labels on point cloud data, which has a wide and urgent need for 3D applications where the volume of data is growing drastically.
• A novel noise-rate blind PNAL framework is proposed to handle spatially variant noise rates in point cloud.
It consists of point-level conﬁdence selection, cluster-level label correction with voting mechanism, and can be easily applied to different network architectures.
• Extensive experiments are conducted to show the clear improvements by PNAL, on both synthetic and real-world noisy label datasets.
• We re-labeled the validation set of ScanNetV2 by cor-recting noises and will make it public to facilitate both point cloud segmentation and noise label learning. 2.
