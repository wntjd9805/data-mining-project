Abstract
Measuring the acoustic characteristics of a space is of-ten done by capturing its impulse response (IR), a represen-tation of how a full-range stimulus sound excites it. This work generates an IR from a single image, which can then be applied to other signals using convolution, simulating the reverberant characteristics of the space shown in the im-age. Recording these IRs is both time-intensive and expen-sive, and often infeasible for inaccessible locations. We use an end-to-end neural network architecture to generate plau-sible audio impulse responses from single images of acous-tic environments. We evaluate our method both by compar-isons to ground truth data and by human expert evaluation.
We demonstrate our approach by generating plausible im-pulse responses from diverse settings and formats including well known places, musical halls, rooms in paintings, im-ages from animations and computer games, synthetic envi-ronments generated from text, panoramic images, and video conference backgrounds. convolution [38, 31]. Audio IRs are recorded measurements of how an environment responds to an acoustic stimulus.
IRs can be measured by recording a space during a burst of white noise like a clap, a balloon pop, or a sinusoid swept across the range of human hearing [28]. Accurately captur-ing these room impulse responses requires time, specialized equipment, knowledge, and planning. Directly recording these measurements may be entirely infeasible in continu-ously inhabited or inaccessible spaces of interest. End-to-end IR estimation has far ranging applications relevant to fields including music production, speech processing, and generating immersive extended reality environments. Our
Image2Reverb system directly synthesizes IRs from images of acoustic environments. This approach removes the bar-riers to entry, namely cost and time, opening the door for a broad range of applications.
In this work we model IR generation as a cross-modal paired-example domain adaptation problem and apply a conditional GAN [10, 12, 23] to synthesize plausible audio impulse responses conditioned on images of spaces. Next, we will describe related work that informs our approach. 1.
