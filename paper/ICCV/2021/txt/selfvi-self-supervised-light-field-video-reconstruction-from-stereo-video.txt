Abstract
Light-ﬁeld imaging is appealing to the mobile devices market because of its capability for intuitive post-capture processing. Acquiring light ﬁeld (LF) data with high angu-lar, spatial and temporal resolution poses signiﬁcant chal-lenges, especially with space constraints preventing bulky optics. At the same time, stereo video capture, now avail-able on many consumer devices, can be interpreted as a sparse LF-capture. We explore the application of small baseline stereo videos for reconstructing high ﬁdelity LF videos.
We propose a self-supervised learning-based algorithm for LF video reconstruction from stereo video. The self-supervised LF video reconstruction is guided via the geo-metric information from the individual stereo pairs and the temporal information from the video sequence. LF estima-tion is further regularized by a low-rank constraint based on layered LF displays. The proposed self-supervised al-gorithm facilitates advantages such as post-training ﬁne-tuning on test sequences and variable angular view interpo-lation and extrapolation. Quantitatively the reconstructed
LF videos show higher ﬁdelity than previously proposed un-supervised approaches.We demonstrate our results via LF videos generated from publicly available stereo videos ac-quired from commercially available stereoscopic cameras.
Finally, we demonstrate that our reconstructed LF videos allow applications such as post-capture focus control and region-of-interest (RoI) based focus tracking for videos. 1.

Introduction
Photography and videography has become ubiquitous in our modern lives due to the availability of simple-to-use imaging hardware. With steadily increasing image quality, consumers long for intuitive and simple processing for post-capture ﬁnetuning of their images. LF imaging has emerged as a promising imaging technique to overcome the limita-tions of conventional photography such as post-capture fo-cus control, novel view synthesis, and post-capture depth-of-ﬁeld control. With video acquisition surging in popu-Figure 1: We propose a self-supervised algorithm for LF video reconstruction from a stereo video, enabling applications such as post-capture focus control for videos.

However, acquiring LF video data at useful frame-rates re-mains challenging. For example, commercial LF cameras such as Lytro acquire LF videos at only 3 frames per sec-ond (fps) [45]. This is mainly because of the trade-off be-tween angular, spatial, and temporal resolution. Modern cameras easily capture videos at 720p resolution at a rea-sonable frame-rate of 30 fps.
Ignoring the challenges of complex LF sensor, capturing a LF video at reasonable an-gular resolution of 7 × 7 requires a staggering ~50× more bandwidth. This is equivalent to capturing a 50MP video at 30 fps, something that is currently unimaginable for con-sumer devices.
While computational photography is poised to solve some of these problems in the upcoming decade via jointly optimized hardware-software solutions [16, 44, 50, 43], a practical solution is yet to be found. Numerous approaches have been proposed to overcome this challenge of high res-olution LF imaging using hardware, commonly available today. Table 1 provides a concise review of such existing methods. We particularly note the recent work attempt-ing to reconstruct LF images from sparsely sampled angu-lar views [19, 3]. Considering the current limitations on available LF-hardware, we consider a simple case of sparse samples: the stereo image pair. In this paper, we tackle the task of reconstructing LF video from a sequence of stereo frames and propose a self-supervised learning-based algo-rithm as our solution.
The LF reconstruction in our self-supervised algorithm is guided via the geometric and temporal information em-bedded in a stereo video sequence. A recurrent neural net-work ﬁrst takes the stereo frames at the current time-step and outputs a low-rank representation for LF frames based on layered LF displays [51]. The full 4D LF frame is then obtained from this representation via a deterministic linear operation. To enforce the LF epipolar consistency, we im-pose a disparity-based geometric consistency constraint on the generated LF frames. To ensure temporal consistency of the generated LF frames, we enforce an optical ﬂow-based constraint [21]. Two different recurrent neural networks are learned to estimate the disparity maps and optical ﬂow from the input stereo video. All three networks are trained via self-supervised cost functions during training.
A signiﬁcant advantage of our approach is that it is self-supervised, and hence does not require hard-to-acquire ground-truth data for supervision while training. Our al-gorithm is able to estimate the full 4D LF with variable number of angular views from the input stereo views. We also show that our algorithm allows us to extend the base-line of the input views and generate novel views outside the original stereo baseline. Finally, our algorithm can be
ﬁne-tuned (see Sec. 4.4 and Fig. 1 and 8) on speciﬁc video sequences as it does not require ground truth data for super-vision. Such self-supervised ﬁne-tuning is especially useful when the test sequences do not follow the same distribution as the training sequences.
We show that our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art disparity-based LF reconstruction algo-rithms. Our algorithm also performs on par with unsuper-vised LF reconstruction approaches, e.g. X-ﬁelds [3] with 4 corner-views of the LF as its input [3]. Overall, our con-tributions are:
• A self-supervised learning-based algorithm for LF video reconstruction from stereo video.
• Effective use of layered display based low-rank regu-larization for self-supervised LF video prediction.
