Abstract
We introduce 3D-FRONT (3D Furnished Rooms with layOuts and semaNTics), a new, large-scale, and compre-hensive repository of synthetic indoor scenes highlighted by professionally designed layouts and a large number of rooms populated by high-quality textured 3D models with style compatibility. From layout semantics down to texture details of individual objects, our dataset is freely available to the academic community and beyond. Currently, 3D-FRONT contains 6,813 CAD houses, where 18,968 rooms diversely furnished by 3D objects, far surpassing all pub-licly available scene datasets. The 13,151 furniture objects all come with high-quality textures. While the ﬂoorplans and layout designs (i.e., furniture arrangements) are di-rectly sourced from professional creations, the interior de-signs in terms of furniture styles, color, and textures have been carefully curated based on a recommender system we develop to attain consistent styles as expert designs. Fur-thermore, we release Trescope, a light-weight rendering tool, to support benchmark rendering of 2D images and annotations from 3D-FRONT. We demonstrate two appli-cations, interior scene synthesis and texture synthesis, that are especially tailored to the strengths of our new dataset. 1.

Introduction
The computer vision community has invested much ef-fort into the study of 3D indoor scenes, from 3D reconstruc-tion, visual SLAM, and navigation, to scene understanding, affordance analysis, and generative modeling. With data-driven and learning-based approaches receiving more and more attention in recent years, there has been a steady ac-cumulation of indoor scene datasets [27, 36, 43, 4, 19, 6, 9, 18, 23, 49, 24] to drive the deep learning revolution that has 1

Table 1: Comparison between prominent 3D indoor scene datasets, where “#3DFRs” represents the number of rooms or scenes populated with 3D furniture objects, “N/A” = “not available”, “N/R” = “not reported”, “Raw Mesh” denotes machine reconstructed meshes, and “Raw PCD” refers to reconstructed point clouds. For model textures, “Rec. from Scan” is the result of reconstruction from raw RGB-D data, while “Amateur” and “Professional” refer to who designed the textures. The
“3D structures” annotatd by Structured3D [49] contain information on primitives including 3D boxes and their relations. redeﬁned the landscape of indoor scene processing.
Existing 3D scene datasets all fall into two broadly cat-egories: acquired (via scanning and reconstruction) vs. de-signed (i.e., synthetic scenes created by humans). In terms of data volume, the largest repository is ScanNet [9] which consists of 2.5M RGB-D images from 1,513 scanned real in 707 distinct scenes acquired by commodity sensors, spaces. The 3D scenes, including textured 3D objects, were recovered by state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction techniques from the raw scans, which are typically noisy and incom-plete. As a result, the reconstructed meshes are often of low quality, both in geometric ﬁdelity and texture quality.
In the world of synthetic 3D indoor scene datasets, the recent exit by SUNCG [34] has left an apparent void in the community. Most recently, Structured3D [49] and Open-Room [24] have emerged as promising alternatives.
In addition to providing professionally designed room lay-outs, Structured3D [49] aims to provide large-scale photo-realistic scene images with rich 3D structure annotations.
However, the actual 3D furniture objects populating the scenes are not included in the dataset. OpenRoom [24] replaces detected objects in a set of 1,068 scanned scenes from ScanNet [9] with CAD models from ShapeNet [7]. A major contribution of this dataset is to provide ground-truth annotations of complex material parameters for the CAD objects. However, the dataset has not been released at this point and according to the authors’ account, only 2.5K CAD models were annotated with material properties.
In this paper, we introduce 3D-FRONT (3D Furnished
Rooms with layOuts and semaNTics), a new, large-scale, and comprehensive repository of synthetic 3D indoor scenes. It contains professionally and distinctively designed layouts spanning 31 scene categories (or room types), ob-ject semantics (e.g., category, style, and material labels), and a large number (18,968) of rooms populated with 3D furniture objects. Most importantly, these 3D furniture ob-jects are all endowed with high-quality textures, thanks to 3D-FUTURE [14], a recently released dataset of quality 3D furniture used in industrial productions. Furthermore, the selection of furniture objects from 3D-FUTURE to popu-late the scenes in 3D-FRONT has been inpired by expert interior designs. Speciﬁcally, the selection is based on a recommender system learned from the expert designs, while taking into account of furniture styles both in terms of ge-ometry and texture. As a result, the furnished rooms in 3D-FRONT consist of stylistically compatible objects adhering to the design inspirations.
In Table 1, we present essential information for the cur-rent public release of 3D-FRONT and compare to other prominent indoor scene datasets. As we can see, the most compelling feature of our dataset is the large number of 3D furnished rooms, which far surpasses all the other pub-licly available datasets. Style compatibility, as well as the high texture quality, of the furniture objects in each scene (see middle of Figure 1) is another unique attribute of 3D-FRONT. On top of all these, the total number of rooms with professionally designed layouts is 45,000, in which 18,968 rooms are fully populated with 3D furniture shapes. Last but not least, we share Trescope, a light-weight rendering tool, with the community so that the users of 3D-FRONT
can easily capture their desired 2D renderings and annota-tions to guide their image-driven learning tasks. We will continuously improve 3D-FRONT by providing much en-riched texture and 3D geometry contents.
We anticipate that 3D-FRONT, being as comprehensive as it is, will enable and further drive a whole suite of AI-powered and data-driven scene analysis and modeling ap-plications. We demonstrate two applications which cannot be well supported by other publicly available datasets — these applications are best served by having a large num-ber of high-quality textured mesh models with style consis-tency, a unique feature of 3D-FRONT. One such applica-tion is learning to texture 3D objects in indoor scenes. In another, by learning the layout of 3D furniture in each room with [40], we can coherently predict and arrange functional furniture for an empty room. 2.
