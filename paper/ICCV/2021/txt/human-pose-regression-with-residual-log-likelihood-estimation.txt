Abstract
Heatmap-based methods dominate in the field of hu-man pose estimation by modelling the output distribu-tion through likelihood heatmaps. In contrast, regression-based methods are more efficient but suffer from inferior performance.
In this work, we explore maximum likeli-hood estimation (MLE) to develop an efficient and effective regression-based method. From the perspective of MLE, adopting different regression losses is making different as-sumptions about the output density function. A density func-tion closer to the true distribution leads to a better regres-sion performance. In light of this, we propose a novel re-gression paradigm with Residual Log-likelihood Estima-tion (RLE) to capture the underlying output distribution.
Concretely, RLE learns the change of the distribution in-stead of the unreferenced underlying distribution to facil-itate the training process. With the proposed reparame-terization design, our method is compatible with off-the-shelf flow models. The proposed method is effective, ef-ficient and flexible. We show its potential in various hu-man pose estimation tasks with comprehensive experiments.
Compared to the conventional regression paradigm, regres-sion with RLE bring 12.4 mAP improvement on MSCOCO without any test-time overhead. Moreover, for the first time, especially on multi-person pose estimation, our re-gression method is superior to the heatmap-based methods.

Introduction
Human pose estimation has been extensively studied in the area of computer vision [21, 22, 1, 29, 19]. Re-cently, with deep convolutional neural networks, significant progress has been achieved. Existing methods can be di-vided into two categories: heatmap-based [57, 56, 62, 4, 64, 54, 46, 52] and regression-based [58, 5, 53, 70, 42, 61].

Heatmap-based methods are dominant in the field of hu-man pose estimation. These methods generate a likelihood heatmap for each joint and locate the joint as the point with the argmax [56, 64, 46] or soft-argmax [40, 31, 54] operations. Despite the excellent performance, heatmap-based methods suffer from high computation and storage demands. Expanding the heatmap to 3D or 4D (spatial + temporal) will be costly. Additionally, it is hard to deploy heatmap in modern one-stage methods.
Regression-based methods directly map the input to the output joints coordinates, which is flexible and efficient for various human pose estimation tasks and real-time appli-cations, especially on edge devices. A standard heatmap head (3 deconv layers) costs 1.4
FLOPs of the ResNet-50 backbone, while the regression head costs only 1/20000
FLOPs of the same backbone. Nevertheless, regression suf-fers from inferior performance. In challenging cases like occlusions, motion blur, and truncations, the ground-truth labels are inherently ambiguous. Heatmap-based methods are robust to these ambiguities by leveraging the likelihood heatmap. But current regression methods are vulnerable to these noisy labels.

In this work, we facilitate human pose regression by ex-ploring maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to model the output distribution. From the perspective of MLE, stan-dard Euclidean distance loss (ℓ1 or ℓ2) can be viewed as a particular assumption that the output conforms to a distribu-tion family (Laplace or Gaussian distribution) with constant variance. Intuitively, the performance can be improved if we construct the likelihood function with the true underly-ing distribution instead of the inappropriate hypothesis.
To this end, we propose a novel and effective regres-sion paradigm, named Residual Log-likelihood Estimation (RLE), that leverages normalizing flows to estimate the underlying distribution and boosts human pose regression.
Given a tractable preset assumption of the likelihood func-tion, RLE estimates the residual log-likelihood, i.e. the change of the distribution. It is easier to be optimized com-pared to the original unreferenced underlying distribution.
Besides, we design a reparameterization strategy for the flow model to learn the intrinsic characteristics of the un-derlying distribution. This strategy makes our regression framework feasible and allows us to utilize the off-the-shelf flow model to approximate the distribution without a so-phisticated network architecture.
During training, the regression model and the RLE mod-ule can be optimized simultaneously. Since the form of the underlying distribution is unknown, the RLE module is also trained via the maximum likelihood estimation process. Be-sides, the RLE module does not participate in the inference phase. In other words, the proposed method can bring sig-nificant improvement to the regression model without any test-time overhead.
The proposed regression framework is general. It can be applied to various human pose estimation algorithms (e.g. two-stage approaches [45, 14, 12, 64, 52], one-stage ap-proaches [70, 42, 61]) and various tasks (e.g. single and multi-person 2D/3D pose estimation [1, 29, 19, 34, 21, 22]).
We benchmark the proposed method on three pose estima-tion datasets, including MPII [1], MSCOCO [29] and Hu-man3.6M [19]. With a simple yet effective architecture,
RLE boosts the conventional regression method by 12.4 mAP and achieves superior performance to the heatmap-based methods. Moreover, it is more computation and stor-age efficient than heatmap-based methods. Specifically, on
MSCOCO [29], our regression-based model with ResNet-50 [15] backbone achieves 71.3 mAP with 4.0 GFLOPs, compared to 71.0 mAP with 9.7 GFLOPs of heatmap-based
SimplePose [64]. We hope our method will inspire the field to rethink the potential of regression-based methods.
The contributions of our approach can be summarized as follows:
•
We propose a novel and effective regression paradigm with the reparameterization design and Residual Log-likelihood Estimation (RLE). The proposed method boosts human pose regression without any test-time overhead. and it is more computation and storage efficient.
•
We show the potential of the proposed paradigm by applying it to various human pose estimation methods.
Considerable improvements are observed in all these methods. 2.
