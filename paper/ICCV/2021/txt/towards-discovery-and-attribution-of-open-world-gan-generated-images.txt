Abstract
With the recent progress in Generative Adversarial Net-works (GANs), it is imperative for media and visual foren-sics to develop detectors which can identify and attribute images to the model generating them. Existing works have shown to attribute images to their corresponding GAN sources with high accuracy. However, these works are lim-ited to a closed set scenario, failing to generalize to GANs unseen during train time and are therefore, not scalable with a steady influx of new GANs. We present an iterative algorithm for discovering images generated from previously unseen GANs by exploiting the fact that all GANs leave dis-tinct fingerprints on their generated images. Our algorithm consists of multiple components including network training, out-of-distribution detection, clustering, merge and refine steps. Through extensive experiments, we show that our algorithm discovers unseen GANs with high accuracy and also generalizes to GANs trained on unseen real datasets.
We additionally apply our algorithm to attribution and dis-covery of GANs in an online fashion as well as to the more standard task of real/fake detection. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to discover new GANs and can be used in an open-world setup. 1.

Introduction
With an ever increasing number of GANs introduced each year, concerns about the malicious use of this technol-ogy, especially in the case of social media content [1, 2, 3] are increasing at an alarming rate which can have ad-verse impacts on public security and privacy. Therefore, a plethora of works have been proposed which focus on the real/fake detection task [4, 5, 6]. However, it is also im-portant to focus on the problem of attribution, i.e. identify-ing the source of these images. Attributing images to their sources can potentially deter malicious organizations and hold them accountable by leading legal proceedings. Addi-tionally, as GANs are becoming part of commercial services

Figure 1. A plethora of GANs are released every year, and there could be a set of images that come from several unknown sources.
Our approach is capable of discovering and attributing unknown
GAN sources while requiring label supervision for only an initial small set of GANs. We attribute with high accuracies, seen GANs from a set of images as well as identify and cluster unknown GAN sources with high purities. such as face animation applications, their popularity draws piracy and plagiarism [7] which is an attack on intellectual property. Therefore, it is pertinent to develop effective tech-niques to attribute images to specific sources.
To address this problem, [7, 8, 9] perform attribution for multiple GAN architectures and obtain high classification accuracies. However, they are limited to the closed-world setup as they attribute only to the GANs seen during train-ing and are incapable of identifying unseen GANs. Such a setup is infeasible in practical scenarios where there are a large number of images belonging to sources not seen dur-ing training. This raises the question of whether we can discover these new sources and group together the set of im-ages which are generated by them. We term this problem as
“GAN discovery and attribution” as it involves attributing images to known sources as well as discovering unknown sources. This is a much more challenging and real world setup as the number of sources are unknown and keep in-creasing. Additionally, there can be a significant domain shift based on the dataset type of GAN generated images.
Many works such as [5, 7, 8] show that GANs leave unique artificial signatures in the images they generate. We exploit this information to implicitly identify signatures and cluster images belonging to unseen sources together while
also attributing images to seen sources. We propose a novel iterative pipeline which utilizes a fixed set of images, la-beled according to their corresponding sources, and per-form GAN attribution and discovery on an unlabeled set of images. Our approach generalizes to an open-world setup where images in the unlabeled/discovery set are not restricted to be from the labeled class sources. Addition-ally, due to the iterative nature of our pipeline, we can con-tinuously discover images from new GANs added to our discovery set in an online manner. Our approach only re-quires labels for an initial set of images from real datasets and a few GANs trained on these real datasets with each real/GAN source representing a separate class. While we can discover unseen GANs trained on these real datasets, we additionally show through experiments that we can discover new real datasets and GANs trained on these new datasets as well without them being present in the initial labeled set.
Attribution and discovery in an open-world setup re-quires us to separate images belonging to seen sources dur-ing training from the unseen sources. We therefore intro-duce an explicit out-of-distribution (OOD) step using the deep network features to separate the images belonging to the two types of sources. We propose to incorporate the
Winner Take All (WTA) hash [10] which, to the best of our knowledge, has previously never been used for OOD detec-tion. Additionally, we obtain clusters for the OOD images and perform merge and refine steps to improve the group-ing of the unknown GANs using 1-Nearest Neighbour (NN) graphs and kernel SVMs, respectively. We combine these components into a single unified pipeline which is executed iteratively for improving the features and clusters while at-tributing seen sources and discovering new GAN sources.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the ca-pability of our approach in an open-world setup. We show the efficacy of our approach to generalize to a wide range of dataset setups. We also analyze the importance of the vari-ous stages. Additionally, we provide an approach to apply our algorithm for the problem of real/fake image detection and show competitive results on a variety of dataset setups.
We summarize our contributions as follows: 1) We in-troduce a new problem for discovering and attributing im-ages from real and GAN sources in an open-world setup; 2)
We propose a novel iterative pipeline consisting of several components such as OOD detection, clustering and merge and refine stages providing a strong benchmark for this task, and; 3) We analyze the capability of our approach to dis-cover GANs on a variety of dataset setups and also present several insights into the various stages of our pipeline. 2.
