The image caption serves as a concise narrator for the story told by an image. While a scene graph aims to be a generalist, an image caption is more specialized in providing a summary. Previous studies have shown that scene graphs are not practical unless they can eliminate irrelevant details and noise. In this regard, the image caption can act as a helpful guide. To achieve this, we propose a method called Topic Scene Graph, where the scene graph borrows the abilities of the image caption to become a specialist while still maintaining its all-around nature. The image caption focuses on important aspects and transfers this knowledge to the scene graph for assessing the significance of objects, relationships, and events. During the caption generation, attention is collected and combined to obtain relationship attention, which is used as weak supervision to regulate the importance scores of relationships. Additionally, by integrating the generation of image captions and scene graphs, we can transform the scene graph into a linguistically rich and expressive form using a single model. Experimental results demonstrate that attention distillation improves the identification of important relationships without strong supervision, and the topic scene graph holds promise for future applications.
