CoMatch is a novel semi-supervised learning method that combines and addresses the limitations of existing approaches. It simultaneously learns two representations of the training data: class probabilities and low-dimensional embeddings. These representations interact with each other to evolve jointly. CoMatch improves pseudo-labels by imposing a smoothness constraint on the class probabilities using the embeddings. Additionally, it regularizes the structure of the embeddings through graph-based contrastive learning using the pseudo-labels. CoMatch achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets, including significant accuracy improvements on the label-scarce CIFAR-10 and STL-10 datasets. On ImageNet with only 1% labeled data, CoMatch outperforms FixMatch by 12.6%, achieving a top-1 accuracy of 66.0%. Moreover, CoMatch demonstrates superior representation learning performance on downstream tasks compared to both supervised learning and self-supervised learning.
