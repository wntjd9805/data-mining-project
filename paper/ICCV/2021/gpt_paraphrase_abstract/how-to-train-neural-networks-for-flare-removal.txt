Lens flare artifacts can be problematic when taking photographs with strong light sources. Flares can appear in various patterns, making their removal difficult. Current analytical solutions have limitations as they rely on assumptions about the flare's geometry or brightness, resulting in effective removal for only a small subset of flares. While machine learning techniques have been successful in removing other types of artifacts, such as reflections, flare removal has been challenging due to a lack of training data. To address this issue, we propose explicitly modeling the optical causes of flare either through empirical methods or wave optics and creating semi-synthetic pairs of images with and without flare. This allows us to train neural networks to remove lens flare effectively. Our experiments demonstrate that the synthesis of data is crucial for accurate flare removal, and the models trained using this technique generalize well to real lens flares in different scenarios.
