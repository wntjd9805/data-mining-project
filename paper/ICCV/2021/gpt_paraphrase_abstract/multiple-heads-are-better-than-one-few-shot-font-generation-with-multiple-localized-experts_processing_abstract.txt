The abstract discusses the challenges faced by existing few-shot font generation (FFG) methods in preserving the global structure of target characters while representing diverse local styles. Previous methods either fail to capture diverse local styles or cannot be applied to characters with unseen components or languages. To address these issues, the authors propose a novel FFG method called Multiple Localized Experts Few-shot Font Generation Network (MX-Font). MX-Font utilizes multiple experts to automatically extract style features representing different local concepts, such as left-side sub-glyph. Component labels are used as weak supervision to guide each expert's specialization for different local concepts. The component assignment problem is formulated as a graph matching problem and solved using the Hungarian algorithm. The authors also employ independence loss and content-style adversarial loss to disentangle content and style. Experimental results show that MX-Font outperforms previous methods in Chinese and cross-lingual generation, such as Chinese to Korean.
