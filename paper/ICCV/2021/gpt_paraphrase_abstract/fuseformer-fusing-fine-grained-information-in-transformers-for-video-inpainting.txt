We propose FuseFormer, a Transformer model designed for video inpainting that addresses the issue of blurry edges in detail. We introduce the Soft Split and Soft Composition operations, which divide the feature map into patches with overlapping intervals and stitch different patches together, respectively. These operations enable effective mapping between tokens and features and facilitate sub-patch level information interaction for improved feature propagation between neighboring patches. The soft composition and soft split are also inserted into the feed-forward network, enhancing its ability to model 2D structure. In both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, FuseFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/ruiliu-ai/FuseFormer.
