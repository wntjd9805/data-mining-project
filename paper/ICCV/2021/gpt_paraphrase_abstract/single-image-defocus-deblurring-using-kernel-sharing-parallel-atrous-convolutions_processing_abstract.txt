This paper presents a new deep learning method for addressing defocus blur in single images using inverse kernels. The authors observe that in defocused images, the blur shapes are similar across pixels, but the blur sizes can vary spatially. By leveraging the property of inverse kernels, they note that when the size of a defocus blur changes while maintaining the shape, the corresponding inverse kernel's shape remains the same, only the scale changes. Building on this observation, they propose a kernel-sharing parallel atrous convolutional (KPAC) block specifically designed for single image defocus deblurring by incorporating the properties of inverse kernels.To effectively simulate the invariant shapes of inverse kernels with different scales, KPAC shares the same convolutional weights across multiple atrous convolution layers. To efficiently simulate the varying scales of inverse kernels, KPAC includes only a few atrous convolution layers with different dilations and learns per-pixel scale attentions to aggregate the layer outputs. Additionally, KPAC utilizes shape attention to combine the outputs of multiple convolution filters within each atrous convolution layer, enabling it to handle defocus blur with slightly varying shapes.The authors demonstrate that their approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a significantly smaller number of parameters compared to previous methods.
