Recently, normalizing flows have shown promising results for tasks involving low-level vision. In the case of image super-resolution (SR), rather than learning a deterministic mapping, it has been successful in predicting diverse, photo-realistic high-resolution (HR) images from a low-resolution (LR) image. Similarly, for image rescaling, it achieves high accuracy by jointly modeling the downscaling and upscaling processes. While existing methods use specialized techniques for these tasks, we aim to unify them into a single framework.In this paper, we introduce the hierarchical conditional flow (HCFlow) as a unified approach for both image SR and image rescaling. HCFlow learns a bijective mapping between HR and LR image pairs by simultaneously modeling the distribution of the LR image and the high-frequency component. The high-frequency component is conditioned on the LR image in a hierarchical manner. To further improve performance, we combine other loss functions, such as perceptual loss and GAN loss, with the commonly used negative log-likelihood loss during training.Extensive experiments on various image SR scenarios, including general image SR, face image SR, and image rescaling, demonstrate that HCFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.
