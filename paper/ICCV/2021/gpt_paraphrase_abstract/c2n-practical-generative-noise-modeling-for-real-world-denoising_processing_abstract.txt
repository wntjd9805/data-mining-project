Learning-based image denoising methods have traditionally relied on well-aligned noisy and clean images or synthesized samples from predetermined noise models. However, recent generative noise modeling techniques attempt to simulate the unknown distribution of real-world noise. Despite these advancements, there are still limitations. In practical scenarios, a noise generator should be able to learn and simulate the general and complex noise distribution without paired examples of noisy and clean images. Existing methods, which are based on unrealistic assumptions about real-world noise, often generate implausible patterns and struggle to express complicated noise maps. To address this, we propose a Clean-to-Noisy image generation framework called C2N that can accurately imitate complex real-world noise without paired examples. C2N incorporates the different components of real-world noise characteristics to express a wide range of noise accurately. By combining C2N with conventional denoising convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we achieve significantly better performance than existing unsupervised methods on challenging real-world benchmarks.
