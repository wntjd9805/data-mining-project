We address the issue of scalable recognition in the fine-grained expert domain, where collecting large amounts of data is easy but annotating it is challenging. Existing approaches rely on semi-supervised or self-supervised learning. In contrast, we propose a novel framework called MEM-ORABLE that combines machine teaching and online crowd-sourcing platforms. Initially, a small portion of the data is labeled by experts and then used to train online annotators for the relevant classes. These annotators then label the entire dataset. Our preliminary studies indicate that the accuracy of classifiers trained on the final dataset depends on the accuracy of the student annotators. To improve this accuracy, we introduce a new machine teaching algorithm called CMaxGrad, which incorporates explanations into a state-of-the-art machine teaching approach. CMaxGrad utilizes counterfactual explanations that consider student predictions, providing feedback tailored to each student's confusion and adapting to their level of competence. Experimental results demonstrate that both MEM-ORABLE and CMaxGrad outperform existing solutions in their respective domains.
