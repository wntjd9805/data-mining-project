Trajectory prediction in complex social interactions is a difficult task. Current methods focus on pairwise interactions or local areas, but interactions can involve an uncertain number of agents and non-local areas. Additionally, these methods treat different types of agents the same, disregarding people's varied reactions towards different agent categories. To tackle these issues, we propose the Unlimited Neighborhood Interaction Network (UNIN). This network predicts trajectories for heterogeneous agents in multiple categories. The UNIN module generates fused-features of all interacting agents simultaneously, accommodating any number of agents and interaction area. A hierarchical graph attention module captures category-to-category and agent-to-agent interactions. Lastly, a Gaussian Mixture Model estimates parameters for generating future trajectories. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.
