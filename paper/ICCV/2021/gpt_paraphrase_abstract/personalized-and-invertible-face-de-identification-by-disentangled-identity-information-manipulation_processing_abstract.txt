The increased use of smartphones and surveillance cameras has led to significant privacy concerns. De-identification is considered an effective approach to protect visual privacy by concealing or replacing identity information. However, existing de-identification methods have limitations as they primarily focus on the protection process and are often irreversible. This paper presents a personalized and reversible de-identification method based on a deep generative model. The key concept is to introduce a user-specific password and an adjustable parameter that can control the extent and direction of identity variation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of our proposed framework for both face de-identification and recovery.
