We have developed a highly effective and reliable framework for aligning pairs of real-world 3D scans through point cloud registration. Our approach leverages Hough voting in the 6D transformation parameter space to achieve accurate alignment. Initially, we extract deep geometric features from the point cloud pair to establish potential correspondences. These correspondences are then used to create triplets, which cast votes in the 6D Hough space to represent the transformation parameters. To improve the accuracy of the votes, we apply a fully convolutional refinement module. Finally, we determine the consensus among the correspondences in the Hough space to predict the final transformation parameters. Our method surpasses existing techniques on the 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch benchmarks, while achieving comparable performance on the KITTI odometry dataset. We also demonstrate the versatility of our approach by achieving a new state-of-the-art result on the ICL-NUIM dataset, integrating our module into a multi-way registration pipeline.
