We present a new approach to address the limitations of self-supervised monocular depth estimation. While this method has been effective in the absence of ground truth labels, it often produces overly smooth results and struggles with occlusion. To improve performance, we utilize pseudo ground truth depth maps generated from self-supervised stereo matching methods. We estimate the confidence map of these pseudo depth maps to mitigate inaccuracies. Additionally, we introduce a threshold network that dynamically learns the threshold based on the pseudo depth maps, addressing prediction errors in the confidence map itself. The filtered pseudo depth labels, determined by the thresholded confidence map, are used to supervise the monocular depth network. Furthermore, we propose a probabilistic framework that refines the monocular depth map using its uncertainty map through the pixel-adaptive convolution (PAC) layer. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing monocular depth estimation methods. We also demonstrate that the proposed threshold learning can enhance the performance of confidence estimation approaches.
