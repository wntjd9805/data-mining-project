Multi-view projection methods have been successful in achieving high performance in 3D shape recognition. However, these methods typically use fixed camera viewpoints for all shapes, limiting their adaptability. To address this issue, we propose the Multi-View Transformation Network (MVTN), which learns optimal viewpoints for 3D shape recognition using differentiable rendering techniques. MVTN can be trained alongside any multi-view network for 3D shape classification, and can render both 3D meshes and point clouds. Our experimental results demonstrate that MVTN significantly improves performance in 3D shape classification and retrieval tasks on various datasets, including ModelNet40, ShapeNet Core55, and ScanObjectNN. Notably, MVTN also enhances network robustness against rotation and occlusion in the 3D domain. The code for MVTN is publicly available at https://github.com/ajhamdi/MVTN.
