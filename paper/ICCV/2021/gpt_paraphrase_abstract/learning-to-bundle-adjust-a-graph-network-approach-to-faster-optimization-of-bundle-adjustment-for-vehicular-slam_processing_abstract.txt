This study introduces a novel approach to bundle adjustment (BA) in the context of structure from motion (SfM) and visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). BA, which is a critical component in visual SLAM, often consumes a significant portion of the execution time. To address this issue, the study proposes a learning-based bundle adjuster that utilizes a graph network. This graph network operates on a graph formed by keyframes, landmarks, and their visibility relationships. Instead of relying on traditional optimization-based BA methods, the proposed approach predicts the optimal updates to the initial parameter values using the graph network. Inspired by the normal equation of the Levenberg-Marquardt method, the graph network employs an intermediate representation of inputs. The network is trained using a loss function based on the sum of reprojection errors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves parameter estimates with slightly lower accuracy compared to conventional BA methods, but in significantly reduced computation time (1/60 - 1/10). This makes it particularly suitable for robust tracking in embedded systems with limited computational resources.
