3D pose estimation has gained attention due to the availability of high-quality benchmark datasets. However, previous studies have shown that deep learning models tend to learn irrelevant correlations that do not generalize beyond the specific dataset they are trained on. To address this issue, this research aims to develop robust models for cross-domain pose estimation by combining ideas from causal representation learning and generative adversarial networks.  The proposed framework introduces a novel approach to causal representation learning that explicitly leverages the causal structure of the pose estimation task. By considering domain changes as interventions on images during the data-generation process, the generative model is guided to produce counterfactual features. This approach enables the model to learn transferable and causal relationships across different domains. Importantly, our framework can effectively learn from various types of unlabeled datasets.  To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both human and hand pose estimation tasks. The results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on most datasets for both domain adaptation and domain generalization settings. This indicates that our framework is capable of learning robust models that can generalize well across different domains.  In summary, this work proposes a novel framework for training robust models for cross-domain pose estimation. By explicitly considering the causal structure of the task and leveraging generative adversarial networks, our approach achieves impressive performance on various datasets. This research contributes to the advancement of 3D pose estimation and paves the way for further improvements in this field.
