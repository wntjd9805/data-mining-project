Coarse-to-fine strategies have been widely used in the design of single image deblurring networks. However, these methods often involve stacking sub-networks with multi-scale input images, which leads to high computational costs. In order to address this issue and create a fast and accurate deblurring network, we introduce the Multi-Input Multi-Output U-net (MIMO-UNet). The MIMO-UNet has three main features. Firstly, it uses a single encoder that takes in multi-scale input images to simplify training. Secondly, the single decoder of the MIMO-UNet generates multiple deblurred images with different scales, mimicking the use of multiple U-nets within a single network. Lastly, we incorporate asymmetric feature fusion to efficiently merge multi-scale features. Extensive experiments conducted on the GoPro and Real-Blur datasets demonstrate that our proposed network outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and computational complexity.
