The current methods for video question-answering have limitations in relational reasoning, as they either focus on object-level or frame-level reasoning and do not integrate the two. Additionally, they do not utilize semantic knowledge for relational reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose the Hierarchical VisuAl-Semantic RelatIonal Reasoning (HAIR) framework. This framework incorporates a graph memory mechanism for relational reasoning, consisting of visual and semantic graph memory. The visual graph memory utilizes visual information from the video, while the semantic graph memory leverages semantic knowledge from the classes and attributes of video objects. By combining these graph memory mechanisms, we create a hierarchical framework that enables visual-semantic relational reasoning from the object level to the frame level. Experimental results on challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and faster inference speed. Furthermore, our approach also outperforms other methods in video+language tasks.
