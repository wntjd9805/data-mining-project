Point cloud completion is a challenging task in 3D vision that aims to recover complete shapes from sparse and incomplete point clouds. Existing learning-based methods require significant computational resources to achieve excellent performance, limiting their practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel Recurrent Forward Network (RFNet) consisting of three modules: Recurrent Feature Extraction (RFE), Forward Dense Completion (FDC), and Raw Shape Protection (RSP). The RFE extracts multiple global features from the incomplete point clouds at different recurrent levels. The FDC generates point clouds in a coarse-to-fine pipeline, while the RSP incorporates details from the original incomplete models to refine the completion results. Additionally, we introduce a Sampling Chamfer Distance to better capture the shapes of models and a Balanced Expansion Constraint to restrict the expansion distances from coarse to fine. Experimental results on ShapeNet and KITTI datasets demonstrate that our network achieves state-of-the-art performance with lower memory cost and faster convergence.
