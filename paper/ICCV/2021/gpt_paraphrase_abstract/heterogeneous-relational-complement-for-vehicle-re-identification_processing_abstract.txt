This paper addresses the challenge of vehicle re-identification, which involves identifying the same vehicle from different camera viewpoints. To tackle this problem, the authors propose two approaches: constructing robust feature representations and introducing camera-sensitive evaluations. The first approach involves the development of a Heterogeneous Relational Complement Network (HRCN). This network incorporates region-specific features and cross-level features to complement the original high-level output. To address distributional differences and semantic misalignment, the authors propose graph-based relation modules that embed these diverse features into a unified high-dimensional space.The second approach focuses on improving the evaluations of cross-camera re-identification. The authors identify deficiencies in existing evaluation measures, such as the Cumulative Matching Characteristic (CMC) and Average Precision (AP), and propose a new measure called the Cross-camera Generalization Measure (CGM). This measure introduces position-sensitivity and penalties for cross-camera generalization to enhance the evaluations.To validate their proposed methods, the authors conduct experiments on benchmark datasets, including VeRi-776, VehicleID, and VERI-Wild. The results show that their HRCN model achieves state-of-the-art performance on these datasets when evaluated using the proposed CGM measure.
