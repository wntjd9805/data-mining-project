This paper presents a new framework for unsupervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation. The goal is to assign pixel-level labels to unlabeled data in the target domain by transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain. Existing self-supervised learning approaches generate pseudo labels from the source model but suffer from noisy labels due to domain shift. Some methods select high-confidence predictions to alleviate this issue, but they often overlook uncertain classes with low confidence scores. This uncertainty can actually enhance feature representation and align the source and target domains.To address these challenges, the authors propose an uncertainty-aware pseudo label refinement framework that considers two important factors simultaneously. First, they progressively enhance the feature alignment model using a target-guided uncertainty rectifying framework. This helps improve the alignment between the source and target domains. Second, they introduce an uncertainty-aware pseudo label assignment strategy that does not rely on manually designed thresholds. This strategy helps reduce the noise in the pseudo labels.Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach, and the results show its effectiveness. The approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two standard synthetic-2-real tasks.
