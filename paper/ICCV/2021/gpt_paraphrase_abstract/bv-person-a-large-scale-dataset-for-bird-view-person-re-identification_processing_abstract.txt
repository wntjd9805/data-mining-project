This study introduces a new task called bird-view person ReID, which involves re-identifying persons in a gallery of horizontal-view images using query images taken from a bird's-eye view. This task is important because many video surveillance cameras capture persons from an elevated view in public places. However, it is challenging due to limited person appearance information in bird-view images and the significant discrepancy compared to horizontal-view images. To address this, the study introduces a large-scale dataset called BV-Person, consisting of 114k images of 18k identities, with nearly 20k images of 7.4k identities taken from the bird's-eye view. A novel model is also proposed for this task, and extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate its performance, along with 11 other state-of-the-art ReID models, using BV-Person and other datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms existing models on all datasets derived from BV-Person and achieves state-of-the-art performance on general ReID datasets as well. The BV-Person dataset is publicly available at https://git.io/BVPerson.
