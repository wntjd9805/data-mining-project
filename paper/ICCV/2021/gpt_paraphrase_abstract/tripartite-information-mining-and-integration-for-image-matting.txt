The development of deep convolutional neural networks has brought about a new phase in image matting. Previous research in image matting has mainly focused on solutions for transition regions. However, we argue that many existing approaches have placed excessive emphasis on transition-dominant local fields and neglected the inherent coordination between global information and transitions. In this paper, we propose the Tripartite Information Mining and Integration Network (TIMI-Net) to formally harmonize the coordination between global and local attributes. Our approach utilizes a novel 3-branch encoder to comprehensively mine the input information, addressing the neglected coordination between global and local fields. To effectively integrate the information from the multi-branch encoder, we introduce the Tripartite Information Integration (TI2) Module to transform and integrate the interconnections between the different branches. Additionally, we have created a large-scale human matting dataset called Human-2K, consisting of 2100 high-precision human images. This dataset aims to advance human image matting and includes 2000 images for training and 100 images for testing. We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our proposed TIMI-Net, comparing it to state-of-the-art methods on alphamatting.com, Composition-1K, Distinctions-646, and our Human-2K dataset. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms other approaches. Furthermore, we have developed an online evaluation website for natural image matting.
