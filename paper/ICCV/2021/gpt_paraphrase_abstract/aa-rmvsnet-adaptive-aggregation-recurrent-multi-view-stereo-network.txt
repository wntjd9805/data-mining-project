This paper introduces AA-RMVSNet, a novel recurrent multi-view stereo network that utilizes long short-term memory (LSTM) with adaptive aggregation. Two adaptive aggregation modules are proposed to improve the accuracy and completeness of 3D reconstruction. The intra-view aggregation module efficiently extracts image features using context-aware convolution and multi-scale aggregation, enhancing performance on challenging regions. The inter-view cost volume aggregation module adapts pixel-wise view aggregation to overcome varying occlusion in complex scenes. These modules are lightweight, effective, and complementary. Instead of conventional 3D CNNs, a hybrid network with a recurrent structure is used for cost volume regularization, enabling high-resolution reconstruction and finer hypothetical plane sweep. The network is trained end-to-end and achieves excellent performance on various datasets, ranking 1st on Tanks datasets and Temples benchmark, and achieving competitive results on DTU dataset. The implementation of this method is available at the provided GitHub link.
