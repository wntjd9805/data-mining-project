This study explores the use of deep neural networks to represent 3D shapes as implicit functions, which has proven to be more effective than explicit representations using meshes and point clouds. While previous approaches have focused on closed shapes, recent proposals have introduced unsigned distance function (UDF) based methods that can represent both open and closed shapes. However, UDFs present challenges in estimating local geometric properties due to the vanishing gradients on the surface, which are crucial for various applications in vision and graphics. Additionally, there are difficulties in efficiently computing these properties with limited memory usage. In this paper, a novel approach called the closest surface-point (CSP) representation is introduced to overcome these challenges. The CSP representation enables the accurate modeling of complex surfaces with any topology, efficient computation of local geometric properties, and implementation of downstream algorithms like sphere-tracing for rendering the 3D surface and creating explicit mesh-based representations. Extensive experiments conducted on the ShapeNet dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, surpassing the current state-of-the-art results.
