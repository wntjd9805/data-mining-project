A spike camera, which continuously outputs binary spike streams to capture high-speed dynamic scenes, has shown potential for recording such scenes with high temporal resolution. However, the spatial resolution of spike cameras is limited, resulting in inferior details in the reconstructed images. To address this issue, we propose a spike camera super-resolution framework that aims to generate high-resolution intensity images from the low-resolution binary spike streams. By considering the relative motion between the camera and the captured objects, we exploit the relationship between light intensity and each spike to recover the external scene with both high temporal and spatial resolution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully reconstructs high-resolution images from low-resolution spike streams.
