The importance of considering the relationship between visual elements in cropping view recommendation is demonstrated in this study. Cropping view recommendation involves reconfiguring images based on composition quality and view rankings. This task is difficult because it is hard to detect subtle visual differences when elements are added or removed. Current methods extract convolutional features from regions both inside and outside the cropping view boundaries without addressing why certain visual elements are significant or irrelevant. The authors propose a transformer-based approach that represents visual elements as visual words and models the dependencies between them. Their solution achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets and provides visualizations that illustrate the attraction and repulsion between visual elements. These findings offer insights into effective cropping view recommendation.
