This paper presents a new method called PoinTr for completing incomplete point clouds captured in real-world applications. The limited sensor resolution, single viewpoint, and occlusion often result in incomplete point clouds. The proposed method reformulates point cloud completion as a set-to-set translation problem and utilizes a transformer encoder-decoder architecture. By representing the point cloud as a set of unordered groups of points with position embeddings, the point cloud is converted into a sequence of point proxies, and transformers are employed for point cloud generation. To enhance the utilization of 3D geometric structures, a geometry-aware block is devised to model local geometric relationships explicitly. This allows the model to better learn structural knowledge and preserve detailed information during point cloud completion. Additionally, the paper introduces two new benchmarks with more diverse incomplete point clouds to better reflect real-world scenarios and promote future research. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin on both the new benchmarks and existing ones.
