Long-term person re-identification (LT-reID) presents significant challenges due to long time gaps between recording footages, during which a person is likely to change clothing. There are two approaches to LT-reID: biometrics-based and data adaptation-based. The biometrics-based approach focuses on identifying clothing-irrelevant biometric features, but the main concern is obtaining high-quality biometric data. The data adaptation-based approach uses fine-tuning strategies with data that exhibit significant clothing changes but performs poorly in cases without clothing change. This study argues that these approaches do not consider the clothing status (whether it changes or not) of a pedestrian and instead assume that all footages of a pedestrian have different clothes. To address this issue, a Regularization via Clothing Status Awareness Network (RCSANet) is proposed to embed clothing status awareness into pedestrian descriptions. This improves the description's robustness to LT-reID scenarios where both clothing-change and no-clothing-change cases occur, while maintaining the best ID discriminative feature. Experimental results demonstrate that RCSANet performs well on three LT-reID datasets.
