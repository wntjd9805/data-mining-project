We present a method to extract detailed information from shadows cast by objects and use it to generate a hemispherical photograph from the object's viewpoint. This essentially turns objects into cameras. This technique is valuable for various image editing tasks like relighting, object insertion or removal, and material estimation. Previous approaches for illumination recovery have focused on low-frequency lighting, relied on specular surfaces, or employed data-driven methods that are prone to generating unrealistic results. To address these limitations, we propose an optimization scheme to update scene parameters, making it possible to capture real-world scenes. Additionally, we introduce a methodology to evaluate the performance of recovery for different object types and shapes.
