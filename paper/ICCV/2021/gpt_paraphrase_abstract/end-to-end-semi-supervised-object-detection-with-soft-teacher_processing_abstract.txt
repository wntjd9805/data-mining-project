This paper introduces a novel approach for semi-supervised object detection that differs from previous complex multi-stage methods. The proposed method utilizes end-to-end training to gradually enhance the quality of pseudo labels, which in turn improves object detection training. Two simple yet effective techniques are also introduced: a soft teacher mechanism that weights the classification loss of each unlabeled bounding box based on the classification score produced by the teacher network, and a box jittering approach to select reliable pseudo boxes for box regression learning. The approach outperforms previous methods on the COCO benchmark across various labeling ratios, such as 1%, 5%, and 10%. It also performs well with a relatively large amount of labeled data, improving the baseline detector's mean average precision (mAP) by +3.6 mAP. Additionally, when combined with the state-of-the-art Swin Transformer based object detector, it increases detection accuracy by +1.5 mAP and instance segmentation accuracy by +1.2 mAP. By incorporating the Object365 pre-trained model, the detection accuracy reaches 61.3 mAP and the instance segmentation accuracy reaches 53.0 mAP, setting a new state-of-the-art. The code and models for this approach will be publicly available at https://github.com/ microsoft/SoftTeacher.
