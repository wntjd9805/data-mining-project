This paper presents BlockCopy, a method that enhances the efficiency of pretrained frame-based convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for video processing compared to traditional frame-by-frame processing. BlockCopy employs a lightweight policy network to identify important regions in an image and applies custom block-sparse convolutions only on these selected regions. Instead of computing features for non-selected regions, BlockCopy simply copies the features from the previous frame, reducing computation and latency. The execution policy of BlockCopy is trained using reinforcement learning in an online manner without the need for ground truth annotations. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated on various dense prediction tasks such as pedestrian detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation using both state-of-the-art and standard baseline networks. BlockCopy achieves significant savings in floating-point operations (FLOPS) and inference speedup while maintaining accuracy.
