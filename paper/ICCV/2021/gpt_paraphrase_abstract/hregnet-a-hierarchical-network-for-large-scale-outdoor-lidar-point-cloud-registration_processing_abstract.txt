This paper introduces HRegNet, an efficient hierarchical network designed for large-scale outdoor LiDAR point cloud registration. Traditional registration methods struggle with the complexity and size of outdoor LiDAR point clouds. To address this challenge, HRegNet focuses on hierarchical extraction of keypoints and descriptors for registration instead of using all points. By combining reliable features from deeper layers and precise position information from shallower layers, HRegNet achieves robust and accurate registration. The network incorporates a correspondence network that generates correct and accurate keypoints correspondences. It also introduces bilateral consensus and neighborhood consensus for keypoints matching, improving the registration performance. The network is highly efficient as it only uses a small number of keypoints for registration. The proposed HRegNet is evaluated on two large-scale outdoor LiDAR point cloud datasets, demonstrating its high accuracy and efficiency.
