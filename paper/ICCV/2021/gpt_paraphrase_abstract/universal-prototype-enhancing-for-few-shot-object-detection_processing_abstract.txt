This study focuses on few-shot object detection (FSOD), which aims to improve the performance of detecting novel objects with limited labeled samples. To overcome the challenge of few samples, the study emphasizes the importance of enhancing the generalization ability of learned features for novel objects. The researchers propose a new approach called Universal Prototype (UP), which learns intrinsic characteristics shared across different object categories. The UPs have the advantage of representing invariant characteristics and also address the issue of unbalanced object categories. The study enhances object features using UPs and introduces a consistency loss to ensure agreement between the enhanced features and the original ones, facilitating the learning of invariant object characteristics. This leads to the development of a new FSOD framework called FSODup, which demonstrates improved feature generalization for novel objects. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets validate the effectiveness of FSODup, with a 6.8% increase in mean Average Precision (mAP) compared to the baseline method in the 1-shot case of VOC Split2.
