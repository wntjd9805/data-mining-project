The community has shown great interest in few-shot object detection, which involves rapidly detecting new objects with very few examples of previously unseen classes. However, current approaches using the Faster R-CNN framework do not perform well in data-scarce scenarios. Therefore, this paper examines the Faster R-CNN framework and identifies its contradictions from two perspectives: multi-stage (RPN vs. RCNN) and multi-task (classification vs. localization). To address these issues, the paper proposes a new architecture called Decoupled Faster R-CNN (DeFRCN). DeFRCN extends Faster R-CNN by introducing a Gradient Decoupled Layer for multi-stage decoupling and a Prototypical Calibration Block for multi-task decoupling. The Gradient Decoupled Layer redefines the feature-forward and gradient-backward operations to decouple subsequent and preceding layers, while the Prototypical Calibration Block is an offline prototype-based classification model that uses detector proposals as input and enhances the original classification scores with additional pairwise scores for calibration. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing approaches and sets a new state-of-the-art in few-shot object detection.
