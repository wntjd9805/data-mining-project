Adaptive person re-identification (ReID) aims to transfer learned knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Pseudo-label-based methods have been effective in this area by generating pseudo labels and optimizing the training model. However, these pseudo labels are often inaccurate and do not reflect the true meaning of the unlabeled samples. This inaccuracy is a result of delayed updates of the pseudo labels and the simplistic criteria used by the clustering method. To address this problem, we propose an online pseudo label generation approach using hierarchical cluster dynamics for adaptive ReID. We construct hierarchical label banks for all samples in the dataset and update the pseudo labels of each sample in every mini-batch, simultaneously performing model optimization and label generation. Our method introduces a new hierarchical cluster dynamics for label updates, where cluster merging and splitting are driven by a possibility computed through label propagation. This approach improves the quality of pseudo labels and enhances re-identification accuracy. We extensively evaluate our proposed method on various domain transfer scenarios, including Market-to-Duke, Duke-to-Market, MSMT-to-Market, MSMT-to-Duke, Market-to-MSMT, and Duke-to-MSMT, and demonstrate its effectiveness.
