Unconditional image synthesis has made significant advancements with the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Inverting an image into its corresponding latent code is crucial for manipulating real images based on the learned semantics of the network. To address the limitations of current inversion methods, this study introduces a novel scheme called ReStyle. Unlike existing encoder-based methods that directly predict the latent code, ReStyle incorporates an iterative refinement mechanism. The encoder predicts a residual with respect to the current estimate of the inverted latent code, resulting in improved accuracy without a significant increase in inference time. The behavior of ReStyle is analyzed to gain insights into its iterative nature. The performance and robustness of ReStyle are evaluated against optimization-based inversion and state-of-the-art encoders. The code for ReStyle is available on the project page: https://yuval-alaluf.github.io/restyle-encoder/.
