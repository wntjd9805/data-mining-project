There is a growing recognition that the vulnerability of Image Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to image corruptions, perturbations, and adversarial attacks is linked to Texture Bias. This lack of emphasis on Shape Bias also contributes to poor performance in Domain Generalization (DG). To address these vulnerabilities, some methods have incorporated shape information by training on negative images, images with edge maps, or images with conflicting shape and texture data. This paper proposes an explicit and comprehensive representation of shape using a traditional computer vision technique called the shock graph of an image's contour map. The resulting graph and its descriptor provide a thorough representation of contour content, which is then classified using modern Graph Neural Network (GNN) methods. Experimental results on three datasets with domain shifts, namely Colored MNIST, PACS, and VLCS, demonstrate that the shape-based approach surpasses classical Image CNN-based methods in domain generalization, even without utilizing appearance information.
