Current methods for 3D object detection require extensive annotation, which limits their practicality in real-world industrial applications. To address this, we propose a self-supervised learning framework specifically designed for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. While self-supervised pipelines have been successful in the 2D domain, challenges unique to the 3D domain, such as complex geometry and multiple object views, make it difficult to directly apply existing techniques. Our novel framework, called GCC-3D, combines geometric-aware contrast and clustering harmonization to enhance unsupervised 3D representation learning. GCC-3D utilizes a Geometric-Aware Contrastive objective to learn spatial-sensitive local structure representation, ensuring that spatially close voxels have high feature similarity. Additionally, we introduce a Pseudo-Instance Clustering harmonization mechanism, which enforces consistent similarities between different views of pseudo-instances and clustering prototype centers, thereby enhancing semantic discriminative capacity. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that GCC-3D significantly improves performance in data-efficient 3D object detection. Furthermore, our GCC-3D framework achieves state-of-the-art results on popular 3D object detection benchmarks.
