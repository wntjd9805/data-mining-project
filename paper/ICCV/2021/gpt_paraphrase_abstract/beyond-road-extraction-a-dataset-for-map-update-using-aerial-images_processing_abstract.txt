The growing availability of satellite and aerial imagery has sparked significant interest in automatically updating street maps through the processing of aerial images. Previously, the focus has primarily been on road extraction, where road networks are inferred from scratch based on aerial images. However, since high-quality maps already exist in most areas of the world, it is more practical to update existing maps rather than creating new ones. With recent advancements in road extraction methods, we propose transitioning to the task of updating existing maps by adding, removing, and shifting roads, while ensuring that the already accurate parts of the map remain up-to-date. In this study, we introduce a new dataset called MUNO21 specifically designed for the map update task, which presents various novel research challenges. We evaluate several state-of-the-art road extraction methods using the MUNO21 dataset and find that significant improvements in accuracy are necessary for achieving automatic map update.
