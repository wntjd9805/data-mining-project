This paper introduces a new approach for representing and classifying two-person interactions using 3D skeleton sequences. The main idea is to utilize Gaussian distributions to capture statistics on both Rn and symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices. The challenge lies in parameterizing these distributions. To address this, the authors develop techniques for embedding Gaussian distributions in matrix groups, drawing on the theory of Lie groups and Riemannian symmetric spaces. This approach takes advantage of the Riemannian geometry of the underlying manifolds and effectively encodes high-order statistics from 3D joint positions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance in two-person interaction recognition across three benchmarks for 3D human activity understanding.
