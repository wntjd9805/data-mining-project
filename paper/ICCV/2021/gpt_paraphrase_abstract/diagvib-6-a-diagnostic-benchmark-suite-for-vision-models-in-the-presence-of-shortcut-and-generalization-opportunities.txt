Deep neural networks (DNNs) used for image classification have been found to rely on shortcut opportunities (SO) that involve easily predictable visual factors. This phenomenon, known as shortcut learning, hampers the generalization capability of these networks. However, our research reveals that shortcut learning occurs not only when predicting complex visual factors, but also when predicting basic factors such as shape, color, and texture. We argue that in addition to shortcut opportunities, there are also generalization opportunities (GO) inherent in real-world visual data due to partial independence between predicted classes and factors of variation (FoVs). We propose that DNNs need to exploit these GO in order to overcome shortcut learning.To address this issue, we introduce the Diagnostic Vision Benchmark suite DiagViB-6, which comprises datasets and metrics designed to assess a network's vulnerability to shortcut learning and its generalization capability across six independent FoVs. DiagViB-6 allows for controlling the type and extent of SO and GO within a dataset. We evaluate a wide range of popular vision architectures using DiagViB-6 and demonstrate that these architectures can only partially exploit GO.As an example, Figure 1 illustrates a case study from our benchmark. The network is trained to predict three shape classes (2, 4, 3) based on varying hues. During training, all five combinations of shape and hue are uniformly presented. Shape 2 is exclusively associated with the blue hue, creating a shortcut opportunity. On the other hand, shapes 4 and 3 occur equally with red and green hues, respectively, presenting a generalization opportunity as they reduce the predictability of the hue factor for the shape factor. We evaluate the model's shortcut vulnerability by measuring its test accuracy on out-of-distribution factor combinations.In summary, our research highlights the presence of both shortcut and generalization opportunities in real-world vision data. We emphasize the importance of exploiting generalization opportunities to mitigate shortcut learning in DNNs. The introduction of DiagViB-6 provides a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the shortcut vulnerability and generalization capability of vision architectures.
