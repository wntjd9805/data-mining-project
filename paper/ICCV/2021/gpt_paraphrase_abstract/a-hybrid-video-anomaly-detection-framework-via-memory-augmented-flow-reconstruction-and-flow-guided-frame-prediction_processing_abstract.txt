This paper introduces HF2-VAD, a Hybrid framework that combines Flow reconstruction and Frame prediction for Video Anomaly Detection. The framework utilizes ML-MemAE-SC, a network with memory modules, to memorize normal patterns and identify abnormal events with larger flow reconstruction errors. Additionally, a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) is employed to predict the next frame based on reconstructed flows, taking into account the high correlation between video frames and optical flow. The quality of flow reconstruction affects the accuracy of frame prediction, and poorly reconstructed flows of abnormal events further degrade the quality of the predicted future frame. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code for the framework is available at https://github.com/LiUzHiAn/hf2vad.
