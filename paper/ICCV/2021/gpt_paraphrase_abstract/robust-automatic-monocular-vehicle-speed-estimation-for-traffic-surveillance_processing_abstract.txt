The potential of CCTV cameras as cheap automated sensors for traffic speed analysis has not been fully realized due to the difficulty of camera calibration. Existing methods using image processing or keypoint detection techniques are ineffective in low-resolution and noisy CCTV footage. In contrast, we propose two new calibration techniques that utilize an off-the-shelf object detector. These techniques leverage the known 3D shapes and normalized dimensions of cars, considering multiple detections jointly. The first technique minimizes a 3D reprojection error, while the second one learns from synthetic training data to predict scene geometry. To address the lack of speed estimation benchmarks reflecting the quality of surveillance cameras, we introduce a new dataset collected from public CCTV streams. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate high accuracy in speed estimation, even in challenging conditions where current methods fail.
