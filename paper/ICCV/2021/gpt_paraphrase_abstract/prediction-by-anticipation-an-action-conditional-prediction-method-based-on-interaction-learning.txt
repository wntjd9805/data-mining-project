Accurate prediction of changes in the environment is crucial for enhancing safety and comfort in autonomous driving (AD). However, due to the intricate interactions among trafÔ¨Åc participants, achieving precise long-term predictions is extremely challenging. To overcome this obstacle, we propose a novel approach called prediction by anticipation. This approach considers interactions as a latent probabilistic generative process, where some vehicles respond to the expected motion of other vehicles. By adopting this perspective, we can decompose consecutive data frames into sequential samples from an action-conditional distribution, which enables effective generalization to various actions and driving scenarios. Our prediction model, which follows a variational Bayesian framework, is trained to optimize the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the log-likelihood of this conditional distribution. Through evaluations using prominent AD datasets such as NGSIM I-80 and Argoverse, we demonstrate significant advancements in both accuracy and generalization compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.
