We introduce a fresh approach to 3D human pose and shape estimation by proposing a unique sparse constrained formulation. From this formulation, we develop a real-time optimization method called SCOPE (Sparse Constrained Optimization for 3D human Pose and shapE estimation). Compared to existing optimization methods, SCOPE is significantly faster, with an average convergence time of 4ms. Importantly, our method is mathematically equivalent to the dense unconstrained formulation used in previous approaches, making it a viable alternative. The key to our efficiency lies in leveraging the sparsity and constraints inherent in our formulation to compute the Gauss-Newton direction more efficiently. Unlike prior work, which scales cubically due to their dense unconstrained formulation, our computation scales linearly with the number of joints and measurements in a complex 3D human model. Building upon our optimization method, we present a real-time motion capture framework capable of estimating 3D human poses and shapes from a single image at a frame rate of over 30 FPS. In benchmark tests against state-of-the-art methods using multiple public datasets, our framework surpasses other optimization methods and achieves competitive accuracy compared to regression methods.
