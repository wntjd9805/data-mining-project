Automatic polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images is a crucial component of computer-aided diagnosis for colorectal cancer. Most existing methods rely on fully supervised deep learning, which requires time-consuming and expensive annotation by physicians. In this study, we introduce a novel semi-supervised approach for polyp segmentation using collaborative and adversarial learning. Our model incorporates focused and dispersive extraction modules to handle the diverse location and shape of polyps. Additionally, we utilize confidence maps generated by a discriminator in an adversarial training framework to effectively leverage unlabeled data and enhance segmentation performance. To further improve the representation of the extraction modules' outputs, we apply consistent regularization to optimize the segmentation networks. We also propose an auxiliary adversarial learning technique to better utilize unlabeled examples and enhance semantic segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on two well-known polyp datasets, Kvasir-SEG and CVC-Clinic DB, demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art semi-supervised and fully supervised segmentation models.
