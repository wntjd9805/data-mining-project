The use of Class Activation Map (CAM) in Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) has significantly improved by generating pseudo labels. However, CAM only identifies seeds from a limited number of regions, which may not be sufficient for semantic segmentation. In this study, we propose a new approach called Complementary Patch (CP) Representation, which considers the expansion of object regions in CAM as an increase in information. We demonstrate that the information obtained from the sum of CAMs generated by a pair of input images with complementary hidden parts is greater than or equal to the baseline CAM. By narrowing the gap between the sum of CAMs from the CP Pair and the original CAM, we can obtain a CAM with more information related to object seeds. To implement this, we introduce the CP Network (CPN) consisting of a triplet network and three regularization functions. Additionally, we propose the Pixel-Region Correlation Module (PRCM) to enhance contextual information by leveraging object-region relations between feature maps and CAMs. Experimental results on the PAS-CAL VOC 2012 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in WSSS, validating the effectiveness of our CP Representation and CPN.
