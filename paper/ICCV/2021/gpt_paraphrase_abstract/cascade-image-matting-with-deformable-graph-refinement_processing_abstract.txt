We propose a Cascade Image Matting Network with Deformable Graph Refinement (CasDGR) for accurate alpha matte estimation from single human images. Our network uses a cascade architecture for coarse-to-fine optimization and incorporates a Deformable Graph Refinement (DGR) module based on graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture long-range relations and enhance alpha matte quality. By dynamically predicting neighbors and applying DGR module to higher-resolution features, we reduce computation complexity. Experimental results show that CasDGR achieves state-of-the-art performance on synthetic datasets and produces good results on real human images.
