This study focuses on supervised video summarization and addresses the challenge of designing a unique model due to the subjective nature of summarization based on user preferences. To overcome this limitation, the authors propose a personalized video summarization model that incorporates predefined user preferences as categorical labels. The model, called Multi-ranker, utilizes multiple pairwise rankers trained together to generate both local and global summaries of a video. To showcase the effectiveness and practicality of their approach compared to traditional global summarizers, the researchers conduct experiments using various benchmark datasets. These experiments include a user study and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods in global video summarization.
