Deep learning has proven to be highly effective in achieving superior performance on visual benchmark datasets, thanks to advancements in computational power and data collection techniques. By directly learning discriminative patterns from raw materials in a task-specific manner, deep learning surpasses hand-crafted features. However, in real-world applications like visual search in online shopping, collecting task-specific labels can be prohibitively expensive. Coarse-class labels, on the other hand, are more affordable but may result in suboptimal representations for the target task. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm that learns fine-grained patterns for the target task using only coarse-class labels. Importantly, we provide a theoretical guarantee for this approach. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of learned representations on the target task, even when only coarse-class information is available for training.
