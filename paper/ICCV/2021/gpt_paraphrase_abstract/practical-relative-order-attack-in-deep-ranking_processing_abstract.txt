New research has shown that deep ranking models are susceptible to small changes that can significantly alter the ranking results. Previous studies have focused on manipulating the absolute ranks of certain candidates, but little attention has been given to adjusting their relative order. This paper introduces a new type of attack called the Order Attack, which secretly changes the relative order of a selected group of candidates based on a specified permutation, while minimizing interference with unrelated candidates. The attack is formulated as a triplet-style loss function that enforces an inequality chain representing the desired permutation. However, directly optimizing this objective in a real-world attack scenario is challenging due to black-box limitations. To address this, a Short-range Ranking Correlation metric is proposed as a surrogate objective for the black-box Order Attack, approximating the white-box method. The effectiveness of the Order Attack is evaluated on the Fashion-MNIST and Stanford-Online-Products datasets, under both white-box and black-box threat models. Additionally, the black-box attack is successfully implemented on a major e-commerce platform. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods, uncovering a previously unknown vulnerability in ranking models.
