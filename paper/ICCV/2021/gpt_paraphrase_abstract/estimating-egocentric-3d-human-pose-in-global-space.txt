Recently, there has been a rise in the popularity of egocentric 3D human pose estimation using a single fisheye camera. This method allows for the capture of a wide range of daily activities in unconstrained environments, which is challenging for traditional outside-in motion capture using external cameras. However, current approaches have various limitations. One major issue is that the estimated poses are confined to the local coordinate system of the fisheye camera, limiting their applicability. Additionally, these methods suffer from accuracy and temporal instability due to uncertainties arising from the monocular setup and the significant occlusion in the distorted egocentric perspective. To address these limitations, we propose a novel technique for egocentric global 3D body pose estimation utilizing a single head-mounted fisheye camera. Our method achieves accurate and temporally stable global poses by performing spatio-temporal optimization across a sequence of frames. This optimization minimizes the errors in heatmap reprojection and incorporates both local and global body motion priors learned from a motion capture dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
