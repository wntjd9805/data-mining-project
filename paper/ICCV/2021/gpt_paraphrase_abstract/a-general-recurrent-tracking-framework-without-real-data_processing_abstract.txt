The lack of available data in multi-object tracking (MOT) poses challenges for developing a robust scoring mechanism for potential tracks. Current manual scoring functions only utilize limited cues such as appearance and motion. To address this issue, we propose a framework called Multiple Nodes Tracking (MNT) that can be adapted to most trackers. Within this framework, we introduce a Recurrent Tracking Unit (RTU) that utilizes long-term information to score potential tracks. Additionally, we present a method for generating simulated tracking data to overcome the limitations of real data availability in MOT. Experimental results show that our simulated tracking data is effective for training the RTU, leading to state-of-the-art performance on MOT17 and MOT16 benchmarks. Furthermore, the RTU can be easily integrated into popular trackers like DeepSORT and MHT, resulting in significant improvements.
