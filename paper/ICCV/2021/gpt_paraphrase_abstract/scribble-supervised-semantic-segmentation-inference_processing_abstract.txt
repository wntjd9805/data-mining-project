This paper presents a framework called progressive segmentation inference (PSI) for scribble-supervised semantic segmentation. The framework utilizes two important cues, namely contextual pattern propagation and semantic label diffusion, to improve the accuracy of pixel-level segmentation results using partially known seeds. In the contextual pattern propagation step, different levels of contextual patterns are correlated and used to distribute pattern information based on a graphical model, increasing the confidence of pixel label prediction. Additionally, the initial annotated seeds are progressively spread across the image based on high-confidence scores of estimated pixels, using an adaptive decision strategy. The two cues are combined in a loop to update pixel-wise label inference. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PSI approach benefits from spatial and semantic context cues, achieving state-of-the-art performance on two publicly available scribble segmentation datasets.
