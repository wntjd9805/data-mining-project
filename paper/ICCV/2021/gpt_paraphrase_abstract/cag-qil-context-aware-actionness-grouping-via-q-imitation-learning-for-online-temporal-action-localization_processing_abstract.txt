Temporal action localization in videos is an important task in video understanding. However, there has been limited progress in extending this task to an online setting, despite the potential benefits for video streaming services. In this study, we introduce a new task called Online Temporal Action Localization (On-TAL), which aims to immediately detect action instances in an untrimmed video stream. The online setting presents challenges as the actionness decision for each frame must be made without knowledge of future frames, and past action proposals cannot be modified using post-processing methods. To address this, we propose a novel framework called Context-Aware Actionness Grouping (CAG) and train it using imitation learning to avoid complex reward engineering. Our evaluation on THUMOS14 and Activitynet1.3 datasets demonstrates significant improvements over non-naive baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, our method can also be applied to the Online Detection of Action Start (ODAS) task and outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in this area.
