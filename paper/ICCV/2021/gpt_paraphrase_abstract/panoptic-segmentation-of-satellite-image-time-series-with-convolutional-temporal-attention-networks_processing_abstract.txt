Unprecedented availability of multi-temporal satellite imagery has provided new opportunities for various Earth observation tasks. One such task is the precise segmentation of agricultural parcels, which has significant economic and environmental implications. While previous research has focused on single images, we argue that the complex temporal patterns of crop phenology are better addressed using sequences of images over time. In this paper, we propose the first end-to-end, single-stage method for panoptic segmentation of Satellite Image Time Series (SITS). Our approach combines a module for panoptic segmentation with a novel image sequence encoding network that utilizes temporal self-attention to extract comprehensive and adaptable multi-scale spatio-temporal features. Additionally, we introduce PASTIS, an openly accessible SITS dataset with panoptic annotations. Through experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our encoder for semantic segmentation compared to other existing architectures, and establish a state-of-the-art for panoptic segmentation of SITS. Our implementation and PASTIS dataset are publicly available.
