We present the problem of perpetual view generation, which involves generating new views over a long camera trajectory based on a single image. This problem is more complex than current view synthesis methods, which struggle with large camera motions. Existing video generation methods also have limitations in producing long sequences and ignoring scene geometry. To address this, we propose an iterative framework that combines geometry and image synthesis, enabling long-range generation after hundreds of frames. Our approach can be trained using monocular video sequences, and we introduce a dataset of coastal aerial footage. By comparing our method with existing view synthesis and conditional video generation techniques, we demonstrate its ability to generate realistic scenes for longer time periods and larger camera trajectories.
