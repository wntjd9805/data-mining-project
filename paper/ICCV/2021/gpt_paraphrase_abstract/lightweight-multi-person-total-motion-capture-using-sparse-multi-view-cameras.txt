We present a lightweight total motion capture system for multi-person interactive scenarios using sparse multi-view cameras. Our method addresses challenges such as severe occlusions, varying reconstruction granularities, changing observation scales, and fast body movements. We introduce a novel hand and face bootstrapping algorithm that enables efficient localization and accurate association of hands and faces, even in occluded situations. We combine pose regression and keypoints detection methods and propose a two-stage parametric fitting method for achieving pixel-aligned accuracy. To handle self-occluded poses and close interactions, we introduce a feedback mechanism that propagates pixel-aligned reconstructions to the next frame for more precise association. Our system achieves fast, robust, and accurate multi-person total motion capture performance, surpassing existing methods in sparse-view setups.
