Although CNNs have made significant advancements in shadow detection, they often make errors in dark non-shadow areas and bright shadow regions. They are also sensitive to changes in brightness. These observations indicate that deep shadow detectors heavily rely on intensity cues, which we refer to as intensity bias.   In this study, we introduce a new approach to address this intensity bias. Our method involves decomposing and reweighting the features using a novel feature decomposition and reweighting scheme. Through self-supervision, we separate the multi-level integrated features into two components: intensity-variant and intensity-invariant. By reweighting these components, our method effectively redistributes attention to the respective latent semantics, achieving a balanced utilization of both types of features.   Extensive experiments conducted on three widely-used datasets demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art shadow detectors.
