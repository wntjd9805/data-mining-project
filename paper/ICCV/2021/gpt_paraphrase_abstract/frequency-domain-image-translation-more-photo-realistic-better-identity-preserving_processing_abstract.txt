Current methods for image-to-image translation using GANs lack the ability to maintain the identity of the source domain, resulting in synthesized images that lose important structural characteristics and have suboptimal visual quality. To address these challenges, we propose a new framework called frequency domain image translation (FDIT), which utilizes frequency information to enhance the image generation process. Our approach decomposes the image into low-frequency and high-frequency components, where the high-frequency feature captures object structure similar to the identity. Our training objective focuses on preserving frequency information in both pixel space and Fourier spectral space. We extensively evaluate FDIT on five large-scale datasets and various tasks, including image translation and GAN inversion. Through extensive experiments and ablations, we demonstrate that FDIT effectively preserves the source image's identity and produces photo-realistic images. FDIT achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing the average FID score by 5.6% compared to the previous best method.
