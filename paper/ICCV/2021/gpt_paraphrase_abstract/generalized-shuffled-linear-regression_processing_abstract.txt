We examine the problem of shuffled linear regression, where the connections between predictors and responses are unknown. The current approach assumes a perfect one-to-one mapping where all data points must match, but this is often unrealistic in practical scenarios due to missing data or outliers. To address this limitation, we extend the formulation of shuffled linear regression to encompass situations where only a subset of the data should align. Additionally, we introduce a straightforward yet powerful optimization algorithm that guarantees global convergence. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of our proposed method.
