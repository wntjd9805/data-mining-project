This paper introduces a dynamic attentive graph learning model (DAGL) for image restoration by exploring the dynamic non-local property at the patch level. Existing methods often assign a fixed number of neighbors for each query item, ignoring the changing nature of non-local correlations. Additionally, these correlations are typically based on pixels, which can lead to biases due to image degradation. To address these issues, the proposed DAGL model utilizes an improved graph model to perform patch-wise graph convolution with a varying and adaptive number of neighbors for each node. This allows the image content to adaptively balance over-smooth and over-sharp artifacts through the number of connected neighbors, while also enhancing the patch-wise non-local correlations for better message passing. Experimental results on various image restoration tasks, including synthetic and real image denoising, image demosaicing, and compression artifact reduction, demonstrate that DAGL achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy and visual quality.
