Our research focuses on weakly-supervised scene graph generation, a challenging task that lacks label-object correspondence. Previous methods treat this correspondence as a latent variable and update it iteratively through nested optimization. However, we propose a simpler approach by decoupling the problem and using an efficient first-order graph matching module optimized through contrastive learning to obtain the correspondence. This correspondence is then utilized to train a standard scene graph generation model. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that this streamlined pipeline outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by over 30% in terms of both graph matching accuracy and scene graph quality on the VisualGenome dataset. We believe that our work provides a strong baseline for future research in this area. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/jshi31/WS-SGG.
