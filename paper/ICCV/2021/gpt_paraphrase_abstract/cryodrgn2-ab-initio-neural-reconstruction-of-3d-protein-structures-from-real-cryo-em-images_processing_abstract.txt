The process of determining protein structure from cryo-EM data involves reconstructing a 3D volume from multiple 2D projection images that are noisy and randomly oriented. Traditionally, the goal has been to recover a single static structure, but new methods have emerged that can reconstruct distributions of structures, allowing for the study of protein complexes with structural heterogeneity. However, these methods rely on fixed image poses, which may not be accurate in highly heterogeneous conditions. 

In this study, we introduce cryoDRGN2, an algorithm that combines ab initio reconstruction with neural modeling to jointly estimate image poses and learn a distribution of 3D structures from real heterogeneous cryo-EM data. We incorporate search algorithms from traditional cryo-EM literature and make necessary optimizations and design choices to make the search procedure computationally feasible in the neural model setting. Our results demonstrate that cryoDRGN2 is robust to high levels of noise in cryo-EM images, has faster training compared to previous neural methods, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real cryo-EM datasets.
