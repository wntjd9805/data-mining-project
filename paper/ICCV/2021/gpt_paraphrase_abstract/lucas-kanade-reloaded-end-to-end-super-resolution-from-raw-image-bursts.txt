This presentation focuses on the problem of reconstructing a high-resolution image using multiple lower-resolution snapshots taken from slightly different viewpoints in both space and time. The main challenges in solving this super-resolution problem involve accurately aligning the input pictures, handling raw and noisy images to maintain fidelity to the original camera data, and developing an appropriate image prior or regularizer for the task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid algorithm that combines insights from previous research on aliasing and incorporates end-to-end learning of parameters while still maintaining the interpretability of traditional approaches to inverse problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on both synthetic and real image bursts, achieving state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks and producing high-quality outcomes with real raw bursts captured by smartphones and prosumer cameras.
