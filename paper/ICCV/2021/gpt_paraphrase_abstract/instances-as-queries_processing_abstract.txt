We introduce QueryInst, a novel approach to instance segmentation. QueryInst is a comprehensive system that treats instances as learnable queries, allowing object detectors like Sparse R-CNN to achieve superior instance segmentation performance. Queries represent instance attributes such as categories, bounding boxes, instance masks, and instance association embeddings in a unified manner. In QueryInst, a query is shared by both detection and segmentation through dynamic convolutions, and it is guided by parallelly-supervised multi-stage learning. We extensively evaluate QueryInst on three challenging benchmarks (COCO, CityScapes, and YouTube-VIS) to assess its effectiveness in object detection, instance segmentation, and video instance segmentation tasks. We demonstrate, for the first time, that a simple end-to-end query-based framework can achieve state-of-the-art performance in various instance-level recognition tasks. The code for QueryInst is available at https://github.com/hustvl/QueryInst.
