This abstract presents a novel method for remapping disparities in stereo image pairs while preserving the 2D shapes and 3D structures of objects. The method aims to adjust disparities of important objects while meeting multiple requirements simultaneously. However, the one-stage optimization process often leads to either degradation of important objects' quality or serious distortions in background regions. To overcome this challenge, a two-stage warping process is proposed. In the first stage, an optimal warping model is developed to find the best warping grids for important objects, satisfying the requirements of disparity remapping. In the second stage, another warping model is introduced to refine the warping results in less important regions, eliminating distortions in shape, disparity, and 3D structure. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experimental results, showing superior performance compared to existing methods.
