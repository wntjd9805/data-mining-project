Developing reliable object detectors that can effectively handle changes in context, viewpoint, and object appearances is crucial for real-world applications. This study investigates the use of auxiliary self-supervised tasks to enhance the ability of object detectors to generalize to out-of-distribution scenarios. Drawing inspiration from the principle of maximum entropy, a new self-supervised task called instance-level temporal cycle confusion (CycConf) is introduced. CycConf focuses on the region features of object detectors and aims to identify the most dissimilar object proposals in adjacent frames of a video, creating a cycle of self-supervision. By encouraging the exploration of invariant structures across instances under various motions, CycConf improves the robustness of the object detector in unseen domains during testing. The study demonstrates consistent enhancements in out-of-domain performance by training object detectors in conjunction with self-supervised tasks on different domain adaptation benchmarks involving static images (Cityscapes, Foggy Cityscapes, Sim10K) and large-scale video datasets (BDD100K and Waymo open data).
