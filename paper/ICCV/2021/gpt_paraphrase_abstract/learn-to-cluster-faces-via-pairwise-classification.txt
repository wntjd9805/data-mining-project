Face clustering is an important task for analyzing large amounts of unlabeled face data. Graph-based methods have become popular for their good performance, but they have issues with high memory usage and reliance on empirical thresholds for determining connections between samples. To address these problems, this paper proposes a new approach to face clustering using pairwise angles. Instead of learning on large-scale graphs, the task is formulated as pairwise relationship classification. This classifier can directly determine the relationship between samples and is improved by contextual information. Additionally, a rank-weighted density method is introduced to improve efficiency by guiding the selection of pairs sent to the classifier. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves state-of-the-art performance on public clustering benchmarks while being the fastest and consuming less memory compared to graph-based methods. The proposed method reduces memory consumption by dealing with face clustering at the pair-level rather than the graph-level.
