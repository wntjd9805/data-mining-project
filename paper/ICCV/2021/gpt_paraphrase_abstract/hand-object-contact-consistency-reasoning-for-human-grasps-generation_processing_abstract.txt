The study of generating human grasps using multi-finger hands is a challenging problem, unlike the well-studied and widely applied prediction of robot grasps with parallel jaw grippers. This paper proposes a method to generate human grasps for a 3D object in the world. The key idea is to establish consistency between the hand contact points and object contact regions. This means that the hand should be in close proximity to the object surface and touch the common contact regions simultaneously. To achieve this, the paper introduces novel objectives for training the human grasp generation model and a self-supervised task that allows adjustment of the grasp generation network even during test time. Experimental results demonstrate a significant improvement in human grasp generation compared to state-of-the-art approaches, especially for unseen and out-of-domain objects.
