This paper introduces the concept of Unsupervised Single Object Tracker (USOT) and addresses the challenges faced by existing unsupervised trackers. The challenges include moving object discovery, exploiting rich temporal variation, and online update. To overcome these challenges and bridge the gap between unsupervised and supervised trackers, the authors propose a three-stage unsupervised learning approach. 

Firstly, instead of random cropping, the authors sample moving objects sequentially using unsupervised optical flow and dynamic programming. Secondly, they train a naive Siamese tracker from scratch using single-frame pairs. Finally, they continue training the tracker using a novel cycle memory learning scheme, which allows for longer temporal spans and enables online updates.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed USOT, learned from unlabeled videos, outperforms existing unsupervised trackers by a significant margin and performs on par with recent supervised deep trackers. The code for USOT is available at https://github.com/VISION-SJTU/USOT.
