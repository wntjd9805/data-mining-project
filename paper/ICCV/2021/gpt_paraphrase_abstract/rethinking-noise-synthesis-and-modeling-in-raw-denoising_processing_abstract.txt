The lack of a comprehensive dataset for real raw image denoising poses challenges in training denoising models to handle realistic raw image noise. Existing methods struggle to accurately model all sources of noise and creating a noise model for each sensor is time-consuming. This paper proposes a novel approach to synthesizing noise by directly sampling from a sensor's real noise, resulting in accurate raw image noise for different camera sensors. Two techniques, pattern-aligned patch sampling and high-bit reconstruction, are introduced to effectively synthesize spatial-correlated noise and high-bit noise respectively. The proposed method is evaluated on SIDD and ELD datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods across various sensors and lighting conditions. Furthermore, it is revealed that recent conclusions derived from DNN-based noise modeling methods are based on inaccurate noise parameters, indicating that physics-based statistical methods still outperform DNN-based approaches.
