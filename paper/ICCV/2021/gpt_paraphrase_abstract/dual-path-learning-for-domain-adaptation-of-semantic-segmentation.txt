Domain adaptation for semantic segmentation reduces the need for extensive pixel-wise annotations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) combined with image-to-image translation has proven effective in adaptive segmentation. However, the common practice of performing SSL with image translation in a single domain can lead to visual inconsistencies that affect subsequent learning. To address this issue, we propose a dual path learning (DPL) framework that leverages the complementary nature of domain adaptation frameworks in the source and target domains. DPL consists of two single-domain adaptation pipelines aligned in the respective source and target domains. The inference of DPL is simple, employing only one segmentation model in the target domain. We introduce novel technologies such as dual path image translation and dual path adaptive segmentation to facilitate mutual promotion between the two paths. Experimental results on GTA5→Cityscapes and SYNTHIA→Cityscapes scenarios demonstrate the superiority of our DPL model over state-of-the-art methods.
