This paper introduces CSG-Stump Net, an unsupervised end-to-end network designed to generate a concise and easily interpretable representation of 3D shapes from point clouds. The network utilizes a three-level structure called CSG-Stump, which includes a complement layer, an intersection layer, and a union layer. This structure is proven to be equivalent to Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG), while eliminating the complex tree structures associated with CSG. CSG-Stump's simple and regular structure allows for consistent dimensionality in the network's outputs, making it compatible with deep learning techniques. The CSG-Stump Net outperforms previous CSG-based methods in terms of generating visually appealing shapes, as validated by extensive experiments.
