To successfully edit real images using a GAN inversion method, it is crucial to find a latent code that aligns with the domain of a pre-trained GAN model. However, this is only possible for images that fall within the range of the training images. This paper introduces BDInvert, a novel GAN inversion approach that enables semantic editing of out-of-range images, which are not geometrically aligned with the training images. BDInvert achieves this by inverting an out-of-range image into an alternative latent space, different from the original latent space. Additionally, a regularized inversion method is proposed to find a solution that supports semantic editing in this alternative space. Experimental results demonstrate that BDInvert effectively enables semantic editing of out-of-range images with geometric transformations.
