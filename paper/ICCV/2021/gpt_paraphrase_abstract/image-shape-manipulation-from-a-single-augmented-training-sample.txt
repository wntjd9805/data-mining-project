This paper introduces DeepSIM, a generative model designed for conditional image manipulation using a single image. The authors emphasize the importance of extensive augmentation in enabling training with a single image and propose the use of thin-plate-spline (TPS) as an effective augmentation technique. The network is trained to map a primitive representation of the image to the actual image. The choice of a primitive representation influences the ease and flexibility of manipulations and can be automatic (e.g. edges), manual (e.g. segmentation), or a combination of both (e.g. edges on top of segmentations). During manipulation, the generator allows for complex image changes by modifying the primitive input representation and mapping it through the network. The proposed method demonstrates impressive performance on various image manipulation tasks.
