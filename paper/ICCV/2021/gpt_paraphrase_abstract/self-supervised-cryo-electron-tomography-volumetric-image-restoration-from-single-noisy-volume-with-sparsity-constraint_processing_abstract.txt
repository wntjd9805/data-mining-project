We propose a novel self-supervised learning model called SC-Net for restoring volumetric images from single noisy data in cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET). Our method does not require ground-truth data during training and incorporates a target function that preserves both local smoothness and detailed structure. We also introduce a new procedure for simulating electron tomographic photographs to aid in method evaluation. Experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances single noisy cryo-ET volumetric data, outperforming state-of-the-art methods such as Noise2Void and achieving comparable performance to Noise2Noise. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/icthrm/SC-Net.
