This study introduces CTRL-C, a novel approach for single image camera calibration. The goal is to estimate camera parameters, such as vanishing points, focal length, and horizon line, from a single input image. CTRL-C is an end-to-end neural network-based method that directly predicts these parameters using both the image and a set of line segments as inputs. The network utilizes the transformer architecture to capture the global structure of the image with multi-modal inputs. Additionally, an auxiliary task of line classification is proposed to effectively extract global geometric information from the lines. Experimental results on the Google Street View and SUN360 benchmark datasets demonstrate that CTRL-C surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance. The code for CTRL-C is available at https://github.com/jwlee-vcl/CTRL-C.
