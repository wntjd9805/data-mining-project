Change captioning involves identifying and describing changes in images using concise captions. However, filtering out insignificant changes remains a challenge, especially when images are taken from different camera perspectives. It is important to disregard changes in viewpoint while capturing actual changes. To address this problem, we propose a new approach called Viewpoint-Agnostic change captioning network with Cycle Consistency (VACC). Our method only requires one before and after image, without relying on any additional information. We achieve this by developing a new difference encoder module that effectively encodes viewpoint information and models the difference between images. Additionally, we introduce a cycle consistency module that can improve the performance of any change captioning network by matching the composite feature of the generated caption with the features of the before and after images. We evaluate our model on three datasets, including a new dataset with extreme viewpoint shifts. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method based on CIDEr, BLEU-4, METEOR, and SPICE scores. Furthermore, we show that attaching our cycle consistency module enhances the performance of existing change captioning networks, even when using different image encoding mechanisms.
