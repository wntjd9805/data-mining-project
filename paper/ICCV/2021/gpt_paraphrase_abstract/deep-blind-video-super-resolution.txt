Most existing video super-resolution (SR) algorithms assume that the blur kernels in the degradation process are known and do not consider modeling the blur kernels in the restoration process. However, this assumption is not valid for blind video SR and often results in over-smoothed super-resolved frames. In this paper, we propose an effective blind video SR algorithm using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our algorithm first estimates the blur kernels from low-resolution (LR) input videos. Then, with the estimated blur kernels, we develop a method for image deconvolution based on the image formation model of blind video SR to generate intermediate latent frames that restore sharp image content. To effectively utilize information from adjacent frames, we estimate motion fields from LR input videos, extract features from LR videos using a feature extraction network, and warp the extracted features based on the motion fields. Additionally, we introduce a method for sharp feature exploration, extracting sharp features from restored intermediate latent frames and using a transformation operation based on these sharp features and warped features from LR inputs to generate better features for high-resolution (HR) video restoration. We formulate the proposed algorithm as an end-to-end trainable framework and demonstrate its favorable performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
