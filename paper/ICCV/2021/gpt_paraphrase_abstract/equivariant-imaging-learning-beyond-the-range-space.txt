Learning from compressed measurements is challenging in imaging problems because most learning-based strategies require pairs of signals and associated measurements for training. However, this is not always possible as the compressed observations do not contain all the information needed. To address this limitation, we propose a novel self-supervised framework that leverages the equivariances present in natural signals. Our approach achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments on real clinical data, specifically sparse-view X-ray computed tomography, and image inpainting on natural images. The code for our framework is available at: https://github.com/edongdongchen/EI.
