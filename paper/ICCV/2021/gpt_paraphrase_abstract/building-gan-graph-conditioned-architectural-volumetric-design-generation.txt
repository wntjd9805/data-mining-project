Architects play a crucial role in the initial stage of professional building design, which involves creating a volumetric design. This process not only involves representing the 3D geometry of the building but also specifying the layout of each floor based on the desired programs. While generating 2D layouts for single-story buildings has been extensively researched, there is a lack of developed methods for multi-story buildings.To address this gap, this study focuses on generating volumetric designs for multi-story buildings based on an input program graph. Instead of producing dense 3D voxels as output, a novel 3D representation called voxel graph is proposed. This representation offers a compact yet expressive way to represent building geometries.The generator used in this study is a cross-modal graph neural network that incorporates a pointer mechanism to connect the input program graph with the output voxel graph. The entire pipeline is trained using an adversarial framework. To evaluate the generated designs, a combination of qualitative user studies and quantitative metrics including quality, diversity, and connectivity accuracy are utilized.The results demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of generating realistic 3D volumetric designs and outperforms previous methods and baselines. The use of voxel graphs as a representation proves to be effective in capturing the complexity of multi-story building designs while maintaining a concise format.
