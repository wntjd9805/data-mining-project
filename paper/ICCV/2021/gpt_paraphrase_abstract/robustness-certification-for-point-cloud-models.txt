The need to ensure the robustness of deep 3D point cloud models used in safety-critical applications like autonomous driving poses a technical challenge. A scalable verifier that can handle various semantic 3D transformations specific to point cloud models is required. To address this challenge, we introduce 3DCertify, the first verifier capable of certifying the robustness of point cloud models. 3DCertify is built on two key insights: (i) a general relaxation method based on first-order Taylor approximations, applicable to any differentiable transformation, and (ii) a precise relaxation technique for global feature pooling, which is more complex but commonly used in point cloud models compared to pointwise activations like ReLU or sigmoid. We evaluate the effectiveness of 3DCertify extensively on a wide range of 3D transformations for classification and part segmentation tasks. For instance, we can certify robustness against rotations within ±60° for 95.7% of point clouds, and our max pool relaxation improves certification by up to 15.6%.
