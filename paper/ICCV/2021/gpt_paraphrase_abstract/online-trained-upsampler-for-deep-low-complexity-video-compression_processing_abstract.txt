Deep learning has shown promise in image and video compression, but it often comes with high computational costs, especially for large resolutions. To address this issue, we propose an online-trained upsampler to enhance an existing codec. This upsampler is a small neural network trained on a specific group of frames, and its parameters are signaled to the decoder. This hybrid approach has a limited scope of only 10s or 100s of frames, which leads to low complexity in both encoding and decoding. Our algorithm can work offline and in zero-latency settings. We evaluate our approach using the x265 codec on various high-resolution datasets, ranging from Full HD to 8K. Our results demonstrate rate savings of 8.6% to 27.5%, and we provide ablation studies to illustrate the impact of our design choices. Comparing our approach to similar methods, we perform favorably.

Figure 1 illustrates the exploitation of different scopes in conventional and learned codecs, including motion vectors, frame-level filters, learned transformations, and block or receptive field methods. Our approach falls within the scope of learned codecs and focuses on a small number of frames, leveraging machine learning techniques. Overall, our method offers a more efficient and effective solution for image and video compression.
