Image-level weakly supervised semantic segmentation is a difficult task because existing methods, such as class activation maps (CAM), are not able to provide accurate guidance for training segmentation networks. In this study, we propose a new approach that utilizes the relationships between CAMs to overcome this limitation. We observed that erasing distinguishing features from images forces networks to focus on non-discriminative object regions and learn new features. Therefore, we use the features learned from erased images as segmentation supervision to train the network. Specifically, we erase the object regions obtained by CAM techniques from the images and use Erased CAM Supervision Net (ECS-Net) to generate pixel-level labels for the remaining regions. We also introduce a rule to suppress noise and select reliable labels. Our experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate that our ECS-Net achieves impressive results, with 67.6% mean intersection over union (mIoU) on the test set and 66.6% mIoU on the validation set, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.
