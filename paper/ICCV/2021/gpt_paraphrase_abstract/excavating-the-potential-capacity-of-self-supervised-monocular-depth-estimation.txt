Self-supervised methods have become increasingly important in monocular depth estimation due to their potential and low annotation cost. Recent works have used extra constraints, such as semantic segmentation, to improve performance. However, these methods increase the model's burden. This paper presents a novel approach to excavate the potential capacity of self-supervised monocular depth estimation without increasing the cost. The approach includes a data augmentation method called data grafting, which encourages the model to consider additional cues for depth estimation. It also introduces an exploratory self-distillation loss, supervised by a self-distillation label generated using a new post-processing method called selective post-processing. Additionally, the paper proposes a full-scale network to specialize the encoder for depth estimation and enhance the model's representational power. Extensive experiments demonstrate that these contributions significantly improve performance compared to the baseline, with even less computational overhead. The proposed model, EPCDepth, outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, including those supervised by additional constraints.
