We propose a single image desnowing algorithm that addresses the complexity of snow particles in terms of shape and size. To represent snow shape, we use the dual-tree wavelet transform and introduce a complex wavelet loss in the network. Additionally, we employ a hierarchical decomposition paradigm to better understand the different sizes of snow particles. We introduce a new feature called the contradict channel (CC) which has higher intensity in regions with snow particles compared to snow-free regions. This feature is utilized to construct the contradict channel loss, improving the performance of snow removal. To overcome limitations in existing snow datasets, we create a comprehensive snow dataset (CSD) for more realistic snow scenario simulations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques on synthetic and real-world datasets. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/weitingchen83/ICCV2021-Single-Image-Desnowing-HDCWNet. Figure 1 compares the performance of our proposed method with state-of-the-art snow removal algorithms, showing that our method achieves superior results.
