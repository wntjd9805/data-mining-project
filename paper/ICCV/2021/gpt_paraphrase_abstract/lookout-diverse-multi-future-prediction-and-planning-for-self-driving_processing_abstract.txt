This paper introduces LOOKOUT, an innovative autonomy system that perceives the environment, predicts various possible future scenarios, and estimates the trajectory of a self-driving vehicle (SDV) by optimizing contingency plans for these scenarios. The system achieves this by learning a diverse distribution of future trajectories in a traffic scene using generative models, ensuring high sample efficiency. Unlike previous approaches, the system explicitly rewards sampling future scenarios that require different reactions from the SDV to improve safety. The contingency planner then generates comfortable and non-conservative trajectories that enable safe responses to a wide range of future situations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of diversity and sample efficiency of motion forecasting in a large-scale self-driving dataset. Furthermore, it generates safer and less-conservative motion plans in long-term closed-loop simulations.
