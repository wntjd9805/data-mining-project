The current challenge in instance segmentation is understanding the relationship between objects in an image. This paper focuses on the concept of relative saliency, which is important for tasks like content-aware image cropping and image labeling. The authors introduce the Salient Object Ranking (SOR) task, which ranks detected objects based on their visual saliency. They propose an end-to-end framework for SOR, solving it through multi-task learning. The framework simultaneously handles instance segmentation and salient object ranking, with the SOR branch designed to be flexible and compatible with different detection methods. The authors also introduce a Position-Preserved Attention (PPA) module, which preserves object coordinates and incorporates them into the ranking process. Experimental results on the ASR dataset show that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches. The code for the method will be publicly available on GitHub.
