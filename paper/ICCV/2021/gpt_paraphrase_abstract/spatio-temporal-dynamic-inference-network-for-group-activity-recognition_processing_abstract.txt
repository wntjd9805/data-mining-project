Group activity recognition involves understanding the actions performed by a group of individuals. The key to achieving this is by modeling complex spatio-temporal interactions. Previous methods have limitations as they rely on a predefined graph and fail to consider the individual-specific interaction context. Additionally, these methods use computationally expensive inference schemes that often lead to over-smoothing.This paper introduces a solution called the Dynamic Inference Network (DIN) to enable person-specific inferences in spatio-temporal settings. DIN consists of two modules: the Dynamic Relation (DR) module and the Dynamic Walk (DW) module. The approach begins by initializing interaction fields on a primary spatio-temporal graph. Within each interaction field, the DR module predicts the relation matrix, while the DW module predicts dynamic walk offsets. This joint-processing approach creates a person-specific interaction graph. By updating features on this specific graph, each person can have a global-level interaction field with a local initialization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both modules. Moreover, DIN outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on two popular datasets while requiring less computational overhead for the reasoning module.
