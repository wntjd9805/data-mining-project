This paper proposes a new neural network solution called RINDNet to detect all four types of edges in computer vision: Reï¬‚ectance, Illumination, surface-Normal, and Depth. RINDNet utilizes a three-stage approach, considering the unique attributes of each edge type and their relationships. In stage I, RINDNet extracts shared features using a common backbone. In stage II, it branches to generate discriminative features for each edge type using the corresponding decoder. In stage III, an independent decision head for each type combines the features from previous stages to predict initial results. Additionally, an attention module learns attention maps to capture the relations between edge types, which are then combined with initial results for final edge detection. The authors also introduce BSDS-RIND, the first public benchmark with annotations for all four edge types. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of RINDNet compared to state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis can be found in the supplementary material.
