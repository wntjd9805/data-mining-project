Weakly supervised instance segmentation (WSIS) using only image-level labels has gained significant attention. Current bottom-up WSIS methods refine discriminative cues from classifiers using complex multi-stage training procedures, but they suffer from inconsistent object boundaries. On the other hand, top-down WSIS methods rely on pseudo masks generated from detectors in a cascade detection-to-segmentation pipeline, which affects the segmentation learning quality. To address these issues, we propose a unified parallel detection-and-segmentation learning (PDSL) framework in this paper. Our framework combines elements from both top-down and bottom-up approaches. The detection module follows the typical design of weakly supervised object detection, while the segmentation module utilizes self-supervised learning for class-agnostic foreground extraction and self-training for refining class-specific segmentation. Additionally, we introduce an instance-activation correlation module to enhance the coherence between the detection and segmentation branches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets.
