In the era of deep learning, traditional edge detectors such as Canny, Sobel, and LBP have been largely overlooked. This is surprising considering the high performance of deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in edge detection. However, the use of large pretrained CNN backbones for edge detection is memory and energy consuming. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight architecture called Pixel Difference Network (PiDiNet) that integrates traditional edge detection operators into modern CNNs. PiDiNet achieves enhanced performance while maintaining efficiency. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of PiDiNet. Surprisingly, when trained from scratch using only two datasets, PiDiNet outperforms human perception in edge detection. It achieves a high frame rate and requires fewer parameters compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The results on different datasets confirm these findings. The codes for PiDiNet are available at a provided link.
