The issue of inaccurate learning targets in crowd counting has become a topic of interest. To address this problem, we propose a new approach that predicts the indices of pre-defined interval bins instead of the count values themselves. However, an inappropriate interval setting can result in imbalanced count error contributions, leading to poor counting performance. To solve this, we introduce a novel count interval partition criterion called Uniform Error Partition (UEP), which ensures equal expected counting error contributions for all intervals. Additionally, we propose the MeanCount Proxies (MCP) criterion to mitigate discretization errors in the count quantization process by selecting the best count proxy for each interval during inference. This reduces the overall expected discretization error in an image. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to delve into this classification task and offers a promising solution for count interval partition. Based on these criteria, we present the Uniform Error Partition Network (UEP-Net), a simple yet effective model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging datasets.
