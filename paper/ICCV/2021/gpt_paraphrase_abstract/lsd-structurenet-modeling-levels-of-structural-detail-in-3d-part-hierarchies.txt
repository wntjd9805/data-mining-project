Current generative models for 3D shapes represented by hierarchies of parts have limitations in their ability to generate variations on individual parts without modifying the rest of the shape. This limitation hinders their application in tasks like 3D CAD design that require adjusting shapes at multiple levels of detail. To overcome this limitation, we propose LSD-StructureNet, an extension to the StructureNet architecture. LSD-StructureNet incorporates individual, probabilistic conditional decoders for each hierarchy depth, allowing for the regeneration of parts at arbitrary positions in the hierarchies. We evaluate LSD-StructureNet on the PartNet dataset, which is the largest dataset of 3D shapes represented by part hierarchies. Our results demonstrate that LSD-StructureNet can perform conditional sampling without compromising inference speed or the realism and diversity of its generated outputs.
