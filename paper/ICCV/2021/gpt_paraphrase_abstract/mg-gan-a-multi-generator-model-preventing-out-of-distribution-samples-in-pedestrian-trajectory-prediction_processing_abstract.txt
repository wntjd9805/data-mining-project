Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a difficult task due to its uncertain and diverse nature. Existing generative adversarial network models struggle to accurately predict future trajectories when the distribution of possible trajectories includes multiple disconnected modes. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-generator model for pedestrian trajectory prediction. In this model, each generator is trained to learn a distribution of trajectories that lead to one of the main modes observed in the scene. Additionally, another network learns a categorical distribution over these generators, taking into account the dynamics and scene input. This architecture enables us to effectively sample from specialized generators and significantly reduce the occurrence of out-of-distribution samples compared to single generator methods.
