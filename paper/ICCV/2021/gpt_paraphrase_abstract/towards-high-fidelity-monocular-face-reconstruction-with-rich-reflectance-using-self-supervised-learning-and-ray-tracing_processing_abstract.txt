Reconstructing a face from a single image in various lighting conditions is a difficult task. Previous methods utilizing deep neural networks and differentiable rendering have allowed for fast reconstruction of geometry, lighting, and reflectance. These methods can also be trained in a self-supervised manner for increased robustness and improved generalization. However, these approaches are limited to Lambertian face reflectance and lack detailed shape information.Recently, ray tracing has been introduced as a method for monocular face reconstruction, providing state-of-the-art results. However, optimization-based approaches are slow and not robust. In this study, we propose a new method that builds upon previous approaches to significantly enhance reconstruction quality and robustness in general scenes. Our method combines a CNN encoder with a differentiable ray tracer, allowing for more advanced personalized diffuse and specular albedos, a sophisticated illumination model, and a realistic representation of self-shadows. This advancement enables a significant improvement in the reconstruction quality of shape, appearance, and lighting, even in challenging lighting conditions. Additionally, our method allows for practical applications such as relighting and self-shadow removal.Compared to existing methods, our results demonstrate improved accuracy and validity. We believe that our approach represents a significant step forward in the field of face reconstruction.
