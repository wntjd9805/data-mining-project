We introduce ROBUSTNAV, a framework for evaluating the performance of embodied navigation agents in the presence of various visual and dynamic corruptions. While previous studies have focused on generalizing to new environments with similar characteristics, our findings reveal that many standard navigation agents struggle or fail when faced with corruptions. We analyze the specific behaviors that emerge in these agents under corrupted conditions. Additionally, we explore techniques like data augmentation and self-supervised adaptation to improve robustness, but acknowledge that there is still significant room for improvement in recovering performance lost due to corruptions. The code for our framework is available at https://github.com/allenai/robustnav.
