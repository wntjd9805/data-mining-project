This study introduces a novel approach called zero-shot semantic segmentation, which aims to identify both seen and unseen classes in training. The method uses a stringent inductive setting where only instances of seen classes are available during training. The proposed approach, called open-aware prototypical matching, utilizes prototypes to extract visual representations, allowing for the addition of new unseen classes. A prototype projection is trained to map semantic representations to prototypes based on seen instances and generate prototypes for unseen classes. Additionally, an open-set rejection technique is used to detect objects that do not belong to any seen classes, reducing misclassification of unseen objects. The approach is applied to two segmentation datasets, PascalVOC 2012 and Pascal Context, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
