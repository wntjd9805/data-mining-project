Despite advancements in instance segmentation, it remains challenging to develop algorithms that are both highly accurate and can perform in real-time. This paper introduces a real-time instance segmentation framework called OrienMask. It builds upon the YOLOv3 object detector by adding a mask head that predicts orientation maps, which are spatial offset vectors for foreground and background pixels. These orientation maps eliminate the need for additional foreground segmentation by allowing masks to be recovered. Instances with the same anchor size share a common orientation map, reducing memory usage without sacrificing mask detail. After non-maximum suppression, instance masks can be efficiently constructed from the corresponding orientation maps. By combining a concise mask representation with an anchor-based object detector, our method achieves real-time performance without compromising accuracy. Experimental results on the COCO benchmark demonstrate that OrienMask achieves a mask average precision of 34.8 at a speed of 42.7 frames per second using a single RTX 2080 Ti GPU.
