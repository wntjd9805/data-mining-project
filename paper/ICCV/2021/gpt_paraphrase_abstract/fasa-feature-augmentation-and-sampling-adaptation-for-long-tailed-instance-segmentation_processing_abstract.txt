Recent methods for addressing the challenge of rare object classes with limited training data in long-tailed instance segmentation have not been very successful. To overcome this issue, we propose a straightforward yet effective approach called Feature Augmentation and Sampling Adaptation (FASA). FASA tackles the problem of data scarcity by augmenting the feature space specifically for the rare classes. Both the Feature Augmentation (FA) and feature sampling components of FASA are adaptable to the current training status. FA takes into account the mean and variance of observed real samples from previous iterations, while the generation of virtual features is sampled in a manner that is adapted to the loss, thus avoiding overfitting. Unlike other methods, FASA does not require complex loss design or inter-class transfer learning, which often incurs high costs and involves the manual definition of head/tail class groups. Our experiments demonstrate that FASA is a fast and versatile method that can easily be integrated into standard or long-tailed segmentation frameworks, resulting in consistent performance improvements with minimal additional computational overhead. Furthermore, FASA can also be applied to other tasks, such as long-tailed classification, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
