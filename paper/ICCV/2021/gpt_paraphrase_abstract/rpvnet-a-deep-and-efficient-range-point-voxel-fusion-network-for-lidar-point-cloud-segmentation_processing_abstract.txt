The abstract discusses the representation of point clouds and the challenges associated with different views, namely point-based, voxel-based, and range-based. It highlights the limitations of each view and proposes a novel fusion network called RPVNet to overcome these limitations. The RPVNet utilizes a deep fusion framework with mutual information interactions and a gated fusion module to merge the features of the three views. The proposed RPV interaction mechanism is efficient and the method is proven to be more efficient due to its lower voxel resolution. The model is evaluated on two large-scale datasets, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, and achieves state-of-the-art performance. It is important to note that the method currently ranks first on the SemanticKITTI leaderboard without any additional techniques.
