We introduce a new loss weighting algorithm called loss scale balancing (LSB) for multi-task learning (MTL) in pixelwise vision tasks. In MTL, a model is trained to predict multiple pixelwise outputs using a combined loss function that incorporates individual task losses. Our proposed algorithm adjusts the weights of these losses dynamically to effectively learn all tasks. Instead of directly controlling each loss value, we periodically balance the loss scale, which is the product of the loss value and its weight. Furthermore, our algorithm prioritizes difficult tasks during training by evaluating their previous loss records. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms traditional weighting algorithms for MTL in various pixelwise tasks.
