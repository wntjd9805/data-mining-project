Crowd counting is a challenging task due to the diverse nature of scenes. Existing methods often use complex structures with large backbones to improve their ability to generalize. However, these methods do not perform well on large-scale datasets. To address this issue, we investigated the use of a multi-expert model for crowd counting. Our focus was on training more efficient expert networks and selecting the most suitable expert. We proposed a task-driven similarity metric called co-fine-tune similarity, which identifies a more efficient subset of data for training the expert network. Similar samples are grouped together to obtain expert parameters. Additionally, we designed a simple network called FPN with Deconvolution Counting Network as a base model for the multi-expert counting network. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach, Multiple Experts FDC (MFDC), achieves the best performance on four public datasets, including the large-scale NWPU-Crowd dataset. Furthermore, the MFDC trained on a dense crowd dataset can generalize well to other datasets without additional training or fine-tuning.
