Curvilinear structure segmentation (CSS) is a type of semantic segmentation used in various applications such as crack detection, aerial road extraction, and biomedical image segmentation. While CSS requires the consideration of both geometric topology and pixel-wise features, most existing methods only focus on improving feature representations, neglecting the importance of preserving topology. In this study, we propose a novel network called Joint Topology-preserving and Feature-refinement Network (JTFN), which addresses both topology preservation and feature refinement using an iterative feedback learning strategy. Our approach incorporates the structure of objects to preserve the corresponding topologies of predicted masks and includes a reciprocative two-stream module for CSS and boundary detection. Moreover, we introduce topology-aware predictions as feedback guidance to refine attentive features by enhancing saliencies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that jointly tackles topology preservation and feature refinement for CSS. We evaluate our JTFN on four datasets with diverse applications (Crack500, CrackTree200, Roads, and DRIVE) and demonstrate that it outperforms alternative methods. The code for our approach is publicly available.
