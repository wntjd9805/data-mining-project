A new framework has been developed to estimate the light transport matrix (LTM) in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. This matrix describes how light interacts with a scene and enables applications such as relighting or separating illumination components. By combining virtual forward light propagation models for NLOS imaging with the line-of-sight (LOS) light transport equation, computational projector-camera setups were designed to estimate the transport matrix of hidden scenes. Specific illumination functions were introduced to compute the different elements of the matrix, overcoming the challenges posed by wide-aperture conditions in NLOS setups. The resulting NLOS light transport matrix allows for the (re)illumination of specific locations in a hidden scene and the separation of direct, first-order indirect, and higher-order indirect illumination, similar to existing LOS techniques.
