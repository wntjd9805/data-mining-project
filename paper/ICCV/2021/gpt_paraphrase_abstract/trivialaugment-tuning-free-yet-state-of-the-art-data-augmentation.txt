Automatic augmentation methods have become increasingly important for achieving high performance in vision tasks. However, existing methods often require a trade-off between simplicity, cost, and performance. In this study, we introduce TrivialAugment, a simple and parameter-free baseline method that surpasses previous methods at minimal cost. TrivialAugment applies only a single augmentation to each image, making its effectiveness surprisingly unexpected. To thoroughly evaluate its performance, we conducted extensive experiments. Firstly, we compared TrivialAugment to state-of-the-art methods in various image classification scenarios. Next, we conducted multiple ablation studies with different augmentation spaces, methods, and setups to identify the key factors contributing to its performance. Additionally, we developed a user-friendly interface and shared our complete code base to facilitate the widespread adoption of automatic augmentation methods and ensure reproducibility of our findings. Our work also highlights the stagnation in automatic augmentation research in certain areas and proposes best practices for future progress in this field. Table 1 summarizes the favorable comparison of TrivialAugment with previous augmentation methods, including an estimate of the search overhead.
