We introduce the Teacher-Student Generative Adversarial Network (TS-GAN) for enhancing the performance of face recognition systems by generating depth images from single RGB images. To ensure the generalizability of our approach on unseen datasets, we incorporate a teacher and a student component in the architecture. The teacher, comprising a generator and a discriminator, learns the mapping between input RGB and paired depth images in a supervised manner. On the other hand, the student, consisting of two generators (one shared with the teacher) and a discriminator, learns from new RGB data without paired depth information to improve generalization. The trained shared generator can then be utilized at runtime to generate depth from RGB for downstream applications like face recognition. Through rigorous experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of TS-GAN in generating synthetic depth images compared to other methods. Additionally, our hallucinated depth combined with RGB inputs significantly improves face recognition performance across various architectures, achieving average improvements of +1.2%, +2.6%, and +2.6% on the IIIT-D, EURECOM, and LFW datasets, respectively.
