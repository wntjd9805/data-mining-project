Current state-of-the-art action recognition methods focus on offline learning, where all types of actions are provided at once. However, we address the challenge of continual learning in action recognition, where new actions are continuously learned over time. This poses a problem known as catastrophic forgetting, where previously learned actions are forgotten when new actions are learned. To tackle this problem, we propose Else-Net, a novel ElasticSemantic Network that utilizes multiple learning blocks to learn diverse human actions over time. Else-Net is capable of automatically searching for and updating the most relevant learning blocks for current new actions, while also exploring new blocks to store new knowledge. This allows the network to retain the knowledge of previously learned actions and mitigate forgetting when learning new actions. Additionally, although different human actions may vary greatly as a whole, their local body parts often share similar features. Inspired by this, our proposed Else-Net mines the shared knowledge of decomposed human body parts from different actions, which aids in continual learning of actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables effective continual action recognition and achieves promising performance on two large-scale action recognition datasets.
