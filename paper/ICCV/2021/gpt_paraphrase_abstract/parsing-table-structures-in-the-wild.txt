This paper addresses the challenge of parsing table structures from images taken in real-world scenarios, where the tables may be deformed, bent, or partially obstructed. Existing studies focus on parsing well-aligned tables from scanned PDF documents, but we aim to develop a practical system for more challenging situations. To achieve this, we propose a method called Cycle-CenterNet, which builds upon CenterNet and includes a novel cycle-pairing module to detect and group table cells into structured tables. We also introduce a large-scale dataset called Wired Table in the Wild (WTW), which contains well-annotated structure parsing of various table styles in different scenes. Our experiments demonstrate that Cycle-CenterNet consistently achieves the highest accuracy for table structure parsing on the WTW dataset, with a 24.6% absolute improvement according to the TEDS metric. Additional analysis further confirms the advantages of our proposed methods for the table structure parsing task.
