Current few-shot object detection (FSOD) techniques have made significant progress by leveraging meta-learning techniques to match query images with few-shot class examples. However, these methods often fail to consider the multiple relationships among query image regions and novel classes, as they perform pairwise matching separately. To address this limitation, we propose a novel FSOD model called QA-FewDet that utilizes heterogeneous graph convolutional networks. By enabling efficient message passing between proposal and class nodes through three different types of edges, our model obtains context-aware proposal features and query-adaptive, multiclass-enhanced prototype representations for each class. These enhancements promote pairwise matching and improve the accuracy of FSOD. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO FSOD benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior results across different shots and evaluation metrics.
