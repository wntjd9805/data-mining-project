Autonomous driving faces challenges in predicting the future trajectories of road agents due to the unpredictable nature of human behaviors. Current methods use goal-based multi-trajectory prediction, where they score over-sampled goal candidates and select a final set. However, these methods rely on sparse pre-defined anchors and heuristic goal selection algorithms. In this study, we propose DenseTNT, an anchor-free and end-to-end trajectory prediction model that directly outputs a set of trajectories from dense goal candidates. We also introduce an offline optimization-based technique to provide multi-future pseudo-labels for our online model. Experimental results demonstrate that DenseTNT achieves state-of-the-art performance, ranking 1st in the Argoverse motion forecasting benchmark and winning 1st place in the 2021 Waymo Open Dataset Motion Prediction Challenge.
