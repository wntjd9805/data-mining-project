We present a trainable framework for processing large-scale visual data tensors using a fraction of their entries. Our method combines a neural network encoder with tensor train decomposition to learn a low-rank latent encoding. We utilize cross-approximation (CA), an adaptive sampling algorithm, to learn the representation from a subset of the original samples. CA selects local representative samples, which are fetched out-of-core and on demand, avoiding the need to work with the full high-resolution data explicitly. The number of required samples increases logarithmically with the input size, allowing us to process large grids that would be otherwise impractical to handle in their uncompressed form. This approach is particularly valuable for analyzing large-scale multidimensional grid data, such as 3D tomography, and for tasks that demand context over a wide receptive field, such as predicting the medical condition of entire organs. The code for our proposed approach is available at https://github.com/aelphy/c-pic.
