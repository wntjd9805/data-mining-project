This study focuses on the problem of reliable object detection in autonomous driving using LiDAR technology. While previous research has aimed to improve performance within a single domain, this study reveals that the performance of LiDAR-based object detectors can drop significantly when applied to different geographic locations and weather conditions. The study investigates unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for LiDAR-based 3D object detection, specifically on the Waymo Domain Adaptation dataset. The study identifies deteriorating point cloud quality as the main cause of the performance drop. To address this issue, the study proposes Semantic Point Generation (SPG), a general approach to enhance the reliability of LiDAR detectors against domain shifts. SPG generates semantic points in the predicted foreground regions and recovers missing parts of foreground objects caused by occlusions, low reflectance, or weather interference. These semantic points are merged with the original points to create an augmented point cloud that can be used by modern LiDAR-based detectors. The study validates the effectiveness of SPG by experimenting with two representative detectors, PointPillars and PV-RCNN. SPG significantly improves the performance of both detectors across all object categories and difficulty levels in the UDA task. Furthermore, SPG also enhances object detection in the original domain, improving 3D detection results on the Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI dataset for both PointPillars and PV-RCNN. When combined with PV-RCNN, SPG achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection results on the KITTI dataset.
