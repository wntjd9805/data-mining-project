Rotation augmentations are commonly used to improve a model's ability to handle rotation invariance/equivariance, but they are not effective in object detection due to the unknown shape of the objects. The widely used method for bounding box label rotation, the LargestBox Method, results in large labels that negatively impact performance, sometimes even worse than using no rotation at all. To address this issue, we propose a new rotation augmentation method that is easy to implement. Firstly, we develop a differentiable approximation of label accuracy and demonstrate that aligning the bounding box with an ellipse is the optimal approach. Secondly, we introduce a Rotation Uncertainty (RU) Loss, which enables the model to adapt to label uncertainty. We evaluate our approach on five different datasets, including COCO, PascalVOC, and Transparent Object BinPicking, and observe significant improvements in rotational invariance for both one-stage and two-stage architectures, as measured by AP, AP50, and AP75 metrics.
