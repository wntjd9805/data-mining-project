We introduce Rank & Sort (RS) Loss, a novel ranking-based loss function for training deep object detection and instance segmentation methods. RS Loss guides the classifier of these methods to rank each positive instance above all negatives and sort the positives based on their localization qualities, such as Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To handle the non-differentiable aspects of ranking and sorting, we propose the Identity Update, which incorporates error-driven update with back-propagation. This allows us to model the sorting error among positives. RS Loss simplifies the training process in several ways. Firstly, the positives are prioritized by the classifier without the need for additional auxiliary heads (e.g., centerness, IoU, mask-IoU), thanks to our sorting objective. Secondly, RS Loss is robust to class imbalance, eliminating the need for sampling heuristics. Lastly, we address the multi-task nature of visual detectors by using tuning-free task-balancing coefficients. By employing RS Loss, we trained seven diverse visual detectors simply by tuning the learning rate. Our results consistently outperform baselines, demonstrating the effectiveness of RS Loss. For example, RS Loss improves Faster R-CNN by approximately 3 box AP and aLRP Loss (a ranking-based baseline) by around 2 box AP on the COCO dataset. Additionally, RS Loss outperforms MaskR-CNN with repeat factor sampling (RFS) by 3.5 mask AP (around 7 AP for rare classes) on the LVIS dataset, surpassing all other counterparts.
