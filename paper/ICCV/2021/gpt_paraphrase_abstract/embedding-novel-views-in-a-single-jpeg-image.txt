We present a new technique to embed additional perspectives within a single JPEG image without compromising the visual quality of the modified image or the resulting novel views. Our approach utilizes the widely used representation of multiplane images (MPIs) for novel view synthesis. By encoding 32 MPI layers (equivalent to 128 channels) into a 3-channel JPEG image, we enable the decoding of MPIs to generate novel views, with a capacity of 1024 bits per pixel for embedding. Through experiments on various public datasets using different novel view synthesis methods, we demonstrate that our proposed method successfully restores high-fidelity novel views from minimally altered JPEG images. Furthermore, our technique proves to be robust against JPEG compression, color adjustments, and cropping. We will make our source code publicly accessible.
