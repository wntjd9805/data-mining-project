We present a novel method for multi-frame image restoration tasks that improves the commonly used maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation. Our method involves incorporating a learned error metric and a latent representation of the target image, which transforms the MAP objective into a deep feature space. This deep reparametrization enables us to model the image formation process directly in the latent space and incorporate learned image priors into the prediction. By combining the benefits of deep learning and the principled multi-frame fusion of the MAP formulation, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in burst denoising and burst super-resolution tasks. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed formulation.
