We present the Seeded Graph Matching Network (SGMN), a graph neural network designed to accurately and efficiently match local features across images in computer vision. To reduce redundancy and learn compact representation, our network incorporates a sparse structure. It consists of two main components: the Seeding Module and the Seeded Graph Neural Network.  The Seeding Module initiates the matching process by generating a small set of reliable matches as seeds. These seeds serve as the starting point for the subsequent steps. The Seeded Graph Neural Network utilizes these seed matches to pass messages within and across images, ultimately predicting assignment costs.  To facilitate message passing, we introduce three novel operations as fundamental elements. First, Attentional Pooling aggregates keypoint features within each image to generate seed matches. This pooling operation helps identify the most relevant features for matching. Second, Seed Filtering enhances the seed features and enables the exchange of messages between images. This step promotes the refinement of matches and improves overall accuracy. Finally, Attentional Unpooling propagates the seed features back to the original keypoints, ensuring that relevant information is preserved throughout the process.  Our experiments demonstrate that SGMN significantly reduces computational and memory complexity compared to traditional attention-based networks. Despite these efficiency gains, our method achieves competitive or even superior performance in matching local features across images.
