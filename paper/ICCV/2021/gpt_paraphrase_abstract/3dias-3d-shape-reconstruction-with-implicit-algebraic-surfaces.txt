The way in which 3D shapes are represented significantly impacts the process of reconstructing these shapes. Current approaches rely on primitive-based representations, which approximate a 3D shape using a series of simple implicit primitives. However, the limited complexity of these primitives hinders the level of detail that can be achieved in the shape reconstruction. Additionally, determining an adequate number of primitives for any given shape is a difficult task.  To address these challenges, we propose a new approach that utilizes a constrained implicit algebraic surface as the primitive. This surface has a higher degree of geometrical complexity and can be defined by only a few learnable coefficients. We further enhance our method by employing a deep neural network to generate these primitives. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of its ability to represent 3D shapes accurately, particularly in the context of single RGB image 3D shape reconstruction.  Furthermore, we show that our method has the capability to semantically learn different segments of 3D shapes in an unsupervised manner. This finding highlights the potential of our approach in understanding and analyzing complex 3D structures without the need for explicit supervision. For those interested, the code for our method is publicly available at the provided link.
