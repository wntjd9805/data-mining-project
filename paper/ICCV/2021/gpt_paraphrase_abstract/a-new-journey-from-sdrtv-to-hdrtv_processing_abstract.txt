Currently, modern displays have the capability to display video content with high dynamic range (HDR) and wide color gamut (WCG). However, the majority of available resources are still in standard dynamic range (SDR). This creates a pressing need to convert existing SDR-TV content into its HDR-TV version. In this study, we analyze the task of converting SDRTV to HDRTV by modeling the formation of SDRTV/HDRTV content. Based on our analysis, we propose a three-step solution pipeline that involves adaptive global color mapping, local enhancement, and highlight generation. Additionally, our analysis inspires the development of a lightweight network that utilizes global statistics to perform image-adaptive color mapping. To evaluate our results, we create a dataset called HDRTV1K, consisting of HDR videos in the HDR10 standard, and select five metrics for assessment. Our final results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative comparisons and visual quality. The code and dataset for our approach are publicly available at https://github.com/chxy95/HDRTVNet.
