We present Multiresolution Deep Implicit Functions (MDIF), a hierarchical representation that can capture fine details of 3D shapes and perform global operations like shape completion. Our model uses a hierarchy of latent grids to represent complex shapes, allowing for decoding at different levels of detail and improving accuracy. For shape completion, we introduce latent grid dropout to simulate incomplete data in the latent space, enabling the decoder to complete the shape. Our multiresolution design, combined with latent optimization in the decoder, significantly enhances shape completion quality. MDIF is the first deep implicit function model to simultaneously support progressive decoding, encoder-decoder inference, decoder-only latent optimization, and multiple applications. It also achieves superior performance compared to previous methods in various 3D reconstruction tasks.
