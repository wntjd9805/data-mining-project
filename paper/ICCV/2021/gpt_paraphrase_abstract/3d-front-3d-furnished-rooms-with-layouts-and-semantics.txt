We present 3D-FRONT, a comprehensive collection of synthetic indoor scenes featuring professionally designed layouts and a large number of rooms furnished with high-quality textured 3D models. Our dataset includes 6,813 CAD houses with 18,968 diverse rooms, surpassing all publicly available scene datasets. The furniture objects in our dataset consist of 13,151 items, all with high-quality textures. We have carefully curated the interior designs, including furniture styles, color, and textures, to ensure consistency using a recommender system we developed. Additionally, we provide Trescope, a lightweight rendering tool, to support benchmark rendering of 2D images and annotations from 3D-FRONT. We demonstrate the usefulness of our dataset through two tailored applications: interior scene synthesis and texture synthesis. Our dataset is freely accessible to the academic community and beyond.
