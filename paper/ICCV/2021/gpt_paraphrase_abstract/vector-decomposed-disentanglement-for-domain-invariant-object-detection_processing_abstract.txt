Recent advancements in domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) have primarily focused on aligning feature-level distributions between the source and single-target domains. However, this approach tends to overlook the impact of domain-specific information present in the aligned features. Therefore, it is crucial to extract domain-invariant representations of objects for effective DAOD. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on vector decomposition to disentangle domain-invariant representations from domain-specific representations. Our approach involves two key steps. Firstly, we design an extractor to separate domain-invariant representations from the input, which are then utilized for extracting object proposals. Secondly, we introduce domain-specific representations as the differences between the input and domain-invariant representations. By performing a difference operation, we enlarge the gap between the domain-specific and domain-invariant representations, thereby enhancing the domain-invariant representations to contain more domain-irrelevant information. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct separate experiments on single-target and compound-target cases. In the single-target case, we compare our method with baseline methods on four domain-shift scenes, and our approach demonstrates a significant performance improvement. Additionally, in the compound-target case where the target comprises two different domains without domain labels, our method outperforms the baseline methods by approximately 4%, further validating its effectiveness.
