Automatic table recognition is a challenging task for machines due to the various layouts and styles of tables. Existing methods fail to consider the logical location of table cells, resulting in incomplete understanding of the table structure. In this study, we propose a table graph reconstruction network (TGRNet) that addresses this issue. TGRNet consists of two branches: a cell detection branch and a cell logical location branch. These branches work together to predict the spatial and logical locations of cells. We evaluate the effectiveness of TGRNet on multiple table recognition datasets, including a new dataset with table graph annotations. The experimental results demonstrate the success of TGRNet in accurately recognizing table structures. The code and annotations for TGRNet are publicly available at https://github.com/xuewenyuan/TGRNet.
