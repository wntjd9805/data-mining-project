This paper explores the problem of Novel Class Discovery (NCD), which involves identifying new object categories in an unlabeled dataset using prior knowledge from a labeled dataset containing related classes. Existing approaches use multiple objective functions with specialized loss terms for labeled and unlabeled samples, often requiring additional regularization terms. In contrast, this paper introduces a UNified Objective function (UNO) that aims to promote synergy between supervised and unsupervised learning. By employing a multi-view self-labeling strategy, pseudo-labels are generated, allowing them to be treated similarly to ground truth labels. This results in a single classification objective that encompasses both known and unknown classes. Despite its simplicity, UNO surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin on various benchmarks (approximately 10% improvement on CIFAR-100 and 8% improvement on ImageNet).
