This paper introduces a neural network called AdaFit that can accurately estimate normals on point clouds, even when they contain noise and density variations. Previous approaches used weighted least squares surface fitting with point-wise weights learned by a network, but this method struggles to find accurate normals in complex regions or with noisy points. By analyzing the challenges of weighted least squares surface fitting, we identify difficulties in determining the polynomial order of the fitting surface and handling outliers. To overcome these issues, we propose a simple yet effective solution that incorporates an additional offset prediction to enhance the quality of normal estimation. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Cascaded Scale Aggregation layer to leverage points from different neighborhood sizes, helping the network generate more precise point-wise offsets and weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdaFit outperforms existing methods on both the synthetic PCPNet dataset and the real-world SceneNN dataset.
