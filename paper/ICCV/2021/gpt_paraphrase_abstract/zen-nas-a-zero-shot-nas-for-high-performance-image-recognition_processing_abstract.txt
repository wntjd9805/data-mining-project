Instead of using a traditional accuracy predictor in Neural Architecture Search (NAS), we introduce a new method called Zen-Score to rank architectures. Zen-Score measures the network expressivity and is positively correlated with model accuracy. Unlike accuracy predictors, Zen-Score only requires a few forward inferences through a randomly initialized network and does not involve training network parameters. We then propose a NAS algorithm called Zen-NAS, which maximizes the Zen-Score of the target network within given inference budgets. With less than half a GPU day, Zen-NAS can efficiently search for high-performance architectures without requiring data. Compared to previous NAS methods, Zen-NAS is significantly faster and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on platforms such as ImageNet. The code for searching and training, as well as pre-trained models, are available at https://github.com/idstcv/ZenNAS.
