The task of reasoning 3D shapes from 2D images is difficult, especially when only single-view images are available. However, objects often consist of simpler geometric parts, making them easier to model. These parts also provide a robust representation that is not affected by appearance variations across objects in the same category. This study addresses the problem of discovering 3D parts from 2D image collections without relying on manual annotations. Instead, a self-supervised approach called latent part discovery (LPD) is proposed. The key idea is to learn a part shape prior that allows each part to accurately fit an object shape while maintaining simple geometry. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method successfully discovers consistent object parts and achieves favorable reconstruction accuracy compared to existing methods with similar levels of supervision.
