We present a new approach for estimating depth from a single image by incorporating surface normal constraints. Existing methods for depth estimation often lack geometric constraints or struggle to accurately capture geometric context, resulting in lower quality depth estimates. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method called Adaptive Surface Normal (ASN) constraint, which correlates depth estimation with geometric consistency. Our approach adaptively determines reliable local geometry from a set of randomly sampled candidates to derive surface normal constraints. We measure the consistency of the geometric contextual features to ensure accurate reconstruction of the 3D geometry and robustness to variations in local shape such as boundaries, sharp corners, and noise. Through extensive evaluations and comparisons using public datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
