Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation has been extensively researched to address the domain gap between labeled source data and unlabeled target data. However, UDA still falls short of achieving fully supervised performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a strategy called Labeling Only if Required (La-bOR) that incorporates a human-in-the-loop approach. La-bOR adaptively assigns scarce labels to points that the UDA model is uncertain about. To identify these uncertain points, we employ an adaptive pixel selector to generate an inconsistency mask. We then label the regions corresponding to these segments, which we refer to as Segment based Pixel-Labeling (SPL), achieving near supervised performance with only a small fraction (approximately 2.2%) of ground truth points. To further reduce the burden on human annotators, we introduce Point based Pixel-Labeling (PPL), which identifies the most representative points for labeling within the inconsistency mask. This reduces the labeling efforts from 2.2% segment labels to 40 points labels while minimizing performance degradation. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate the advantages of this novel framework for domain adaptive semantic segmentation, while also minimizing human labor costs.
