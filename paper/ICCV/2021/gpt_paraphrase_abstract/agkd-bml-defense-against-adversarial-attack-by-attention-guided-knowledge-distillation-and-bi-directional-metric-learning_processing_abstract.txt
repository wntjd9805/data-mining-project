We introduce a new model called AGKD-BML that utilizes adversarial training to improve the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks. The model incorporates attention knowledge from a pre-trained "teacher" model to guide the training of a "student" model on adversarial examples. By focusing on the correct regions and correcting corrupted features, the student model achieves higher accuracy. Additionally, we propose a bidirectional metric learning approach to regularize the representation in feature space. This involves attacking a clean image to its most confusing class and then attacking a clean image from that class back to the original class. The representation distance between the original image and its adversarial example is minimized, while the distance between the forward and backward adversarial examples is maximized using a triplet loss. We evaluate the AGKD-BML model on two popular datasets with various attacks and consistently outperform existing state-of-the-art methods. The code for AGKD-BML is available at the provided GitHub link.
