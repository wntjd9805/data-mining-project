We introduce the StereOBJ-1M dataset, a comprehensive collection of stereo RGB images for estimating object pose. This dataset is specifically designed to tackle difficult scenarios such as object transparency, translucency, and specular reflection, in addition to common challenges like occlusion, symmetry, and variations in lighting and environments. To ensure that we have enough data for modern deep learning models, we have developed a new method for efficiently annotating pose data in a multi-view approach, enabling data collection in complex and adaptable settings. With complete annotations of 6D object poses, our dataset comprises over 396,000 frames and more than 1.5 million annotations of 18 objects captured in 183 scenes across 11 different environments. These objects encompass 8 symmetric objects, 7 transparent objects, and 8 reflective objects. We utilize two cutting-edge pose estimation frameworks as baselines for future research, evaluating their performance on the StereOBJ-1M dataset. Furthermore, we propose a novel technique for optimizing object-level pose by computing 6D pose from keypoint predictions obtained from multiple images.
