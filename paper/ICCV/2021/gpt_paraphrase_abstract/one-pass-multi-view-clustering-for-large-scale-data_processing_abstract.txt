Current multi-view clustering algorithms based on non-negative matrix factorization compute multiple coefficient matrices for different data views and learn a common consensus. However, the final partition is obtained using classical clustering techniques like k-means, which limits the discriminative embedding. Additionally, this two-step procedure fails to effectively integrate multi-view matrix factorization with partition generation, resulting in poor performance. To address these issues, we propose a one-pass multi-view clustering algorithm that removes the non-negativity constraint and jointly optimizes the two steps. This allows the generated partition to guide multi-view matrix factorization, producing more purposeful coefficient matrices and improving the quality of the partition. We solve the resulting optimization problem using an alternate strategy that is theoretically guaranteed to converge. The proposed algorithm is parameter-free and has linear complexity, making it practical for applications. Furthermore, we compare our algorithm with recent advances in the literature on benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness, superiority, and efficiency.
