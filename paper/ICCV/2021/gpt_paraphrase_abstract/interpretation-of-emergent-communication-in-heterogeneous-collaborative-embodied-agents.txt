The use of communication between AI agents has gained attention, but it remains unclear if the learned communication is understandable and based on perception. To investigate this, we introduce the CoMON task where an oracle agent with environment information communicates with a navigator agent who visually perceives the environment to find goals. Effective communication is crucial for success in this task, making it suitable for studying different communication mechanisms between agents with different capabilities. We examine two common communication mechanisms and analyze their patterns from an egocentric and spatial perspective. Our findings demonstrate that the emergent communication is grounded in agent observations and the spatial structure of the environment.
