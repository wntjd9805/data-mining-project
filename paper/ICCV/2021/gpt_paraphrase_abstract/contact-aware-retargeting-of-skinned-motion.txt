This paper presents a new approach to motion retargeting that addresses the preservation of self-contacts and prevention of interpenetration. Self-contacts, such as when different body parts touch each other, are important aspects of human body language, but existing methods do not adequately model or preserve these contacts. Interpenetration, where body parts pass through each other, is a common issue in motion estimation methods. The proposed method takes as input a human motion sequence, a target skeleton, and character geometry. It identifies self-contacts and ground contacts in the input motion and optimizes the motion to be applied to the output skeleton while maintaining these contacts and minimizing interpenetration. To achieve efficient retargeting while satisfying contact constraints, a novel geometry-conditioned recurrent network with an encoder-space optimization strategy is introduced. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous methods quantitatively, and a user study confirms that the retargeted motions are considered higher-quality compared to recent works. Additionally, the method is shown to generalize to motion estimated from human videos, improving upon previous works that exhibit noticeable interpenetration.
