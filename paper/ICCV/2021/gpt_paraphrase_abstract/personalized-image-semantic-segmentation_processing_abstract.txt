In recent years, there has been significant progress in semantic segmentation models trained on public datasets. However, these models have not addressed the issue of personalization in segmentation, despite its practical importance. This paper aims to tackle the problem of personalized image segmentation by exploring the personalized characteristics of the data to achieve more accurate segmentation results for unlabeled personalized images. To facilitate further research in this field, we have created a large dataset called PSS (Personalized Semantic Segmentation) that contains personalized images from various users. We also review recent studies related to this problem and evaluate their performance on our dataset. Additionally, we propose a baseline method that considers the inter-image context when segmenting specific images by examining the correlation among a user's personalized images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches on the proposed dataset. The code and the PSS dataset can be accessed at https://mmcheng.net/pss/.
