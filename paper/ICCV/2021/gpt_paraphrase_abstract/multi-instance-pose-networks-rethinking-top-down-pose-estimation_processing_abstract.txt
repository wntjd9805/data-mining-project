Current top-down human pose estimation methods are limited by their assumption of a single person/instance in the input bounding box, which leads to failures in crowded scenes with occlusions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel solution called the Multi-Instance Pose Network (MIPNet) that can predict multiple 2D pose instances within a given bounding box. Our approach incorporates a Multi-Instance Modulation Block (MIMB) that can adaptively adjust channel-wise feature responses for each instance, while also being parameter efficient. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on various datasets including COCO, CrowdPose, and OCHuman. Our results show that MIPNet achieves significant improvements over previous approaches, with 70.0 Average Precision (AP) on CrowdPose and 42.5 AP on OCHuman test sets, which are improvements of 2.4 AP and 6.5 AP, respectively. When using ground truth bounding boxes for inference, MIPNet outperforms HRNet with an improvement of 0.7 AP on COCO, 0.9 AP on CrowdPose, and 9.1 AP on OCHuman validation sets. Interestingly, when fewer high confidence bounding boxes are used, HRNet's performance degrades by 5 AP on OCHuman, while MIPNet maintains relatively stable performance with only a 1 AP drop for the same inputs.
