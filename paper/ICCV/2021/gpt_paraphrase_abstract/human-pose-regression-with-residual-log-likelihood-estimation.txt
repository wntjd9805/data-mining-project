Heatmap-based methods are commonly used in human pose estimation to model the output distribution through likelihood heatmaps. However, regression-based methods, while more efficient, tend to have lower performance. In this study, we propose a regression-based method that utilizes maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Different regression losses are used to make assumptions about the output density function, with the goal of achieving a distribution closer to the true distribution for better regression performance. We introduce a novel regression paradigm called Residual Log-likelihood Estimation (RLE), which captures the underlying output distribution by learning the change in distribution instead of the unreferenced underlying distribution. Our method is compatible with off-the-shelf flow models and is shown to be effective, efficient, and flexible in various human pose estimation tasks through comprehensive experiments. Compared to conventional regression methods, our regression with RLE achieves a 12.4 mAP improvement on MSCOCO without any overhead during testing. Notably, our regression method outperforms heatmap-based methods, particularly in multi-person pose estimation.
