In this study, we aim to enhance the understanding of the dynamic nature of video salient object detection (VSOD) and address two key questions: how can a model adapt to dynamic variations and perceive subtle differences in the real-world environment, and how can temporal dynamics be effectively incorporated into spatial information over time? To tackle these challenges, we propose a dynamic context-sensitive filtering network (DCFNet) that consists of a dynamic context-sensitive filtering module (DCFM) and a bidirectional dynamic fusion strategy. The DCFM introduces a new approach to generate dynamic filters by extracting location-related affinities between consecutive frames. Our bidirectional dynamic fusion strategy promotes the interaction of spatial and temporal information in a dynamic manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on most VSOD datasets, while maintaining a real-time speed of 28 frames per second. The source code for our approach is publicly available at https://github.com/OIPLab-DUT/DCFNet.
