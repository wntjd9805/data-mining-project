Conventional semantic segmentation networks struggle to accurately detect objects that are outside of their training data, which is crucial for applications like autonomous driving. To address this limitation, we propose an open world semantic segmentation system consisting of two modules: (1) an open-set semantic segmentation module that can identify both known and unknown objects, and (2) an incremental few-shot learning module that gradually incorporates the unknown objects into the model's knowledge base. This system mimics human behavior by detecting unknown objects and learning them with appropriate supervision. We utilize the Deep Metric Learning Network (DMLNet) with contrastive clustering for open-set semantic segmentation, which outperforms other methods on challenging open-set semantic segmentation datasets without the need for additional data or generative models. Furthermore, we introduce two incremental few-shot learning methods to enhance the DMLNet by leveraging annotations of the unknown objects.
