This paper suggests a solution to the practical problem of developing a universal model for crowd counting that can be applied across different scenes and datasets. The main issue with existing crowd counters is their sensitivity to scale shift, which is a common occurrence in real-world scenarios due to variations in scene layouts and image resolutions. This makes it challenging to train a model that can be universally applied. To address this problem, the authors propose a scale alignment module as a key component of a new crowd counting framework. They present a closed-form solution for determining the optimal image rescaling factors by minimizing the distances between their scale distributions. Additionally, they introduce a novel neural network and loss function based on the sliced Wasserstein distance for estimating scale distribution. Through their proposed method, they have developed a universal model that performs well on multiple datasets and even outperforms state-of-the-art models specifically fine-tuned for each dataset. Experimental results also demonstrate the improved generalizability of their model to unseen scenes.
