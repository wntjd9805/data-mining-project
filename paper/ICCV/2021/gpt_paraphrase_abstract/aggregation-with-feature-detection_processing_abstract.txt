Aggregating features from different depths of a network is a common practice to enhance the network's capability. Many modern architectures use skip connections to facilitate this feature aggregation. However, there are inconsistencies and incompatibilities that arise due to the different semantic meanings of these features. Existing methods typically blend deep features through element-wise summation or concatenation with a convolution. This paper proposes a novel feature aggregation method called DEtect-rePLAce (DEPLA) that goes beyond summation or concatenation. DEPLA detects and identifies areas in one layer that need to be updated and replaces the feature at those locations with information from another layer. This process ensures that inconsistent patterns are avoided while preserving useful information in the merged outputs. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DEPLA in improving various baseline models such as ResNet, FishNet, and FPN across three major vision tasks: ImageNet classification, MS COCO object detection, and instance segmentation.
