This paper introduces the concept of graph feature pyramid networks, which adapt their structure to different image characteristics and enable feature interactions across multiple scales. The authors propose a superpixel hierarchy to represent intrinsic image structures, from which the graph feature pyramid network derives its structure. The network includes contextual and hierarchical layers for feature interactions within and across scales. To enhance these layers, the authors introduce two types of local channel attention for graph neural networks. The graph feature pyramid network is then integrated into the Faster R-CNN algorithm for object detection. Experimental results show that this modified algorithm outperforms previous feature pyramid based methods and other popular detection methods on both MS-COCO 2017 validation and test datasets.
