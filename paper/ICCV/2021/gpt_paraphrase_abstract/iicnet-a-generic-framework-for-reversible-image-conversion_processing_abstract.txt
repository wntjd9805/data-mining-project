This study introduces Invertible Image Conversion Net (IIC-Net), a versatile solution for reversible image conversion (RIC) tasks. Unlike previous encoder-decoder methods, IIC-Net is designed with an invertible neural net structure to better preserve information during conversion. The network incorporates a relation module and a channel squeeze layer to enhance nonlinearity and extract cross-image relations, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that IIC-Net outperforms task-specific methods in existing RIC tasks and can also adapt well to new tasks. The advantage of IIC-Net is that it eliminates the need for hand-engineered embedding networks for rapidly occurring visual content. The source codes for IIC-Net are publicly available.
