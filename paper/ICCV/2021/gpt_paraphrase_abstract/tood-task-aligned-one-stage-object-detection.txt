We propose a Task-aligned One-stage Object Detection (TOOD) method that aligns the tasks of object classification and localization in a learning-based manner. Our approach includes a novel Task-aligned Head (T-Head) that effectively balances learning task-interactive and task-specific features, allowing for greater flexibility in learning the alignment. Additionally, we introduce Task Alignment Learning (TAL) to explicitly align the optimal anchors for the two tasks during training, using a sample assignment scheme and a task-aligned loss. Our experiments on MS-COCO dataset show that TOOD achieves a significantly higher average precision (AP) of 51.1 compared to recent one-stage detectors such as ATSS, GFL, and PAA. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of TOOD in better aligning object classification and localization through qualitative results. The code for TOOD is available at https://github.com/fcjian/TOOD.
