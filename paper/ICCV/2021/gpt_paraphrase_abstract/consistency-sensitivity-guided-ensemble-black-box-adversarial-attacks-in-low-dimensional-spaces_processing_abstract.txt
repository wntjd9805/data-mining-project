Black-box attacks aim to generate adversarial noise that can cause a deep neural network to fail. The main challenge in designing black-box attack methods is to estimate and understand the target model based on the feedback received from queries sent to it. The ultimate goal is to minimize the number of queries required for a successful attack. However, existing attack methods search and refine the adversarial noise in a high-dimensional space, which necessitates hundreds or even thousands of queries to the target network. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new approach called the Consistency and Sensitivity Guided Ensemble Attack (CSEA) method, which operates in a low-dimensional space. In this method, we estimate the target model in the black box by using a linear composition of an ensemble of surrogate models with different network structures. These surrogate models employ random block masks on the input image to jointly create and submit randomized and sparsified queries to the target model. By utilizing the results of these queries and following a consistency constraint, the surrogate models can be trained using only a small number of queries. This training allows the surrogate models to accurately approximate the target model in the high-dimensional space. Additionally, the randomized and sparsified queries provide valuable information for constructing an attack sensitivity map for the input image. This map helps in refining the adversarial attack locally, thereby increasing its success rate. Through extensive experiments, we have shown that our proposed approach significantly reduces the number of queries required to attack the target network while maintaining a high success rate. It outperforms existing black-box attack methods by a considerable margin.
