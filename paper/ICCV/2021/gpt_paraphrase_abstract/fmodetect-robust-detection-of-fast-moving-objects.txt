We present a novel approach for detecting fast moving objects through a learning-based method. These objects are often blurred and cover extensive distances within a single video frame. The detection of fast moving objects involves addressing both deblurring and matting challenges, collectively known as deblatting. By separating deblatting into consecutive matting and deblurring processes, we achieve real-time performance, resulting in a significant speed improvement. This advancement opens up possibilities for new applications.  Our proposed method detects fast moving objects by utilizing a truncated distance function to the object's trajectory. To accomplish this, we train our model using synthetic data. For accurate trajectory estimation and sharp appearance estimation, we introduce a matting and fitting network. This network estimates the blurred appearance of the object without the background, followed by energy minimization-based deblurring.  In terms of performance, our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in various aspects such as recall, precision, trajectory estimation, and sharp appearance reconstruction. Additionally, our approach offers a substantial speed advantage compared to other methods like deblatting. This speed improvement enables real-time fast moving object detection and retrieval in large video collections.  In summary, we propose a learning-based approach for fast moving object detection, which combines deblurring and matting techniques. Our method achieves real-time performance and surpasses existing methods in terms of accuracy and speed. This advancement opens up possibilities for real-time application scenarios and efficient analysis of large video datasets.
