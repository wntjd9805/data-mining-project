Colorization has become a popular research topic, with traditional methods relying on external color images for satisfactory results. However, these methods require a large image database or online search engine to retrieve suitable exemplars. Recent deep-learning-based approaches offer a more cost-effective solution but often produce unsatisfactory artifacts and inconsistent colors. In this study, we propose a method that leverages the rich color priors stored in a pretrained Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to recover vivid colors. Our approach involves retrieving matching features through a GAN encoder and incorporating them into the colorization process using feature modulations. The use of a powerful generative color prior and careful design allows our method to produce vibrant colors in a single pass. Additionally, our method offers convenient access to diverse results by modifying GAN latent codes. It also inherits the advantageous interpretability and controllability of GANs, enabling smooth transitions through the GAN latent space. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to previous approaches.
