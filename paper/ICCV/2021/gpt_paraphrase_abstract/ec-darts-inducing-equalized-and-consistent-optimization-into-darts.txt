Differential architecture search (DARTS) is efficient in finding high-performance architectures, but it suffers from issues such as model collapse due to unbalanced competition among operations with different trainable parameters, and inconsistent structures between the search and retraining stages. These issues are referred to as operation gap and structure gap in DARTS. To address these gaps, we propose a method called equalized and consistent differential architecture search (EC-DARTS). EC-DARTS optimizes operation weights based on their categories to shrink the operation gap. Additionally, we introduce an induced structural transition to bridge the structure gap between the model structures in the search and retraining stages. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10 and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a test error of 2.39% on CIFAR10 with only 0.3 GPU days on NVIDIA TITAN V, and a top-1 error of 23.6% on ImageNet under the mobile setting.
