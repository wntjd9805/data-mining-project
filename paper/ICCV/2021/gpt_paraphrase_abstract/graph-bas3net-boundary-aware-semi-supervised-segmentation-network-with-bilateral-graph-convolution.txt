Semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have gained significant attention in medical image segmentation as they can leverage unlabeled data to overcome the challenges of acquiring large amounts of pixel-wise annotated samples. However, many existing SSL methods overlook the importance of geometric shape constraints in objects, resulting in unsatisfactory boundary delineation and non-smooth object segmentation. To address this issue, we propose a novel SSL network called Graph-BAS3Net that incorporates boundary information and learns the relationship between semantics and geometry in the graph domain. Our approach consists of two components: BAS3Net, a multi-task learning framework that enhances GAN-based SSL by including a boundary detection task for encoding richer object shape and surface features, and BGCM, a graph-based cross-task module that explores co-occurrence relations between semantic segmentation and boundary detection tasks to enable the network to learn stronger semantic and geometric correspondences from both labeled and unlabeled data. Experimental results on the LiTS dataset and COVID-19 dataset demonstrate that our proposed Graph-BAS3Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods in semi-supervised segmentation tasks.
