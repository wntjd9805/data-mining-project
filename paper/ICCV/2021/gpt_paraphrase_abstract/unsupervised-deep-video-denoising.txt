We propose a new method, called Unsupervised Deep Video Denoiser (UDVD1), for training deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for video denoising without the need for clean videos. This is particularly useful in applications like microscopy where noiseless videos are not available. UDVD1 achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised methods, even when trained on a single short noisy video. We demonstrate its effectiveness in denoising various types of real-world imaging data, including raw video, fluorescence-microscopy, and electron-microscopy data.Unlike current approaches, UDVD1 does not require explicit motion compensation, which is computationally expensive and unreliable when dealing with noisy input data. Through a gradient-based analysis, we find that UDVD1 automatically adapts to local motion in the noisy videos, allowing it to perform implicit motion compensation. This is a significant advantage as the network is trained solely for denoising but still learns to handle motion effectively.
