Marine debris poses a significant threat to marine life and the overall ecosystem due to pollution. To prevent waste from reaching the ocean, it is beneficial to clean up floating debris in inland waters using autonomous cleaning devices such as unmanned surface vehicles. However, achieving effective cleaning relies on a precise and resilient object detection system. This is challenging due to the small size of the target, intense light reflection on the water's surface, and reflections from objects on the banks. To facilitate the practical application of autonomous floating waste cleaning, we introduce FloWâ€ , the first dataset for detecting floating waste in inland water areas. The dataset consists of two parts: FloW-Img, an image sub-dataset, and FloW-RI, a multimodal sub-dataset containing synchronized millimeter wave radar data and images. Accurate annotations are provided for both the images and radar data, enabling the development of floating waste detection strategies based on either image or radar data, as well as the fusion of both sensors. We conducted several baseline experiments on our dataset, testing vision-based and radar-based detection methods. The results indicate that the detection accuracy is relatively low and that floating waste detection remains a challenging task.
