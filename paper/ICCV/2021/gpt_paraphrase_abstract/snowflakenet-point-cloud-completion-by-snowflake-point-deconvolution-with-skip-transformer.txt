SnowflakeNet with Snowflake Point Deconvolution (SPD) is proposed as a solution for point cloud completion. Previous methods have struggled with the discrete nature of point clouds and unstructured predictions, leading to a lack of fine local geometric details in the completed shape. SnowflakeNet addresses this issue by modeling the generation of complete point clouds as a snowflake-like growth of points in 3D space. Child points are progressively generated by splitting their parent points after each SPD. To capture detailed geometry, skip-transformer is introduced in SPD to learn point splitting patterns that best fit local regions. This skip-transformer utilizes an attention mechanism to summarize splitting patterns from previous SPD layers and produce the splitting in the current layer. The locally compact and structured point cloud generated by SPD accurately captures the structure characteristic of 3D shapes in local patches, allowing the network to predict highly detailed geometries including smooth regions, sharp edges, and corners. Experimental results demonstrate that SnowflakeNet outperforms existing point cloud completion methods on commonly used benchmarks.
