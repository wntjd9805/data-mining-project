Annotating object segmentation masks manually is a time-consuming task. Interactive segmentation methods provide a more efficient alternative but are not affordable at a large scale due to their linearly growing cost with the number of annotated masks. To address this issue, we propose a highly efficient annotation scheme for creating large datasets with object segmentation masks. We leverage the similarities in appearance among object instances in large-scale images by employing hierarchical clustering on mask predictions generated by a segmentation model. Our scheme involves searching through the hierarchy of clusters and selecting which clusters to annotate. Only a few masks per cluster are manually verified by humans, and the labels are then propagated to the entire cluster. We conducted a large-scale experiment to generate 1 million object segmentation masks for 80 object classes on unlabeled images. The results demonstrate that: (1) we obtain 1 million masks with a total annotation time of only 290 hours; (2) our annotation time is reduced by 76 times compared to manual annotation; and (3) the quality of our masks is comparable to those from manually annotated datasets. The code, data, and models used in our study are available online.
