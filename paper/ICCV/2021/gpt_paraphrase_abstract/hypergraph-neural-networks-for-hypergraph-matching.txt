Hypergraph matching involves finding feature correspondence by considering higher-order structural information. Deep learning has shown significant progress in graph matching, indicating its potential for hypergraphs. This paper introduces the first unified hypergraph neural network (HNN) solution for hypergraph matching. The approach involves constructing an association hypergraph from the two hypergraphs to be matched and transforming the matching problem into a node classification problem on the association hypergraph. A novel hypergraph neural network is designed to effectively solve the node classification problem. The proposed method, named HNN-HM, is end-to-end trainable and improves optimization by jointly learning all its components. Experimental evaluation on various benchmarks demonstrates that HNN-HM outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
