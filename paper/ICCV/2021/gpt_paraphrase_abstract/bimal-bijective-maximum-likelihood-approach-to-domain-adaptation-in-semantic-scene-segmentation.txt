Semantic segmentation, which involves assigning labels to individual pixels, is a widely used technique in computer vision applications. While fully supervised segmentation methods have achieved impressive accuracy on large datasets, they struggle to perform well in new environments or domains. In this study, we introduce an Un-aligned Domain Score to assess the effectiveness of a model on a new target domain without any supervision. Additionally, we propose a new loss function called Bijective Maximum Likelihood (BiMaL), which is a more generalized version of Adversarial Entropy Minimization that does not make any assumptions about pixel independence. We evaluate BiMaL on two different domains and find that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on empirical experiments involving "SYNTHIA to Cityscapes," "GTA5 to Cityscapes," and "SYNTHIA to Vistas" datasets.
