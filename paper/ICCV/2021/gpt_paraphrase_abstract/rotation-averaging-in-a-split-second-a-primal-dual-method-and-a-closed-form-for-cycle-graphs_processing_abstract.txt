A fundamental aspect of geometric reconstruction is rotation averaging, which aims to find the best set of absolute rotations that can explain a given set of relative orientations. This process is crucial in bundle adjustment and structure-from-motion, but it poses challenges due to its non-convexity and high dimensionality. In this study, we approach rotation averaging using a maximum likelihood estimation approach and provide two contributions. Firstly, we introduce a new primal-dual method that does not require initialization and demonstrate its ability to converge to the global optimum through empirical analysis. Additionally, we derive the first optimal closed-form solution for rotation averaging in cycle graphs, placing this achievement within the context of spectral graph theory. Our proposed methods significantly improve both precision and performance in rotation averaging.
