Lesion segmentation in medical imaging has been a significant focus in clinical research. Various algorithms have been proposed to detect and segment lesions, with deep learning-based approaches showing notable improvements over traditional methods. However, most advanced deep learning methods necessitate the manual design of multiple network components and training strategies. To address this issue, we present T-AutoML, an automated machine learning algorithm. T-AutoML not only searches for the optimal neural architecture but also identifies the best combination of hyperparameters and data augmentation strategies simultaneously. Our proposed method utilizes the modern transformer model, which adapts to the dynamic length of the search space embedding and greatly enhances the search capability. We validate T-AutoML on multiple large-scale public lesion segmentation datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance.
