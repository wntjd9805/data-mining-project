Unsupervised person re-identification (Re-ID) is a challenging task due to the absence of ground-truth labels. Existing methods rely on estimated pseudo labels obtained through iterative clustering and classification, which are prone to performance penalties caused by inaccurate cluster estimations. In this study, we propose a new method called Meta Pairwise Relationship Distillation (MPRD) to estimate pseudo labels for unsupervised person Re-ID. MPRD consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). The GCN estimates pseudo labels based on the current features extracted by the CNN, while the CNN improves its feature learning by incorporating high-quality positive and negative sample pairs provided by the GCN. To facilitate this process, a small set of labeled samples is used to guide the training of the GCN, enabling it to distill meta knowledge and discern the differences in the neighborhood structure between positive and negative sample pairs. Our experiments on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17 datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art approaches.
