The task of computing dense pixel-to-pixel image correspondences is a crucial aspect of computer vision. Typically, this involves aligning images from the same semantic category for manipulation or segmentation purposes. However, existing deep learning alignment methods lack the ability to cluster images, requiring a separate and costly step. In this study, we propose a multi-task model called Jim-Net that can cluster and align images directly, without the need for pixel-level or image-level annotations. We develop an unsupervised training algorithm for pair-matching alignment, selectively matching and aligning image pairs from the clustering branch. Our unsupervised Jim-Net achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art supervised methods on the PF-PASCAL benchmark dataset for 2D image alignment. We also apply Jim-Net to cryo-electron tomography, a 3D microscopy imaging technique, and demonstrate its effectiveness in discovering and recovering representative macromolecular structures in situ. This capability is vital for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cellular functions. To the best of our knowledge, Jim-Net is the first end-to-end model that can simultaneously align and cluster images, significantly enhancing performance compared to performing each task individually.
