This study focuses on the challenging task of inpainting man-made scenes, specifically in preserving visual patterns such as edges, lines, and junctions. Previous attempts at restoring object/building structures in man-made scene images have been unsuccessful. To address this, the paper proposes learning a SketchTensor (ST) space for inpainting man-made scenes. This space enables the restoration of edges, lines, and junctions, leading to reliable predictions of overall image structures. To refine the structures, a Multi-scale Sketch Tensor inpainting (MST) network with an innovative encoder-decoder structure is proposed. The encoder extracts lines and edges from input images and projects them into the ST space, while the decoder learns to restore the input images. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed model. Additionally, the model demonstrates competitive performance in inpainting general nature images compared to other methods.
