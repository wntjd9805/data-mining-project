This study focuses on the issue that current single image super-resolution (SISR) methods only address high definition (HD) images and neglect ultra-high definition (UHD) images such as 4K and 8K resolution. To evaluate the performance of existing SISR methods on UHD images, the researchers introduce two large-scale image datasets, UHDSR4K and UHDSR8K, and use 70,000 V100 GPU hours of training to benchmark these methods under seven different settings. The purpose is to establish a set of baseline models for UHD image super-resolution. Additionally, the researchers propose a baseline model called Mesh Attention Network (MANet) for SISR. The MANet incorporates the attention mechanism in both horizontal (different depths) and vertical (different levels of receptive field) directions to learn correlations among feature maps, enabling the network to focus on more important features. Overall, this study aims to address the lack of SISR methods for UHD images and provide a benchmark for future research in this area.
