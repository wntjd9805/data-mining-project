The use of self-training for semi-supervised semantic segmentation has made significant progress. However, a major drawback is the imbalance in class distribution within real-world semantic segmentation datasets, which leads to biased pseudo-labeled data favoring majority classes. This paper introduces a straightforward yet effective method called Distribution Alignment and Random Sampling (DARS) to address this issue. DARS generates unbiased pseudo labels that align with the true class distribution estimated from the labeled data. Additionally, the paper proposes a progressive data augmentation and labeling strategy to enhance model training using pseudo-labeled data. Experimental results on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Despite its simplicity, our method performs competitively compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code for implementing DARS can be found at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/DARS.
