Multi-label image recognition is a challenging problem in computer vision that is often addressed using complex methods and heavy computations, making it difficult to understand and interpret the results. In this paper, we propose a simple module called class-specific residual attention (CSRA) to effectively capture different spatial regions occupied by objects from different categories. CSRA generates class-specific features for each category by using a simple spatial attention score and combines it with the class-agnostic average pooling feature. Despite its simplicity, CSRA achieves state-of-the-art results in multi-label recognition tasks. Additionally, CSRA is easy to implement, computationally efficient, and provides intuitive explanations and visualizations. Impressively, using only 4 lines of code, CSRA consistently improves the performance of various pretrained models and datasets without requiring additional training.
