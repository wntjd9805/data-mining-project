The use of wide-angle lenses has become increasingly popular due to their ability to capture a wide field-of-view scene. However, these lenses often produce images with radial distortion, which makes the scene look unrealistic. Previous methods for correcting this distortion have focused on rectifying the image within a rectangle or invagination, but this approach fails to display the complete content and regular shape simultaneously.In this paper, we propose a new method called Rectification OutPainting (ROP) that aims to extrapolate the coherent semantics of the scene into the blank areas, creating a wider field-of-view beyond the original wide-angle lens. To overcome challenges such as variable painting regions and curve boundaries, we design a rectification module that rectifies the image with geometry supervision. The extrapolated results are generated using a dual conditional expansion strategy.To ensure local consistency, we introduce a curve-aware correlation measurement that focuses on the generated region. This helps enforce the regular shape of the rectification construction. We believe that our approach is the first to address the challenging task of rectification through outpainting, and our curve-aware strategy ensures a rectification construction with complete content and regular shape.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ROP method outperforms other state-of-the-art solutions.
