This paper proposes a new solution for semi-supervised video object segmentation using object-matching. Existing methods focus on matching object features between frames, but fail to address two key issues: incomplete annotation due to unseen parts of the object and misalignment caused by changes in object position. To overcome these challenges, the authors introduce an object-based dynamic memory network that utilizes information from all past frames. Additionally, an adaptive object alignment module is proposed to address misalignment by incorporating a region translation function. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets with efficient inference time. The code for this method is available at the provided GitHub link.
