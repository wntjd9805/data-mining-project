Neural volumetric representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have become popular for creating realistic 3D scenes from images. However, the computational requirements of NeRF make it unsuitable for real-time applications. To address this, we propose a method called Sparse Neural Radiance Grid (SNeRG) that allows for real-time rendering on regular hardware. We achieve this by modifying NeRF's architecture and using a sparse voxel grid representation with learned feature vectors. The resulting representation maintains NeRF's ability to render fine details and view-dependent appearance, while being compact (less than 90 MB per scene) and capable of real-time rendering (over 30 frames per second on a laptop GPU). We provide screen captures of our results in the accompanying video.
