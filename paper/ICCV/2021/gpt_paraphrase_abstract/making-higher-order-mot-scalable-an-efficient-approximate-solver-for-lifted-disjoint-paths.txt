We introduce a highly efficient solver for the lifted disjoint paths problem (LDP), which is a challenging model for multiple object tracking (MOT). Our solver is able to handle large MOT instances from crowded and lengthy MOT sequences. By using an approximate solving approach, we are able to process the MOT15/16/17 benchmarks without compromising the quality of the solutions. Additionally, our solver allows for solving the MOT20 benchmark, which was previously considered too large and complex for LDP solvers. Our solver performs as well as, or even better than, current state-of-the-art methods, including an optimal LDP solver, on all four standard MOT benchmarks.
