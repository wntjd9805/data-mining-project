Current few-shot classification methods primarily focus on generalization within a single dataset, lacking the ability to transfer knowledge across different domains. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a more realistic multi-domain few-shot classification problem to investigate cross-domain generalization. This new setting presents two main challenges: (1) generating efficient multi-domain feature representations and (2) exploring domain correlations to improve cross-domain generalization. To tackle these challenges, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-mode modulator. This modulator is designed to maintain multiple modulation parameters for each domain within a single network, enabling the creation of a single-network multi-domain representation. By employing a well-designed separative selection module and cooperative query module, domain-aware features can be efficiently generated for a specific domain. Additionally, we divide the modulation parameters into a domain-specific set and a domain-cooperative set to leverage intra-domain information and inter-domain correlations, respectively. The intra-domain information captures individual domain characteristics to prevent negative interference, while the inter-domain correlations facilitate information sharing between relevant domains to enhance their representation. Furthermore, these correlations can be utilized by unseen domains to adaptively combine information from seen domains for extrapolation. Experimental results on the challenging META-DATASET benchmark demonstrate that our proposed multi-mode modulator achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly for unseen test domains.
