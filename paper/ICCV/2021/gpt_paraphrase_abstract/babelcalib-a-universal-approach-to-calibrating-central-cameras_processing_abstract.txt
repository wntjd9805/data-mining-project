Current calibration methods for large field-of-view cameras can be unreliable due to the non-linearity of the problem and the lack of accurate initial values for all camera parameters. This can be a result of using a simpler projection model or having a poor initial estimate for the internal parameters. To overcome these challenges, we propose a two-step approach: first, calibrating the parameters using a back-projection model, and then regressing the parameters for a desired forward model. We also incorporate a robust estimation framework to handle outliers in the data. Extensive experiments show that our method is highly reliable and provides the most accurate calibration parameters for absolute pose estimation. The code for our approach is available at https://github.com/ylochman/babelcalib.
