To improve the efficiency of super-resolution (SR) models without sacrificing performance, we propose novel loss functions. These functions enable high-quality SR from more efficient models. To fully utilize the representative power of a low-complexity generator network, we apply our proposed loss functions. Specifically, we use a Fourier space supervision loss to restore missing high-frequency content and design a discriminator architecture in the Fourier domain to match the target high-frequency distribution. Our loss functions, which directly emphasize frequencies in Fourier space, significantly enhance the perceptual image quality while maintaining high restoration quality compared to previous methods. By combining spatial and frequency domain losses, we further improve performance as both representations provide complementary information. Our trained generator achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art perceptual SR methods, such as RankSRGAN and SRFlow, while being 2.4× and 48× faster respectively.
