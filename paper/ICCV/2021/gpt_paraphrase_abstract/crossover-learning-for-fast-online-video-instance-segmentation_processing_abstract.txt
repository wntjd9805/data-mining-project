This paper introduces CrossVIS, a fast online model for video instance segmentation (VIS) and other video understanding tasks. The model utilizes a novel crossover learning scheme to model temporal visual context across frames. Instead of using additional network parameters, crossover learning utilizes instance features in the current frame to localize the same instance in other frames at the pixel level. This approach, combined with the instance segmentation loss, enables efficient cross-frame instance-to-pixel relation learning without increasing computational cost during inference. Additionally, the paper proposes a global balanced instance embedding branch to improve online instance association. The proposed methods are evaluated on three challenging VIS benchmarks, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in online VIS with a good balance between latency and accuracy.
