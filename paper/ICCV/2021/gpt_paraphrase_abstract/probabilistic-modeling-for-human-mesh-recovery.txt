This study addresses the challenge of reconstructing a 3D human figure using 2D evidence. While most previous works overlook the inherent uncertainty in this problem and provide a single estimation, we propose a different approach. We embrace the ambiguity in reconstruction and reframe the problem as learning a mapping from input to a distribution of plausible 3D poses. Our method utilizes the normalizing flows model, offering several advantages. For typical applications requiring a single 3D estimate, our formulation allows for efficient mode computation, achieving performance comparable to deterministic unimodal regression models. Additionally, by considering the likelihood of each sample, our model proves useful in various downstream tasks. These tasks include reconstructing from multiple uncalibrated views and fitting a human model, where our model serves as a powerful image-based prior for mesh recovery. Our results highlight the significance of probabilistic modeling and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in diverse scenarios.
