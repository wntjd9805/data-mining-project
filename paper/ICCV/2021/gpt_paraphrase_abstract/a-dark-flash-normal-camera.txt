The problem of estimating surface normal and reflectance maps in casual photography is addressed in this study. Uncontrolled lighting conditions often result in low-quality images and hinder downstream processing. To overcome this, the researchers propose the use of a single near infrared (NIR) light source and camera, referred to as a "dark flash image," in addition to the visible illumination. By combining a color image captured under arbitrary visible lighting and a dark flash image captured under controlled front-lit NIR lighting, the method computes a normal map, a diffuse albedo map, and a specular intensity map of the scene. Since obtaining ground truth normal and reflectance maps of faces is challenging, a novel training technique is proposed. This technique combines information from two easily accessible sources: a stereo depth signal and photometric shading cues. The method is evaluated across various subjects and lighting conditions, and its applications include optimizing stereo geometry and filling shadows in an image.
