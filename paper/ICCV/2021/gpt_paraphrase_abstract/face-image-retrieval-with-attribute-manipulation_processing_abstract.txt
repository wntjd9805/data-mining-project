The current solutions for face image retrieval are limited because they do not consider different facial attributes separately and cannot incorporate user preferences for specific attributes. This paper proposes a new framework for face image retrieval that allows users to specify desired modifications to facial attributes and assign different levels of importance to each attribute. The framework disentangles the semantics of various attributes by learning sparse and orthogonal basis vectors in the latent space of StyleGAN. These basis vectors are then used to decompose the dissimilarity between face images based on attribute dissimilarity, assign attribute preferences, and adjust attributes in the query. The sparsity and orthogonality of the basis vectors enable independent adjustment of each attribute and facilitate preference assignment and dissimilarity decomposition. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by achieving state-of-the-art results in face image retrieval.
