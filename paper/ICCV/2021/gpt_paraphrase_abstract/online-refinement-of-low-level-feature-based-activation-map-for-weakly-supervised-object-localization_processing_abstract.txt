We propose a novel two-stage learning approach for weakly supervised object localization (WSOL). Unlike previous methods that utilize high-level feature based Class Activation Maps (CAMs), we introduce a strategy that utilizes low-level feature based activation maps to localize objects. In the first stage, an activation map generator is employed to produce activation maps using the low-level feature maps in the classifier. This inclusion of rich contextual object information enhances the localization process. In the second stage, an evaluator is utilized to assess the activation maps generated by the activation map generator. To reduce uncertainty between object and background activations and explore less discriminative regions, we introduce a weighted entropy loss, an attentive erasing technique, and an area loss. By preserving low-level object information in the first stage, our second stage model gradually generates a well-separated, complete, and compact activation map of the object in the image. This activation map can be easily thresholded for precise localization. Our framework outperforms existing methods by a significant margin on the CUB-200-2011 and ImageNet-1K datasets, establishing a new state-of-the-art for WSOL. The code for our approach will be made available soon.
