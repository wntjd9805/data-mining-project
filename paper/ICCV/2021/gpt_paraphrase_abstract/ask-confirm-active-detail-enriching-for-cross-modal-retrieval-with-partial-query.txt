Significant progress has been made in text-based image retrieval. However, existing methods struggle in real-life scenarios where users often provide incomplete descriptions of images, resulting in false positives. This study introduces the partial-query problem and analyzes its impact on text-based image retrieval. Previous interactive methods address this issue by passively receiving user feedback to improve the query iteratively, but this approach is time-consuming and requires significant user effort. Instead, a new retrieval framework is proposed, using an Ask-and-Confirm approach, where AI actively searches for missing details in the query and users only need to confirm AI's suggestions. The framework includes an object-based interaction method to enhance user-friendliness and a reinforcement-learning-based policy to search for discriminative objects. Additionally, a weakly-supervised training strategy is presented, which does not require human-annotated dialogs apart from a text-image dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances text-based image retrieval performance.
