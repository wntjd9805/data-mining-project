This paper introduces a novel approach called FAST (Frequency-Aware Spatiotemporal Transformer) for detecting video inpainting. The goal is to identify traces of video inpainting by considering spatial, temporal, and frequency domains simultaneously. Unlike existing methods that rely on hand-designed attention modules and memory mechanisms, FAST incorporates global self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range relationships. Additionally, while previous methods focus on spatial and temporal connections, FAST utilizes a spatiotemporal transformer framework to detect spatial connections between patches and temporal dependencies between frames. Moreover, FAST addresses the lack of high-frequency details in inpainted videos by incorporating frequency domain information through a specially designed decoder. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance and generalization capabilities.
