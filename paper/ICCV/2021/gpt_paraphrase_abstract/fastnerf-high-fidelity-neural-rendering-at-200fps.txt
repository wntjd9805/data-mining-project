FastNeRF is a new system based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) that can render photorealistic 3D images at high speeds. Previous methods using NeRF were computationally demanding and not suitable for interactive rates, particularly on mobile and mixed reality devices. However, FastNeRF can render high-quality images at a rate of 200Hz on a high-end consumer GPU. The key aspect of FastNeRF is a factorization technique inspired by graphics, which allows for efficient caching of a deep radiance map and quick estimation of pixel values using ray directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FastNeRF is significantly faster than the original NeRF algorithm and existing methods for accelerating NeRF, while still maintaining visual quality and versatility.
