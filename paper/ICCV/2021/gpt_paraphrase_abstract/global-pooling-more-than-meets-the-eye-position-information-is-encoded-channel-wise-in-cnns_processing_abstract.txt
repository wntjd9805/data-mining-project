This paper challenges the widely accepted belief that converting a 3D tensor into a vector through global pooling eliminates all spatial information in a convolutional neural network (CNN). The authors demonstrate that positional information is preserved by the arrangement of channel dimensions, while semantic information is not. They apply these findings to two practical applications. Firstly, they propose a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and loss function that enhances a CNN's translation invariance. Secondly, they introduce a method to efficiently identify the channels in the latent representation responsible for encoding overall position information or region-specific positions. The authors show that semantic segmentation heavily relies on overall position channels for predictions and demonstrate the possibility of a "region-specific" attack that impairs network performance in a specific part of the input. The authors believe that their discoveries and practical applications will contribute to the understanding of CNN characteristics.
