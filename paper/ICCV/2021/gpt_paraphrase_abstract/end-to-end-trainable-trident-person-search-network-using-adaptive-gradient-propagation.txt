This paper introduces a trident network for person search, which addresses the conflicting goals of commonness and uniqueness in person detection and re-identification tasks. The trident network combines detection, re-identification, and part classification into a single framework. To enhance training, an adaptive gradient weighting technique is proposed, which controls the flow of gradients based on the quality of person detection. This approach prevents over-fitting and encourages the utilization of fine-grained features by incorporating the part classification branch. Experimental results on the CUHK-SYSU and PRW datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art end-to-end person search methods.
