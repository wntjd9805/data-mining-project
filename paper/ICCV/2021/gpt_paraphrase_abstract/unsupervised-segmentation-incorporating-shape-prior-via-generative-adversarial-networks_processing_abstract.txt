We introduce an image segmentation algorithm developed in an unsupervised deep learning framework. Due to factors like changes in illumination and occlusions, accurately delineating object boundaries can be challenging. To address this, we propose an unsupervised image decomposition algorithm that obtains an intrinsic representation resistant to biases using a multiplicative image model. This intrinsic image is then fed into an unsupervised segmentation procedure based on a piecewise smooth model. Additionally, our segmentation model incorporates a geometric constraint within the generative adversarial network framework, minimizing the discrepancy between the distribution of partitioning functions and the distribution of prior shapes. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm by conducting experiments on synthetic examples and a benchmark dataset for image segmentation, specifically focusing on scenarios involving bias fields and occlusions.
