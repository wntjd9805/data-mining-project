Current methods in weakly-supervised object detection fall short in fully utilizing discriminative category information from fully-supervised datasets, resulting in low mAP. To address this issue, we propose a novel category transfer framework. Our approach leverages visually-discriminative and semantically-correlated category information to enhance object classification in weakly-supervised detectors. For overlapping categories, we introduce a double-supervision mean teacher to gather common category information and bridge the domain gap. For non-overlapping categories, we propose a semantic graph convolutional network to promote the aggregation of semantic features between correlated categories. We evaluate our framework on Pascal VOC 2007 as the weakly-supervised dataset and COCO as the fully-supervised dataset. Our category transfer framework achieves impressive results, surpassing state-of-the-art methods with a 63.5% mAP and 80.3% CorLoc when considering 5 overlapping categories between the datasets.
