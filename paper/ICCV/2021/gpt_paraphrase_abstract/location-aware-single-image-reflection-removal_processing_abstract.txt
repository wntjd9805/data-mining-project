This paper presents a new method for removing reflections from single images using location-aware deep learning. The method utilizes a network with a reflection detection module that generates a probabilistic reflection confidence map by using multi-scale Laplacian features as input. This map indicates whether a region is dominated by reflection or transmission, and it guides the network in predicting the reflection and transmission layers. The network is designed as a recurrent network, allowing it to progressively refine the results of reflection removal with each iteration. The novelty of the approach lies in the use of Laplacian kernel parameters to emphasize the boundaries of strong reflections, leading to improved detection of strong reflections and higher quality reflection removal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches. The code and pre-trained model for the method are available at https://github.com/zdlarr/Location-aware-SIRR.
