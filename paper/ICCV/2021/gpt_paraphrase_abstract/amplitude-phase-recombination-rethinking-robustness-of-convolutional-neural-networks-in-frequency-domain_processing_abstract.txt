The abstract discusses the generalization behavior of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and highlights the importance of the phase spectrum of images for robust vision systems. The paper notes that CNNs tend to converge at local optima related to high-frequency components of training images, while the amplitude spectrum is easily disturbed by noise or corruptions. In contrast, humans rely on phase components for robust recognition. This observation motivates a new perspective on data augmentation that combines the phase spectrum of the current image with the amplitude spectrum of a distractor image. This approach helps the CNN focus on structured information from phase components and maintain robustness to amplitude variation. Experimental results on various image datasets demonstrate that this method achieves state-of-the-art performance in generalization tasks, including adaptability to corruptions, surface variations, out-of-distribution detection, and adversarial attacks. The code for the proposed method is available on GitHub under the repository name "APR".
