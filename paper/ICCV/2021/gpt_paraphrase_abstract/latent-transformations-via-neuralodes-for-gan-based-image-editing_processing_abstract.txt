Recent advancements in semantic image editing rely heavily on the disentangled latent spaces of state-of-the-art generative models, like Style-GAN. Recent studies have shown that linear shifts along latent directions can achieve controllability of attributes in face images. However, these methods assume that the latent spaces of GANs have inherently linearly separable attribute distributions and semantic vector arithmetic properties. In our research, we propose the use of nonlinear latent code manipulations implemented as trainable Neural ODE flows. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach for non-face image domains with complex non-textured factors of variation. Through investigation of various datasets with known attributes, we show that certain attribute manipulations are difficult to achieve using linear shifts alone.
