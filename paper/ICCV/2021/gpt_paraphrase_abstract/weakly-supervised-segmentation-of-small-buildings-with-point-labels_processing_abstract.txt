This paper introduces a weakly supervised segmentation network for aerial/satellite images, specifically focusing on small and large objects. Traditional supervised image segmentation methods require manual pixel-level labeling, which is time-consuming and challenging for small objects. To address this, the authors propose a simple point labeling method for small objects and fully label the large objects. They then train a segmentation network using a small object mask to distinguish between small and large objects in the loss function. To handle the limited number of point labels, they employ a memory bank during training. Experimental results on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of their approach.
