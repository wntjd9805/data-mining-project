The primary challenge in detecting manipulated images is finding features that can identify manipulations in new data while avoiding false alarms on authentic images. Current research focuses on sensitivity and overlooks specificity. In this study, we address both aspects through multi-view feature learning and multi-scale supervision. Multi-view feature learning aims to learn semantic-agnostic features that are more generalizable by exploiting noise distribution and boundary artifacts around tampered regions. Multi-scale supervision allows us to learn from authentic images, which are often overlooked by current methods based on semantic segmentation networks. We propose a new network called MVSS-Net to implement these ideas. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MVSS-Net in detecting both pixel-level and image-level manipulations.
