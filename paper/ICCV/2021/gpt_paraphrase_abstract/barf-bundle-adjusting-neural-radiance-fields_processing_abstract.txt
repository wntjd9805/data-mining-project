Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have become popular for their ability to generate realistic images of real-world scenes. However, NeRF requires accurate camera poses to learn scene representations, which is a limitation. In this paper, we propose a method called Bundle-Adjusting Neural Radiance Fields (BARF) that allows NeRF to be trained with imperfect or unknown camera poses. BARF addresses the joint problem of learning 3D representations and registering camera frames by utilizing coarse-to-fine registration techniques. We also identify that using positional encoding in NeRF negatively affects registration with a synthesis-based objective. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that BARF effectively optimizes neural scene representations and resolves large camera pose misalignment. This breakthrough enables view synthesis and localization of video sequences from unknown camera poses, opening up new possibilities for visual localization systems such as SLAM and applications in dense 3D mapping and reconstruction.
