Deep Metric Learning (DML) methods are widely used in computer vision to improve prediction accuracy by learning effective visual data similarity. However, existing DML approaches have limitations. Pair-based methods are accurate but computationally expensive, while proxy-based methods are less accurate in capturing data relationships. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hybrid grouplet paradigm that combines the accurate pair-wise relationships of pair-based methods with the efficient training of proxy-based methods. The proposed method introduces a non-Euclidean space and a hierarchical representation manifold to DML. It adopts a unified graph perspective, where different DML methods learn distinct local connecting patterns between data points. Instead of explicit pair-wise relationships, the method encodes data relationships in an optimal transport problem involving proxies. To automatically determine these relationships, a differentiable implicit layer is used to solve the problem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multiple benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the method.
