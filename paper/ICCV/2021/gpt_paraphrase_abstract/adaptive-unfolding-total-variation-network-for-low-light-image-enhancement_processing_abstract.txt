Real-world low-light images often suffer from two main issues: noise and poor visibility. Previous works have focused on estimating and reducing noise levels in raw Bayer space, but the process becomes more complicated in the sRGB color space due to image processing. Existing algorithms in sRGB space only address the visibility problem or assume a hypothetical noise level, making them impractical. To overcome this, we propose an adaptive unfolding total variation network (UTVNet) that approximates the noise level in sRGB low-light images by learning the balancing parameter in a model-based denoising method. Additionally, we learn the noise level map by unrolling the corresponding minimization process to provide smoothness and fidelity constraints. Utilizing the noise level map, UTVNet can recover finer details and effectively suppress noise in real low-light scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of UTVNet compared to state-of-the-art methods in enhancing real-world low-light images.
