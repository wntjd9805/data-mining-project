This paper introduces a new dataset called MultiSports, which aims to address the limitations of existing action detection benchmarks. The dataset focuses on spatio-temporal localized sports actions and incorporates three criteria for constructing a realistic and challenging dataset: multi-person scenes with motion dependent identification, well-defined boundaries, and relatively fine-grained classes of high complexity. MultiSports v1.0 consists of 4 sports classes, 3200 video clips, and 37701 annotated action instances with 902k bounding boxes. The dataset is characterized by high diversity, dense annotation, and high quality. To evaluate the dataset, baseline methods are adapted and analyzed in depth. The authors hope that MultiSports can serve as a standard benchmark for spatio-temporal action detection in the future.
