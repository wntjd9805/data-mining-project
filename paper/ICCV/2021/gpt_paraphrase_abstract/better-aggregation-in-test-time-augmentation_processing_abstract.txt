Test-time augmentation, which involves combining predictions from transformed versions of a test input, is a commonly used technique in image classification. Typically, these predictions are aggregated using a simple average. This paper aims to provide experimental analyses to understand scenarios where the simple average method is not optimal and proposes a solution to address these limitations. The research reveals that while test-time augmentation can improve accuracy overall, it also has the potential to change many correct predictions into incorrect ones. The study further explores the factors that influence these changes in predictions. Based on these findings, the paper introduces a learning-based approach for aggregating test-time augmentations. Extensive experiments conducted on various models, datasets, and augmentations demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches.
