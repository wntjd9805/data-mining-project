Active learning is a technique that aims to reduce the cost of labeling data by selecting the most informative samples from a dataset. However, there is limited research on active learning for object detection. Existing methods either use multiple models or extend classification methods, which only consider the classification head of an image to estimate its informativeness. This paper introduces a new deep active learning approach for object detection. The approach utilizes mixture density networks to estimate a probabilistic distribution for each localization and classification head's output. It explicitly estimates both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a single pass of a single model. A scoring function is then used to aggregate these uncertainties from both heads and calculate the informativeness score for each image. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on the PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets. The results show that the approach outperforms single-model based methods and achieves comparable performance to multi-model based methods, while significantly reducing computing costs.
