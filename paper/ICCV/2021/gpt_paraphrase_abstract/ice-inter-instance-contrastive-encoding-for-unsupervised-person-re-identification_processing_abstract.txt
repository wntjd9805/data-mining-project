Unsupervised person re-identification (ReID) is the task of learning distinctive identity features without the need for annotations. Recently, self-supervised contrastive learning has gained attention for its effectiveness in unsupervised representation learning. This approach involves matching the same instance in different augmented views. However, previous contrastive methods have not fully explored the relationship between different instances, particularly for instance-level contrastive loss. To address this limitation, we propose Inter-instance Contrastive Encoding (ICE). ICE utilizes inter-instance pairwise similarity scores to improve existing class-level contrastive ReID methods. Firstly, we employ pairwise similarity ranking as hard pseudo labels to encourage contrast between difficult instances and reduce intra-class variance. Secondly, we utilize similarity scores as soft pseudo labels to enhance consistency between augmented and original views, making our model more robust to augmentation perturbations. We conducted experiments on several large-scale person ReID datasets to validate the effectiveness of our proposed unsupervised method ICE. The results show that ICE is competitive even with supervised methods. The code for implementing ICE is available at https://github.com/chenhao2345/ICE.
