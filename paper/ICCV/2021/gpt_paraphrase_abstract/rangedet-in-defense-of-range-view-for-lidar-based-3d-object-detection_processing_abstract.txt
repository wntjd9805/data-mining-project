This paper introduces RangeDet, an anchor-free single-stage LiDAR-based 3D object detector. Unlike previous methods, RangeDet relies solely on the range view representation, which is more compact and free from quantization error compared to voxelized or Bird's Eye View representations. While range view representation has been used in semantic segmentation, its performance in object detection has been inferior to voxelized or Bird's Eye View counterparts. Through analysis of existing range-view-based methods, two overlooked issues are identified: the scale variation between nearby and far away objects, and the inconsistency between the 2D range image coordinates used in feature extraction and the 3D Cartesian coordinates used in output. To address these issues, three components are deliberately designed in RangeDet. The effectiveness of RangeDet is evaluated on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset, achieving 72.9/75.9/65.8 3D AP on vehicle/pedestrian/cyclist, respectively. These results surpass other range-view-based methods and are comparable to state-of-the-art multi-view-based methods. The code for RangeDet will be made available at https://github.com/TuSimple/RangeDet.
