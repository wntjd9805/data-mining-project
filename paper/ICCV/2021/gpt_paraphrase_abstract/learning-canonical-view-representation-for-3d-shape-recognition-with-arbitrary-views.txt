This paper focuses on the recognition of 3D shapes from various viewpoints, which poses a significant challenge for view-based 3D shape recognition. To address this challenge, the authors propose a canonical view representation method. The method involves transforming the original features of arbitrary views into a fixed number of view features, known as the canonical view representation, by aligning them with a set of learnable reference view features using optimal transport. This results in each 3D shape with arbitrary views being represented by a fixed number of canonical view features, which are further aggregated to create a comprehensive and robust 3D shape representation for shape recognition. Additionally, the authors introduce a constraint that ensures the view features in the canonical view representation can be embedded into scattered points in a Euclidean space. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance under fixed viewpoint settings and significantly outperforms other applicable methods under the arbitrary view setting.
