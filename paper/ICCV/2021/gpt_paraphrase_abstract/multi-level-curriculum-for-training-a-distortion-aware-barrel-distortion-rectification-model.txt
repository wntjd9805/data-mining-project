Barrel distortion rectification is the process of removing radial distortion from wide-angle lens images. Previous deep learning approaches have focused on learning the distortion parameters or rectified mapping function directly, resulting in a limited understanding of distortion. This paper introduces a progressive and meaningful approach to barrel distortion rectification, inspired by curriculum learning. By breaking down the rectification task into three levels - structure recovery, semantics embedding, and texture rendering - and considering the relationship between these levels, a hierarchical architecture is designed. This architecture enables progressive rectification and produces more accurate results. Additionally, a novel distortion-aware pre-training strategy is proposed to facilitate faster and better convergence of neural networks. Experimental results on both synthesized and real-world distorted image datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of both qualitative and quantitative performance.
