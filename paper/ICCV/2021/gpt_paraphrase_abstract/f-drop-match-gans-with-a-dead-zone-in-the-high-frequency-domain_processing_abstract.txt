To address the limitations of generative adversarial networks (GANs) in replicating high-frequency components of natural images, we propose two novel training techniques: frequency dropping (F-Drop) and frequency matching (F-Match). F-Drop involves filtering out unnecessary high-frequency components from input images in the discriminators, preventing confusion caused by perturbations. This modification also encourages GANs to focus on fitting the dominant low-frequency components of natural images. On the other hand, F-Match aims to minimize the difference between real and fake images in the frequency domain, resulting in more realistic generated images. Implemented as a regularization term in the objective functions of the generators, F-Match penalizes the batch mean error in the frequency domain. This helps the generators fit the filtered high-frequency domain (filtered by F-Drop) to the real image. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the combination of F-Drop and F-Match enhances the generative performance of GANs in both the frequency and spatial domains across various image benchmarks.
