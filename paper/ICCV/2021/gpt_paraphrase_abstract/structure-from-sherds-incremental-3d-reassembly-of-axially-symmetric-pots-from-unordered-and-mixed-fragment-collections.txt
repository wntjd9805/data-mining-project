Reconstructing broken pots accurately using 3D scanned fragments remains a difficult task. Previous methods attempt to find all possible matches between pot sherds at once, but this approach often leads to false positive matches due to the similar appearance of sharp fracture surfaces. To address this issue, we draw inspiration from the field of structure-from-motion (SfM) and propose a new method for reassembling axially symmetric pots. Our approach is based on iterative registration of one sherd at a time, similar to the incremental approach used in SfM. However, we go beyond traditional incremental SfM by incorporating beam search to explore multiple registration possibilities and handle indistinguishable false matches. Furthermore, we allow the simultaneous reassembly of multiple pots by utilizing multiple roots in each step. Our method achieves an accuracy of over 80% on a dataset consisting of 80 real fragments from 5 pots, surpassing the current state-of-the-art. This work brings us closer to the goal of large-scale pot reassembly. The code and preprocessed data for our method are available at https://github.com/SeongJong-Yoo/structure-from-sherds.
