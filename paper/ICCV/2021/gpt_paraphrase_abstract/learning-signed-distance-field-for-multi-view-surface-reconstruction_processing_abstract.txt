This study presents a new approach for neural surface reconstruction that combines stereo matching and feature consistency to optimize implicit surface representation. The framework uses a signed distance field (SDF) and a surface light field to represent scene geometry and appearance, respectively. The SDF is supervised by geometry from stereo matching and refined through multi-view feature consistency and image fidelity. The proposed method improves the robustness of geometry estimation and enables the reconstruction of complex scene topologies. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, particularly in reconstructing mesh in wide open scenes without the need for object masks.
