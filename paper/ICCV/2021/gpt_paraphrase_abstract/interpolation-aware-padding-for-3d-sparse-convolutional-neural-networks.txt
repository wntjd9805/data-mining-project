Sparse voxel-based 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used in 3D vision tasks. These networks create sparse non-empty voxels from the input and perform convolution operations only on these voxels. In this study, we propose a new padding scheme called interpolation-aware padding, which adds a few empty voxels next to the non-empty ones and incorporates them in the computation of the 3D CNN. This ensures that all neighboring voxels are present when calculating point-wise features using trilinear interpolation. Our network outperforms existing networks that use nearest neighbor interpolation or normalized trilinear interpolation with zero-padding or octree-padding schemes in tasks that require fine-grained 3D vision, such as semantic segmentation and 3D detection. We conducted extensive comparisons on various 3D segmentation and detection tasks, demonstrating the superiority of our padding scheme in combination with feature interpolation in sparse 3D CNNs.
