Heatmap-based methods are commonly used for 2D human pose estimation, although regression is considered more intuitive. The introduction of the integral regression method has brought these two approaches closer together. This study aims to investigate the difference in supervision between heatmap-based detection and integral regression. It is found that integral pose regression has an underlying bias caused by the expectation after the softmax function. To address this bias, a compensation method is proposed, which improves the accuracy of integral regression on various pose estimation benchmarks. Additionally, a combined detection and bias-compensated regression method is proposed, which outperforms existing baselines with minimal additional components.
