Modern recognition systems require a significant amount of supervision to achieve accuracy. However, adapting these systems to new domains can be challenging and expensive as it requires a substantial amount of data from experts. Zero-shot learning, which relies on annotated attributes for novel categories, presents a solution. Nonetheless, annotating the complete set of attributes for a novel category is a laborious and costly task, particularly in expert domains.To address this issue, we propose a novel approach inspired by field guides, where the learner model engages in interactive learning by asking for the most informative attributes that define a class. We evaluate our method on classification benchmarks such as CUB, SUN, and AWA2, which include attribute annotations. Our results demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to a model with full annotations while requiring significantly fewer annotations.Reducing annotation costs is highly valuable in real-world deployment, considering the precious time of experts. Therefore, our approach holds promise for facilitating the efficient and cost-effective adaptation of recognition systems in various domains.
