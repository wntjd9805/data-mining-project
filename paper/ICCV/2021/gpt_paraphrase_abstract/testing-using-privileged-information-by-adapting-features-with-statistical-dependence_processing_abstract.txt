We enhance the predictions of an imperfect predictor by incorporating additional features at test time, without the need for retraining or knowledge of the prediction function. This situation commonly occurs when training labels or data are restricted, proprietary, unavailable, or when training is excessively costly. Our assumption is that these additional features are valuable if they show a significant statistical connection to the underlying accurate predictor. To achieve this, we employ manifold de-noising to estimate and strengthen the statistical dependence between the initial noisy predictor and the extra features. We provide an example where applying this approach results in improved ranking of real-world visual attributes.
