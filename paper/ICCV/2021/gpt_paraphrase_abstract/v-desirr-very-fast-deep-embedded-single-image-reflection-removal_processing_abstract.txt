Unwanted reflections often corrupt real-world images, and their removal is highly desired. Many of these images come from high-resolution smartphone cameras. Existing methods for removing reflections either prioritize restoration quality at the expense of processing speed and memory requirements, or focus on low-resolution images, limiting their practical use. We propose a lightweight deep learning model for reflection removal using a unique scale space architecture. Our method consists of two stages: a Low Scale Sub-network (LSSNet) to process the lowest scale, and a Progressive Inference (PI) stage to process higher scales. The sub-networks in the PI stage are designed to be shallower than LSSNet to reduce computational complexity, and weight sharing is employed between scales to limit the model size and enable generalization to high resolutions without retraining. Our method outperforms existing methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, and is 20 times faster with 50 times fewer parameters compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm RAGNet. We implemented our method on an Android smartphone, achieving restoration of a 12 MP image in under 5 seconds.
