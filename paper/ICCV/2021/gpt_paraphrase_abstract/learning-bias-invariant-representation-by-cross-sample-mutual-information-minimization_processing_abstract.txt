Deep learning algorithms have the potential to inherit bias from the training data, leading to poor generalization and misleading decision-making in real-life applications. To address this issue, we propose a method called cross-sample adversarial debiasing (CSAD). This method involves extracting target and bias features separately from the latent representation generated by a feature extractor, and then learning to identify and remove the correlation between these features. We use a cross-sample neural mutual information estimator to measure this correlation, and further enhance its performance through joint content and local structural representation learning. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on publicly available datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Figure 1 provides a visual representation of our CSAD method applied to a color-biased binary classification task, where our objective is to obtain a color-invariant digit classifier. Existing methods only eliminate the correlation between the extracted features and the red color of the individual sample, while CSAD can reduce the correlation between the features and various shades of red across different samples.
