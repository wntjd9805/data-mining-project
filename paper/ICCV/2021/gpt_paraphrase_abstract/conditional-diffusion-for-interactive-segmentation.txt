Existing methods in click-based interactive segmentation do not fully utilize user cues, resulting in the need for excessive clicks for satisfactory results. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called Conditional Diffusion Network (CDNet). CDNet consists of two modules: Feature Diffusion Module (FDM) and Pixel Diffusion Module (PDM). FDM spreads features from user clicks to potential target regions based on global similarity, while PDM diffuses the predicted logits of clicks within locally connected regions. This enables the information inferred from user clicks to be generalized to the appropriate destinations. Additionally, we introduce Diversified Training (DT) to reduce optimization ambiguity caused by click simulation. By incorporating FDM, PDM, and DT, CDNet is able to better understand user intentions and make improved predictions with limited interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that CDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.
