We propose an interpretable deep network for removing JPEG compression artifacts, which addresses the limitations of existing deep learning methods that focus solely on pixel-level mapping relationships and lack interpretability. Our network learns both pixel-level regressive prior and semantic-level discriminative prior. We formulate the image de-blocking problem using a variation-al model and introduce two prior terms for image content and gradient. The content-relevant prior acts as a de-blocker at the pixel-level, while the gradient-relevant prior serves as a semantic-level classifier. We develop an alternating minimization algorithm and convert it into a deep network architecture to effectively solve the variational model. This increases the interpretability of the network and enables accurate estimation of the dual priors from training samples. By integrating these priors into a single framework, we achieve better performance in image de-blocking compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our method is validated through experiments on benchmarks and real-world use cases.
