We present a parallel version of the Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) algorithm, specifically designed for solving binary optimization tasks like image segmentation. The original QPBO algorithm developed by Kolmogorov and Rother relies on the Boykov-Kolmogorov (BK) maxflow/mincut algorithm and performs well in various image analysis tasks. However, the sequential nature of the QPBO algorithm limits its efficiency on modern hardware. To overcome this limitation, we have redesigned the QPBO algorithm to utilize parallel maxflow/mincut algorithms, resulting in significantly reduced solve times for large optimization tasks. To evaluate the performance of our parallel QPBO implementation, we compared it with other state-of-the-art solvers. We conducted benchmark tests on two extensive segmentation tasks and a substantial collection of smaller segmentation tasks. The results demonstrate that our parallel QPBO algorithm outperforms the serial QPBO algorithm by more than 20 times on large tasks and over three times on the majority of small tasks. It is important to note that our algorithm is not limited to image segmentation and can be applied to any QPBO problem. We have made our implementation and experimental results publicly available at DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.5201620.
