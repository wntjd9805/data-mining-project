Despite the advancements in human activity classification, there has been less success in understanding human interactions. This is primarily due to the difficulty of the task and the limited capability of current approaches, which rely on shallow graphical models to learn human interactive relations. To address this issue, we propose a consistency-aware graph network that combines the strengths of graph networks and consistency-aware reasoning to enhance human interaction understanding. Our approach consists of three components: a backbone convolutional neural network (CNN) for extracting image features, a factor graph network for learning complex interactive relations among individuals, and a consistency-aware reasoning module for enforcing labeling and grouping consistencies. We observe that embedding consistency-aware reasoning into an energy function can lead to consistent predictions. To train our network, we introduce an efficient mean-field inference algorithm that enables end-to-end training of all modules. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods. The code for our approach is publicly available at https://git.io/CAGNet.
