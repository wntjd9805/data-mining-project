This paper introduces FloorPlan-CAD, a dataset consisting of over 10,000 real-world CAD drawings of residential and commercial buildings. The drawings are represented as vector graphics and annotated with 30 object categories. The paper proposes the task of panoptic symbol spotting, which involves identifying instances of countable objects and understanding the semantic meaning of uncountable elements. To address this task, the paper presents a novel method that combines Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture both non-Euclidean and Euclidean features. The proposed CNN-GCN method achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic symbol spotting and serves as a baseline network for the panoptic symbol spotting task. The contributions of the paper include the creation of the first CAD drawing dataset, the introduction of the panoptic symbol spotting task, and the development of a baseline solution using the CNN-GCN method. The dataset and code are publicly available. These contributions are expected to advance research in related areas.
