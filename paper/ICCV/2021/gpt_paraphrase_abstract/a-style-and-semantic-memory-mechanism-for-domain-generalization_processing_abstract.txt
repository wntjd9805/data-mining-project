Conventional domain generalization algorithms prioritize the assumption of semantic invariance across domains, while disregarding the importance of intra-domain style invariance. This paper argues that leveraging intra-domain style invariance is crucial for improving the efficiency of domain generalization. The network needs to be aware of which domain features are invariant and shared among instances in order to enhance its understanding and semantic discriminative ability. To address this, a new "jury" mechanism is proposed to learn useful semantic feature commonalities among domains. The proposed model, called STEAM, is a probabilistic graphical model that requires the construction of semantic and style feature memory banks. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods significantly.
