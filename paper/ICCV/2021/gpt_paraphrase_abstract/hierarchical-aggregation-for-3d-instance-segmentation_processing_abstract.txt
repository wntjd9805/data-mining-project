This research introduces a clustering-based framework called HAIS for instance segmentation on point clouds in 3D scene perception. HAIS utilizes the spatial relation of points and point sets to effectively generate instance proposals. To address the issue of over-segmentation or under-segmentation, hierarchical aggregation is introduced to gradually generate complete instances from point sets. A sub-network is then employed to filter noisy points and score mask quality. HAIS is a fast method that achieves impressive results on the ScanNet v2 benchmark, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods with a 69.9% AP50 score. The framework also demonstrates good generalization ability on the S3DIS dataset. The code for HAIS is available on GitHub at https://github.com/hustvl/HAIS.
