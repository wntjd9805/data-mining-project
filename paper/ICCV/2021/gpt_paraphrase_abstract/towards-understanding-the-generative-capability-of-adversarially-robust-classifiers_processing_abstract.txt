Recently, researchers have discovered that adversarially robust classifiers have the ability to generate high-quality images similar to generative models. In this study, we investigate this phenomenon from an energy perspective and offer a new explanation. We redefine the processes of adversarial example generation, adversarial training, and image generation in terms of an energy function. Our findings reveal that adversarial training plays a crucial role in obtaining a flat energy function with low energy levels around real data, which is essential for generative capability. Building on this new understanding, we propose a superior adversarial training method called Joint Energy Adversarial Training (JEAT). JEAT can generate high-quality images and achieve state-of-the-art robustness against a wide range of attacks. The InceptionScore of images (CIFAR-10) generated by JEAT is 8.80, significantly outperforming original robust classifiers (7.50). Notably, our results demonstrate that JEAT exhibits better robustness compared to other hybrid models.
