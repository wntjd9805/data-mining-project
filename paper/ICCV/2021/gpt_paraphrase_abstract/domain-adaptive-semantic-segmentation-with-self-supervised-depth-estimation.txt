This study focuses on domain adaptation for semantic segmentation, which aims to improve model performance when there is a distribution shift between the source and target domains. The authors propose leveraging supervision from auxiliary tasks, specifically self-supervised depth estimation, to bridge the domain gap. They suggest explicitly learning the correlation between task features to enhance target semantic predictions using target depth estimation. Additionally, they use the depth prediction discrepancy from source and target depth decoders to estimate the pixel-wise adaptation difficulty. This adaptation difficulty, inferred from depth, is then used to refine the pseudo-labels for target semantic segmentation. The proposed method can be easily integrated into existing segmentation frameworks. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes and GTA-to-Cityscapes benchmark tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance with accuracy rates of 55.0% and 56.6%, respectively.
