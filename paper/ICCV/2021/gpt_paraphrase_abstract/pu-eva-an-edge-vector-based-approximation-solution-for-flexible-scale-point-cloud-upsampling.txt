This study introduces a novel method called PU-EVA for upsampling point clouds. Point clouds are important for various applications, but upsampling them to achieve denser and more regular approximations is challenging. Existing methods have fixed upsampling rates, but PU-EVA utilizes edge-vector based affine combinations to achieve arbitrary upsampling rates. The method encodes neighboring connectivity and restricts approximation error. It also decouples the upsampling scales from the network architecture, allowing for arbitrary upsampling rates in one-time training. The proposed PU-EVA outperforms existing methods in terms of proximity-to-surface, distribution uniformity, and preservation of geometric details.
