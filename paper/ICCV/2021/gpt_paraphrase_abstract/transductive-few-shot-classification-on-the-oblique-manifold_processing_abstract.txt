In this study, we focus on few-shot learning (FSL) which involves learning from limited amounts of data. Our approach involves extracting features in the Euclidean space and using the geodesic distance metric on the Oblique Manifold (OM). To enhance feature extraction, we propose a non-parametric Region Self-attention with Spatial Pyramid Pooling (RSSPP) method that balances between generalization and discriminative ability of single image features. These features are then embedded into the OM as points. Additionally, we develop an Oblique Distance-based Classifier (ODC) that performs classification in tangent spaces, which provide a better approximation of the OM locally through learnable tangency points. To improve the performance of our algorithm, we introduce a new method for parameter initialization and a novel loss function for transductive settings. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmarks including mini-ImageNet, tiered-ImageNet, and Caltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB).
