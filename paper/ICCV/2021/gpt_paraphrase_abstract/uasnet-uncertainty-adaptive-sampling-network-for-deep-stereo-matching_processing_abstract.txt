Recent research has demonstrated the importance of cascade cost volume in deep stereo matching for generating high-resolution depth maps efficiently. However, there is still a need to investigate how to construct effective cascade volumes and perform efficient sampling. Previous approaches to cascade-based methods have used uniform sampling within a predicted disparity range based on variance, but this often results in missing the ground truth disparity and reduced accuracy in the disparity map. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel uncertainty adaptive sampling network (UAS-Net) comprising two modules: an uncertainty distribution-guided range prediction (URP) model and an uncertainty-based disparity sampler (UDS) module. The URP leverages a more discriminative uncertainty distribution to handle complex matching ambiguities and improve disparity range prediction. The UDS dynamically adjusts the sampling interval to accurately localize disparity. By incorporating these modules, our UAS-Net learns to construct cascade cost volume and directly predict full-resolution disparity maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the highest ground truth covering ratio compared to other cascade cost volume-based stereo matching methods. Additionally, our approach achieves top performance on both the SceneFlow dataset and the KITTI benchmark.
