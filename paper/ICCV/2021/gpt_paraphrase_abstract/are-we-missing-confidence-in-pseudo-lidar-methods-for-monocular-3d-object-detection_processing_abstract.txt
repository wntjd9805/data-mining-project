Pseudo-LiDAR-based methods have gained popularity in the field of monocular 3D object detection, especially on the KITTI3D benchmark. However, it has been observed that the validation results reported by these methods are biased. This bias is due to an overlap between the KITTI3D object detection validation set and the training/validation sets used to train depth predictors for Pseudo-LiDAR-based methods. Even after removing this overlap, the bias persists. Therefore, the only reliable set for comparison is the test set, where Pseudo-LiDAR-based methods do not excel. To address this, we propose a new deep architecture that incorporates a 3D confidence prediction module. By integrating 3D confidence estimation techniques from RGB-only 3D detection approaches and using a newly designed 3D confidence measure, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI3D benchmark.
