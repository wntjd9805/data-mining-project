Autonomous driving systems often rely on expert demonstrations, but humans are not effective coaches for algorithms that require dense on-policy supervision. Automated experts can generate large-scale demonstrations using privileged information, but existing automated experts for urban driving rely on hand-crafted rules and perform poorly even on driving simulators. To address these issues, we trained a reinforcement learning expert that maps bird's-eye view images to low-level actions. This expert not only sets a new performance standard on CARLA but also provides informative supervision signals for imitation learning agents. By being supervised by our reinforcement learning coach, a baseline end-to-end agent with monocular camera-input achieves expert-level performance. Our end-to-end agent achieves a 78% success rate on the NoCrash-dense benchmark, generalizes well to new towns and weather conditions, and performs at a state-of-the-art level on the challenging CARLA LeaderBoard.
