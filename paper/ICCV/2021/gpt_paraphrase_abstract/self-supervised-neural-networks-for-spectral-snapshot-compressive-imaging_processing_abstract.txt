In this study, we explore the use of untrained neural networks to solve the reconstruction problem in snapshot compressive imaging (SCI). SCI involves capturing high-dimensional data using a compressed approach with a 2D detector. While deep neural networks have been successful in reconstructing SCI data, they usually require large amounts of training data with simulated ground truth. Inspired by untrained networks like deep image priors (DIP) and deep decoders, we propose a framework that integrates DIP into the plug-and-play regime, creating a self-supervised network for spectral SCI reconstruction. Extensive tests using synthetic and real data demonstrate that our algorithm, without training, achieves competitive results compared to training-based networks. Moreover, by combining our method with a pre-trained deep denoising prior, we achieve state-of-the-art results. Our code is available at the provided GitHub link.
