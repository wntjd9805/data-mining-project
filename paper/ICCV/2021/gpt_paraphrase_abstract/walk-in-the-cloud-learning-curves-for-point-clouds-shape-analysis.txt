This paper introduces a new approach to addressing the issue of insufficient shape descriptors for 3D geometries in discrete point cloud objects. The proposed method involves aggregating hypothetical curves within point clouds. Initially, sequences of connected points (curves) are grouped by guided walks in the point clouds, and then aggregated to enhance their point-wise features. The implementation of this aggregation strategy includes a novel curve grouping operator and a curve aggregation operator. The effectiveness of the method was demonstrated through benchmarking on various point cloud analysis tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results such as 94.2% classification accuracy on the ModelNet40 classification task, 86.8% instance IoU on the ShapeNetPart segmentation task, and a cosine error of 0.11 on the ModelNet40 normal estimation task.
