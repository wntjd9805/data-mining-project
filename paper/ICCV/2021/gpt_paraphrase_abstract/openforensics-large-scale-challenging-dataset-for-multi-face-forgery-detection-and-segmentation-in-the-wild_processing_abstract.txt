The proliferation of deepfake media is causing concerns among the public and authorities. To address this, this study focuses on two new countermeasure tasks: detecting and segmenting forged faces in real-life situations. Localizing forged faces among multiple human faces in natural scenes is more challenging than traditional deepfake recognition. To facilitate research in this area, the authors have created OpenForensics, a large-scale dataset with rich annotations specifically designed for face forgery detection and segmentation. This dataset has the potential to contribute to deepfake prevention and general human face detection research. The authors have also conducted a thorough evaluation of state-of-the-art methods on their dataset, creating benchmarks for these tasks in various scenarios.
