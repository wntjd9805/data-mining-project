Unsupervised domain adaptive person re-identification (UDA re-ID) is focused on transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain to improve a model's discrimination on an unlabeled target domain. This study proposes a novel approach that utilizes the connection between the source and target domains to address the UDA re-ID task. The researchers suggest explicitly modeling intermediate domains to characterize this connection. They introduce an Intermediate Domain Module (IDM) that generates representations of intermediate domains by combining hidden representations from the source and target domains using two domain factors. The researchers propose two properties that these intermediate domains should possess based on the concept of the "shortest geodesic path." They enforce bridge losses on the prediction space and feature space of the intermediate domains to ensure the appropriate distribution of these domains. Additionally, a diversity loss is enforced on the two domain factors to prevent overfitting to either the source or target domains. The proposed method surpasses existing approaches in various UDA re-ID tasks, achieving a significant mAP gain of up to 7.7% on the challenging MSMT17 benchmark.
