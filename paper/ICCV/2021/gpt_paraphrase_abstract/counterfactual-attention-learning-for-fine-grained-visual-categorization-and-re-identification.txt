This paper introduces a novel approach to learning attention mechanisms for fine-grained visual recognition tasks. The proposed method utilizes counterfactual causality to improve the effectiveness of attention. Unlike existing methods that rely on conventional likelihood, our approach measures attention quality and provides a supervisory signal using counterfactual inference. By analyzing the impact of learned attention on network predictions through counterfactual intervention, we maximize this effect to encourage the learning of more useful attention for fine-grained image recognition. Our method is evaluated on various fine-grained recognition tasks, such as fine-grained image categorization, person re-identification, and vehicle re-identification. The consistently improved performance across all benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of our approach.
