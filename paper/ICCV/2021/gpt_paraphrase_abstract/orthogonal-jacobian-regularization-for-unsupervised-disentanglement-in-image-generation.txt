Unsupervised disentanglement learning is a critical issue in understanding and utilizing deep generative models. Previous approaches, such as SeFa and Hessian Penalty, have limitations in effectively disentangling latent directions. In this paper, we propose a simple method called Orthogonal Jacobian Regularization (OroJaR) to encourage deep generative models to learn disentangled representations. OroJaR promotes orthogonality between the variations caused by perturbations in different latent dimensions, as measured by the Jacobian with respect to the input. Additionally, OroJaR indirectly encourages the output's Hessian matrix to be diagonal. Unlike Hessian Penalty, OroJaR holistically constrains the output, making it highly effective in disentangling latent dimensions corresponding to spatially correlated variations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves disentangled and controllable image generation, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.
