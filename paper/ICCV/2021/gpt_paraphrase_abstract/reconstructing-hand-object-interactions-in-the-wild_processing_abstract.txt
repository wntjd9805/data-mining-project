We investigate the challenge of understanding hand-object interactions from 2D images in realistic settings. The difficulty lies in reconstructing the 3D structures of both the hand and the object due to occlusion between them. In this study, we propose two significant contributions. Firstly, we introduce an innovative reconstruction technique called RHO (Reconstructing Hands and Objects) that utilizes 2D image cues and 3D contact priors to reconstruct accurate 3D models of the hand and the object. Secondly, we create a dataset called MOW (Manipulating Objects in the Wild) consisting of 500 hand-object interaction images that have been transformed into 3D using the RHO technique. Our dataset encompasses 121 different object categories, offering a wider range of manipulation actions than previous datasets.
