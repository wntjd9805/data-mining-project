This study investigates the challenge of motion blur in visual object tracking and explores a new approach called adversarial blur attack (ABA) to test the robustness of visual object trackers against motion blur. The objective is to deceive state-of-the-art trackers by transforming input frames into their motion-blurred counterparts. The researchers propose an optimization-based ABA (OP-ABA) method that synthesizes motion blur in tracking based on the principles of motion blur generation. However, OP-ABA is time-consuming, so they also propose a more efficient one-step ABA (OS-ABA) method. OS-ABA involves training a joint adversarial motion and accumulation predictive network (JAMANet) with guidance from OP-ABA. Experimental results on popular datasets demonstrate that both OP-ABA and OS-ABA can significantly reduce the accuracy of state-of-the-art trackers, with high transferability.
