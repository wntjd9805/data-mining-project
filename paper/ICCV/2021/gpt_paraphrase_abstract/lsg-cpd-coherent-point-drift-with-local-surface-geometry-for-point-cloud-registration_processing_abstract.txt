Probabilistic point cloud registration methods are increasingly popular due to their strong performance. However, most of these methods ignore important local surface geometric information and instead use isotropic Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) with spherical components. This approach only penalizes the point-to-point distance between point clouds. In this paper, we propose a new method called CPD with Local Surface Geometry (LSG-CPD) that addresses this limitation. LSG-CPD incorporates different levels of point-to-plane penalization based on the flatness of the local surface, resulting in GMM components with anisotropic covariances. We formulate point cloud registration as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem and solve it using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We demonstrate that the computation in the E step can be efficiently performed on a GPU using simple matrix manipulations. In the M step, we optimize the rigid transformation of the registration on a matrix Lie group. Our method outperforms current algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness on datasets captured with different types of sensors. Additionally, it is significantly faster than modern implementations of CPD. The source code for our method is available at https://github.com/ChirikjianLab/LSG-CPD.git.
