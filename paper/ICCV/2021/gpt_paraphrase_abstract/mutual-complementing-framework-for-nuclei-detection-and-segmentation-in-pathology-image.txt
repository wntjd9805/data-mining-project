The detection and segmentation of nuclei in pathology images are crucial for cancer diagnosis. Manual segmentation is time-consuming and expensive, while accurate detection is challenging due to various factors. Supervised methods require extensive annotated samples, and existing unsupervised methods fail on degenerated samples. This paper proposes a Mutual-Complementing Framework (MCF) for nuclei detection and segmentation in pathology images. MCF consists of two branches trained in a mutual-complementing manner. The detection branch complements the pseudo mask of the segmentation branch, while the segmentation branch complements missing nucleus templates. The detection branch employs response map fusion strategies and gradient direction-based postprocessing to obtain optimal detection results. The segmentation network is trained using a combination of confidence loss, synthetic samples, and self-fineting, focusing only on high confidence areas. MCF achieves comparable performance with limited supervision, showing robustness on degenerated samples, crucial for clinical diagnosis.
