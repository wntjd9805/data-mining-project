Deep generative models of 3D shapes have garnered significant attention in research. However, most existing models generate discrete shape representations like voxels, point clouds, and polygon meshes. In contrast, we introduce a novel approach to 3D generative modeling that represents shapes as sequences of computer-aided design (CAD) operations. Unlike meshes and point clouds, CAD models capture the process of creating 3D shapes, commonly used in industrial and engineering design tasks. Nevertheless, the sequential and irregular nature of CAD operations presents considerable challenges for current 3D generative models. To address this, we propose a CAD generative network based on the Transformer, drawing parallels between CAD operations and natural language. Our model performs well in both shape autoencoding and random shape generation tasks. To train the network, we compile a new CAD dataset comprising 178,238 models and their corresponding CAD construction sequences. We have publicly released this dataset to encourage further research in this area.
