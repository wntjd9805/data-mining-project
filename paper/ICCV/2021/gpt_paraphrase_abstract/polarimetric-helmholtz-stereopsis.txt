The concept of Helmholtz stereopsis (HS) is based on the reciprocity principle of light propagation, specifically the Helmholtz reciprocity. This principle allows for the reconstruction of 3D surfaces with arbitrary reflectance. This paper introduces a new approach called polarimetric Helmholtz stereopsis (polar-HS), which expands upon the classical HS method by considering the polarization state of light in the reciprocal paths. By incorporating phase information from polarization, polar-HS only requires a single reciprocal image pair for reconstruction. The authors propose new constraints based on reciprocity and diffuse/specular polarization to accurately determine surface depths and normals through an optimization framework. Experimental results using a hardware prototype demonstrate the effectiveness of the polar-HS approach in generating high-quality 3D reconstructions for various types of surfaces, ranging from diffuse to highly specular.
