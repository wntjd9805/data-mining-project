This paper introduces a novel approach to unsupervised domain adaptation called Active Universal Domain Adaptation (AUDA). AUDA aims to go beyond the limitations of existing methods by removing assumptions about label set relationships and recognizing target samples from both source and target-private classes. To achieve this, AUDA utilizes active learning to annotate a small budget of target data. However, adapting the model to the target domain and selecting informative target samples for annotation pose challenges due to large domain gaps and significant semantic shifts. To address these challenges, the authors propose an Active Universal Adaptation Network (AUAN). AUAN incorporates two key strategies: Adversarial and Diverse Curriculum Learning (ADCL) and Clustering Non-transferable Gradient Embedding (CNTGE). ADCL progressively aligns the source and target domains to classify target samples, while CNTGE employs transferability, diversity, and uncertainty clues to annotate informative target samples, enabling inference of labels for target-private classes. The authors also propose joint training of ADCL and CNTGE with target supervision to promote domain adaptation and recognition of target-private classes. The effectiveness of the proposed AUDA model, equipped with ADCL and CNTGE, is demonstrated through extensive experiments on four popular benchmarks. Overall, AUDA provides promising results for unsupervised domain adaptation in practical scenarios.
