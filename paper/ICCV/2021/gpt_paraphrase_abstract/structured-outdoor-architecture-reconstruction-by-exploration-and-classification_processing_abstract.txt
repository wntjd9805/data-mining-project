This study introduces a framework for reconstructing structured architecture from aerial images. The proposed approach involves exploring and classifying building models to enhance the accuracy of existing reconstruction algorithms. Initially, the framework modifies the reconstruction through heuristic actions to explore different building models. Then, it learns to classify the correctness of these models by comparing them to the ground-truth. This process is repeated iteratively during testing to achieve the best classification score. The approach is evaluated using initial reconstructions from two baseline algorithms and two state-of-the-art reconstruction algorithms. Both qualitative and quantitative assessments demonstrate consistent improvement in reconstruction quality compared to the initial reconstructions.
