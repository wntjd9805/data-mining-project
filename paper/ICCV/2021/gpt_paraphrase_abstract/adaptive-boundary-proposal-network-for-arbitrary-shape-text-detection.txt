We propose a new approach for detecting arbitrary shape text without the need for post-processing. Our method consists of a boundary proposal model and an adaptive boundary deformation model. The boundary proposal model generates prior information and coarse boundary proposals using multi-layer dilated convolutions. The adaptive boundary deformation model, which includes a Graph Convolutional Network and a Recurrent Neural Network, iteratively deforms boundaries based on the prior information from the boundary proposal model. This enables our method to efficiently generate accurate text boundaries without complex post-processing. Our experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/GXYM/TextBPN.
