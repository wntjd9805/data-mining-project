This paper introduces a novel approach called MIHO (Modeling the Interaction of Hand and Object) for simultaneously estimating the pose of the hand and the object it interacts with. While previous studies have focused on separately estimating the hand and object poses, this work addresses the challenge of modeling their interaction. The authors propose a contact representation called Contact Potential Field (CPF), where each pair of contacting vertices is treated as a spring-mass system. This creates a potential field with minimal elastic energy at the grasp position. Experimental results on commonly used benchmarks show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction metrics. It also produces physically plausible hand-object poses, even in cases of severe interpenetration or disjointedness. The code for this work is available at https://github.com/lixiny/CPF.
