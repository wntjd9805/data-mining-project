Unsupervised Domain Adaptation, which involves transferring knowledge from a well-annotated source domain to an unlabeled target domain, faces challenges when the source domain is not accessible or lacks sufficient memory storage. This situation, known as Source-free Domain Adaptation, only allows the use of a well-trained source model for target learning. To address the issue of unavailable source data, we introduce an Adaptive Adversarial Network (A2Net) consisting of three components. The first component, Adaptive Adversarial Inference, aims to improve the recognition of samples that are difficult for the source-specific classifier to identify by finding a target-specific classifier. The second component, Contrastive Category-wise Matching, enhances the compactness of the subspace for each category by leveraging the positive relation between pairs of target images. The third component, Self-Supervised Rotation, enables the model to learn additional semantics from target images independently. Through extensive experiments on popular cross-domain benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model in solving adaptation tasks without relying on any source data.
