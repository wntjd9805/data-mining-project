In object detection using convolutional neural networks (CNN), the optimization of classification and regression is typically done independently. This lack of interaction between the two leads to inconsistent predictions during training and inference phases, particularly for objects with irregular shapes or occlusion. This inconsistency hampers the performance of existing detectors after non-maximum suppression (N-MS). To address this, we propose a Harmonic loss that harmonizes the optimization of the classification and localization branches. The Harmonic loss allows these branches to mutually supervise and promote each other during training, resulting in consistent predictions with high co-occurrence of accurate classification and localization in the inference phase. To prevent outliers from dominating the localization loss during training, we introduce a Harmonic IoU loss that harmonizes the weight of the localization loss for samples with different IoU levels. Our model is evaluated on benchmark datasets (PASCAL VOC and MS COCO) and demonstrates its generality and effectiveness in improving the accuracy of existing object detectors.
