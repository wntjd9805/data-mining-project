The Image Signal Processor (ISP) is a crucial component in digital cameras that converts sensor signals into images for human perception. However, existing ISP designs have fixed architectures that may not be optimal for diverse real-world applications. To address this, we propose a novel Reconfigurable ISP (ReconfigISP) that can automatically adjust its architecture and parameters based on specific data and tasks. We implement multiple ISP modules and enable backpropagation for each module by training a differentiable proxy. This allows us to use differentiable neural architecture search to find the optimal ISP architecture. We also employ a proxy tuning mechanism to maintain the accuracy of proxy networks in all cases. Extensive experiments conducted on image restoration and object detection, considering different sensors, lighting conditions, and efficiency constraints, demonstrate the effectiveness of ReconfigISP. Only a few hundred parameters need tuning for each task.
