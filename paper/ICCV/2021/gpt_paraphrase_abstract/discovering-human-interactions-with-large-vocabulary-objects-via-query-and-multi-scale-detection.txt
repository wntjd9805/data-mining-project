This study focuses on human-object interaction (HOI) detection with a large number of object categories. Previous research in HOI detection has mostly been limited to a smaller number of object categories (e.g., 80 categories), which may not be suitable for the increasing diversity of objects (e.g., 1000 categories). In contrast to previous methods, we approach HOI detection as a query problem. We propose a unified model that can identify target objects and predict corresponding interactions based on human queries, eliminating the need for generic object detectors, additional steps for associating human-object instances, and multi-stream interaction recognition. We achieve this through a repurposed Transformer unit and a novel cascade detection method using multi-scale feature maps. This highly-coupled solution benefits both object detection and interaction classification in a large vocabulary setting. To address the challenges of large vocabulary HOI detection, we create two datasets from the SWiG and 100 Days of Hands datasets. Experiments using these datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves HOI detection mean Average Precision (mAP) and has a faster inference speed compared to existing one-stage HOI detectors.
