Lane detection is a crucial task in autonomous driving vehicles. However, the current approach of relying on annotated images for lane detection is burdensome. While active learning has been successful in reducing annotation in various computer vision tasks, it has not been explored for lane detection. We conducted experiments and discovered that existing active learning methods are not suitable for lane detection due to two main reasons. Firstly, these methods evaluate data uncertainties based on entropy, which is unfavorable for lane detection as it tends to select images with very few or no lanes at all. Secondly, existing methods do not consider the noise in lane annotations caused by occlusion and unclear lane marks. In this study, we propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that evaluates image uncertainty based on the knowledge acquired by the student model. Our proposed uncertainty metric addresses the aforementioned problems. To further reduce data redundancy, we investigate the influence sets of image samples and introduce a new diversity metric for data selection. Finally, we integrate the uncertainty and diversity metrics and develop a greedy algorithm for data selection. Our experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on lane detection benchmarks. Additionally, we extend our method to 2D object detection and observe its effectiveness in this domain as well.
