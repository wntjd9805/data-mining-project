Existing mesh reconstruction models have limitations in capturing local geometry details and reconstructing meshes of various genus. In this study, we propose a pixel-to-mesh framework that addresses these challenges by incorporating geometry structure extraction, pixel-to-mesh mapping, and mesh editing. Our framework improves the fidelity of reconstruction by considering structural information and repairing non-closed boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing methods.
