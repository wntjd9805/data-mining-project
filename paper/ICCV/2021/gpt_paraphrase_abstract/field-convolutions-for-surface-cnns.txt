We introduce a new type of convolution operator for vector fields on surfaces. Instead of combining neighboring features based on a single coordinate parameterization, we allow each neighbor to describe the position of the point within its own coordinate frame. This formulation combines spatial convolution with parallel transport, making it robust to noise and other factors. We call this concept field convolution, which is well-suited for CNNs on surfaces. Field convolutions are flexible and easy to incorporate into surface learning frameworks, and their discriminative nature has a significant impact on the learning process. By using networks with residual field convolution blocks, we achieve state-of-the-art results in shape classification, segmentation, correspondence, and sparse matching tasks in geometry processing benchmarks.
