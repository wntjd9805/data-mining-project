The task of fine-grained 3D segmentation is crucial in understanding 3D objects, particularly in applications like intelligent manufacturing and parts analysis. However, there are several challenges that have not been addressed, including interpreting complex structures in different regions of 3D objects and accurately capturing fine-grained structures. Current deep learning and graph machine learning methods are not successful in overcoming these challenges, resulting in subpar performance in fine-grained 3D analysis.  To address these issues, this study combines methods from topological data analysis with a geometric deep learning model for fine-grained segmentation of 3D objects. A novel neural network model called Persistent Homology based Graph Convolution Network (PHGCN) is proposed. This model integrates persistent homology into a graph convolution network to capture multi-scale structural information and accurately represent complex structures in 3D objects. Additionally, a new loss function called Persistence Diagram Loss (LPD) is introduced to ensure topology correctness in segmenting fine-grained structures.  Extensive experiments on fine-grained 3D segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PHGCN model and its significant improvements over current state-of-the-art methods.
