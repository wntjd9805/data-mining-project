The increasing popularity of image editing tools has raised concerns about the authenticity of images, particularly in cases of forgery such as splicing, copy-move, and removal. While existing methods for detecting image forgery have shown success on public datasets, they often struggle when the images have been JPEG compressed, as is common on social networks. This paper introduces a self-supervised domain adaptation network for JPEG-resistant image forgery detection. The network consists of a backbone network with Siamese architecture and a compression approximation network (ComNet). To improve performance against JPEG compression, ComNet is trained to approximate the characteristics of JPEG compression through self-supervised learning, generating JPEG-agent images. The backbone network is then trained using domain adaptation to accurately locate the tampered areas and reduce the domain shift between uncompressed and JPEG-agent images. Extensive experiments on various public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in image forgery detection, particularly for JPEG compression with unknown quality factors (QFs).
