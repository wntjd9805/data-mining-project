This study addresses the issue of label noise in training deep face recognition systems. The authors propose a model that uses meta-learning to automatically clean noisy training data and improve performance. The model learns reliable cleaning knowledge from well-labeled noisy data and gradually transfers it to the target data. To address the drift problem in transfer learning, a threshold adapter module is introduced. The proposed method is evaluated on two noisy face recognition datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the IJB-C benchmark.
