We introduce GTT-Net, a supervised learning system that reconstructs sparse dynamic 3D geometry. Our approach is based on a graph-theoretic formulation of the generalized trajectory triangulation problem, which assumes knowledge of non-concurrent multi-view imaging geometry but lacks global image sequencing. GTT-Net utilizes pairwise affinities to model the spatio-temporal relationships between input observations and estimate 3D geometry. We conducted experiments on reconstructing 3D motion-capture sequences, which demonstrated that GTT-Net surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness. In the field of articulated motion reconstruction, our proposed architecture has the ability to learn and enforce semantic 3D motion priors for shared training and test domains, while also being capable of generalizing its performance to different training and test domains. Furthermore, GTT-Net offers a computationally efficient framework for trajectory triangulation, making it suitable for multi-instance reconstruction and event segmentation applications.
