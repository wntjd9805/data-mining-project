Point cloud segmentation is an essential task in 3D analysis. Although deep learning methods have made advancements in this area, they often assume clean labels and struggle with noisy labels. This is particularly problematic in real-world point cloud datasets where object class labels are frequently mislabeled. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework called PointNoise-Adaptive Learning (PNAL). Unlike existing noise-robust methods for image tasks, PNAL is designed to handle the spatially variant noise rate specific to point clouds, regardless of the noise level. Our approach involves a point-wise confidence selection technique that relies on historical predictions to determine reliable labels. Additionally, we introduce a cluster-wise label correction method that considers neighbor point correlations through a voting strategy. We extensively evaluate PNAL on synthetic and real-world noisy datasets, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness. Even with 60% symmetric noisy labels, our method outperforms the baseline approach without PNAL and is comparable to an ideal upper bound trained on a completely clean dataset. Moreover, we meticulously re-labeled the validation set of the popular but noisy ScanNetV2 scene dataset, providing a clean dataset for future research. The code and data for our approach will be made available to the public.
