Weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL) allows for object detection using a dataset that lacks explicit localization information. By training a classification model with only image-level annotations, the model's feature map can be utilized as a score map for localization. However, there is currently no standard method for normalizing the class activation map (CAM) in WSOL, leading to underutilization of the methods' potential. This paper reviews existing normalization methods and highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate method based on the dataset's characteristics. Additionally, a new normalization method is proposed, which significantly improves the performance of CAM-based WSOL methods. The proposed method is evaluated on three datasets (CUB, ImageNet, and Open-Images) using three different architectures, demonstrating consistent performance gains compared to the conventional min-max normalization method. Figure 1 provides a comparison of WSOL methods with different normalization techniques for a class activation map, showing that our proposed method, IVR, achieves the highest accuracy. The evaluation metric suggested in [6] is used, and the scores presented in the figure are the average scores across ResNet50, VGG16, and InceptionV3. Overall, our normalization method, IVR, outperforms all other WSOL methods in terms of performance.
