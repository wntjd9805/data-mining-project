The use of Geometry Projection in monocular 3D object detection is a valuable method for estimating depth. However, this method also introduces an error amplification problem, where the error in estimated height is greatly reflected in the output depth. This leads to uncontrollable depth inferences and hampers training efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Geometry Uncertainty Projection Network (GUP Net). This network includes a GUP module that calculates the uncertainty of inferred depth using geometry guidance. This not only provides reliable confidence for each depth estimation but also aids in depth learning. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Task Learning strategy during the training stage to minimize the instability caused by error amplification. This strategy monitors the learning progress of each task using an indicator and assigns appropriate loss weights based on the pre-task situation. Each task only begins learning once its pre-tasks have been successfully learned, enhancing the stability and efficiency of the training process. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of object depth inference, surpassing the state-of-the-art image-based monocular 3D detectors by 3.74% and 4.7% AP40 in the car and pedestrian categories, respectively, on the KITTI benchmark.
