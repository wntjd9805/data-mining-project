The issue of synchronization involves determining the unknown values associated with the vertices of a graph. In this graph, the edges are labeled with the ratio of the connected vertices, and the labels belong to a group. This study focuses on the synchronization problem in multi-graphs, which are graphs that have more than one edge connecting the same pair of nodes. This problem arises when there are multiple measures available to represent the relationship between two vertices. This can occur when different sensors measure the same quantity or when the original graph is divided into sub-graphs that are solved independently. In such cases, the relationships among sub-graphs result in multi-edges, and the problem can be seen as a multi-graph synchronization problem. The current solution for this problem involves averaging the multi-edges to simplify the multi-graphs. However, this approach has limitations because averaging is only well-defined for certain groups, and the resulting estimator is less precise and accurate, as demonstrated through empirical evidence. To address these limitations, this paper introduces MULTISYNC, a synchronization algorithm for multi-graphs. MULTISYNC is based on a principled constrained eigenvalue optimization and offers a general solution that can handle any linear group. The effectiveness of MULTISYNC is demonstrated through experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world problems.
