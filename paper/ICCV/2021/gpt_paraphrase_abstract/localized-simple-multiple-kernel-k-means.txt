Simple multiple kernel k-means (SimpleMKKM) is a clustering algorithm that combines multiple kernel matrices to improve clustering performance. However, SimpleMKKM has a limitation in that it treats all sample pairs equally, without considering the variation of samples. This leads to unsatisfactory clustering results. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new algorithm that focuses on aligning the similarity of a sample to its k-nearest neighbors with the ideal similarity matrix. This approach allows the algorithm to prioritize closer sample pairs and avoid unreliable similarity evaluations for farther sample pairs. The authors theoretically demonstrate that SimpleMKKM is a special case of this new algorithm, and propose a localized version of SimpleMKKM that can be implemented using existing packages. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the localized version consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The code for the localized SimpleMKKM algorithm is publicly available.
