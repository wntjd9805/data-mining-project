A typical man-made structure can be simplified as the Manhattan world assumption, where it is represented by a Manhattan Frame (MF) with three orthogonal axes. The problem of estimating the MF rotation can be solved by determining the rotation between the MF and the camera frame. However, the entire rotation space is not necessary for solving the MF rotation, which hinders computational efficiency. This study demonstrates that the volume of the space containing all MF rotations is only 1/24 of the total rotation space. An exact MFR space is then identified from the rotation space, allowing for efficient search within it using a branch-and-bound (BnB) framework. This approach ensures stability and efficiency in MF estimation and also improves the efficiency of solving general rotation problems. Experiments using synthetic and real datasets confirm the effectiveness of this approach.
