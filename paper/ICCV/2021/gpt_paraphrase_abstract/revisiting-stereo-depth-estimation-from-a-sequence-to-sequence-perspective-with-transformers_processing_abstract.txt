Stereo depth estimation is typically achieved by finding optimal correspondences between pixels in the left and right images to determine depth. In this study, we propose a new approach called STereo TRansformer (STTR) that tackles this problem by considering sequence-to-sequence correspondence. Instead of constructing a cost volume, we use dense pixel matching with position information and attention. STTR offers several advantages: 1) it removes the constraint of a fixed disparity range, 2) it identifies occluded areas and provides confidence estimates, and 3) it enforces uniqueness constraints during the matching process. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate promising results, showing that STTR can generalize well across different domains even without fine-tuning.
