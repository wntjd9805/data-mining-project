This paper introduces a new method for estimating high-resolution optical flow using a 1D attention operation and 1D correlation. Inspired by Transformers, the method reduces computational complexity and allows for large displacement matching in high-resolution images. By applying attention in the vertical direction and correlation in the horizontal direction, the method achieves 2D correspondence modeling. Additionally, the method can exchange the directions of attention and correlation, resulting in two 3D cost volumes that are concatenated for optical flow estimation. The proposed 1D formulation enables the method to handle very high-resolution input images while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments on Sintel, KITTI, and real-world 4K resolution images validate the effectiveness and superiority of the method.
