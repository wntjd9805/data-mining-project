This study presents a novel algorithm for self-calibrating cameras with arbitrary non-linear distortions. Unlike previous methods that rely solely on geometric constraints, our approach incorporates both geometric and photometric consistency by learning the scene geometry using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). We propose a new geometric loss function called projected ray distance loss to ensure geometric consistency in complex non-linear camera models. Our experiments on real image datasets demonstrate that our model can accurately learn camera parameters without the need for initialization. Furthermore, we show that our differentiable approach improves the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) compared to existing methods. Our module can be easily integrated into NeRF variants to enhance their performance. The code and data for our algorithm are available at https://github.com/POSTECH-CVLab/SCNeRF.
