We propose a novel deblurring method called PyNAS (pyramid neural architecture search network) to overcome the challenge of manually designing lightweight and efficient networks for removing blurs in dynamic scenes. PyNAS automatically designs hyperparameters including scales, patches, and standard cell operators using gradient-based search strategies. Unlike previous methods, PyNAS searches the hierarchy patch and scale scheme rather than just cell searching. The search strategy follows a top-to-bottom principle, distinguishing between top-level variables (pyramid-scales and pyramid-patches) and bottom-level variables (cell operators) to search multi-scale variables. To avoid collapse and computational issues, PyNAS employs an early stopping strategy during the search stage. We also use a path-level binarization mechanism for multi-scale cell searching to reduce memory consumption. Our main contribution is a real-time deblurring algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GoPro and VideoDeblurring datasets, processing 720p images at around 58 fps.
