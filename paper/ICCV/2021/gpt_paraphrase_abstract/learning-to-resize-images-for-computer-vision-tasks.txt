Despite the significant advancements made by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision, the impact of image size on training accuracy has been largely overlooked. Typically, input images are resized to a small spatial resolution for efficiency, using off-the-shelf resizers such as bilinear and bicubic. However, these resizers may limit the performance of trained networks. In this study, we demonstrate that learned resizers can greatly enhance performance compared to traditional linear resizers. Our approach involves jointly training a CNN-based resizer with a baseline vision model, which produces machine-friendly visual manipulations that consistently improve task performance. Specifically, we focus on the classification task using the ImageNet dataset and experiment with different models to develop resizers tailored to each model. Furthermore, we show that the proposed resizer can also be applied to fine-tune classification baselines for other vision tasks, such as image quality assessment on the AVA dataset.
