This paper explores the matching of low-light scene images, with the aim of advancing the applications of Structure from Motion (SfM) and visualSLAM. Modern image sensors can capture scenes with high precision in their RAW-format images, exceeding eight-bit brightness resolution. The objective is to effectively utilize this high-precision information to match extremely low-light scene images that traditional methods are unable to handle. Despite the presence of some brightness information in the low bits of RAW-format images for such scenes, conventional camera raw image processing fails to utilize it effectively. Recent research by Chen et al. demonstrated that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can learn to generate visually appealing images from RAW-format images. To investigate the potential of utilizing such information stored in RAW-format images for image matching, a new dataset called MID (matching in the dark) was created. This dataset was used to experimentally evaluate the performance of different combinations of eight image-enhancing methods and eleven image matching methods, including classical/neural local descriptors and classical/neural initial point-matching techniques. The results highlight the advantages of using RAW-format images and provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the various component methods. Furthermore, the findings suggest that there is scope for future research in this area.
