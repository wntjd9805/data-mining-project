In the context of scanning devices, point clouds are often affected by noise, which can disrupt subsequent tasks like surface reconstruction and analysis. This noise can be seen as the result of convolving a noise-free point cloud distribution with a noise model, ultimately yielding a distribution with a mode representing the clean underlying surface. To address this issue, we propose a method to denoise a point cloud by increasing the log-likelihood of each point through gradient ascent, thereby iteratively updating their positions. Since the convolved distribution is unknown during test-time and we only require the score (i.e., the gradient of the log-probability function) for gradient ascent, we introduce a neural network architecture to estimate the score of the convolved distribution using only noisy point clouds as input. We establish objective functions for training the network and develop a denoising algorithm that utilizes the estimated scores. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model surpasses state-of-the-art methods across various noise models and exhibits potential for application in other tasks like point cloud upsampling.
