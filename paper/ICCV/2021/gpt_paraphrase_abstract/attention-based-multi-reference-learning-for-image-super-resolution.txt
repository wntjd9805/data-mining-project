This paper presents a new approach called Attention-based Multi-Reference Super-resolution network (AMRSR) for enhancing the resolution of low-resolution images. The AMRSR network utilizes multiple reference images to transfer similar textures to the super-resolution output while maintaining spatial coherence. Compared to existing reference super-resolution methods, the use of multiple reference images with attention-based sampling significantly improves the performance on various benchmark datasets. Multi-reference super-resolution addresses the challenge of image super-resolution by providing a diverse range of image features to compensate for the lack of information while being memory-efficient. The paper introduces a novel hierarchical attention-based sampling technique that learns the similarity between low-resolution image features and multiple reference images using a perceptual loss. Ablation studies demonstrate the contributions of both multi-reference and hierarchical attention-based sampling to the overall performance. The proposed approach achieves significant improvements in performance, even when the reference images differ significantly from the target image.
