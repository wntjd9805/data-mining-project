This paper addresses the issue of detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) objects in semantic segmentation. Existing methods in the literature are either accurate or fast, but not both, limiting their practicality. To overcome this limitation, we propose four design principles: separating OOD detection from the segmentation task, considering the entire segmentation network, generating training data for the OOD detector using blind spots in the network, and focusing on localized regions in the image to simulate OOD objects. Our main contribution is a new OOD detection architecture called ObsNet, along with a dedicated training scheme using LocalAdversarial Attacks (LAA). Through various ablation studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Additionally, we compare our method to ten recent approaches on three datasets and show superior performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.
