There have been significant advancements in visual re-localisation research due to benchmark datasets that assess the accuracy of camera poses. These datasets often rely on a reference algorithm, such as Structure-from-Motion (SfM) or Simultaneous-Localisation-and-Mapping (SLAM), to generate pseudo ground truth poses for numerous images. However, it is worth considering whether the choice of reference algorithm favors a specific type of re-localisation method. This study examines two commonly used re-localisation datasets and demonstrates that the evaluation results differ based on the reference algorithm used. As a result, the commonly accepted beliefs in re-localisation literature, such as the superiority of learning-based scene coordinate regression over classical feature-based methods, and RGB-D-based methods over RGB-based methods, are questioned. The authors argue that any rankings of re-localisation methods should consider the type of reference algorithm used and the similarity of the methods to that reference algorithm.
