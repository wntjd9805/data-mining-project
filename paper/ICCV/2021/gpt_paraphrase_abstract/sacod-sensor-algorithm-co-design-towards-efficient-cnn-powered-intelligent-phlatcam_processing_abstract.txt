The demand for integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) into Internet-of-Thing (IoT) devices, particularly for IoT cameras, has been increasing. However, there are two main challenges that limit the extensive use of these IoT systems. Firstly, certain applications, such as those related to medicine and wearables, have strict requirements for the camera's size. Secondly, powerful CNNs often require significant storage and energy resources, which are limited in IoT devices. While PhlatCam offers a potential solution to the size challenge, the second challenge remains a bottleneck. Existing compression techniques focus mainly on the CNN algorithm itself and do not fully realize the potential for storage and energy reduction. In response, this work proposes SACoD, a Sensor Algorithm Co-Design framework that aims to develop a more efficient CNN-powered PhlatCam. SACoD optimizes both the mask coded in the PhlatCam sensor and the backend CNN model through differential neural architecture search, considering model parameters and architectures. Extensive experiments, including simulations and physical measurements on manufactured masks, demonstrate that the SACoD framework achieves significant model compression and energy savings without compromising task accuracy. The proposed framework is benchmarked against two state-of-the-art designs using six datasets across four different vision tasks. The code for SACoD is available at: https://github.com/RICE-EIC/SACoD.
