A new generative model for layout generation is proposed in this study. The process involves three steps: generating layout elements as nodes in a layout graph, establishing constraints between layout elements as edges in the same graph, and finally solving for the optimal layout using constrained optimization. The first two steps are based on transformer architectures, while the layout optimization efficiently implements the constraints. The study presents three significant contributions compared to existing methods: it does not require any user input, generates higher quality layouts, and enables new possibilities for conditional layout generation.
