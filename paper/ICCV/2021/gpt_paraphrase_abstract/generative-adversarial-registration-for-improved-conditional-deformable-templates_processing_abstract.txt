Deformable templates play a crucial role in medical image analysis, such as registration, segmentation, and population analysis. However, current methods often produce templates with blurred or anatomically implausible appearances, which hinder their interpretation in biomedical applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that combines deformable registration and conditional template estimation through an adversarial game framework. By incorporating flexible image covariates, our method generates templates that are more realistic, age and disease-specific, and better aligned with spatiotemporal trends in the population. Moreover, these templates exhibit improved sharpness and centrality, facilitating more accurate population modeling and easier identification of anatomical structures. Overall, our approach enhances the quality and utility of deformable templates for standardized downstream analyses in medical image analysis.
