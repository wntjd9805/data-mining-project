Accurate estimation of lighting is a difficult but crucial task in computer vision and computer graphics applications, such as HDR relighting. Existing methods for modeling lighting either in the frequency or spatial domain are inadequate for representing complex lighting conditions in scenes, resulting in inaccurate estimation. This paper introduces a new lighting estimation model called NeedleLight, which utilizes needlets to represent illumination and allows estimation in both frequency and spatial domains. A thresholding function is designed to achieve sparse needlets, reducing redundant lighting parameters and improving localization properties. Additionally, a novel spherical transport loss based on optimal transport theory is proposed to guide the regression of lighting representation parameters while considering spatial information. Moreover, a concise and effective metric is proposed that directly evaluates estimated illumination maps rather than rendered images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeedleLight consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in lighting estimation across multiple evaluation metrics.
