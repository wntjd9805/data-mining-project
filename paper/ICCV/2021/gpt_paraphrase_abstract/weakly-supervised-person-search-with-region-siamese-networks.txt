Supervised learning is the predominant approach in person search, but it requires extensive labeling of bounding boxes and identities, which can be challenging to collect, especially for person identities. This raises the question of whether a person search model can be trained effectively without identity supervision. This paper introduces a weakly supervised setting where only bounding box annotations are available. In this setting, a baseline model called RegionSiamese Networks (R-SiamNets) is proposed. To learn useful representations for recognition without identity labels, the R-SiamNet is supervised using instance-level consistency loss and cluster-level contrastive loss. Instance-level consistency learning ensures that the R-SiamNet extracts consistent features from each person region, regardless of the presence or absence of out-of-region context. Cluster-level contrastive learning encourages the aggregation of similar instances and the separation of dissimilar ones in feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the weakly supervised method. The proposed model achieves a rank-1 accuracy of 87.1% and a mean average precision (mAP) of 86.0% on the CUHK-SYSU benchmark, outperforming fully supervised methods like OIM and MGTS. The performance can be further improved by incorporating additional training data. This work aims to inspire future research in this field.
