Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have achieved impressive results in skeleton-based action recognition by effectively aggregating joint features through graph topology. In this study, we propose a novel approach called Channel-wise Topology Refinement Graph Convolution (CTR-GC) to dynamically learn different topologies and aggregate joint features in different channels. CTR-GC models channel-wise topologies by learning a shared topology as a generic prior for all channels and refining it with channel-specific correlations. Our refinement method introduces minimal additional parameters, making it easier to model channel-wise topologies. Additionally, we find that CTR-GC relaxes the strict constraints of graph convolutions by reformulating them into a unified form, resulting in enhanced representation capability. By combining CTR-GC with temporal modeling modules, we develop a powerful graph convolutional network named CTR-GCN, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets.
