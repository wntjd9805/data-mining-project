This paper focuses on the unsupervised recovery of human mesh from a single image. To tackle the challenges of this task, namely pose failure and shape ambiguity, the authors propose a lightweight framework called Skeleton2Mesh. This framework consists of three modules: Differentiable Inverse Kinematics (DIK), Pose Refinement (PR), and Shape Refinement (SR). DIK transfers 3D rotation from estimated 3D skeletons using minimal kinematics prior knowledge. PR and SR modules address pose ambiguity and shape ambiguity, respectively. The three modules are seamlessly incorporated into Skeleton2Mesh in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, an adaptive joint regressor is used to mitigate the effects of skeletal topology from different datasets. Experimental results on the Human3.6M dataset show that the proposed method outperforms previous unsupervised methods by 32.6% under the same conditions. Qualitative results on in-the-wild datasets demonstrate that the recovered 3D meshes are natural and realistic. The project is accessible at https://sites.google.com/view/skeleton2mesh.
