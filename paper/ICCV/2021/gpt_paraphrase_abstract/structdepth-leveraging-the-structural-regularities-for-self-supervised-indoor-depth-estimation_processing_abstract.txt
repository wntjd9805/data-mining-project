The performance of self-supervised monocular depth estimation is impressive for outdoor datasets but degrades in indoor environments due to the lack of textures. To address this issue, we utilize the structural regularities observed in indoor scenes to enhance the training of depth networks. We introduce two additional supervisory signals: the Manhattan normal constraint, which aligns major surfaces with dominant directions (such as the floor, ceiling, and walls), and the co-planar constraint, which ensures that 3D points within the same planar region are well-fitted by a plane. These supervisory signals are generated by classifying major surface normals into dominant directions and detecting planar regions during training. As the predicted depth improves with more training epochs, the supervisory signals also enhance and contribute to a better depth model. Extensive experiments on indoor benchmark datasets demonstrate that our network surpasses state-of-the-art methods. The source code can be found at https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/StructDepth.
