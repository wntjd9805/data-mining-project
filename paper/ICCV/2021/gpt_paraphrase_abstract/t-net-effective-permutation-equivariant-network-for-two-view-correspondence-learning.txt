We have developed T-Net, a framework for learning correspondences between two views that is simple, flexible, and effective. T-Net utilizes two novel structures, namely the "−" structure and the "|" structure, to reject outliers and regress the relative pose encoded by the essential matrix. The "−" structure employs an iterative strategy to learn correspondence features, while the "|" structure combines all the features from the iterations to output the correspondence weight. Additionally, we introduce the Permutation-Equivariant Context Squeeze-and-Excitation module, which processes sparse correspondences in a permutation-equivariant manner and captures both global and channel-wise contextual information. Through extensive experiments on outdoor and indoor scenes, we demonstrate that T-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance. On outdoor scenes (YFCC100M dataset), T-Net achieves an mAP of 52.28%, representing a 34.22% precision improvement over the best-published result (38.95%). On indoor scenes (SUN3D dataset), T-Net achieves a precision increase of 21.82% (19.71% precision) compared to the best-published result (16.18%).
