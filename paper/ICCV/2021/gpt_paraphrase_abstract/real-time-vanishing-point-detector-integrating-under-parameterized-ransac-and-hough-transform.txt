We propose a new method for detecting vanishing points (VPs) in un-calibrated monocular images by combining under-parameterized RANSAC (UPRANSAC) with the Hough Transform. Our algorithm first selects a hypothetical inlier from a sample set using UPRANSAC to determine a portion of the VP's degrees of freedom. Then, a reliable brute-force voting scheme (1-D Hough Transform) is applied to find the remaining degrees of freedom along the extension line of the hypothetical inlier. We can sequentially detect multiple VPs by removing inliers from minimal sample sets until a stop criterion is met. Compared to traditional RANSAC, our UPRANSAC has a higher likelihood of hitting at least one inlier, making it more reliable for VP detection. Additionally, our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the Hough Transform by reducing the voting space to only one parameter. Experimental results using benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves higher or comparable detection accuracies compared to the state-of-the-art methods, while operating in real-time.
