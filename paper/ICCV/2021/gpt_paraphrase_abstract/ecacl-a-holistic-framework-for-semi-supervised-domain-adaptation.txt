This paper examines Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA), a research area that aims to develop a high-performing model using a small number of labeled samples in the target domain, with the assistance of labeled samples from a source domain. While several SSDA methods have been proposed recently, they do not fully utilize the value of the limited labeled target samples. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive SSDA framework called Enhanced Categorical Alignment and Consistency Learning (ECACL). ECACL incorporates multiple domain alignment techniques that complement each other. It includes two categorical domain alignment techniques for class-level alignment, a data augmentation technique to improve generalizability, and a consistency learning technique to increase robustness against image perturbations. These techniques can be applied to one or more of the three inputs (labeled source, unlabeled target, and labeled target) and align the domains from various perspectives. ECACL unifies these techniques and achieves more comprehensive domain alignments compared to existing methods. For instance, ECACL improves the state-of-the-art accuracy from 68.4 to 81.1 on VisDA2017 and from 45.5 to 53.4 on DomainNet in the 1-shot setting.
