Detecting and classifying cells in digital pathology is crucial for automated diagnostic and prognostic tasks. However, accurately classifying cells into subtypes, such as tumor cells, lymphocytes, or stromal cells, poses a significant challenge. Existing methods primarily rely on analyzing the morphological characteristics of individual cells, whereas pathologists often consider the spatial context of cells when assigning their classes. In this study, we propose a novel approach that integrates spatial contextual information into both cell detection and classification. To accomplish this, we utilize a spatial statistical function to capture the local density of cells in a multi-class and multi-scale manner. By combining representation learning and deep clustering techniques, we develop a sophisticated cell representation that incorporates both appearance and spatial context. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in the classification task, as demonstrated by its superior performance on various benchmark datasets.
