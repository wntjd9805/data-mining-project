Current halftoning algorithms often lose colors and fine details when converting color images into binary dot patterns, making it difficult to recover the original information. To address this issue, we propose a new halftoning technique that allows for full restoration of the original image. Our approach involves embedding the previously dropped information into the halftone patterns, which not only reproduce the image tone and maintain randomness, but also represent color information and fine details. We employ two collaborative convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the dithering scheme, using a self-supervision formulation. To mitigate the problem of CNN flatness degradation, we introduce a novel noise incentive block (NIB) that can enhance performance as a generic plug-in for CNNs. Additionally, we develop a guiding-aware training scheme to ensure regulated convergence direction. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our invertible halftoning method.
