Unsupervised domain adaptation has been a successful method for reducing the manual annotation workload by aligning synthetic and real-world data. However, unconditionally mapping the target-domain distribution to the source-domain can distort the structural information of the target-domain data. In this study, we propose a new active learning strategy using multiple anchors to assist in domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. Instead of using a single centroid, the use of multiple anchors allows for a better characterization of the source domain as a multimodal distribution. This enables the selection of more representative and complementary samples from the target domain with minimal manual annotation. By doing so, we effectively alleviate the distortion of the target-domain distribution and achieve a significant performance improvement. We also employ the multi-anchor strategy to model the target distribution and use a novel soft alignment loss to regulate the latent representation of the target samples around the anchors. This results in more precise segmentation. Through extensive experiments on public datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to confirm the effectiveness of each component. The code for our approach will be made available at https://github.com/munanning/MADA in the near future.
