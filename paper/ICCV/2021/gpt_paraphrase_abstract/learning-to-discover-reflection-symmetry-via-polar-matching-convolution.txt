Detecting reflection symmetry is a difficult task due to the variations and ambiguities present in real-world symmetry patterns. Traditional convolutional networks struggle with this task because they are not capable of handling rotational and reflection equivariance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new convolutional technique called polar matching convolution. This technique incorporates polar feature pooling, self-similarity encoding, and a systematic kernel design for different angles. By using high-dimensional kernel convolution, our network effectively learns to identify symmetry patterns in real-world images. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset and employ a self-supervised learning strategy by augmenting the dataset with synthesized images. Experimental results show that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness.
