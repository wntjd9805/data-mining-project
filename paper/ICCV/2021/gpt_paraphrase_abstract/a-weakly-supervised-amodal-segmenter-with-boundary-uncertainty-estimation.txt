This paper focuses on an approach called weakly supervised amodal instance segmentation, which involves segmenting both visible and occluded object parts. The training data only provides ground-truth visible segmentations. To train a segmenter that can predict amodal segmentations, the training images are manipulated to generate occlusions. The resulting predictions on training images are used as pseudo-ground truth for training Mask-RCNN, which is used for amodal instance segmentation on test images. A new Amodal Segmenter based on Boundary Uncertainty estimation (ASBU) is proposed for generating the pseudo-ground truth. ASBU differs from prior work by using the occlusion boundary as input instead of the occluder's mask. Additionally, ASBU estimates an uncertainty map of the prediction, which helps regularize learning by reducing segmentation loss in regions with high uncertainty. ASBU outperforms the state of the art on the COCOA and KINS datasets in three tasks: amodal instance segmentation, amodal completion, and ordering recovery.
