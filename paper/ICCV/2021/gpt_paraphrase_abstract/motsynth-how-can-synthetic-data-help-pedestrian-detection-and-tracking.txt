Deep learning methods that detect and track pedestrians in videos require a significant amount of training data. However, obtaining this data in public areas raises privacy concerns and manual annotation is time-consuming, especially for videos. Labeling pedestrians in crowded scenarios is also challenging and prone to errors. This paper explores the use of synthetic data to improve multi-person tracking. The researchers create MOTSynth, a large and diverse synthetic dataset for object detection and tracking using a rendering game engine. Their experiments demonstrate that MOTSynth can effectively replace real data for tasks such as pedestrian detection, re-identification, segmentation, and tracking.
