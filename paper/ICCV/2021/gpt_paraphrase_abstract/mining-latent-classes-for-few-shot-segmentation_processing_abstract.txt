Few-shot segmentation (FSS) is the task of segmenting new classes with limited annotated samples. Existing methods have a problem called feature undermining, where potential novel classes are mistakenly treated as background during training. To address this issue and improve feature embedding on latent novel classes, we propose a novel joint-training framework. Our approach includes an additional mining branch that utilizes transferable sub-clusters to exploit latent novel classes, as well as a rectification technique for both background and foreground categories to ensure more stable prototypes. Moreover, our transferable sub-cluster can leverage unlabeled data for further feature enhancement. Through extensive experiments on two FSS benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a 3.7% higher mean intersection over union (mIOU) on PASCAL-5i and a 7.0% higher mIOU on COCO-20i. Additionally, our method requires 74% fewer parameters and has 2.5 times faster inference speed.
