Most recent video super-resolution (SR) methods either use an iterative approach to handle low-resolution (LR) frames from a sliding window or use previously estimated SR output to recursively reconstruct the current frame. Some studies have attempted to combine these two approaches into a hybrid framework but have not fully utilized its potential. In this paper, we propose an omniscient framework that not only incorporates the preceding SR output but also utilizes SR outputs from the present and future. This omniscient framework is more versatile as it encompasses iterative, recurrent, and hybrid frameworks as special cases. Our proposed framework enables a generator to outperform its counterparts in other frameworks. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of objective metrics, subjective visual effects, and complexity.
