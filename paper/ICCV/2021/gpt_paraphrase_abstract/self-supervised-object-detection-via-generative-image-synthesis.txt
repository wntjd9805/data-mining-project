We introduce SSOD, the first framework for self-supervised object detection that utilizes controllable GANs for end-to-end analysis-by-synthesis. Our approach learns to synthesize and detect objects using real-world images without bounding box annotations. By leveraging controllable GANs, we generate images with predefined object properties and train object detectors using these synthetic images. We propose a tightly integrated synthesis and detection network to optimize the training of our system. Additionally, we propose a method to adapt SSOD to target data without labels. In evaluating car detection on the KITTI and Cityscapes datasets, we demonstrate that SSOD outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method, Wetectron, which is purely image-based. Furthermore, even without 3DCAD assets, SSOD surpasses the rendering-based method Meta-Sim2. Our work advances the field of self-supervised object detection by introducing a successful paradigm of using controllable GAN-based image synthesis and significantly improving baseline accuracy. The code for SSOD is open-source and available at https://github.com/NVlabs/SSOD.
