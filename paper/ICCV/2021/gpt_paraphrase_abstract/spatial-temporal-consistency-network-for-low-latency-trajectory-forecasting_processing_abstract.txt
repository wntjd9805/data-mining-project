Trajectory forecasting is crucial for autonomous vehicles and mobile robots to navigate safely. Existing graph-based approaches lack a strong temporal model and only consider motion on a frame-to-frame basis. To address this limitation, we propose a compact model called Spatial-Temporal Consistency Network (STC-Net). STC-Net utilizes dilated temporal convolutions to capture long-range dependencies in trajectory modeling, while graph convolutions handle spatial interactions between trajectories. Additionally, we introduce a feature-wise convolution to generate predicted trajectories in a single pass and refine them alongside observed trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that STC-Net produces spatially and temporally consistent trajectories, outperforming other graph-based methods. With just 0.7k parameters and a latency of only 1.3ms, STC-Net advances the current state-of-the-art and meets the requirements for practical applications.
