We present a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) model called Hi-LANDER for clustering images into unknown identities. Unlike fully unsupervised hierarchical clustering, our approach uses supervision from a training set to determine grouping and complexity criteria. Hi-LANDER outperforms current GNN-based clustering algorithms with a 49% improvement in F-score and a 7% increase in Normalized Mutual Information (NMI). Moreover, our unified framework reduces computational cost by three-fold compared to state-of-the-art GNN-based methods, which rely on separate models for intermediate steps. The training and inference code for Hi-LANDER is publicly available.
