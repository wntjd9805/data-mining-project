Object localisation is a common task in regular images, but in computational pathology, dealing with large tissue sections, the number of objects can be overwhelming. Annotating all objects is impractical, so sparse annotation is the only option. However, standard supervised learning treats unannotated objects as negatives, leading to confusion and biased learning. To address this, we propose exclusive cross-entropy, which examines second-order loss derivatives to identify and exclude biased terms. Our experiments on various datasets and localisation tasks demonstrate significant improvements compared to cross-entropy or focal loss, achieving excellent performance with only 10-40% of annotations.
