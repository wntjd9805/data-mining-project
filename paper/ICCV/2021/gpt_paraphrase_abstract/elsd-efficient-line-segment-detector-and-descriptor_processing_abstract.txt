We introduce a new method called ELSD (Efficient Line Segment Detector and Descriptor) that can simultaneously detect line segments and extract their descriptors in an image. Unlike traditional approaches that handle detection and description separately, ELSD utilizes a shared feature extractor for both tasks, enabling real-time performance for higher-level applications such as SLAM and image matching. Our approach involves a compact model that represents line segments using their mid-point, angle, and length, ensuring center-symmetry. We also propose a non-centerness suppression technique to filter out fragmented line segments caused by intersections, and a fine offset prediction to improve mid-point localization. Additionally, we integrate the line descriptor branch with the detector branch and jointly train them in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results demonstrate that ELSD achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency on the Wireframe dataset and YorkUrban dataset. Furthermore, our line description capability surpasses previous works in line matching tasks.
