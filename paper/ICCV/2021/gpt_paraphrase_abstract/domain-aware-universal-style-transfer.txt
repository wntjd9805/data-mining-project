Style transfer methods aim to apply the styles of reference images to content images. However, existing methods have limitations in the range of styles they can transfer due to their structural constraints. These methods struggle to preserve content and apply desired styles across different domains. To address this, we propose Domain-aware Style Transfer Networks (DSTN), which not only transfer style but also capture the domain properties from reference images. We introduce a novel domainness indicator that assesses the domainness value based on texture and structural features. Additionally, we present a unified framework with domain-aware skip connection to adaptively transfer stroke and palette based on the domainness indicator. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our model produces superior qualitative results and outperforms previous methods in terms of proxy metrics for both artistic and photo-realistic stylizations. The codes and pre-trained weights for our model are available at Kibeom-Hong/Domain-Aware-Style-Transfer.
