We observed that people rely on their physical intuition when manipulating objects, regardless of the objects' meaning. Building on this observation, we introduce Act the Part (AtP), a method that teaches an agent how to interact with articulated objects to discover and segment their parts. AtP combines action selection and motion segmentation to isolate structures and enable perceptual part recovery without the need for semantic labels. Our experiments demonstrate that AtP learns efficient strategies for part discovery, can generalize to unfamiliar object categories, and can perform conditional reasoning for the task. Notably, AtP's training in simulation transfers convincingly to real-world data without requiring fine-tuning.
