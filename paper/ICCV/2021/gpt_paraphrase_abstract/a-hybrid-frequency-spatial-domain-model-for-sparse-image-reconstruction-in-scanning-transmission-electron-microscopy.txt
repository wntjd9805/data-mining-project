Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is a valuable technique for high-resolution imaging of materials at the atomic level. When applying STEM to beam-sensitive materials, two important research aspects are reducing scanning time and minimizing electron beam exposure while maintaining a satisfactory signal-to-noise ratio. One effective solution to achieve this is partially sampling the material using fixed electron doses and then using computational methods to restore the lost information. Inspired by the successful application of deep learning in image in-painting, we have developed an encoder-decoder network that can reconstruct STEM images even in cases of extremely sparse sampling. Our model combines local pixel information obtained through convolution operators with global texture features. We achieve this by applying specific filter operations in the frequency domain to obtain an initial reconstruction and global structure prior. Our method is capable of effectively restoring texture structures and is robust at different sampling ratios, even in the presence of Poisson noise. Through a comprehensive study, we have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by approximately 50%. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/icthrm/Sparse-Sampling-Reconstruction.
