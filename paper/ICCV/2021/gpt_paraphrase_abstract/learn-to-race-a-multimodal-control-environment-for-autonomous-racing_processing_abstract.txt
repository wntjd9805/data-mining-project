Current research on autonomous driving mainly focuses on urban driving, which is insufficient for understanding the complex driving behavior involved in high-speed racing. However, existing racing simulation frameworks struggle to accurately capture realism in terms of visual rendering, vehicular dynamics, and task objectives, making it difficult to transfer learning agents to real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a new environment called Learn-to-Race (L2R) where agents can learn to race in simulated competition-style racing using a variety of information sources, including virtual cameras and inertial measurement sensors. Our environment includes a simulator and a training framework that accurately models vehicle dynamics and racing conditions. In this paper, we introduce the Arrival simulator for autonomous racing and propose the L2R task, which incorporates challenging metrics inspired by learning-to-drive challenges, Formula-style racing, and multimodal trajectory prediction for autonomous driving. Additionally, we provide the L2R framework suite, which enables simulated racing on high-precision models of real-world tracks. Furthermore, we offer an official L2R task dataset consisting of expert demonstrations, along with a series of baseline experiments and reference implementations. All of our code is available on GitHub. The Learn-to-Race interfaces with a racing simulator that includes real-world racetracks like the Thruxton Circuit and Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Simulated race cars are equipped with learning agents that are tasked with the objective of achieving the fastest lap times and best metrics.
