This paper introduces a new unsupervised network for addressing the challenges of computer vision tasks in imaging through turbulent refractive media like air and water, which cause geometric distortion due to refraction and light scattering. The proposed network utilizes a grid deformer to estimate the distortion field and an image generator to produce the distortion-free image. By incorporating positional encoding, the network achieves simplified structure while preserving fine spatial details in the recovered images. Unlike traditional methods, our approach does not require labeled data for training and exhibits good generalizability across different turbulent image datasets with various types of distortions. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-captured turbulent images validate the effectiveness of our method in removing distortions caused by air and water, without the need for extensive customization.
