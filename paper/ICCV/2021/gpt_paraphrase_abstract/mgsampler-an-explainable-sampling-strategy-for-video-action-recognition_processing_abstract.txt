We propose a Motion-Guided Sampler (MGSampler) as a solution to the frame sampling problem in video action recognition. Current sampling strategies lack flexibility in handling complex variations in videos. Our MGSampler utilizes motion as a universal signal to adaptively select frames. We introduce two important properties in our design: motion sensitivity and motion uniformity. We employ two motion representations to efficiently identify motion-salient frames and devise a sampling strategy based on cumulative motion distribution to evenly cover important segments. Our MGSampler can be incorporated into existing video architectures. Experimental results on five benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization power of our MGSampler compared to fixed sampling strategies.
