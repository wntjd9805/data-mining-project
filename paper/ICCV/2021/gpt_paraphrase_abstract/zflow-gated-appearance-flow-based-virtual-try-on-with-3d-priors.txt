Image-based virtual try-on is a popular research area due to its practicality. Existing methods use a two-stage process involving warping and texture fusion to generate realistic try-on images. However, issues arise due to the flexible nature of garments and the lack of geometric information. This often leads to improper rendering of fine details. To address these concerns, we propose ZFlow, an end-to-end framework that combines hierarchical flow estimates and dense structural priors. ZFlow achieves impressive results in terms of geometric and textural integrity, as demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative evaluations. We also conduct extensive comparisons with other solutions, including user studies and ablation studies on multiple datasets.
