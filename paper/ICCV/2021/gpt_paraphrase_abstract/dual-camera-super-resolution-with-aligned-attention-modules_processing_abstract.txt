We introduce a new approach to reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) called dual-camera super-resolution (DCSR), which enhances image quality and fidelity using reference images. Our method extends the standard patch-based feature matching with spatial alignment operations. Additionally, we focus on DCSR as a promising application of RefSR and create a dataset of 146 image pairs from a smartphone's main and telephoto cameras. To address the differences between real-world and training images, we propose a self-supervised domain adaptation strategy. Extensive experiments on our dataset and a public benchmark show significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods, both quantitatively and visually.
