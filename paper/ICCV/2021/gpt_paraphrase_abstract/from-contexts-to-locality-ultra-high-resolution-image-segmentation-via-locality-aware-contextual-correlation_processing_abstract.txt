Recently, there has been a growing interest in ultra-high resolution image segmentation due to its practical applications. This paper proposes an innovative approach to the commonly used high-resolution image segmentation pipeline. Our method involves partitioning an ultra-high resolution image into regular patches for local segmentation, and then merging the local results to create a high-resolution semantic mask.

To process the local patches, we introduce a new segmentation model that takes into account the contextual correlation. This model effectively utilizes the relationship between a local patch and its various contexts to handle semantic regions with significant variations. Additionally, we present a contextual semantics refinement network that connects the local segmentation result with its contextual semantics. This network helps reduce boundary artifacts and improve mask contours during the generation of the final high-resolution mask.

We conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate our model and compared it against other state-of-the-art methods using public benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the competition. We have also made our codes available on GitHub at https://github.com/liqiokkk/FCtL.
