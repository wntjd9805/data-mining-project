We have created a Large Scale Multi-Illuminant (LSMI) Dataset consisting of 7,486 images captured with three different cameras across more than 2,700 scenes with two or three illuminants. This dataset not only provides pixel-wise ground truth illumination for each image, but also includes information on the chromaticity of each illuminant in the scene and the mixture ratio of illuminants per pixel. Unlike existing datasets, our dataset predominantly features illuminants found naturally in the scene, and the ground truth illumination is calculated by comparing images with different illumination combinations. This enables us to capture the natural composition of lighting conditions in real-world settings with a wide field-of-view, offering a more comprehensive dataset for multi-illumination white balance. Since traditional white balance algorithms designed for single illuminant scenarios are not directly applicable, we have developed a per-pixel deep neural network-based white balance algorithm and demonstrated its effectiveness compared to patch-wise white balancing. Through extensive analysis, including a user study, we have validated the advantages of our dataset and anticipate its meaningful contribution to future research on white balancing.
