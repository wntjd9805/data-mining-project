This abstract discusses the challenges faced by self-supervised methods in monocular depth estimation, particularly in nighttime scenarios with low visibility and varying illuminations. To address these issues, the paper proposes a novel framework that incorporates Priors-Based Regularization to learn distribution knowledge, Mapping-Consistent Image Enhancement module to improve image visibility and contrast, and Statistics-Based Mask strategy to adjust the removal of pixels in texture-less regions. Experimental results show the effectiveness of each component, and the framework achieves state-of-the-art results on two nighttime datasets. The code for the framework is available at https://github.com/w2kun/RNW.
