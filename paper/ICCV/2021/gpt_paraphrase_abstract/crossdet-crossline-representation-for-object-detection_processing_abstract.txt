This paper introduces a new approach to object detection in images called Cross-Det. Existing methods use rectangular anchor boxes or points to represent objects, but these approaches can introduce background noise or miss important appearance information. Cross-Det uses a set of growing cross lines along horizontal and vertical axes to represent objects, allowing for flexible representation and capturing continuous object information. A crossline extraction module is used to capture features of cross lines, and a decoupled regression mechanism helps to accurately localize objects. The proposed method achieves consistent improvements on the PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness. The code for Cross-Det is available at the provided GitHub link.
