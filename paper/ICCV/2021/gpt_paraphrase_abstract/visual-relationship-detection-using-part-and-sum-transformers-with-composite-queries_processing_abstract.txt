This paper introduces a novel approach called Part-and-Sum detection Transformer (PST) for performing visual composite set detection in computer vision applications. The problem involves detecting both the individual parts (subject, object, predicate) and the complete triplet (part and sum) in a hierarchical manner. Unlike existing Transformers that use queries at a single level, PST simultaneously models the interactions between the parts and sums using composite queries and attention modules. It incorporates sum queries to better capture the part-and-sum relations, which are not adequately addressed in standard Transformers. The approach utilizes tensor-based part queries and vector-based sum queries, and models their joint interaction. Experimental results on visual relationship detection and human object interaction tasks demonstrate that PST achieves state-of-the-art performance among single-stage models and is comparable to custom designed two-stage models.
