The current literature on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) focuses on the covariate shift and conditional shift assumptions, which aim to encourage models to learn shared features across different domains. However, this approach suffers from a loss of semantics in the source domain, which are important for discrimination in the target domain. We propose a solution called Transporting Causal Mechanisms (TCM) that addresses this issue by utilizing the concept of transportability theory. This theory recognizes the loss of semantics as a confounding effect that can only be eliminated through causal intervention. However, the theoretical solution provided by transportability is not practical for UDA due to the requirement of stratiﬁcation and representation of the unobserved confounder causing the domain gap. In response, TCM offers a practical solution by identifying the confounder stratum and representations using unsupervised discovery of domain-invariant and disentangled causal mechanisms. Our TCM approach is supported by both theoretical and empirical evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TCM achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging UDA benchmarks: ImageCLEF-DA, Ofﬁce-Home, and VisDA-2017.
