Research on adversarial attacks has gained significant attention in recent years. While previous studies on transfer-based adversarial attacks have shown promise in improving the transferability to unseen black-box models, there is still much progress to be made in this area. This paper introduces a new approach called Meta Gradient Adversarial Attack (MGAA) which leverages the concept of meta-learning. MGAA is a plug-and-play architecture that can be seamlessly integrated with existing gradient-based attack methods to enhance cross-model transferability. The proposed method involves randomly selecting multiple models from a model zoo to create different tasks. These tasks are then used to simulate both white-box and black-box attacks iteratively. By reducing the gap between the gradient directions in white-box and black-box attacks, the transferability of adversarial examples in the black-box setting can be significantly improved. Extensive experiments conducted on the CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that MGAA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both black-box and white-box attack scenarios.
