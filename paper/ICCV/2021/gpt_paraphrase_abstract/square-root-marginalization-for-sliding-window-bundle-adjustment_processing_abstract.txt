This paper introduces a new method called square root sliding-window bundle adjustment, which is designed for real-time odometry applications. The method incorporates the use of square root formulation in three key aspects of the optimization-based sliding-window estimator. Firstly, for bundle adjustment, the method eliminates landmark variables by implementing nullspace projection. Secondly, the marginalization prior is stored using a matrix square root of the Hessian. Lastly, when marginalizing old poses, the method avoids forming normal equations and instead updates the square root prior directly with a specialized QR decomposition. The paper demonstrates that the proposed square root marginalization is mathematically equivalent to the conventional use of Schur complement on the Hessian. Additionally, it effectively handles rank-deficient Jacobians, producing a prior equivalent to Schur complement with Moore-Penrose inverse. The performance of the proposed estimator is evaluated using visual and visual-inertial odometry on real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed estimator is 36% faster than the baseline method. Furthermore, it is observed that conventional Hessian-based marginalization leads to numeric failures and reduced accuracy when using single precision. The paper analyzes the numeric properties of the marginalization prior and explains why the square root form does not suffer from the same issues, resulting in superior performance.
