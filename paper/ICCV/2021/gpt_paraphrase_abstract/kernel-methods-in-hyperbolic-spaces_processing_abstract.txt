Embedding data in hyperbolic spaces has been beneficial for advanced machine learning applications, but it comes with difficulties due to the curved geometry. In Euclidean spaces, kernel machines provide theoretical properties and superior representational power. This paper introduces positive definite kernel functions for hyperbolic spaces, which brings two advantages: 1. The ability to seamlessly benefit from kernel machines alongside hyperbolic embeddings, and 2. Simplification of operations involving hyperbolic data through the rich structure of Hilbert spaces associated with kernel machines. However, finding valid kernel functions on curved spaces is challenging and considered an open problem. This work addresses this gap by developing several valid positive definite kernels in hyperbolic spaces, including universal ones such as RBF. The proposed kernels are comprehensively studied on various challenging tasks, demonstrating the superiority of kernelization for hyperbolic representations.
