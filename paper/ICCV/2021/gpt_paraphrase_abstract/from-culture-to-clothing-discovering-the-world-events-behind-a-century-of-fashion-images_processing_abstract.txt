Fashion is influenced by external cultural factors, but currently, the process of identifying these connections is done manually and is limited to the most obvious occurrences. In this study, we propose a data-driven method to identify specific cultural factors that impact people's clothing choices. By analyzing large datasets of news articles and vintage photos spanning a century, we develop a statistical model that can detect the relationships between worldly events and individuals' fashion decisions. Additionally, we apply our model to two image datasets, enhancing the accuracy of visual style prediction and photo timestamping tasks. This research represents an initial step towards a computational, scalable, and easily updatable approach for linking culture to fashion.
