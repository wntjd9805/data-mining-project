This paper introduces a new active learning method called In-fluence Selection for Active Learning (ISAL) that focuses on selecting unlabeled samples that have the most positive influence on model performance. The proposed method, ISAL, aims to estimate the expected gradient of unlabeled samples using the Untrained Unlabeled sample Influence Calculation (UUIC) in order to determine their influence. The effectiveness of UUIC is demonstrated through both theoretical and experimental analyses. One of the advantages of UUIC is that it only relies on model gradients, making the active learning algorithm task-agnostic and model-agnostic. ISAL outperforms previous methods in various active learning settings and tasks with different datasets. Additionally, ISAL reduces annotation costs by at least 12%, 13%, and 16% on CIFAR10, VOC2012, and COCO, respectively, compared to previous methods.
