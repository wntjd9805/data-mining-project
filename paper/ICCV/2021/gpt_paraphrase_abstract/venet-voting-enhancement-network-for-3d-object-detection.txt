This paper introduces a new 3D object detector called VENet, which is based on the VoteNet framework. The goal of VENet is to improve the accuracy of object detection in cluttered indoor scenes by enhancing the voting process. The paper addresses the limitations of existing voting schemes, particularly the negative impact of votes from neighboring objects and background. To overcome these limitations, several strategies are proposed. Firstly, the classic MLP in the backbone network is replaced with the proposed Attentive MLP (AMLP) to obtain better feature descriptions of seed points before voting. Secondly, a new vote attraction loss (VALoss) is designed to encourage vote centers to be located close to the corresponding object centers. This helps to improve the compactness of the votes. Additionally, a vote weighting module is developed to integrate the foreground/background prediction into the vote aggregation process. This enhances the capability of VoteNet to handle noise from background voting. These three strategies collectively contribute to more effective voting and improved performance, resulting in the development of VENet.Experimental results demonstrate that VENet outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets. Ablation studies are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed components.
