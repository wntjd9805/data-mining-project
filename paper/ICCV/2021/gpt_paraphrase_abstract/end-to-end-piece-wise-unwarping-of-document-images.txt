This study focuses on document unwarping, which aims to correct physical deformations of paper in order to obtain a flatbed scanned document-image for OCR tasks. Current methods for unwarping documents rely on global unwarping techniques, which are not effective in handling local deformation changes. Additionally, global unwarping often introduces unwanted warping artifacts in less distorted regions to compensate for severe warping in other parts of the document. In this paper, we propose an innovative end-to-end trainable approach for unwarping documents. Our method utilizes a piece-wise formulation that predicts local deformation fields and combines them with global information to achieve a more accurate unwarping result. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art by achieving a 4% improvement in multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) and performs better in terms of OCR metrics, specifically character error rate (CER) and word error rate (WER).
