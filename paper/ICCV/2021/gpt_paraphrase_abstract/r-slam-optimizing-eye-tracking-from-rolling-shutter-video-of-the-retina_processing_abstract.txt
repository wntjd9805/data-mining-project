We propose a novel approach to recover eye motion from rolling shutter video of the retina. Our method combines convex optimization and a constrained version of gradient descent to jointly estimate the motion and appearance of the retina. By incorporating the rolling shutter imaging model into our optimization formulation, we achieve high accuracy in both offline and real-time scenarios. We validate our approach using retina video captured with an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO), and demonstrate eye tracking at a frequency of 1 kHz with accuracies below one arcminute. This is a significant improvement compared to traditional eye tracking systems, which typically have lower accuracy.
