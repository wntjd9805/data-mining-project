Instance segmentation in 3D scenes is a challenging task due to data irregularity and uncertainty in the number of instances. Current methods use a two-step approach involving point-wise feature learning and grouping, but this has limitations in terms of supervision and handling data irregularities. To overcome these issues, we propose an end-to-end solution called SemanticSuperpoint Tree Network (SSTNet) that incorporates a semantic superpoint tree (SST) for proposing object instances. The SST is constructed based on learned semantic features and is split at intermediate tree nodes to generate instance proposals. We also introduce a refinement module called CliqueNet to prune incorrectly grouped superpoints. Experimental results on ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. SSTNet achieves the highest mAP on the ScanNet (V2) leaderboard, surpassing the second best method by 2%. The source code in PyTorch is available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/SSTNet.
