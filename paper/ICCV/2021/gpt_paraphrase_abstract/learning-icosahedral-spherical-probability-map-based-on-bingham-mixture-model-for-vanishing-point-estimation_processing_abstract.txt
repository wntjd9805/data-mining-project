Current methods for estimating vanishing points (VPs) in images rely on pre-extracted image lines or prior knowledge of the number of VPs. However, this information may not always be available or sufficient. To address this issue, we propose a network that takes a perspective image as input and predicts a spherical probability map of VPs. This map allows us to detect all VPs accurately. Our method incorporates several technical innovations that enhance its reliability. Firstly, we use an icosahedral spherical representation for our probability map, which ensures a uniform distribution of pixels and enables estimation of VPs at arbitrary positions. Secondly, we introduce a loss function that enforces antipodal symmetry and sparsity in the probability map to prevent overfitting. Thirdly, we generate a ground truth probability map that effectively represents the locations and uncertainties of VPs, even if they are noisy or exhibit anisotropic dispersions. Lastly, we detect VPs by fitting a Bingham mixture model to the predicted probability map, allowing us to handle close VPs robustly and provide confidence levels for practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the best compromise between generality, accuracy, and efficiency when compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
