This study focuses on reconstructing planar surfaces in indoor scenes using two views and unknown camera poses. Previous methods have been successful in creating object-centric reconstructions but have overlooked the dominant structures of indoor scenes, such as planes. In this paper, we propose a method that reconstructs planar surfaces from multiple views while simultaneously estimating camera pose. Through our experiments, we show that our approach surpasses the current state-of-the-art in reconstructing challenging scenes from Matterport3D using sparse views.
