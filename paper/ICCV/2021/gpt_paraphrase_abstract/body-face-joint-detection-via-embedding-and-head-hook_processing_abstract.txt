Detecting pedestrians and their associated faces together is a difficult task due to occlusion, non-frontal poses, and lack of strong correlational evidence in crowded scenes. To address this challenge, this paper presents the Body-FaceJoint (BFJ) detector, a novel framework that accurately detects bodies and their corresponding faces. The detector follows a multi-class design, simultaneously detecting bodies and faces. It introduces two key contributions: an Embedding Matching Loss (EML) that learns an associative embedding for matching body and face of the same person, and a new concept called "head hook" that spatially bridges the gap between body and faces. These additions provide new sources of information, making the detection of body and face pairs less difficult. To evaluate the association performance, the paper introduces a new metric called log-average miss matching rate (mMR-2) and extends existing benchmarks by annotating each face box. Experimental results demonstrate that the BFJ detector achieves state-of-the-art performance in pedestrian detection on both one-stage and two-stage structures, surpassing various body-face association strategies.
