Recently, RGB-D sensors have gained popularity in the field of Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM). The accuracy of the input depth map is crucial for RGB-D SLAM, but transparent objects can cause false depth input, rendering traditional RGB-DSLAM algorithms ineffective. In this study, we propose a new SLAM approach called transfusion that can handle the presence of transparent objects. Our method consists of two parts: Transparent Objects Iterative Closest Points (TC-ICP) is used to detect and remove transparent objects, reducing trajectory errors, while Transparent Objects Reconstruction (TO-Reconstruction) reconstructs transparent and opaque objects separately using different methods. To assess our algorithm, we created a new RGB-D SLAM database with 25 video sequences, each containing at least one transparent object. The experiments demonstrate that our approach is capable of handling scenes with transparent objects, improving the accuracy of camera trajectory and environment reconstruction compared to existing methods.
