Rain streaks in images can significantly reduce visibility and hinder image recognition and analysis. While CNN-based methods have been developed for rain removal, they struggle to adapt to real-world scenarios and restore high-quality rain-free images with clear structures. To address this, we propose a Structure-Preserving Deraining Network (SPDNet) with RCP guidance. Unlike other methods, SPDNet generates rain-free images without relying on any assumptions about rain generation. We utilize the RCP (Rain Containing Prior) of images, which contains more accurate structural information than rainy images, to guide our deraining network and preserve the structure of the rain-free image. Our network includes a Wavelet-based Multi-Level Module (WMLM) to learn the background information of rainy images and an Interactive Fusion Module (IFM) to effectively utilize RCP information. Furthermore, we introduce an iterative guidance strategy to progressively improve the accuracy of RCP and refine the results. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code for our model is available at https://github.com/Joyies/SPDNet.
