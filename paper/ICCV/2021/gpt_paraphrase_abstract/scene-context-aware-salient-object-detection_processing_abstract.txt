Salient object detection is an important task in image analysis that aims to identify objects that attract visual attention. However, existing methods often fail to perform well in real-world complex scenarios due to two main issues. Firstly, most available datasets only consist of simple foregrounds and backgrounds that do not adequately represent real-life situations. Secondly, current methods only focus on learning contextual features of salient objects, which is insufficient for understanding the high-level semantics required for saliency reasoning in complex scenes.To address these problems, this paper proposes a new approach. First, a new large-scale dataset with complex scenes is constructed to better represent real-life scenarios. Then, a context-aware learning approach is introduced, which explicitly utilizes the semantic scene contexts. This approach includes two modules: a Semantic Scene Context Refinement module that enhances the contextual features learned from salient objects by incorporating scene context, and a Contextual Instance Transformer that learns the contextual relations between objects and the scene context. It is worth noting that the utilization of high-level semantic contextual information for saliency detection in image scenes is not extensively explored in the existing literature.Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach, and the results show that it outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in complex scenarios for saliency detection. Furthermore, the approach demonstrates good generalization capabilities, as it transfers well to other existing datasets.
