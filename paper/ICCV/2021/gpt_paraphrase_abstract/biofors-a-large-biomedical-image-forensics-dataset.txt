Research in media forensics has been focused mainly on combatting misinformation on social media. However, the issue of image manipulation and misuse in biomedical research documents has not received much attention beyond academic discussions. This lack of momentum is primarily due to the absence of benchmark datasets and standardized tasks. To address this gap, we introduce BioFors1, the first dataset specifically designed for benchmarking common biomedical image manipulations. BioFors consists of 47,805 images extracted from 1,031 open-source research papers, categorized into Microscopy, Blot/Gel, FACS, and Macroscopy. Additionally, we propose three forensic analysis tasks: external duplication detection, internal duplication detection, and cut/sharp-transition detection. We evaluate BioFors using state-of-the-art algorithms and find that existing computer vision algorithms developed on standard datasets are not robust when applied to biomedical images. This highlights the need for further research to tackle the unique challenges posed by biomedical image forensics.
