CNNs perform well when the training and test distributions are the same, but they struggle with unseen image corruptions. These corruptions, such as random noise or compression artifacts, are common in real scenarios. However, improving performance on corrupted images should not result in degraded performance on regular images. To address this challenge, we propose a mixture of two expert models during training, with each model specializing in high or low-frequency robustness. Additionally, we introduce a regularization scheme that minimizes the total variation of convolution feature-maps to enhance high-frequency robustness. This approach improves performance on corrupted images without sacrificing in-distribution performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on ImageNet-C and an automotive dataset, showcasing improvements in object classification and object detection for both synthetic and real-world corruptions.
