We introduce a unique approach to solve the problem of animating garments using deep learning. Our method allows for the animation of any type of outfit, regardless of its complexity or structure. Previous techniques aimed to simultaneously edit, resize, and animate garments by utilizing body models, resulting in complex solutions that lack scalability, applicability, and compatibility. By focusing solely on garment animation, we propose a straightforward model capable of animating any outfit, regardless of its topology, vertex order, or connectivity. Our proposed architecture converts outfits into animated 3D models in a standardized format for 3D animation, ensuring compatibility with any graphics engine. Additionally, we suggest a methodology that combines supervised learning with unsupervised physically based learning to address collisions and improve cloth quality.
