We propose a method for developing robust white-box classification loss functions that can handle label noise in training data. We use Taylor polynomials to parameterize a flexible family of loss functions and employ evolutionary strategies to search for noise-robust losses within this space. To create reusable loss functions applicable to new tasks, we evaluate their performance across various training datasets and architectures. The resulting white-box loss can be easily integrated as a plug-and-play module, enabling effective label-noise-robust learning in different downstream tasks without the need for special training procedures or network architectures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various datasets with synthetic and real label noise, achieving superior results compared to previous methods.
