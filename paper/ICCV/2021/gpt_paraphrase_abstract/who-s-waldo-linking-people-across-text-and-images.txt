We have developed a new task and dataset called person-centric visual grounding, which aims to link people mentioned in captions to their corresponding images. Unlike previous approaches that focus on object-based visual grounding, our task involves masking out people's names in captions to encourage methods to rely on contextual cues instead. To support this task, we have created a dataset called Who's Waldo, which was automatically generated from image-caption data on Wikimedia Commons. We have also proposed a Transformer-based method that outperforms several strong baselines on this task. We have made our data and code available to the research community to promote the development of contextual models that integrate both vision and language. The data and code can be accessed at: https://whoswaldo.github.io.
