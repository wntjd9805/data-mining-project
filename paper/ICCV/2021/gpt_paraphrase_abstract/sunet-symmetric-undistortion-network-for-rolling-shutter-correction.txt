This paper introduces a new deep network for addressing the rolling shutter distortion issue in consumer-grade cameras. Most modern cameras use a rolling shutter mechanism, which can cause distortions in images when the camera is in motion during image capture. The proposed network is designed to correct this problem by predicting a global shutter image that corresponds to the intermediate time between two consecutive frames. This is a challenging task because this intermediate time represents a camera pose that is different from both frames. The pipeline of the network involves estimating two time-symmetric dense undistortion flows using established principles such as pyramidal construction, warping, and cost volume processing. These flows are used to warp both rolling shutter images into a common global shutter image in the feature space. To effectively combine the contextual information from the two rolling shutter images, a symmetric consistency constraint is created in the image decoder. This constraint helps in recovering a high-quality global shutter image.The proposed approach is evaluated through extensive experiments using both synthetic and real data from public benchmarks. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing state-of-the-art techniques.
