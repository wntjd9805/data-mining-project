City modeling plays a crucial role in computational urban planning, navigation, and entertainment. This study introduces BlockPlanner, the first generative model of city blocks. BlockPlanner is capable of synthesizing valid city blocks with diverse land lot configurations. A novel vectorized representation of city blocks is proposed, employing a ring topology and a two-tier graph to capture both the global and local structures of a city block. Each land lot is abstracted into a vector representation that encompasses its 3D geometry and land use semantics. This vectorized representation allows for the use of a lightweight network to capture the underlying distribution of land lot configurations within a city block. To ensure that the generated city blocks adhere to intrinsic spatial constraints, a set of effective loss functions is employed to shape rational results. A pilot city block dataset is contributed to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed representation and framework compared to existing methods. Notably, BlockPlanner also enables the editing and manipulation of city blocks, facilitating useful applications such as topology refinement and footprint generation.
