We present 3DeepCT, a deep neural network designed for computed tomography (CT) that reconstructs 3D scattering volumes using multi-view images. The architecture of 3DeepCT is specifically tailored to capture the stationary nature of atmospheric cloud fields. The objective of volumetric scattering tomography is to reconstruct a volume based on its 2D projections. Traditional approaches to this problem involve iterative inverse methods relying on signal processing and physics models. However, these techniques are computationally intensive and have a slow convergence time. In contrast, our study demonstrates that 3DeepCT surpasses physics-based inverse scattering methods in terms of accuracy while significantly reducing computational run-time. We also introduce a hybrid model that combines 3DeepCT with physics-based analysis, resulting in a technique that achieves fast inference time and improved recovery performance.
