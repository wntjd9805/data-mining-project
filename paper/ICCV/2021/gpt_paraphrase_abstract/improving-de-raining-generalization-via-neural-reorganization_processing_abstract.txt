Current image de-raining networks are limited in their ability to generalize to real-world rainy scenes due to overfitting on biased distributions in single synthetic datasets. This paper presents a novel approach to enhance the de-raining generalization of deep networks by accumulating knowledge from multiple synthetic datasets. A Neural Reorganization (NR) algorithm is proposed to strike a balance between stability and plasticity in the network, allowing it to retain learned information while adapting to new data. The algorithm incorporates synaptic consolidation mechanisms from the biological brain and knowledge distillation techniques. Experimental validation demonstrates that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in processing both synthetic and real-world rainy images by effectively accumulating de-raining knowledge.
