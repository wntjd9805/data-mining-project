We present a technique for reconstructing a coherent sequence of surfaces from evolving point clouds without supervision. Our method establishes dense and meaningful correspondences between all keyframes by representing the reconstructed surface as an atlas using a neural network. By defining canonical correspondences based on the atlas, we ensure that the reconstruction remains as isometric as possible across frames, resulting in semantically meaningful results. Through experiments and comparisons, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of unsupervised correspondence accuracy and surface reconstruction accuracy.
