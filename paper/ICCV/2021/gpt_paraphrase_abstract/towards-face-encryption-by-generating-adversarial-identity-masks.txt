The privacy and security of personal data shared on social media and networks have become increasingly important. Previous attempts to prevent identity information leakage from face photos using image obfuscation techniques have been either visually unsatisfactory or ineffective against face recognition systems. In this paper, we aim to develop a technique that can encrypt personal photos to protect users from unauthorized face recognition systems while maintaining visual similarity to the original version for humans. We propose a method called targeted identity-protection iterative method (TIP-IM) that generates adversarial identity masks to overlay on facial images, concealing the original identities without compromising visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TIP-IM achieves a success rate of over 95% against various state-of-the-art face recognition models in practical test scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical and effective applicability of our method on a commercial API service.
