We present a flexible framework called Dressing in Order (DiOr) that allows for 2D pose transfer, virtual try-on, and various fashion editing tasks. DiOr utilizes a unique recurrent generation pipeline that sequentially dresses a person, resulting in different looks when garments are tried on in different orders. Our system can create dressing effects that previous methods cannot achieve, such as different interactions between garments and layering multiple garments of the same type. DiOr encodes the shape and texture of each garment separately, allowing for individual editing. Joint training on pose transfer and inpainting improves the preservation of details and coherence of generated garments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that DiOr surpasses other recent methods like ADGAN in terms of output quality and handles a wide range of editing functions without direct supervision.
