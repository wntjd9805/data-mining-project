In the past decade, CNN-based object detectors using deep learning have made significant advancements. However, the difference between the training and testing data domains leads to a decrease in performance and limits their real-world applications. To address this issue, a new approach called Knowledge Transfer Network (KTNet) is introduced for domain adaptation. KTNet is built on a base detector that incorporates knowledge mining and relational knowledge constraints. Firstly, a foreground/background classifier is created to extract common attribute knowledge of objects in different scenarios across both source and target domains. Secondly, a relational knowledge graph is used to ensure category correlation consistency across domains. This approach enables the detector to learn object-related and domain-independent representations. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that transferring object-specific knowledge leads to significant performance improvements. KTNet achieves state-of-the-art results on three cross-domain detection benchmarks.
