Satellite multi-view stereo (MVS) imagery is well-suited for large-scale Earth surface reconstruction. However, the prevailing learning-based MVS methods using homography warping are only applicable to pin-hole cameras. To apply this technology to satellite MVS for large-scale Earth surface reconstruction, we propose a rigorous RPC warping module. This module records rational polynomial coefficients as a tensor and formulates RPC warping as a series of tensor transformations. Based on this RPC warping, we introduce the deep learning-based satellite MVS framework for large-scale and wide depth range Earth surface reconstruction, called SatMVS. We also present a new dataset, TLCSatMVS, consisting of 519 5120Ã—5120 satellite images acquired from a three-line camera (TLC). This dataset complements existing WorldView-3 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RPC warping module and SatMVS framework achieve superior reconstruction accuracy compared to the pin-hole fitting method and conventional MVS methods.
