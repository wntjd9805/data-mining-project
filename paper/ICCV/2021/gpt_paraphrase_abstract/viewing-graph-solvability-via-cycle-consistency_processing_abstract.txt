We propose a new approach and algorithm for determining whether a viewing graph in structure-from-motion is solvable, meaning it can uniquely determine a set of projective cameras. Existing theoretical conditions are either incomplete or computationally difficult due to involving a large number of unknowns in solving polynomial equations. Our main contribution is a method that reduces the number of unknowns by exploiting cycle consistency. We advance the understanding of solvability by classifying previously undecided minimal graphs up to 9 nodes, extending practical solvability testing to graphs with up to 90 nodes, and definitively answering an open research question about the equivalence of finite solvability and solvability. Additionally, we provide real data experiment results that demonstrate the presence of unsolvable graphs in practical scenarios.
