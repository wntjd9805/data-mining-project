Humans are able to identify landmarks in images by recognizing their shared geometric structure. This concept of geometric equivariance has been used for unsupervised discovery of object landmark representations. This paper introduces a new approach that combines instance-discriminative and spatially-discriminative contrastive learning to achieve effective landmark representation. By training a deep network to be invariant to geometric and photometric transformations, the network's intermediate layers produce representations that are highly predictive of object landmarks. These representations are stacked across layers in a "hypercolumn" and further enhanced through spatially-contrastive learning, improving their performance in matching and few-shot landmark regression tasks. Additionally, this paper provides a unified perspective on existing approaches for equivariant and invariant representation learning, using contrastive learning as a framework to understand the nature of learned invariances. Experimental results on standard benchmarks and a new challenging dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.
