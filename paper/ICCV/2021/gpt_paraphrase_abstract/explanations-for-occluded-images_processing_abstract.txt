Current algorithms for explaining the results of image classifiers are not effective when the object of interest in the image is partially hidden. In this study, we introduce a new algorithm called DEEPCOVER that addresses this limitation. DEEPCOVER is a black-box algorithm that utilizes a principled approach based on causal theory to compute accurate explanations. Our experiments demonstrate that DEEPCOVER outperforms existing explanation tools when dealing with images containing occlusions. Moreover, DEEPCOVER performs at a similar level to state-of-the-art methods when explaining images without occlusions.
