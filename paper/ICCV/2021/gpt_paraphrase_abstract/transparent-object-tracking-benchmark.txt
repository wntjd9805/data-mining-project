In recent years, there has been significant progress in visual tracking. However, most research in this field has focused on tracking opaque objects, neglecting transparent object tracking. This paper addresses this gap by introducing the Transparent Object Tracking Benchmark (TOTB), which consists of 225 videos from 15 different transparent object categories, each labeled with bounding boxes. TOTB is the first benchmark dedicated to transparent object tracking. To assess the performance of existing trackers and provide a basis for future research on TOTB, 25 state-of-the-art tracking algorithms were evaluated. The results show that there is a need for further improvement in transparent object tracking. Surprisingly, some findings contradict common beliefs in opaque object tracking, such as the fact that deeper features do not always lead to better performance. Furthermore, a novel tracker called TransATOM is introduced, which utilizes transparency features and outperforms all 25 evaluated approaches by a significant margin. The release of TOTB aims to facilitate future research and application of transparent object tracking in both academia and industry.
