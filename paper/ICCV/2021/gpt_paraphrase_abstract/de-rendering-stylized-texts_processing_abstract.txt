We propose using text vectorization to edit raster text in display media, such as posters, web pages, or advertisements. Instead of transforming or generating images in the raster domain, our approach involves learning a text vectorization model that parses rendering parameters like text, location, size, font, style, effects, and hidden background. These parameters are then used for reconstruction and any editing tasks. Our text vectorization technique leverages differentiable text rendering to accurately reproduce raster text in a resolution-free parametric format. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach successfully parses text, styling, and background information in a unified model, resulting in artifact-free text editing compared to a raster baseline.
