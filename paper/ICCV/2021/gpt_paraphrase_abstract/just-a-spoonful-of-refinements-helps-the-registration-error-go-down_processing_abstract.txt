We address the issue of data-driven 3D point cloud registration. When given point correspondences, the standard Kabsch algorithm provides the best rotation estimate. This allows for the training of registration models through differentiation of the SVD operation. However, we demonstrate that by extending the original optimization problem with the initial rotation estimate from Kabsch, we can enhance point correspondence learning during model training. Specifically, we linearize the constraints of the rotation matrix and solve the resulting linear system of equations. By iteratively updating the initial estimate, we generate new solutions. Our experiments indicate that by incorporating our differentiable layer into existing learning-based registration methods, we improve the quality of correspondence matching. This results in a reduction of up to 7% in rotation error for correspondence-based data-driven registration methods.
