This study addresses the issue of single image-based 3D shape retrieval (IBSR), which involves finding the most similar shape to a given 2D image from a shape database. Existing methods typically use metric learning with a triplet loss to embed 2D images and 3D shapes into a shared feature space. Inspired by the success of contrastive learning in self-supervised representation learning, the authors propose a novel IBSR pipeline that incorporates contrastive learning. However, applying contrastive learning to IBSR tasks is challenging due to the need for strong data augmentation in positive pairs and the entanglement of shape and appearance in 2D images. To address these challenges, the authors suggest using multi-view grayscale rendered images as shape representations and employing a color transfer-based data augmentation technique. They also introduce a category-level contrastive loss to differentiate similar objects from different categories. Experimental results on popular IBSR benchmarks, including Pix3D, Stanford Cars, and Comp Cars, demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by 4% - 15% in terms of retrieval accuracy.
