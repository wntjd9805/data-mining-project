We introduce 4D-Net, a novel 3D object detection technique that combines 3D Point Cloud and RGB sensing data in both spatial and temporal dimensions. To incorporate the 4D information, we employ dynamic connection learning, which connects different feature representations and abstraction levels, while also considering geometric constraints. Our approach surpasses the current state-of-the-art and strong baseline methods on the Waymo Open Dataset. By leveraging motion cues and rich image details, 4D-Net excels in detecting distant objects. Additionally, we will release the source code to the public.
