Current methods for skeleton-based action recognition primarily focus on improving recognition accuracy, neglecting model efficiency. Recently, some approaches have attempted to enhance the speed of skeleton modeling by creating lightweight modules. However, apart from model size, the amount of data involved in calculations also significantly impacts running speed, especially for skeleton data where many joints are redundant or non-informative for identifying specific skeletons. Additionally, previous methods typically employ a fixed-sized model for all samples, disregarding recognition difficulty and wasting computations for easy samples. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel approach called AdaSGN. AdaSGN reduces the computational cost of the inference process by adaptively controlling the input number of skeleton joints on-the-fly. Furthermore, it dynamically selects the optimal model size for each sample, achieving a better balance between accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets (NTU-60, NTU-120, and SHREC) validate the superiority of AdaSGN, which achieves comparable or even higher performance with significantly lower GFLOPs compared to the baseline method.
