Despite recent advancements in pedestrian attribute recognition using complex networks and attention mechanisms, the importance of inter-image relations and spatial/semantic consistency in surveillance scenarios has been largely overlooked. It is crucial for attributes to maintain consistent spatial locations across different pedestrian images, such as the "hat" attribute always being located at the top and the "boots" attribute at the bottom of the picture. Additionally, the semantic features of attributes, regardless of their specific variations (e.g., baseball cap, beret, or helmet), should also remain consistent. To address these issues, we propose a Spatial and Semantic Consistency (SSC) framework that incorporates two complementary regularizations. The first regularization focuses on reliable and stable attribute-related regions, ensuring spatial consistency. The second regularization extracts intrinsic and discriminative semantic features based on precise attribute locations to achieve semantic consistency. Extensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks, including PA100K, RAP, and PETA, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches without increasing the number of parameters.
