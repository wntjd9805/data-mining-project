This study addresses the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for person re-identification (re-ID), where annotations are available for the source domain but not for the target domain. Previous methods have used a two-stage optimization pipeline, pre-training the network on the source domain and then fine-tuning it on the target domain using pseudo labels created by feature clustering. However, these methods have two main limitations. First, the presence of label noise may hinder the learning of discriminative features for recognizing target classes. Second, the domain gap between the source and target domains may hinder the transfer of knowledge. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose three technical schemes. First, they introduce a cluster-wise contrastive learning algorithm (CCL) that iteratively optimizes feature learning and cluster refinement to learn noise-tolerant representations in an unsupervised manner. Second, they adopt a progressive domain adaptation (PDA) strategy to gradually reduce the domain gap between the source and target data. Third, they propose Fourier augmentation (FA) to maximize the class separability of re-ID models by imposing additional constraints in the Fourier space. These schemes facilitate the learning of discriminative feature representations. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods on multiple benchmarks. For example, it achieves notable improvements over the MMT method, with increases in mean average precision (mAP) of 8.1%, 9.9%, 11.4%, and 11.1% on the Market-to-Duke, Duke-to-Market, Market-to-MSMT, and Duke-to-MSMT tasks, respectively. Overall, the goal of this study is to learn feature representations for recognizing target classes in an unsupervised domain adaptation task, and the proposed technical schemes effectively address the limitations of previous methods.
