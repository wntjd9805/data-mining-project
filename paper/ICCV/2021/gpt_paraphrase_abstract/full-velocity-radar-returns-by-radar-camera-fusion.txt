This paper introduces a solution to address the limitations of Doppler radar in accurately estimating object velocity in dynamic scenes. By combining radar data with camera images, the authors propose a closed-form solution to estimate full-velocity using optical flow. They also tackle the problem of associating radar returns with camera images using a neural network. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing significant improvements in velocity estimation and accumulation of radar points compared to existing techniques.
