Existing 3D single object tracking methods face challenges in accurately tracking objects in LiDAR scans due to occlusion and incomplete shapes. This study introduces a novel approach that utilizes the ground truth bounding box from the first frame to enhance feature description and improve feature comparison. The proposed method includes the BoxCloud representation, which captures the point-to-box relation of an object, and a box-aware feature fusion module for reliable feature matching and embedding. By integrating these components into the P2B model, a superior box-aware tracker (BAT) is constructed. Experimental results on KITTI and NuScenes benchmarks demonstrate that BAT outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method, achieving a 12.8% improvement in precision and a âˆ¼20% faster runtime.
