We present a method for computed tomography (CT) of dynamic volumetric scattering objects using a limited number of moving cameras. Our focus is on passive tomography of dynamic clouds, which play a significant role in Earth's climate. Current scattering CT techniques assume static objects, while existing 4D CT methods rely on linear image formation models and often require strong prior assumptions. In this paper, we discuss the required angular and temporal sampling rates for accurate reconstruction. We achieve spatiotemporal CT through gradient-based optimization, which takes into account the correlation time of the dynamic object. We validate our approach through physics-based simulations and experiments using real-world data.
