This paper focuses on the development of minimal geodesic models for image segmentation. Current geodesic-based segmentation approaches utilize image features and geometric regularization terms to compute geodesic paths. However, this paper addresses a more complex problem: finding simple and closed geodesic curves with a convexity shape prior. To achieve this, the authors propose an orientation-lifting strategy that maps planar curves to a high-dimensional orientation space. The convexity shape prior acts as a constraint for constructing local metrics. The geodesic curves in the lifted space can then be efficiently computed using the fast marching method. Additionally, the authors introduce a method to incorporate region-based homogeneity features into the geodesic model, allowing for region-based segmentation with shape prior constraints.
