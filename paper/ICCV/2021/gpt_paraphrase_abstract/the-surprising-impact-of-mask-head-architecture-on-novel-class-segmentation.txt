We address the issue of expensive mask annotation in instance segmentation models. Instead of using masks for all categories, we propose a partially supervised approach where bounding boxes are used for training. Specifically, we focus on the Mask R-CNN model and find that training the mask-head with only groundtruth boxes significantly improves its performance on novel classes. We also explore the use of alternative mask-head architectures, such as ResNet and Hourglass models, and discover that they can generalize to unseen classes in different ways. This generalization ability, which we call the strong mask generalization effect, allows us to achieve state-of-the-art results in the partially supervised COCO instance segmentation benchmark. Importantly, our approach is not limited to specific detection methodologies or backbone networks. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://git.io/deepmac.
