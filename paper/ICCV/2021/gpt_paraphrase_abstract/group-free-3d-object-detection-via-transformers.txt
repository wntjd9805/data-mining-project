The detection of 3D objects from 3D point clouds has received increased attention recently. Existing methods typically involve grouping points together to form object candidates, which are then used to extract object features. However, this grouping step often leads to inaccurate point assignments, resulting in reduced performance in 3D object detection.   In this paper, we propose a straightforward yet effective approach for directly detecting 3D objects from point clouds. Instead of grouping local points for each object candidate, our method utilizes an attention mechanism in the Transformers to compute the object's feature from all points in the point cloud. This mechanism automatically learns the contribution of each point during network training.   Additionally, we introduce an improved attention stacking scheme that combines object features from different stages, leading to more precise object detection results. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D object detection on widely used benchmarks, namely Scan-Net V2 and SUN RGB-D. The code and models for our method are publicly available at https://github.com/zeliu98/Group-Free-3D.
