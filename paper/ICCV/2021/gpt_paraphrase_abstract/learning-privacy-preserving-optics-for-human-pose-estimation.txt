The increasing use of always-connected digital cameras in our daily lives has raised concerns about privacy and security. We need to develop computer vision systems that can protect privacy while still capturing useful information for tasks. To address this, we propose a novel approach to privacy-preserving human pose estimation. We combine an optical encoder, which provides hardware-level protection, with a software decoder in an end-to-end framework. We introduce a visual privacy protection layer in the optical encoder that allows us to optimize the camera lens's point spread function. Through extensive simulations and a prototype camera, we demonstrate that our approach successfully degrades or inhibits private attributes while preserving important features for human pose estimation.
