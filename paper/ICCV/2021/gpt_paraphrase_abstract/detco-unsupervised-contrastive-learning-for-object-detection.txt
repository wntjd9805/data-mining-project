We introduce DetCo, a straightforward yet effective self-supervised method for object detection. Existing unsupervised pre-training approaches for object detection often lack in either image classification or the reverse. In contrast, DetCo performs well in both instance-level dense prediction tasks and image-level classification. This is achieved through two key components: (1) multi-level supervision for intermediate representations and (2) contrastive learning between global images and local patches. These designs enhance the discriminative and consistent representation at each level of the feature pyramid, leading to improved detection and classification simultaneously.Extensive experiments on various datasets, including VOC, COCO, Cityscapes, and ImageNet, demonstrate the superiority of DetCo over recent methods in both 2D and 3D instance-level detection tasks, as well as its competitiveness in image classification. For instance, in ImageNet classification, DetCo achieves a top-1 accuracy that is 6.9% and 5.0% higher than InsLoc and DenseCL, two contemporary works designed for object detection. Furthermore, in COCO detection, DetCo outperforms SwAV with Mask R-CNN C4 by 6.9 average precision (AP). Notably, DetCo significantly improves the performance of Sparse R-CNN, a recent strong detector, from 45.0 AP to 46.5 AP (+1.5 AP), establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on COCO.
