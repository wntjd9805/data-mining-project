This paper introduces DA-VSN, a domain adaptive video segmentation network, that addresses the issue of performance drop when applying supervised video segmentation models to videos of a different domain. DA-VSN utilizes temporal consistency regularization (TCR) to bridge the domain gap. It consists of two designs: cross-domain TCR, which ensures that predictions of target frames have similar temporal consistency as source frames through adversarial learning, and intra-domain TCR, which ensures that unconﬁdent predictions of target frames have similar temporal consistency as conﬁdent predictions. Experimental results show that DA-VSN outperforms multiple baselines by significant margins, demonstrating its superiority in domain adaptive video segmentation.
