We introduce LayoutTransformer, a novel framework designed to generate scene layouts for various domains including images, mobile applications, documents, and 3D objects. Complex scenes can be represented as meaningful arrangements of simpler graphical elements. Our framework utilizes self-attention to understand the relationships between these elements and generate new layouts within a given domain. It can create layouts from scratch or extend existing ones, and can handle any number of primitives per layout. Our analyses demonstrate that the model automatically captures the semantic properties of the primitives. We propose improvements in the representation of layout primitives and training methods, resulting in competitive performance across diverse data domains such as object bounding boxes in natural images, documents, mobile applications, and 3D shapes.
