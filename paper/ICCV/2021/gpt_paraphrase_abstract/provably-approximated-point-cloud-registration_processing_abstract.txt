The objective of the alignment problem is to align a given point cloud 𝑃 with another observed point cloud 𝑄. This involves finding a rotation matrix 𝑅 and a translation vector 𝑡 that minimize the sum of paired distances between the transformed points 𝑅𝑝𝑖 − 𝑡 and their corresponding points 𝑞𝑖. The registration problem is a more challenging version where the correspondence between points is unknown, and the goal is to find the optimal alignment for all possible correspondence functions from 𝑃 to 𝑄. Existing algorithms like Iterative Closest Point (ICP) have been proposed for these problems, but none can guarantee a non-trivial approximation for the global optimum.

In this study, we establish the existence of a "witness" set consisting of three pairs of points from 𝑃 and 𝑄. By using a novel alignment algorithm, this witness set allows us to achieve a constant factor approximation to the global optimum, even in the worst-case scenario. We also present algorithms that can identify and recover this witness set, providing the first provable constant factor approximation for both the alignment problem in expected linear time and the registration problem in polynomial time. These small witness sets can be applied to various variants, such as points in higher-dimensional spaces, cost functions that are resistant to outliers, and different correspondence types.

Extensive experiments conducted on real and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our approximation constants are close to 1, and our error is up to ten times smaller than that of state-of-the-art algorithms. This highlights the practical effectiveness of our approach in achieving accurate alignments between point clouds.
