This study focuses on the issue of spectral leakage in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) caused by windowing artifacts in filtering operations. While CNNs use linear filters to decompose input into different frequency bands, the size and shape of the convolutional kernel are often not optimized based on standard filter design principles. The researchers highlight that the small size of CNN kernels makes them prone to spectral leakage, leading to performance-degrading artifacts. To address this problem, the authors propose using larger kernel sizes and incorporating the Hamming window function to mitigate leakage in CNN architectures. They demonstrate improved classification accuracy on various benchmark datasets, such as Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, simply by utilizing a standard window function in convolutional layers. Additionally, the study reveals that CNNs utilizing the Hamming window exhibit increased robustness against different adversarial attacks. The code for their proposed approach is available online.
