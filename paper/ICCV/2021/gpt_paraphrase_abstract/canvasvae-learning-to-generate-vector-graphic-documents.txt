This study focuses on developing a generative model for vector graphic documents, which are commonly used in creative applications due to their resolution-free and compact nature. The researchers define vector graphic documents based on a range of attributes associated with a canvas and a sequence of visual elements like shapes, images, and texts. They utilize variational auto-encoders to train the model and learn the representation of these documents. To support their research, they gather a new dataset of design templates from an online service that includes occluded elements within the document structure. Through experiments, the researchers demonstrate that their model, called CanvasVAE, serves as a robust foundation for generative modeling of vector graphic documents.
