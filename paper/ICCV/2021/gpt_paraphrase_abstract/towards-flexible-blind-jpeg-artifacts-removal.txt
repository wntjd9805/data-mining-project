Training a single deep blind model to remove JPEG image artifacts of different quality factors has become popular for its practicality. However, current blind methods reconstruct the image without predicting the quality factor, which limits control over the output compared to non-blind methods. To address this issue, we introduce a flexible blind convolutional neural network called FBCNN. FBCNN predicts the adjustable quality factor to balance artifacts removal and details preservation. It separates the quality factor from the JPEG image using a decoupler module and incorporates the predicted quality factor into the reconstructor module through a quality factor attention block, enabling flexible control. Additionally, we discover that existing methods struggle with non-aligned double JPEG images, even with slight pixel shifts. Therefore, we propose a double JPEG degradation model to enhance the training data. Extensive experiments on single JPEG images, general double JPEG images, and real-world JPEG images demonstrate that FBCNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.
