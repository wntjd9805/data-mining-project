In recent years, there has been an increase in the popularity of face-swap and face-reenactment techniques, making face synthesis technology more accessible to the general public. However, these methods have also given rise to the creation of deepfakes, which are videos that manipulate and replace faces in a way that often leads to negative consequences for society. To address the growing threat of deepfakes, we have developed the Korean DeepFake Detection Dataset (KoDF), which consists of a large collection of synthesized and real videos featuring Korean subjects. In this paper, we provide a detailed explanation of how we constructed the dataset and demonstrate the differences between KoDF and existing deepfake detection datasets through experiments. We emphasize the importance of utilizing multiple datasets to achieve real-world generalization in deepfake detection. The KoDF dataset, including real clips, synthesized clips, clips with adversarial attacks, and metadata, is publicly available at https://moneybrain-research.github.io/kodf.
