We present Watch OnceOnly (WOO), an end-to-end pipeline for video action detection. Unlike current methods that separate actor localization and action classification into distinct stages or use two separate models within one stage, our approach tackles both tasks simultaneously in a unified network. This simplifies the pipeline by consolidating the backbone network and eliminating the need for many manual components. WOO employs a unified video backbone to extract features for both actor localization and action classification. Moreover, we integrate spatial-temporal action embeddings into our framework and incorporate a spatial-temporal fusion module to enhance feature discrimination and information richness, leading to improved action classification performance. Extensive experiments on AVA and JHMDB datasets demonstrate that WOO achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing up to 16.7%GFLOPs compared to existing methods. Our work aims to challenge the conventional approach to action detection and provides a strong foundation for end-to-end action detection.
