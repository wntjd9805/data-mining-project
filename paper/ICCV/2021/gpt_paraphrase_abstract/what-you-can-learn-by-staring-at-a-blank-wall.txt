We introduce a novel approach for estimating the number of people or activity level of a person in a room by observing a blank wall. Our method utilizes the analysis of subtle changes in indirect lighting captured in a video of the wall, which can reveal a hidden signal correlated with motion in the unseen part of the scene. By leveraging this signal, we are able to classify the presence of zero, one, or two moving individuals, as well as determine the activity level of a person in the hidden area. To achieve this, we train two convolutional neural networks using data from 20 different scenes. In testing scenarios and real-time online settings, our method achieves an impressive accuracy of approximately 94% for both tasks. Unlike existing non-line-of-sight methods, our technique does not rely on known obstructions or controllable light sources and can be applied to unfamiliar rooms without the need for recalibration. We extensively evaluate the generalization and robustness of our approach using both real and synthetic data, while also examining the impact of various scene parameters on the quality of the obtained signal.
