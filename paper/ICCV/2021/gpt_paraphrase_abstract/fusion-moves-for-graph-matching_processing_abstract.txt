We present our contribution to approximate algorithms for the quadratic assignment problem, also known as graph matching. Drawing inspiration from the successful fusion moves technique used in multilabel discrete Markov random fields, we explore its potential in the context of graph matching. Specifically, we demonstrate how fusion moves can be effectively integrated with state-of-the-art dual methods that have recently exhibited remarkable outcomes in computer vision and bio-imaging domains. Through empirical evaluations conducted on diverse graph matching datasets, we observe a significant enhancement in the performance of these methods in terms of both speed and solution quality. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art, surpassing competing methods by a considerable margin.
