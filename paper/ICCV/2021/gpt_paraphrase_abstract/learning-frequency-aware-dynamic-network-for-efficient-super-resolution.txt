Deep learning methods, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have been successfully used in single image super-resolution (SISR). However, existing networks are computationally expensive, making them difficult to implement on mobile devices with limited resources. This paper proposes a novel frequency-aware dynamic network that divides the input into multiple parts based on its coefficients in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain. Expensive operations are applied to the high-frequency part, while cheap operations are assigned to the lower-frequency part to reduce computation burden. Since low-frequency areas contain fewer textural details, this dynamic network does not compromise the quality of the resulting super-resolution images. Predictors are embedded into the dynamic network to fine-tune the handcrafted frequency-aware masks. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark SISR models and datasets demonstrate that the frequency-aware dynamic network can be used with various SISR neural architectures to achieve a better balance between visual quality and computational complexity. For example, it can reduce the computational cost of SR models by approximately 50% while maintaining state-of-the-art SISR performance.
