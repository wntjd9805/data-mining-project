Few-shot learning is a technique that aims to address the issue of expensive and specialized labeling of fine-grained data. In contrast, coarse labels are more easily obtainable and abundant. This study introduces a method called PAS, which enables few-shot learners to utilize coarsely-labeled data prior to evaluation. Inspired by self-training, the additional data is labeled using a teacher model trained on the base dataset. The teacher's predictions are then filtered based on the coarse labels. Subsequently, a new student representation is trained using both the base dataset and the pseudo-labeled dataset. The PAS approach consistently and significantly outperforms existing methods on three different datasets. The code for implementing PAS is available at https://github.com/cpphoo/PAS.
