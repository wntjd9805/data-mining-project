We propose a framework called Conditional Estimation (CEST) that can learn 3D facial parameters from 2D single-view images through self-supervised training using videos. CEST utilizes analysis by synthesis, estimating the 3D facial parameters from the face image and then reconstructing the 2D image using these parameters. To learn meaningful 3D facial parameters without explicit labels, CEST considers the statistical dependency between different parameters. The estimation of each parameter is conditioned not only on the given image but also on previously derived parameters. Additionally, CEST incorporates reflectance symmetry and consistency among video frames to improve parameter disentanglement. By efficiently training with in-the-wild video clips and incorporating this novel strategy, CEST demonstrates its effectiveness through qualitative and quantitative experiments.
