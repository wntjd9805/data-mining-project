The abstract discusses the process of point cloud registration, which involves combining two point clouds by identifying common structures. The authors propose a Feature Interactive Representation learning Network (FIRE-Net) to improve the accuracy of matching these structures. The network includes a Combined Feature Encoder (CFE) that extracts interactive features within each point cloud and combines them to describe the local geometric structure. Additionally, a feature interaction mechanism is introduced to enable information exchange between point pairs across the two point clouds. This mechanism includes a Local Interaction Unit (LIU) and a Global Interaction Unit (GIU) that facilitate interaction at both local and global levels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in partially overlapping point cloud registration.
