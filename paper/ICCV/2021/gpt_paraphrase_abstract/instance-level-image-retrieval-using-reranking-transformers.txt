This study focuses on instance-level image retrieval, which involves finding images in a large database that match an object in a query image. Traditionally, retrieval systems use global image descriptors and then refine or rerank the results using domain-specific techniques like geometric verification with local features. This paper introduces Reranking Transformers (RRTs) as a general model that combines both local and global features to rerank matching images in a supervised manner, eliminating the need for expensive geometric verification. RRTs are lightweight and can be easily parallelized, allowing for efficient reranking in a single forward-pass. The study conducts extensive experiments on three datasets, demonstrating that RRTs outperform previous reranking methods while requiring fewer local descriptors. Additionally, the study shows that RRTs can be optimized together with the feature extractor, leading to tailored feature representations for downstream tasks and improved accuracy.
