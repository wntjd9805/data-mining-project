This study focuses on generating audio impulse responses (IRs) from single images of acoustic environments. Traditionally, IRs are obtained by capturing the response of a space to a stimulus sound, but this process is time-consuming and expensive. To overcome these limitations, the researchers propose using an end-to-end neural network architecture to generate plausible IRs from images. They evaluate their method by comparing the generated IRs to ground truth data and through human expert evaluation. The researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by generating plausible IRs from various settings and formats, including well-known places, musical halls, rooms in paintings, images from animations and computer games, synthetic environments generated from text, panoramic images, and video conference backgrounds. This method has significant applications in music production, speech processing, and creating immersive extended reality environments. By modeling IR generation as a cross-modal paired-example domain adaptation problem and utilizing a conditional GAN, the researchers are able to synthesize realistic audio impulse responses based on images of spaces. This approach eliminates the barriers of cost and time, making it accessible for a wide range of applications.
