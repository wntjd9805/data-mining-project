Instance segmentation methods require large datasets with expensive instance-level mask labels. Partially supervised instance segmentation aims to improve mask prediction with limited mask labels. However, using a class agnostic mask head, which is commonly used in this approach, presents difficulties in learning a general concept of foreground for weakly annotated classes using box supervision alone. To address this issue, we propose the use of an object mask prior (OMP) that implicitly provides the mask head with the general concept of foreground learned by the box classification head under the supervision of all classes. This enables the class agnostic mask head to focus on the primary object in a region of interest (RoI) and enhances generalization to weakly annotated classes. We evaluate our approach on the COCO dataset using different splits of strongly and weakly supervised classes. Our approach outperforms the Mask R-CNN baseline and achieves competitive performance with the state-of-the-art, while offering a simpler architecture.
