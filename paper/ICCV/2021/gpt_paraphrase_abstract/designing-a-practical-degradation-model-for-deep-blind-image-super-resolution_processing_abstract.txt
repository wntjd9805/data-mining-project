The ineffectiveness of existing single image super-resolution (SISR) methods in real images has been recognized. Although some degradation models consider factors like blur, they do not adequately cover the diverse degradations found in real images. To address this, a more complex and practical degradation model is proposed in this paper. The model includes randomly shuffled blur, downsampling, and noise degradations. The blur is approximated using isotropic and anisotropic Gaussian kernels, while the downsampling is randomly chosen from nearest, bilinear, and bicubic interpolations. The noise is synthesized by adding Gaussian noise with different levels, adopting JPEG compression with various quality factors, and generating processed camera sensor noise using reverse-forward camera image signal processing (ISP) pipeline model and RAW image noise model. To validate the effectiveness of the new degradation model, a deep blind ES-RGAN super-resolver is trained and applied to super-resolve synthetic and real images with diverse degradations. The experimental results demonstrate that the new degradation model significantly enhances the practicality of deep super-resolvers, offering a powerful solution for real SISR applications.
