A common practice in using deep neural networks is to apply the same architecture to all input instances. However, this fixed architecture may not be suitable for diverse data. To address this issue, we propose Differentiable Dynamic Wirings (DDW), which learns instance-specific connectivity patterns. Our approach initializes the network as a complete directed acyclic graph and generates edge weights using a learnable module called Router. We adjust the network connectivity by selecting edges with weights above a threshold. Instead of using the same path, DDW dynamically aggregates features in each node, enhancing the network's representation power. We represent the network connectivity of each sample as an adjacency matrix, which is updated during the forward pass and used for gradient computation in the backward pass. We validate our approach using popular architectures such as MobileNetV2, ResNet, ResNeXt, and RegNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our approach.
