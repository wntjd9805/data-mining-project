This abstract discusses the importance of video compression in delivering videos over the internet. While deep learning techniques have shown promise in surpassing human-designed algorithms, they are not as efficient in terms of computation and power consumption compared to existing codecs. The paper proposes a new approach called SRVC, which enhances existing codecs by incorporating a small, content-adaptive super-resolution model to significantly improve video quality. SRVC utilizes two bitstreams: one for the compressed low-resolution video created by the existing codec, and another for periodic updates to a lightweight super-resolution neural network customized for short video segments. By passing the decompressed low-resolution frames through the super-resolution model, SRVC reconstructs high-resolution video frames. The results demonstrate that SRVC achieves the same peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) with only 20% of the bits-per-pixel used by H.265 in slow mode, and 3% of the bits-per-pixel used by DVC, a recent deep learning-based video compression scheme. Additionally, SRVC operates at a speed of 90 frames per second on an NVIDIA V100 GPU.
