This paper focuses on B-frame compression, which involves predicting frames using both past and future reference frames, unlike most neural video codecs that only address P-frame coding. The proposed B-frame solution builds upon existing P-frame methods, allowing for easy integration of B-frame coding capability into an existing neural codec. The approach involves interpolating the two reference frames to create a single reference frame, which is then utilized in conjunction with the existing P-frame codec to encode the input B-frame. The study demonstrates that the interpolated frame serves as a superior reference for the P-frame codec compared to using the previous frame as traditionally done. Experimental results reveal that employing the suggested method with an existing P-frame codec results in a 28.5% reduction in bit-rate on the UVG dataset, while maintaining the same video quality.
