The dependence of deep learning on large-scale manually labeled datasets can be reduced by learning from the web. This is particularly useful for fine-grained recognition, which focuses on distinguishing subordinate categories, as it significantly reduces labeling costs by utilizing free web data. However, the problem of webly supervised fine-grained recognition has not been extensively studied in the computer vision community due to the lack of high-quality datasets. To address this gap, this paper introduces two new benchmark datasets called WebFG-496 and WebiNat-5089. WebFG-496 consists of 53,339 web training images with 200 species of birds, 100 types of aircraft, and 196 models of cars. On the other hand, WebiNat-5089 contains 5089 sub-categories and over 1.1 million web training images, making it the largest webly supervised fine-grained dataset to date. Additionally, a novel webly supervised method called "Peer-learning" is proposed for benchmarking these datasets. Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms competing baseline models and achieves state-of-the-art performance. The benchmark datasets and the source codes of the Peer-learning method are publicly available at https://github.com/NUST-Machine-Intelligence-Laboratory/weblyFG-dataset.
