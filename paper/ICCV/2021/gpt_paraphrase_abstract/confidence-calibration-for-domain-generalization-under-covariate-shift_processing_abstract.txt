Current calibration algorithms aim to tackle the issue of covariate shift through unsupervised domain adaptation. However, these methods have certain drawbacks. Firstly, they rely on unlabeled data from the target domain, which may not be accessible during the calibration stage in real-world scenarios. Secondly, their effectiveness heavily relies on the dissimilarity between the distributions of the source and target domains. To overcome these limitations, we propose innovative calibration solutions based on domain generalization. Our main concept involves utilizing multiple calibration domains to minimize the distribution gap between the target and calibration domains, thereby enhancing calibration transfer without requiring any target domain data. We provide both theoretical justification and empirical experimental results to validate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms. Comparing them to state-of-the-art calibration methods designed for domain adaptation, we observe a significant decrease of 8.86 percentage points in expected calibration error, or equivalently, a substantial increase of 35 percentage points in improvement ratio for multi-class classification using the Office-Home dataset.
