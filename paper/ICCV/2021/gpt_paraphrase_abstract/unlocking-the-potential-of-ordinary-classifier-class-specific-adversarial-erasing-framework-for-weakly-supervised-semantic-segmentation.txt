This paper investigates weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) using image-level classification labels. It addresses the limitations of ClassActivation Maps (CAMs) in only highlighting the most discriminative regions of the classes of interest. The study proposes an approach called adversarial erasing (AE) to explore the less discriminative regions. The authors experimentally demonstrate that an ordinary classifier already has the ability to activate these regions when the most discriminative regions are partially erased. Building on this finding, a class-specific AE-based framework is proposed. This framework utilizes the ordinary classifier to identify regions for erasing and generates a class-specific mask by randomly selecting a single specific class to erase (target class) from the existing classes in the image. The proposed CAMs Generation Network (CGNet) generates a CAM specifically for the target class while ensuring it does not intrude into object regions of other classes. Pseudo-labels refined from these CAMs yield state-of-the-art WSSS performance on both the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS-COCO datasets using only image-level supervision.
