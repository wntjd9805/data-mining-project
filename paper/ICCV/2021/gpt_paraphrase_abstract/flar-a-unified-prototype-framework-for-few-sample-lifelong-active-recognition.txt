The abstract discusses the concept of Active Recognition (AR), where intelligent agents with visual sensors actively explore their observations to improve recognition performance. However, most existing methods for AR are limited to a fixed-category setting, making them less applicable to real-world scenarios where new classes need to be learned without starting from scratch. Additionally, collecting large amounts of data for new categories is costly. To address these challenges, the paper proposes a unified framework called Few-sample Lifelong Active Recognition (FLAR), which focuses on actively recognizing newly emerging categories with only a few training samples. FLAR faces three main difficulties: lifelong recognition policy learning, preserving knowledge of old categories, and the lack of training samples. To overcome these difficulties, the proposed approach integrates prototypes, which are robust representations for limited training samples, into a reinforcement learning solution. This encourages the agent to move towards views that result in more discriminative features. The problem of catastrophic forgetting during lifelong learning is mitigated through knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments conducted on two datasets for object and scene recognition demonstrate that the proposed approach can actively recognize novel categories even with limited training samples. The approach exhibits a class-incremental behavior, allowing for the continuous learning of new categories without the need for extensive retraining.
