We present a novel method for identifying persuasive atypicality in images. While previous studies have focused on atypicality in general, persuasive atypicality serves a specific purpose of conveying meaning and relies on understanding the spatial relationships between objects. Our proposed technique utilizes self-supervised attention and accurately models spatial relations to capture contextual compatibility. Additionally, we experiment with incorporating common sense by considering the semantics of objects that co-occur. To validate our approach, we evaluate it on a dataset of visually persuasive advertisements and a separate dataset that contains atypicality without persuasive intent.
