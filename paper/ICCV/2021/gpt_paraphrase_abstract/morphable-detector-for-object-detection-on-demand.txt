Intelligent robots used in emerging applications often need to navigate and understand new environments. In these situations, it is important to be able to detect objects of new classes quickly and with minimal online effort. This task, known as object detection on demand (ODOD), is challenging because it is not possible to annotate a large amount of data in real-time, and the embedded systems used in robots cannot perform back-propagation for training. Existing few-shot detection methods are not suitable for ODOD as they require additional training. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called the morphable detector (MD). The MD adjusts its parameters online based on a few samples to detect objects of novel classes without the need for extra training. The MD has two sets of parameters, one for feature embedding and the other for class representation (referred to as "prototypes"). Each class is associated with a hidden prototype that is learned by combining visual and semantic embeddings. The learning process of the MD involves alternately learning the feature embedding and the prototypes in an approach similar to expectation-maximization (EM), which allows the recovery of unknown prototypes from a few samples of a novel class. Once the MD is learned, it can use a few samples of a novel class to directly compute its prototype for the online morphing process. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of the MD on various datasets, including Pascal, COCO, and FSOD.
