Gait recognition aims to understand the unique spatio-temporal patterns of the human body shape during movement. Existing methods that divide feature maps into fixed horizontal stripes to identify body parts are flawed because they cannot accurately locate the parts. To address this, we propose a new approach called 3D local operations, which allows for adaptive scales, locations, and lengths when extracting local 3D volumes of body parts. This enables us to learn the spatio-temporal patterns of body parts effectively. Our experiments show that our 3D local convolutional neural networks achieve the best performance on popular gait datasets. The code for our approach is available at: https://github.com/yellowtownhz/3DLocalCNN.
