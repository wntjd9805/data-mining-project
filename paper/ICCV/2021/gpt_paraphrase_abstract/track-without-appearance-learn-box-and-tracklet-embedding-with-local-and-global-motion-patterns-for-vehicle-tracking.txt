Vehicle tracking is a crucial task in the field of multi-object tracking (MOT). One distinct characteristic of vehicle tracking is the smooth trajectories of vehicles in both world and image coordinates. Therefore, models that capture motion consistencies are highly necessary. However, tracking with standalone motion-based trackers is challenging due to limited information, detection errors, and occlusion, which can cause targets to be easily lost. To address this challenge, utilizing appearance information for object re-identification can be helpful, although it requires additional computation and is sensitive to occlusion. This paper aims to explore the importance of motion patterns in vehicle tracking without relying on appearance information. A novel approach is proposed that addresses the association issue for long-term tracking by fully exploiting motion information. The tracklet embedding issue is tackled using the reconstruct-to-embed strategy based on deep graph convolutional neural networks (GCN). Extensive experiments conducted on the KITTI-car tracking dataset and UA-Detrac dataset demonstrate that the proposed method, despite not using appearance information, achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art trackers.
