We introduce Retrieve in Style (RIS), an unsupervised framework for facial feature transfer and retrieval on real images. Previous research has demonstrated the ability to transfer local facial features by leveraging the disentanglement property of the StyleGAN latent space. However, RIS improves upon existing methods in several ways. Firstly, it introduces more effective feature disentanglement, allowing for challenging transfers such as hair and pose that were previously not possible with state-of-the-art methods. Secondly, RIS eliminates the need for per-image hyper-parameter tuning and computing a catalog over a large batch of images. This streamlines the process and reduces computational requirements. Thirdly, RIS enables fine-grained face retrieval using disentangled facial features, specifically targeting features like eyes. This is the first work to achieve face image retrieval at such a detailed level. Additionally, RIS demonstrates robust and natural editing on real images, as evidenced by both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Furthermore, we discuss the responsible applications of RIS. For those interested, our code is publicly available at https://github.com/mchong6/RetrieveInStyle.
