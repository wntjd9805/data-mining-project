Current research on convolution on 3D point clouds, which extends from 2D grid domains, is not yet optimal. The standard convolution fails to distinguish feature correspondences effectively among 3D points, leading to poor feature learning. To address this limitation, we propose a method called Adaptive Graph Convolution (AdaptConv) that generates adaptive kernels for points based on their dynamically learned features. By using AdaptConv instead of a fixed or isotropic kernel, the flexibility of point cloud convolutions is enhanced, allowing for precise capturing of diverse relations between points with different semantic parts. Unlike existing attentional weight schemes, our AdaptConv incorporates adaptiveness within the convolution operation itself, instead of assigning different weights to neighboring points. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods for point cloud classification and segmentation on various benchmark datasets. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/hrzhou2/AdaptConv-master.
