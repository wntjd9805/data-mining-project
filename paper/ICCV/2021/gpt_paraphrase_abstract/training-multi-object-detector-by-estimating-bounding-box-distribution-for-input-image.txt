The main issue in multi-object detection using neural networks is how to train the network to handle a variable number of bounding boxes in different input images. Previous methods have approached this problem by directly assigning ground truth bounding boxes to specific locations in the network's output. However, this approach is heuristic and complex. This paper presents a new approach by formulating the multi-object detection task as a problem of density estimation of bounding boxes. Instead of assigning ground truth to specific locations, the network is trained to estimate the probability density of bounding boxes in an input image using a mixture model. The authors propose a novel network called Mixture Density Object Detector (MDOD) and an objective function for density estimation-based training. The MDOD method is applied to the MS COCO dataset and not only offers a new approach to multi-object detection but also improves detection performance. The code for MDOD is available at https://github.com/yoojy31/MDOD.
