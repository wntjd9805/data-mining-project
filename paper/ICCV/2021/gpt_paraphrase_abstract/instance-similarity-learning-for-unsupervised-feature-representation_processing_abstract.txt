This paper introduces a novel method called instance similarity learning (ISL) for unsupervised feature representation. Traditional methods rely on assigning high similarity to close instance pairs in the feature space, but this approach often results in incorrect pairwise relationships for large neighborhoods. This is because the Euclidean distance metric fails to accurately capture the semantic similarity on the feature manifold. In contrast, our proposed method explores the feature manifold in an unsupervised manner to learn the semantic similarity among instances and obtain discriminative representations. To achieve this, we utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to mine the underlying feature manifold. The generated features serve as proxies to progressively explore the feature manifold and acquire reliable pseudo supervision for the semantic similarity among instances. Extensive experiments conducted on image classification tasks demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/ZiweiWangTHU/ISL.git.
