This paper introduces a framework for improving the accuracy of an optical flow network using external cues. By incorporating sparse yet precise optical flow hints from an external source, the correlation scores generated by a cutting-edge optical flow network are adjusted to produce more accurate predictions. While it is not possible for real sensors to provide sparse flow hints, we demonstrate how these hints can be obtained by combining depth measurements from active sensors with geometry and hand-crafted optical flow algorithms. Our experimental results, conducted on standard benchmarks under simulated and real conditions, validate the efficacy of our framework.
