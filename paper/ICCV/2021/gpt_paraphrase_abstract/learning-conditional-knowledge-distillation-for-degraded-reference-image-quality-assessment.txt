This paper presents a practical solution called degraded-reference IQA (DR-IQA) for evaluating image restoration (IR) algorithms. Unlike existing approaches that rely on pristine-quality images as references, DR-IQA uses degraded images as references in blind image restoration tasks. The reference information is extracted from degraded images by distilling knowledge from pristine-quality images. This is achieved by learning a reference space where degraded images share the same feature statistics with pristine-quality images. The reference space is optimized to capture deep image priors that are helpful for quality assessment. Pristine-quality images are only used during training. DR-IQA provides a powerful and differentiable metric for blind IRs, particularly for GAN-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that DR-IQA performs comparably to full-reference settings.
