Learning-based hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising methods have proven effective, but their generalization capability on real testing HSI is limited due to their reliance on synthetic datasets. Additionally, there is a lack of public paired real HSI denoising datasets for evaluating HSI methods. This paper addresses these issues by focusing on the production of realistic datasets for learning and evaluating HSI denoising networks. To achieve this, the authors collect a paired real HSI denoising dataset, consisting of short-exposure noisy HSIs and corresponding long-exposure clean HSIs. They also propose an accurate HSI noise model that matches the distribution of real data and can be used to synthesize realistic datasets. Using this noise model, they develop an approach to calibrate the noise parameters of a given hyperspectral camera. The authors conduct extensive experiments and find that a network trained with synthetic data generated by their noise model performs as well as one trained with paired real data. They provide the code and data for their work, which can be accessed at the provided GitHub link.
