We propose a unified model called NPPNet that simultaneously performs human parsing and pose estimation tasks. These tasks are closely related, and by using one model for both, they can benefit from each other. However, human parsing involves pixel-wise classification while pose estimation is a regression task, making it challenging to extract discriminative features for both tasks and model their correlation. To address this, we employ Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to automatically allocate efficient feature connections. NPPNet searches for an efficient network architecture by exploring encoder-decoder architectures for each task and embedding NAS units for multi-scale feature interaction and high-level feature fusion. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both human parsing and pose estimation tasks.
