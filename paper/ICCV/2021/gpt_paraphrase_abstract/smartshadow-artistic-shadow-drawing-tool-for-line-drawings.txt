SmartShadow is a deep learning application designed for digital painting artists to enhance their artwork by adding shadows to line drawings. The application offers three innovative tools to assist artists in this process. Firstly, the Shadow brush allows artists to create rough outlines to indicate the desired areas for shadows, and the application then generates the shadows in real-time. Secondly, the Shadow boundary brush enables precise control over the boundaries of specific shadows. Lastly, the Global shadow generator estimates the direction of global shadows based on input brush strokes and consistently extends these shadows throughout the entire image. These tools not only significantly speed up the shadow drawing process (validated by experiments to be 3.1 times faster), but also provide the flexibility to achieve various shadow effects, thereby facilitating richer artistic creations. To develop these tools, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were trained using a large dataset comprising both real and synthesized data. Notably, the dataset includes 1670 shadow samples drawn by real artists. The effectiveness of the approach was confirmed through qualitative analysis and a user study, demonstrating that the shadows generated by SmartShadow are of high quality and practically usable in the daily works of digital painting artists.To provide further evidence of the application's capabilities, the supplementary material includes 30 additional results and 15 visual comparisons.
