Can neural models that are designed for general purposes learn how to navigate? In terms of PointGoal navigation, the answer is yes. Neural models that consist of task-agnostic components (such as CNNs and RNNs) and are trained using large-scale model-free reinforcement learning can achieve almost perfect performance. However, when it comes to ObjectGoal navigation, the question remains open. In this paper, we address this question.Currently, the best-known result for ObjectNav using general-purpose models is a success rate of only 6%. We have discovered that the main issue is overfitting. While training on a large scale leads to a 94% success rate in training environments, the success rate drops to just 8% in validation. We have identified that agents memorize environment layouts during training, which allows them to bypass the need for exploration and instead directly learn the shortest paths to nearby goal objects. This behavior occurs as a natural consequence of optimizing for the task metric, which actually discourages exploration. It is facilitated by powerful observation encoders and the limited number of training environment configurations.Based on our findings, we propose a solution to address overfitting in ObjectNav called Treasure Hunt Data Augmentation (THDA). THDA involves inserting 3D scans of household objects at various locations within scenes and using them as goals for ObjectNav. This augmentation greatly expands the set of training layouts. When combined with our other proposed changes, we achieve a 90% improvement in the state of the art on the Habitat ObjectGoal Navigation benchmark, increasing the success rate from 14% to 27%. Additionally, we improve path efficiency by 48%, increasing the Success weighted Path Length (SPL) from 7.5 to 11.1.In summary, we demonstrate that general-purpose neural models can learn to navigate in PointGoal scenarios. However, the same models face challenges in ObjectGoal navigation due to overfitting. By introducing THDA and implementing other modifications, we significantly enhance performance on the ObjectGoal Navigation benchmark.
