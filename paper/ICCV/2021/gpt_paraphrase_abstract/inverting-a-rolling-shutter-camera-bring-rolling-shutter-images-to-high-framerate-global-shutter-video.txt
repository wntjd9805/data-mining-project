This paper proposes a method for recovering a high framerate global shutter (GS) video from consecutive rolling shutter (RS) images, in order to achieve RS temporal super-resolution (RSSR). The RS effect poses challenges for downstream applications. The authors address this problem by exploiting the geometric constraint in the RS camera model, resulting in geometry-aware inversion. They make three contributions to resolve the difficulties: (i) formulating bidirectional RS undistortion flows under a constant velocity motion model, (ii) establishing the connection between RS undistortion flow and optical flow through a scaling operation, and (iii) developing a mutual conversion scheme between varying RS undistortion flows corresponding to different scanlines. Based on these formulations, the authors propose the first RS temporal super-resolution network in a cascaded structure to extract high framerate GS video. Their method explores spatio-temporal geometric relationships within a deep learning framework, requiring no additional supervision besides the middle-scanline ground truth GS image. Experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate that their method produces high-quality GS image sequences with rich details, surpassing existing methods.
