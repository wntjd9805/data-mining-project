Multiple outcomes are crucial in trajectory prediction tasks due to the uncertain nature of the future. Existing approaches can be categorized into regression, generation, and classification frameworks, but each has limitations that prevent comprehensive modeling of multimodal prediction tasks. This study introduces a new perspective and prediction framework that consists of three steps: modality clustering, classification, and synthesis. By addressing the shortcomings of previous frameworks, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on popular benchmarks, even without incorporating social and map information. Specifically, the method achieves a 19.2% and 20.8% improvement in ADE and FDE respectively on the ETH/UCY dataset.
