The task of online semantic segmentation in autonomous driving, specifically on a time series of point cloud frames, is crucial. However, existing models that focus on single-frame segmentation lack satisfactory accuracy and exhibit unstable flickering across frames. To address this, we propose a lightweight semantic segmentation framework called TempNet, which enhances both accuracy and stability by incorporating a novel frame aggregation scheme. To ensure computational efficiency, feature extraction and aggregation are performed only on a small subset of key frames using a temporal feature aggregation (TFA) network with an attentional pooling mechanism. These enhanced features are then propagated to intermediate non-key frames to avoid information loss. Additionally, we introduce a partial feature update (PFU) network that selectively updates propagated features with local features extracted from non-key frames when a significant disparity is quickly assessed. As a result, consistent and information-rich features are obtained for each frame. We evaluate TempNet on five state-of-the-art point cloud segmentation models using the SemanticKITTI dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that TempNet outperforms these models by a significant margin with minimal additional computational cost.
