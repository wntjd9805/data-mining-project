Most current deep learning-based trackers use a holistic approach to track targets by learning deep representations of the entire target. However, this method struggles to track targets with varying appearances. To overcome this limitation, some trackers use a part-based tracking strategy, dividing the target into patches and tracking them in parallel. The overall target state is inferred by combining the tracking results of these patches. However, not all patches are equally informative for tracking, and non-discriminative patches can have negative effects. In this paper, we propose a method that tracks the salient local parts of the target that are most informative for tracking. We introduce a fine-grained saliency mining module to capture these local saliencies and a saliency-association modeling module to learn effective correlation representations between the exemplar and the search image for state estimation. Our extensive experiments on five different datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art trackers.
