Most recent studies have focused on using deep neural networks to detect and locate temporal anomalies by learning normal patterns in an unsupervised manner. However, our work aims to make use of instance-level anomaly labels, which indicate whether anomalous events occurred in each instance of temporal data. In this paper, we introduce a new framework called WETAS that effectively identifies anomalous segments within an input instance. WETAS learns distinctive features from the instance-level labels to infer the sequential order of normal and anomalous segments, creating a rough segmentation mask. By applying dynamic time warping (DTW) alignment between the input instance and its segmentation mask, WETAS achieves temporal segmentation and improves itself using the mask as additional supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that WETAS outperforms other approaches in localizing temporal anomalies and provides more informative results compared to point-level detection methods.
