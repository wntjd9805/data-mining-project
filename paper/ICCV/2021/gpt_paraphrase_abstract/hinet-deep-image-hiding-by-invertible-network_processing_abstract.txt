This paper introduces a novel framework called HiNet, based on invertible neural networks (INN), for image hiding. The primary challenges in image hiding are capacity, invisibility, and security. To address the issue of capacity, the proposed framework utilizes an inverse learning mechanism to simultaneously learn the processes of concealing and revealing images. This allows for concealing a full-size secret image into a cover image of the same size, thereby increasing the capacity. In terms of invisibility, the framework hides the secret information in the wavelet domain instead of the pixel domain. Additionally, a low-frequency wavelet loss is introduced to ensure that the secret information is hidden in high-frequency wavelet sub-bands, enhancing invisibility and improving hiding security. Experimental results demonstrate that HiNet outperforms other state-of-the-art image hiding methods, with a significant improvement in secret image recovery on various datasets.
