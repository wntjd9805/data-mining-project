This paper presents a novel framework for unsupervised deep homography estimation. The framework introduces three contributions. Firstly, instead of regressing 4 offsets for a homography, the authors propose a homography flow representation that can be estimated using a weighted sum of 8 pre-defined homography flow bases. Secondly, considering that a homography contains only 8 degrees of freedom (DOFs), which is much less than the rank of network features, a Low Rank Representation (LRR) block is introduced to reduce the feature rank. This ensures that features related to dominant motions are retained while others are rejected. Lastly, a Feature Identity Loss (FIL) is proposed to enforce warp-equivariance in the learned image features. This means that the result should remain the same if the order of warp operation and feature extraction is swapped. By incorporating this constraint, the unsupervised optimization process is more effective and stable features are learned. The effectiveness of the proposed components is demonstrated through extensive experiments, showing that the approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art on homography benchmark datasets in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The code for the framework is available at the given GitHub link.
