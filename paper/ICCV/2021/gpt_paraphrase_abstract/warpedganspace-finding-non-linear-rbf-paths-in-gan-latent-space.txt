This study aims to address the limitations of current methods in discovering interpretable paths in the latent space of pretrained GANs. These limitations include the discovery of linear paths independent of the latent code and the reliance on visual inspection or laborious human labeling for evaluation. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose to learn non-linear warpings on the latent space using a set of RBF-based latent space warping functions. Each warping generates a family of non-linear paths through the gradient of the function. By optimizing the trainable parameters of the RBFs, the authors ensure that images generated along different paths are easily distinguishable by a discriminator network. This enables the generation of easily distinguishable image transformations, such as pose and facial expressions in facial images. The authors demonstrate that their method can also derive linear paths and that non-linear paths lead to steeper, more disentangled, and interpretable changes in the image space compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code and pretrained models are publicly available at the provided link.
