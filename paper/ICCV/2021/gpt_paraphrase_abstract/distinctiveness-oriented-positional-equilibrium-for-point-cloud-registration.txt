State-of-the-art learning-based methods for point cloud registration have relied heavily on graph neural networks (GNN). However, these GNN backbones suffer from a problem known as indistinguishable features, caused by oversmoothing and structural ambiguity of the high-level features. This issue, which has not received much attention in recent literature, is a crucial bottleneck in point cloud registration. To address this problem, we propose a new positional embedding scheme called the Distinctiveness oriented Positional Equilibrium (DoPE) module. This module significantly enhances the distinctiveness of high-level features in both the source and target point clouds, leading to better point matching and improved registration accuracy. Our approach involves using the DoPE module in an iterative registration framework. The two point clouds are gradually registered through rigid transformations, computed using the position-aware features provided by DoPE. In each iteration, the DoPE module provides increasingly consistent positional information to corresponding pairs, improving the predictions for point-to-point correspondence and enabling more accurate estimation of the rigid transformation. After only a few iterations, the network reaches a desired equilibrium state where the positional embeddings for matching pairs become nearly identical. We have conducted comprehensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of DoPE. These experiments cover various registration benchmarks, different registration task settings, and prominent backbones. The results demonstrate unprecedented performance improvements across all combinations.
