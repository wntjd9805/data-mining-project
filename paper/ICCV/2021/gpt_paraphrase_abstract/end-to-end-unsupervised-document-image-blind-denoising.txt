The removal of noise from scanned pages is an essential step before submitting them to an optical character recognition (OCR) system. However, most existing methods for image denoising require pairs of noisy and clean pages, which is not often available in real-world settings. Additionally, there is no single model capable of removing different types of noise from documents. In this study, we introduce a novel unsupervised deep learning model that can effectively eliminate various types of noise, such as salt and pepper noise, blurred or faded text, and watermarks, from documents with different intensities. Our proposed model is the first of its kind and provides an end-to-end solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by significantly improving the quality of scanned images and enhancing OCR performance on multiple test datasets.
