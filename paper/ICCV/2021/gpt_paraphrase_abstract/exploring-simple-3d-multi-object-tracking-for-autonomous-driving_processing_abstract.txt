3D multi-object tracking in LiDAR point clouds is crucial for self-driving vehicles. Most existing methods rely on a tracking-by-detection pipeline that requires a heuristic matching step for object association. This paper introduces SimTrack, an end-to-end trainable model that simplifies the tracking process by jointly detecting and tracking objects directly from raw point clouds. SimTrack predicts the initial location of each object in a given snippet to establish its tracking identity and then updates the location based on motion estimation. The heuristic matching step is eliminated during inference through a simple read-off operation. SimTrack incorporates object association, newborn object detection, and track termination in a single unified model. Extensive evaluations on the nuScenes and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that our approach performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods while eliminating the need for heuristic matching rules.
