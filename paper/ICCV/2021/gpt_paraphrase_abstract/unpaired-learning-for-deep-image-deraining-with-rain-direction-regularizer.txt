We introduce a straightforward yet efficient technique for removing rain from images using unpaired learning. Our method utilizes synthetic images and real rainy images to estimate rain maps and reconstruct derained images. We incorporate semi-supervised learning to separate rain layers and develop a rain direction regularizer to enhance rain estimation. By synthesizing new paired sets and employing knowledge distillation, we refine the deraining model. We also create two new rainy datasets to evaluate our approach, and the results demonstrate its superiority over existing methods in both benchmark datasets and real-world images.
