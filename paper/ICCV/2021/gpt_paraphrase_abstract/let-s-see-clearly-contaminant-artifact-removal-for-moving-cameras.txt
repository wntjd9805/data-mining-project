This paper presents a method for automatically removing contaminants such as dust, dirt, and moisture from camera lenses to improve the quality of images and videos. The proposed approach involves detecting attention maps to identify regions that require restoration. A flow completion module is then used to estimate the flow of the background scene in the attention regions affected by contaminants. By utilizing the attention maps and completed flows, a recurrent technique is employed to restore the input frame by retrieving clean pixels from neighboring frames. Additionally, a multi-frame processing stage is utilized to ensure temporal consistency throughout the entire video sequence. To train the network, a synthetic dataset is created to simulate the physical lighting properties of contaminant artifacts. This novel dataset and framework result in a method that effectively addresses various contaminants and surpasses other restoration approaches in terms of both visual quality and quantitative performance.
