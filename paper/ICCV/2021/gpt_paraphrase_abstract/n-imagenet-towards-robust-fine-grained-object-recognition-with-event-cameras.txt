We have developed N-ImageNet, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for accurate object recognition using event cameras. This dataset was created using programmable hardware, where an event camera continuously moves around a monitor displaying images from ImageNet. N-ImageNet is a challenging benchmark for event-based object recognition, offering a wide range of classes and samples. Through empirical analysis, we have demonstrated that pretraining on N-ImageNet significantly enhances the performance of event-based classifiers and enables them to learn effectively even with limited labeled data. Additionally, we have introduced various versions of N-ImageNet to evaluate the robustness of event-based classifiers under different camera trajectories and challenging lighting conditions. We have also proposed a new event representation technique to mitigate performance degradation. Notably, our work is the first to quantitatively explore the impact of environmental conditions on event-based object recognition algorithms. N-ImageNet and its variants are valuable resources that can guide the practical implementation of event-based object recognition algorithms in real-world scenarios.
