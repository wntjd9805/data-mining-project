Recent advancements in trajectory prediction have emphasized the importance of considering agents' intentions in order to accurately forecast their movements. However, these research findings are not easily applicable to intelligent and safety critical systems due to a lack of accessible public datasets. The existing datasets only focus on short-term pedestrian-specific intentions from a limited egocentric perspective. To address this gap, we introduce LOKI (LOng term and Key Intentions), a new extensive dataset specifically designed for predicting joint trajectories and intentions of diverse traffic agents (both pedestrians and vehicles) in autonomous driving scenarios. The LOKI dataset aims to explore various factors influencing intention, including the agent's own will, social interactions, environmental constraints, and contextual information. Additionally, we propose a model that integrates trajectory and intention prediction, demonstrating the benefits of recurrently considering intention for trajectory forecasting. Our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art trajectory prediction techniques by up to 27% and establishes a baseline for frame-wise intention estimation.
