We propose a reliable image hashing algorithm for attributing images to trusted sources, enabling users to make informed judgments about online images. Our algorithm is able to detect subtle visual changes that can significantly alter the message conveyed by an image, while remaining unaffected by benign transformations that occur during online redistribution. Our main contribution is OSCAR-Net1, a robust image hashing model inspired by the success of Transformers in the field of computer vision. OSCAR-Net creates a scene graph representation that focuses on minute changes in the visual appearance of each object and their spatial relationships. The network is trained using contrastive learning on a dataset of original and manipulated images, resulting in a state-of-the-art image hash for content identification that can handle large-scale applications.
