Open set recognition involves the detection of unknown classes that were not known during training. In order to identify new categories, a classifier must project input samples from known classes into compact and distinct regions of the feature space to differentiate them from samples of unknown classes. While Capsule Networks have been proven to outperform other methods, they have not yet been fully utilized in open-set recognition. Capsule networks replace scalar neurons with capsule vectors or matrices, representing different object properties. In our proposed approach, during training, capsule features of the same known class are encouraged to match a predefined Gaussian distribution, with a separate Gaussian for each class. This is achieved by employing the variational autoencoder framework, using a set of Gaussian priors as an approximation of the posterior distribution. Through this approach, we can control the compactness of features belonging to the same class around the center of the Gaussians, thereby regulating the classifier's ability to detect samples from unknown classes. Our model has been extensively tested through various experiments and ablation studies, achieving state-of-the-art results on different datasets in the tasks of open-set recognition and unknown detection.
