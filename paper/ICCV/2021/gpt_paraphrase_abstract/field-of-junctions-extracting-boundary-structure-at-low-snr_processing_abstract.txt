We present a new approach to identifying multiple boundary elements in images, such as contours, corners, and junctions, using a bottom-up model. Our model describes the shape of boundaries in small patches using a "generalized M-junction" that consists of M angles and a movable vertex. By employing non-convex optimization, we analyze images to simultaneously determine M + 2 junction values at each location. To ensure spatial consistency, we incorporate a novel regularizer that reduces curvature while preserving corners and junctions. The resulting "field of junctions" serves as a contour detector, corner/junction detector, and enhances the appearance of boundaries in regional areas. Notably, our approach excels at high noise levels, overcoming the limitations of other segmentation and boundary detection methods, thanks to its unified analysis of contours, corners, junctions, and uniform regions.
