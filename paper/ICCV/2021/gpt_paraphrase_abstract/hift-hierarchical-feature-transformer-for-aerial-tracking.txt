This study introduces a new method called hierarchical feature transformer (HiFT) for aerial tracking. Unlike existing Siamese-based tracking methods, HiFT utilizes hierarchical similarity maps generated by multi-level convolutional layers to combine spatial and semantic cues. This enables the fusion of global contextual information and the efficient learning of interdependencies among multi-level features. The proposed HiFT approach has been evaluated on four aerial benchmarks and has demonstrated its effectiveness. Real-world tests on an aerial platform have also confirmed its practicality, achieving real-time speed. The code for HiFT is available at https://github.com/vision4robotics/HiFT.
