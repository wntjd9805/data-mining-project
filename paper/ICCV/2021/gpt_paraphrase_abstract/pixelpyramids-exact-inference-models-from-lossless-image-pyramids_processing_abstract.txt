Autoregressive models are effective but computationally expensive for density estimation in natural images due to their sequential ordering. To address this limitation, we introduce Pixel-Pyramids, a block-autoregressive approach that utilizes a lossless pyramid decomposition and scale-specific representations to encode the joint distribution of image pixels. This approach offers a sparser dependency structure compared to fully autoregressive models. We demonstrate that our Pixel-Pyramids achieve state-of-the-art density estimation results for various image datasets, particularly for high-resolution data. For CelebA-HQ 1024Ã—1024 images, our method improves density estimates to 44% of the baseline while maintaining faster sampling speeds than easily parallelizable flow-based models.
