This paper addresses the challenge of improving the representation of images beyond the limitations of training labels. By utilizing a combination of coarse labels and a latent space, our network achieves more accurate category-level retrieval of images in a collection. We achieve this through a nearest-neighbor classifier objective and an instance loss inspired by self-supervised learning. Our approach surpasses all other methods in retrieving or classifying images at a finer granularity than what was available during training. Additionally, our strategy enhances accuracy in transfer learning tasks to fine-grained datasets.
