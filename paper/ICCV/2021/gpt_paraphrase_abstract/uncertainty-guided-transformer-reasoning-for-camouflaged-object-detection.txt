Detecting objects that blend into their surroundings is a difficult task for both humans and AI. Traditional object detection methods are not effective for this task as they primarily focus on identifying easy and obvious objects, while ignoring more challenging ones with indistinguishable textures. To address this, we propose a new approach called uncertainty-guided transformer reasoning (UGTR) that combines a probabilistic representational model with transformers. Our method first learns a conditional distribution over the output of the backbone model to estimate initial predictions and associated uncertainties. Then, it uses an attention mechanism to reason over these uncertain regions and generate final predictions. By leveraging both deterministic and probabilistic information, our approach combines the advantages of Bayesian learning and Transformer-based reasoning for camouflaged object detection. Experimental results on CHAMELEON, CAMO, and COD10K datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves higher accuracy compared to existing state-of-the-art models. The code for our approach is available at https://github.com/fanyang587/UGTR.
