This paper presents a novel approach for generating superpoints from irregular 3D point clouds using a deep iterative clustering network. Unlike existing methods that rely on handcrafted or learned features, our network can learn superpoints in an end-to-end manner. The network first learns a soft point-superpoint association map by considering both the coordinates and features of the points. It then iteratively updates the association map and superpoint centers to improve the grouping accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a label consistency loss to train the network by predicting pseudo labels for the superpoint centers. Experimental results on different datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in superpoint generation and also enhances point cloud semantic segmentation. The code for our approach is publicly available at https://github.com/fpthink/SPNet.
