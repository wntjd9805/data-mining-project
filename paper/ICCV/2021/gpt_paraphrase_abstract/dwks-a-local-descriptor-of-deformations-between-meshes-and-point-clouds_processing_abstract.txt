Our proposal introduces a new descriptor called DWKS, which is designed to identify correspondences between two collections of deformable shapes. Unlike other descriptors that focus on local geometry, DWKS captures the deformation around a specific point within a collection in a multi-scale and informative way. This allows us to determine correspondences between collections without the need for landmarks. We build upon the successful spectral WKS descriptors, but instead of using the Laplace-Beltrami operator, we demonstrate that a similar construction can be achieved with shape difference operators, which capture differences or distortions within a collection. By leveraging this collection information, our descriptor enables non-rigid shape matching tasks that involve strong partiality and significant deformations. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through various challenging matching problems involving meshes and point clouds.
