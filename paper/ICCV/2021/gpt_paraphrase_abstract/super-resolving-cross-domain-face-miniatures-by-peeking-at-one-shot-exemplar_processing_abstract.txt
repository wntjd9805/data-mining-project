Conventional methods for enhancing the resolution of facial images typically assume that the low-resolution (LR) images being tested belong to the same domain as the training images. However, in real-world scenarios, there are often differences in lighting conditions and imaging hardware between training and testing images, resulting in domain gaps. Ignoring these gaps can lead to subpar performance in face super-resolution (FSR). This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently and effectively transferring a trained FSR model to a target domain. The authors propose a new network called DAP-FSR (Domain-Aware Pyramid-based Face Super-Resolution network), which aims to super-resolve LR faces from a target domain using only a pair of high-resolution (HR) and LR examples from that domain. The DAP-FSR network leverages an encoder to extract multi-scale latent representations of the input LR face. Since only one example is available from the target domain, the authors suggest augmenting the target domain data by mixing the latent representations of the target domain face with those from a source domain. The mixed representations are then fed into the decoder of the DAP-FSR network, which generates new face images that resemble the style of the target domain. The generated HR faces are used to optimize the decoder and reduce the domain gap. Through iterative updates to the latent representations and the decoder, the DAP-FSR network adapts to the target domain, resulting in authentic and high-quality upsampled HR faces. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of the DAP-FSR network compared to state-of-the-art methods.
