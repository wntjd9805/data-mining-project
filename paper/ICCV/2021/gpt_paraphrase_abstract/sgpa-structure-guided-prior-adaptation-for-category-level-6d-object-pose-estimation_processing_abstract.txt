This paper addresses the challenge of predicting the position and orientation of unseen objects in category-level 6D object pose estimation. This task is crucial in robotics and augmented reality applications. The main obstacle in this task is the significant intra-class variation, which remains unsolved. To overcome this problem, the paper proposes a structure-guided prior adaptation scheme that utilizes category priors. Unlike existing methods, the proposed approach dynamically adapts the prior based on the structure similarity between an object and its corresponding category prior. This adaptation allows for accurate reconstruction of the 3D canonical model of the specific object, enabling precise pose estimation. Additionally, the paper incorporates sparse structural information during prior adaptation by extracting low-rank structure points from the dense object point cloud. Extensive experiments on CAMERA25 and REAL275 benchmarks demonstrate a significant improvement in performance.
