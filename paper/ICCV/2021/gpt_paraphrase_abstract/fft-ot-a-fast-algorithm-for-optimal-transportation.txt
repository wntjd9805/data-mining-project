The abstract discusses the concept of optimal transportation maps, which are used to find the most cost-effective way of transporting a probability measure from one location to another. These maps have been widely applied in various fields such as vision, deep learning, and medical imaging. The computation of optimal transportation maps on a large scale is challenging due to their highly non-linear nature. To address this challenge, the authors propose a method called FFT-OT algorithm, which is based on three key ideas. First, they convert the problem of solving a Monge-Amp√®re equation into a fixed point problem. Second, they reformulate the property of obliqueness in optimal transportation maps as Neumann boundary conditions on rectangular domains. Third, they incorporate the use of FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) in each iteration to solve a Poisson equation and improve computational efficiency. The proposed algorithm is evaluated through experiments conducted on surfaces obtained from 3D scanning and medical imaging reconstructions. The results demonstrate that the FFT-OT algorithm is a simple, versatile, and scalable method with high efficiency and accuracy.
