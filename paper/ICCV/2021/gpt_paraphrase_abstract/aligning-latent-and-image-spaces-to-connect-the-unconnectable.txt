This work presents a method for generating infinite high-resolution images with diverse and complex content. The method utilizes a patch-wise generator that is perfectly equivariant and performs synchronous interpolations in both the image and latent spaces. Latent codes are positioned on a coordinate grid and each pixel is computed based on an interpolation of neighboring codes. The AdaIN mechanism is modified to work within this setup, and a GAN model is trained to generate images positioned between any two latent vectors. This approach enables the generation of infinitely large images with smooth transitions between different scenes. Additionally, a new dataset called LHQ, consisting of 90k high-resolution nature landscapes, is introduced. The proposed method is tested on LHQ, LSUN Tower, and LSUN Bridge datasets, and it outperforms the baselines in terms of image quality and diversity, achieving at least four times improvement.
