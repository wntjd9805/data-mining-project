Many existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods use domain adversarial training to align features and reduce the gap between different domains. This involves training a feature extractor to deceive a domain discriminator, ensuring that the feature distributions are aligned. However, as training progresses, the discrimination capability of the domain classifier decreases, making it less effective in driving the training of the feature extractor. To address this issue, we propose a new optimization strategy called Re-enforceable Adversarial Domain Adaptation (RADA). This strategy aims to rejuvenate the domain discriminator during training by using dynamic domain labels. We accomplish this by relabeling well-aligned target domain samples as source domain samples in real-time. This relabeling makes the distributions of the samples that were previously difficult to distinguish more separable, resulting in a more powerful domain classifier for the new data distributions. This, in turn, enhances the alignment of features. We conducted extensive experiments on various UDA benchmarks to evaluate the effectiveness and superiority of our RADA method. The results demonstrate that RADA outperforms other approaches in terms of domain adaptation.
