Image quality assessment (IQA) is a crucial area of study in order to comprehend and enhance visual experience. The most advanced IQA methods currently rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, CNN-based models often face limitations due to the fixed shape constraint during batch training. This constraint necessitates resizing and cropping of input images, leading to a decline in image quality. In order to overcome this issue, we introduce a novel approach called multi-scale image quality Transformer (MUSIQ), which enables the processing of native resolution images with varying sizes and aspect ratios. By utilizing a multi-scale image representation, our method can effectively evaluate image quality at different levels of detail. Additionally, we propose a unique hash-based 2D spatial embedding and a scale embedding to support positional embedding in the multi-scale representation. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance compared to other methods on prominent IQA datasets such as PaQ-2-PiQ, SPAQ, and KonIQ-10k.
