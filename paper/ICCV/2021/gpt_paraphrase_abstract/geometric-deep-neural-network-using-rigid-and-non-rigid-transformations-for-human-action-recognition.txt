Deep learning architectures have been successful in computer vision tasks, but they are designed for data with a Euclidean structure. However, pre-processed data often lies on a non-linear space. In this study, we propose a new approach for skeleton-based action recognition that takes into account the underlying geometry of the data. We model skeleton sequences as trajectories on Kendall's shape space and then map them to a linear tangent space. The resulting structured data is then inputted into a deep learning architecture, which includes a layer for optimizing rigid and non-rigid transformations of the 3D skeletons, followed by a CNN-LSTM network. Our approach has been evaluated on two large-scale skeleton datasets, NTU-RGB+D and NTU-RGB+D 120, and has shown superior performance compared to existing geometric deep learning methods and recently published approaches in the majority of configurations.
