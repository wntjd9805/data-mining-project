This paper introduces a new approach called single-temporal supervised learning (STAR) for change detection in high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images. Traditionally, bitemporal supervised learning is used for change detection, but it is costly and time-consuming to label large-scale bitemporal HSR images. STAR addresses this issue by exploiting object changes in unpaired images as supervisory signals, allowing for the training of a high-accuracy change detector using only unpaired labeled images. The proposed approach, ChangeStar, utilizes the ChangeMixin module to reuse deep semantic segmentation architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that ChangeStar significantly outperforms the baseline under single-temporal supervision and achieves superior performance under bitemporal supervision. The code for ChangeStar is available on GitHub.
