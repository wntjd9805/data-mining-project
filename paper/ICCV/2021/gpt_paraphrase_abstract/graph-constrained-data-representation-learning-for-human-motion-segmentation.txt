Recently, there has been a rise in the use of transfer subspace learning approaches for human motion segmentation (HMS). These approaches utilize prior knowledge from a source domain to improve clustering performance on a target domain, making them the current state of the art in HMS. However, this paper proposes a new unsupervised model that learns a representation of the data and uncovers clustering information from the data itself. This model is similar to temporal subspace clustering but has two key differences. Firstly, it learns an auxiliary data matrix that can deviate from the initial data, providing more flexibility to the coding matrix. Secondly, it introduces a regularization term for this auxiliary data matrix to preserve the local geometrical structure in the high-dimensional space. The proposed model is efficiently optimized using an original Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) formulation, enabling joint learning of the auxiliary data representation, a non-negative dictionary, and a coding matrix. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets for HMS demonstrate that this approach achieves significantly better clustering performance than state-of-the-art methods, including both unsupervised and semi-supervised transfer learning approaches.
