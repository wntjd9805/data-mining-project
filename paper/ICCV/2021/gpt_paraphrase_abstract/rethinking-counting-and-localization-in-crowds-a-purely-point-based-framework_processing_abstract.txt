To better meet the practical needs of crowd analysis, it is more effective to localize individuals in crowds rather than simply counting them. However, current localization methods that rely on intermediate representations, such as density maps or pseudo boxes, as learning targets are counter-intuitive and prone to errors. In this paper, we present a point-based framework for simultaneous crowd counting and individual localization. Instead of reporting the absolute counting error, we introduce a new metric called density Normalized Average Precision (nAP) to provide a more comprehensive and precise evaluation of performance.Within this framework, we propose an intuitive solution called Point to Point Network (P2PNet) which directly predicts a set of point proposals to represent heads in an image, aligning with human annotation results. By conducting a thorough analysis, we identify the crucial step of assigning optimal learning targets for these proposals. To address this, we propose using the Hungarian algorithm to perform one-to-one matching for this association. P2PNet not only outperforms existing methods on popular counting benchmarks, but also achieves promising accuracy in individual localization.The codes for our approach will be made available at TencentYoutuResearch/CrowdCounting-P2PNet.
