This study explores the concept of cued recall, wherein humans are able to recognize small-scale objects by associating visual cues with their memorized appearance. Inspired by this memory process, the researchers propose a new framework for detecting small-scale pedestrians using cued recall. They introduce a large-scale embedding learning approach called LPR Memory, which aims to memorize and recall the appearance of large-scale pedestrians. By utilizing a large-scale pedestrian exemplar set, the LPR Memory can retrieve information about large-scale pedestrians from small-scale ones. The effectiveness of the proposed framework with the LPR Memory is validated through comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments.
