Curriculum learning is a method inspired by human learning that involves teaching easier concepts first before moving on to harder ones. This approach uses non-uniform sampling of mini-batches based on the difficulty of examples. Similar to how a teacher adjusts the curriculum based on a student's progress, a proper curriculum should be adapted to the current state of the model. In contrast to previous works that use a fixed curriculum, this study introduces Adaptive Curriculum Learning (Adaptive CL), which adjusts the difficulty of examples based on the model's current state. The difficulty score is adjusted using the loss of the current model while retaining previously learned knowledge. The study also provides theoretical proof that the expected convergence rate of curriculum learning decreases with respect to the loss of a point regarding the optimal hypothesis and increases with respect to the loss of a point regarding the current hypothesis in a non-linear model and binary classification setting. These analyses suggest that Adaptive CL can improve convergence properties during the early stages of learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Adaptive CL compared to existing curriculum learning methods.
