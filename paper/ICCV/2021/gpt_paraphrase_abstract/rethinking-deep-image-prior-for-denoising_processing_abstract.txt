The deep image prior (DIP) is a useful tool for solving inverse problems, but it struggles with denoising due to the challenge of fitting noise. In this study, we analyze the DIP using effective degrees of freedom to track optimization progress and propose a stopping criterion that avoids overfitting to noise. We also introduce the stochastic temporal ensemble (STE) method to enhance the DIP's denoising performance. We extend our method to handle both Gaussian and Poisson noise. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively removes noise while preserving important details in the image. Furthermore, our method outperforms previous techniques in terms of LPIPS scores on multiple datasets, while maintaining comparable PSNR and SSIM values.
