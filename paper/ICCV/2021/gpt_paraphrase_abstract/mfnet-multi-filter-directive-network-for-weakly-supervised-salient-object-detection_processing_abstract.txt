Weakly supervised salient object detection (WSOD) aims to train a CNN-based saliency network using low-cost annotations. Previous WSOD methods have focused on obtaining a single "high-quality" pseudo label from these annotations and then building their saliency networks. However, these methods are limited as the generated single label is influenced by refinement algorithms and may exhibit biased characteristics, which in turn impact the saliency networks. In this study, we propose a new framework that incorporates multiple pseudo labels to obtain more comprehensive and accurate saliency cues, thereby avoiding the aforementioned issue. Our approach involves a multi-filter directive network (MFNet) consisting of a saliency network and multiple directive filters. These directive filters are designed to extract and filter precise saliency cues from the noisy pseudo labels. The multiple accurate cues from the directive filters are then simultaneously propagated to the saliency network using a multi-guidance loss. Extensive experiments conducted on five datasets using four metrics demonstrate that our method surpasses existing methods in terms of performance. Furthermore, our framework can be easily integrated into existing methods to enhance their performance. The code and results of our method can be accessed at https://github.com/OIPLab-DUT/MFNet.
