Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have seen growth in various applications, including inland waters. This expansion presents new challenges for object detection, crucial for USV perception systems. This study focuses on small object detection on water surfaces in inland waters, important for safe navigation and tasks like waste cleaning. To overcome limitations of vision-based detection, a novel radar-vision fusion method is proposed. By utilizing millimeter wave radar point clouds and integrating RGB images and radar data, the method enhances accuracy and robustness for small object detection. Testing on a real-world floating bottle dataset shows significant improvement in detection accuracy compared to vision-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, the proposed method remains robust even when a single sensor degrades.
