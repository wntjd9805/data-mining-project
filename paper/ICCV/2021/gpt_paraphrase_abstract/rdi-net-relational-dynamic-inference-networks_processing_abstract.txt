Dynamic inference networks aim to improve computational efficiency by dynamically selecting an executing path for a given sample. Existing methods assign routers to convolutional blocks and make sequential executing decisions without considering the relations during dynamic inference. This paper proposes a novel approach to model relations in dynamic inference from two perspectives: routers and samples. The authors introduce a relational router that uses graph convolution to aggregate contextual features from preceding routers and propagate its own features to subsequent routers, enabling executing decisions for the current block in a long-range manner. Additionally, a Sample Relation Module (SRM) is introduced to model the relation between samples, encouraging correlated samples to follow correlated executing paths. The proposed method, called Relational Dynamic Inference Network (RDI-Net), achieves state-of-the-art performance and reduces computational cost according to extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets.
