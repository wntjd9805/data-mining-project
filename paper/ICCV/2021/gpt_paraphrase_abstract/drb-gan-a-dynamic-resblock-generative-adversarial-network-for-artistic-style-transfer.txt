The paper introduces a novel approach called the Dynamic ResBlock Generative Adversarial Network (DRB-GAN) for artistic style transfer. The style code is represented as shared parameters in Dynamic ResBlocks that connect both the style encoding network and the style transfer network. The style encoding network utilizes a style class-aware attention mechanism to generate the style codes based on the style feature representation. In the style transfer network, multiple Dynamic ResBlocks are employed to combine the style code with the extracted CNN semantic feature. These combined features are then passed through a spatial window Layer-Instance Normalization (SW-LIN) decoder, resulting in high-quality synthetic images with artistic style transfer. Additionally, the DRB-GAN model incorporates a style collection conditional discriminator for both arbitrary style transfer and collection style transfer during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DRB-GAN outperforms existing methods in terms of visual quality and efficiency for both arbitrary and collection style transfer.
