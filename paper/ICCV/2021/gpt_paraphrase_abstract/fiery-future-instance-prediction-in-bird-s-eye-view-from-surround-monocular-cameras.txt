FIERY is a future prediction model for autonomous driving that uses monocular cameras to estimate the future behavior of road agents. It predicts instance segmentation and motion of dynamic agents, which can then be transformed into non-parametric future trajectories. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on HD maps, FIERY learns to model the stochastic nature of the future directly from camera driving data. It combines perception, sensor fusion, and prediction components in a single model. The results show that FIERY outperforms previous prediction baselines on the NuScenes and Lyft datasets. The code and trained models are publicly available.
