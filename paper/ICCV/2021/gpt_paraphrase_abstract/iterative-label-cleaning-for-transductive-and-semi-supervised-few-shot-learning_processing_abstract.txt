We propose a new algorithm for few-shot learning that effectively utilizes limited supervision and data. Our approach combines transductive inference and semi-supervised learning to improve performance. By leveraging the manifold structure of labeled and unlabeled data distributions, we predict pseudo-labels and balance them over classes. We also use the loss value distribution of a limited-capacity classifier to select the cleanest labels, iteratively enhancing the quality of pseudo-labels. Our solution achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results on four benchmark datasets (miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, CUB, and CIFAR-FS). It is robust to feature space pre-processing and the quantity of available data. The source code for our algorithm is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/MichalisLazarou/iLPC.
