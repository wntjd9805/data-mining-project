This paper addresses the challenge of predicting the motion of vehicles in complex environments with limited visibility. The authors introduce a new task called safety-aware motion prediction, which focuses on predicting an occupancy map that indicates the earliest time when each location can be occupied by both seen and unseen vehicles. The ability to predict unseen vehicles is crucial for ensuring safety in autonomous driving. To tackle this task, the authors propose a deep learning model that incorporates three new loss functions to predict the earliest occupancy map. The model is evaluated on the nuScenes dataset and outperforms existing baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in safety-aware motion prediction. The authors claim that their approach is the first to successfully predict the existence of unseen vehicles in most cases.
