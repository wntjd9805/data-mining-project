ML deployments often struggle with training models for rare categories due to limited labeled data. However, there is usually access to a large amount of unlabeled data, making semi-supervised or active learning methods appealing for reducing human labeling efforts. Previous approaches assume access to a modest amount of labeled data and that all images belong to a common category, which is often not the case in practice. This paper addresses the challenge of starting with only five labeled positives for a rare category and a majority of unlabeled negatives. To overcome this, an active semi-supervised method is proposed. The method utilizes human and machine efforts effectively by using human labels to identify positive examples and machine-generated pseudo-labels to identify negatives. It also adapts representation learning techniques to handle imbalanced human labeled data and iteratively trains models with noisy machine labeled data. The proposed approach is compared with previous active learning and semi-supervised methods, showing significant improvements in accuracy per unit labeling effort, especially with limited labeling resources.
