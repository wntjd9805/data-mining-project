This study focuses on uncertainty estimation for image-guided depth completion. We enhance the Deep Basis Fitting (DBF) method for depth completion by incorporating a Bayesian evidence framework, which allows us to generate calibrated per-pixel variance. The DBF approach involves a network that generates low-dimensional depth bases and a differentiable least squares fitting module that calculates basis weights using sparse depths. Through our Bayesian Deep Basis Fitting (BDBF) approach, we are able to 1) provide accurate uncertainty estimates and 2) enable depth completion even with limited or no sparse measurements. We conduct controlled experiments to compare BDBF with commonly used techniques for uncertainty estimation across different scenarios. The results demonstrate that our method yields superior uncertainty estimates and accurate depth predictions.
