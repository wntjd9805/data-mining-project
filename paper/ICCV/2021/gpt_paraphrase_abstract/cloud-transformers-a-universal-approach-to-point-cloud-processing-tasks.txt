We introduce a versatile building block that enhances deep point cloud processing architectures for various tasks. This block merges the concepts of spatial transformers and multi-view convolutional networks with the efficiency of standard convolutional layers in both two and three-dimensional dense grids. It operates through multiple parallel heads, where each head transforms feature representations of individual points into a compact space and employs dense convolution to exchange information across points. The outputs of each head are combined to update point features. By utilizing this block, we construct architectures for discriminative tasks such as point cloud segmentation and classification, as well as generative tasks like point cloud inpainting and image-based point cloud reconstruction. These architectures achieve state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the adaptability of the new building block for point cloud processing.
