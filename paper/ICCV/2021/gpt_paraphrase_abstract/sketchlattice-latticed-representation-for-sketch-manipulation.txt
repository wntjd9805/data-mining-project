The main challenge in designing a sketch representation is dealing with the abstract and iconic nature of sketches. Current approaches either treat sketches as natural images using CNN-based networks or utilize a vector format that captures the structural information of drawing orders through RNN-based methods. However, the pixelative format lacks the intuitive utilization of structural cues, while the vector format is not widely available for practical use. To address this, we propose a lattice structured sketch representation that eliminates the need for vector data while preserving its structural cues. The sketch lattice is a set of points sampled from the pixelative format using a lattice graph. Our lattice structure is adaptable to structural changes, which greatly benefits sketch abstraction modeling for generation tasks. We demonstrate that our lattice representation can be efficiently encoded using a graph model with significantly fewer parameters compared to the current state-of-the-art. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the sketch lattice for sketch manipulation, such as sketch healing and image-to-sketch synthesis.
