We introduce a new neural representation for light field content that enables efficient storage and accurate local reconstruction. Our approach utilizes a fully-connected neural network to learn the mapping between each pixel's coordinates and its corresponding color values. To improve the network's ability to capture fine details, we propose an input transformation strategy based on Gegenbauer polynomials, which have shown theoretical advantages over the Fourier basis. Experimental results demonstrate that our Gegenbauer-based design, combined with sinusoidal activation functions, outperforms various network architectures, including those inspired by Fourier techniques. Our network, called SIGNET (SInusoidalGegenbauer NETwork), achieves higher quality light field reconstruction while maintaining a more compact representation compared to state-of-the-art compression methods. Additionally, SIGNET allows for random access to encoded light field pixels due to its functional design. We also show that SIGNET has super-resolution capability without requiring additional training.
