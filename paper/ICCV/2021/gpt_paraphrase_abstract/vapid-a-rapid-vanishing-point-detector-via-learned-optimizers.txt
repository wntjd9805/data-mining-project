Vanishing points are a well-known concept in 3D vision research, used to infer 3D structures from 2D images. They have various applications in autonomous driving, SLAM, and AR/VR, such as road direction estimation, camera calibration, and camera pose estimation. However, existing methods for detecting vanishing points often struggle to balance robustness, precision, and inference speed. In this paper, we propose VaPiD, a new neural network-based Vanishing Point Detector that achieves unprecedented efficiency through the use of learned vanishing point optimizers. Our method consists of two components: a vanishing point proposal network that provides coarse estimations of vanishing points, and a neural vanishing point optimizer that iteratively refines the positions of these proposals for higher precision. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach offers competitive, and in some cases superior, performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods for vanishing point detection, while also being significantly faster.
