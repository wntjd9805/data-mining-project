This abstract discusses the concept of how a static scene would react to a local poke and the effects it would have on other parts of an object. Despite the stochastic nature of the world, there would be distinct movement that is governed by the characteristic kinematics of objects. Conversely, the movement of an object provides important information about its underlying kinematics and the interdependencies between its parts. The authors propose a method called iPOKE (invertible Prediction of Object Kinematics) that allows for the sampling of object kinematics and establishes a one-to-one correspondence with plausible future image sequences. This enables controlled stochastic video synthesis, capturing the diversity of outcomes while still providing efficient control of movements. Unlike previous works, this approach can be applied to various object instances and is not limited to specific object classes.
