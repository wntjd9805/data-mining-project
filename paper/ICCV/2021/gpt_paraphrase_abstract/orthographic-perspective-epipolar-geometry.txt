This paper explores the relationship between orthographic and perspective cameras in terms of epipolar geometry. It extends classical findings on the perspective essential matrix to this context and introduces new minimal solvers for both calibrated and partially calibrated, as well as non-central camera setups. Although orthographic cameras may appear uncommon, they have practical applications in various fields, such as modeling 2D maps, aerial/satellite photography, and approximating narrow field-of-view cameras. The experiments conducted demonstrate the practicality of the developed theory and solvers in applications like Radar-Camera calibration and aligning Structure-from-Motion models with aerial or satellite images.
