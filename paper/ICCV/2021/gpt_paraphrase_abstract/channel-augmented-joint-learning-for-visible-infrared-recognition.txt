This paper presents a novel approach to address the visible-infrared recognition problem by introducing a powerful channel augmented joint learning strategy. Existing methods for data augmentation in this problem often overlook the specific properties of visible to infrared matching by using standard operations designed for single-modality visible images. In contrast, our approach focuses on generating color-irrelevant images by randomly swapping color channels, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing augmentation operations without modifying the network. This strategy significantly improves the robustness against color variations. Additionally, we incorporate a random erasing strategy to simulate random occlusions and further enhance diversity. To handle both intra- and cross-modality variations in cross-modality metric learning, we propose an enhanced channel-mixed learning strategy that utilizes squared difference for stronger discriminability. Furthermore, we develop a channel-augmented joint learning strategy to explicitly optimize the outputs of augmented images. Extensive experiments on visible-infrared recognition tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies. Without the use of auxiliary information, our approach achieves a significant improvement of 14.59% in Rank-1 accuracy and 13.00% in mean average precision (mAP) on the large-scale SYSU-MM01 dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art performance.
