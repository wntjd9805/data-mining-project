Few-shot learning is a challenging task that involves recognizing samples from new classes with minimal labeled examples. Current methods assume that the data for few-shot learning tasks adhere to a fixed Euclidean structure, but this assumption is difficult to maintain in real-world scenarios and can distort the data. To address this issue, we propose learning a curved embedding space using hyperbolic geometry, which allows for task-specific embedding spaces with suitable curvatures that match the data characteristics. This approach leads to more generic embedding spaces. We then utilize intra-class and inter-class context information in the embedding space to generate class prototypes for discriminative classification. We conducted comprehensive experiments on inductive and transductive few-shot learning and found that our proposed method outperforms existing embedding methods.
