This study proposes a new lane detection framework called Cond-LaneNet, which addresses the challenge of detecting lane lines with complex topologies. The framework first detects the lane instances and then predicts the line shape for each instance. To tackle the discrimination problem at the lane instance level, a conditional lane detection strategy based on conditional convolution and row-wise formulation is introduced. Additionally, a Recurrent Instance Module (RIM) is designed to handle complex lane topologies such as dense lines and fork lines. The proposed method achieves real-time efficiency due to its end-to-end pipeline, requiring minimal post-processing. Extensive evaluation on three benchmark datasets demonstrates that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency, with a F1 score of 78.14 and a frame rate of 220 FPS on the CULane dataset. The code for the method is publicly available at https://github.com/aliyun/conditional-lane-detection.
