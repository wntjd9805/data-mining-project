Convolutional neural networks face challenges when processing point clouds due to their irregular distribution and discrete shape representation. To overcome these challenges, various handcrafted convolution variants have been developed, although they may not effectively capture the diverse shapes formed by discrete points. This paper introduces PointSeaConv, a novel differential convolution search paradigm for point clouds. It is a data-driven approach that automatically generates suitable convolutions for geometric shape modeling. The paper also presents a joint optimization framework for simultaneously searching for internal convolutions and external architecture. To mitigate the impact of discretization error, an epsilon-greedy algorithm is introduced. The proposed PointSeaNet, a deep network capable of capturing geometric shapes at both the convolution and architecture levels, is discovered for point cloud processing through this approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointSeaNet outperforms current handcrafted deep models on challenging benchmarks across multiple tasks with significant improvements.
