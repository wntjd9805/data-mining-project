This abstract discusses the challenge of few-shot semantic segmentation, which involves segmenting a target object in a query image with limited annotated support images. The task requires understanding various visual cues and analyzing correspondence relations between the query and support images. To address this, the authors propose Hypercorrelation Squeeze Networks (HSNet), which utilizes multi-level feature correlation and efficient 4D convolutions. HSNet extracts diverse features from different convolutional layers and creates a collection of 4D correlation tensors called hypercorrelations. By using center-pivot 4D convolutions in a pyramidal architecture, the method gradually incorporates high-level semantic and low-level geometric cues from the hypercorrelations to generate precise segmentation masks in a coarse-to-fine manner. The proposed method shows significant performance improvements on standard few-shot segmentation benchmarks (PASCAL-5i, COCO-20i, and FSS-1000), validating its effectiveness.
