Four new real-world distribution shift datasets have been introduced, which involve changes in image style, image blur, geographic location, camera operation, and more. These datasets were used to evaluate existing methods for improving out-of-distribution robustness. Contrary to previous claims, it was found that using larger models and artificial data augmentations can enhance robustness on real-world distribution shifts. Additionally, it was discovered that improvements in artificial robustness benchmarks can transfer to real-world distribution shifts. Based on the observation that data augmentations can assist with real-world distribution shifts, a new data augmentation method was proposed, which outperforms models pre-trained with significantly more labeled data, thus advancing the state-of-the-art. However, while certain methods consistently improve robustness in texture and local image statistics, they do not prove effective in addressing other distribution shifts such as geographic changes. This study highlights the importance of simultaneously studying multiple distribution shifts in future research, as it was demonstrated that no evaluated method consistently enhances robustness.
