The current leading methods for object detection and segmentation are effective in scenarios where the list of object categories is known. However, many real-world applications require the ability to detect and segment objects that have never been seen before. This paper introduces UVO (Unidentified Video Objects), a new benchmark for open-world object segmentation in videos. UVO surpasses existing benchmarks in terms of size, providing significantly more videos and mask annotations per video. UVO also presents more challenging scenarios with crowded scenes and complex background motions. Additionally, UVO can be utilized for object tracking and super-voxel segmentation. It is believed that UVO serves as a versatile platform for researchers to develop innovative approaches for open-world object segmentation and encourages further exploration in video understanding beyond classification and detection.
