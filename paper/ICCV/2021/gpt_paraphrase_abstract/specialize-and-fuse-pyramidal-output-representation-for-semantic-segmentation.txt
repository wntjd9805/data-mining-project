We introduce a new method for semantic segmentation that focuses on simplicity and efficiency. Our approach involves a pyramidal output representation, where different levels specialize in specific class distributions. This allows us to predict a smaller number of labels for unity-cells, ensuring parsimony. We also incorporate a coarse-to-fine contextual module to aggregate features from different levels. Through extensive studies, we demonstrate the effectiveness of each module in our method. Finally, our approach achieves top performance on popular semantic segmentation datasets such as ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, and Pascal-Context.
