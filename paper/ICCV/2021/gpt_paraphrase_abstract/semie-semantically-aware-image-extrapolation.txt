We propose a new approach for image extrapolation that allows for adding new objects to an image. Previous methods were limited to extending existing objects, but our approach focuses on both extending existing objects and adding new objects based on the context. We begin by obtaining an object segmentation map using a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation method. This map is then used to compute extrapolated semantic and panoptic segmentation maps. Finally, the input image and segmentation maps are combined to generate the extrapolated image. We conducted experiments on Cityscapes and ADE20K-bedroom datasets and found that our method outperformed all other methods in terms of FID and object co-occurrence statistics.
