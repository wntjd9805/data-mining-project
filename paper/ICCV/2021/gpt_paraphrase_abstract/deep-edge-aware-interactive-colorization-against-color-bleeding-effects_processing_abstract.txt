Deep neural networks used for automatic image colorization often suffer from a problem called color-bleeding artifact. This refers to the issue of colors spreading near the boundaries between different objects in an image, which degrades the realism of the generated outputs. Existing approaches to address this problem only work well in cases where there is a high contrast of gray-scale values in the input image. Alternatively, involving user interactions has shown promise in solving color-bleeding artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a new edge-enhancing network that allows users to indicate regions of interest through simple scribbles, guiding the enhancement process. Our method requires minimal effort from users while effectively improving color-bleeding artifacts compared to existing approaches across various datasets.
