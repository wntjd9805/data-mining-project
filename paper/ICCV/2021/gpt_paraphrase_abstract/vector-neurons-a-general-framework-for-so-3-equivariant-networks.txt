This paper presents a general framework called Vector Neuron representations for creating rotation-equivariant neural networks for point-cloud processing. By extending neurons from scalar values to vectors, the framework enables a straightforward mapping of rotation actions to latent spaces, allowing for equivariance in common neural operations. The simplicity of vector neurons allows them to be easily incorporated into various network architectures, making them versatile in processing geometry inputs in arbitrary poses. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method performs comparably well with more complex and specialized methods in terms of accuracy and generalization on classification and segmentation tasks. Additionally, the paper introduces a rotation-equivariant reconstruction network, which is a novel contribution. The source code for the framework is available on GitHub.
