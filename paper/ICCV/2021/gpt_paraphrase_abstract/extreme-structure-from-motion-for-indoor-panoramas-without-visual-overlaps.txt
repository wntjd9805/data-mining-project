This paper presents a novel algorithm for Structure from Motion (SfM) specifically designed for residential indoor panoramas that lack visual overlaps. In scenarios where only one panorama exists in a room, existing SfM algorithms are unable to perform the task effectively. To address this, our approach involves learning to assess the realism of room/door/window arrangements in a top-down semantic space. By utilizing heuristics to generate potential arrangements based on door detections, we evaluate their realism scores and select the most realistic arrangement, which allows us to determine the corresponding camera poses. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted experiments using a dataset consisting of 1029 panorama images from 286 houses. Both qualitative and quantitative assessments demonstrate that the existing SfM approach fails for the majority of the houses. In contrast, our proposed approach achieves a mean positional error of less than 1.0 meter for 47% of the houses, and even 78% when considering the top five reconstructions.
