This paper addresses the challenge of image-to-image translation models that require either image-level or set-level supervision. However, obtaining set-level supervision can be difficult in practice. The paper proposes a fully unsupervised image-to-image translation model called TU-NIT, which learns to separate image domains and translate input images into the estimated domains. Experimental results demonstrate that TU-NIT achieves comparable or better performance than set-level supervised models, generalizes well on different datasets, and is robust to hyperparameter choices. Additionally, TU-NIT can be easily extended to semi-supervised learning with a small amount of labeled data.
