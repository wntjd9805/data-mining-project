ME-PCN is a point completion network that improves upon mainstream methods by considering the "emptiness" in 3D shape space. While previous methods focus on encoding the occupied shapes and ignoring empty regions, ME-PCN argues that these empty regions provide valuable information about shape boundaries. By encoding both occupied and empty points, ME-PCN is able to estimate complete and reasonable surface points in two stages: a coarse-grained estimation followed by a refinement stage for fine-grained details. Experimental results demonstrate that ME-PCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both qualitative and quantitative performance. Additionally, the "emptiness" design of ME-PCN is lightweight and can easily be incorporated into existing methods, consistently improving scores related to shape completion.
