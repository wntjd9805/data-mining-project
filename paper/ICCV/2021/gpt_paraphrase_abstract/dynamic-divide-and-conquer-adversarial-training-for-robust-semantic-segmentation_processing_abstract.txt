Adversarial training has shown promise in improving the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial perturbations, particularly in classification tasks. However, its effectiveness in semantic segmentation is relatively unexplored. In this study, we propose a general adversarial training approach called dynamic divide-and-conquer adversarial training (DDC-AT) to enhance the defense capabilities of semantic segmentation models. DDC-AT involves setting up additional branches in the target model during training and handling pixels with diverse properties towards adversarial perturbations. This dynamic division mechanism automatically divides pixels into multiple branches. Importantly, these additional branches can be discarded during inference, incurring no extra parameters or computational costs. We conducted extensive experiments using various segmentation models on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, and the results show that DDC-AT achieves satisfactory performance against both white-box and black-box attacks. The code for implementing DDC-AT is available at https://github.com/dvlab-research/Robust-Semantic-Segmentation.
