The minimum graph cut and minimum s-t-cut problems are essential in computer science, particularly in computer vision and machine learning. Karger's contraction algorithm is a successful randomized algorithm for finding global minimum cuts. In this study, we investigate the possibility of extending Karger's algorithm to solve other cut problems. We prove that many natural generalizations of Karger's algorithm are not efficient for solving the s-t-mincut or normalized cut problems optimally. However, we introduce a new algorithm for seeded segmentation and graph-based semi-supervised learning, inspired by Karger's original algorithm. This algorithm has a linear runtime and provides a potential that represents the posterior probability of a sample belonging to a specific class. We clarify its connection to the random walker algorithm and harmonic energy minimization in terms of spanning forests. In experiments on seeded image segmentation and graph-based semi-supervised learning with image data, our method performs at least as well as the random walker algorithm, harmonic energy minimization, and Gaussian processes.
