Partial Domain Adaptation (PDA) is a domain adaptation scenario where the source label space includes the target label space. The main challenge in PDA is negative transfer caused by source-only classes. This issue becomes more complex in the case of videos, where negative transfer can occur due to both spatial and temporal features, resulting in the Partial Video Domain Adaptation (PVDA) problem. In this study, we introduce a new approach called Partial Adversarial Temporal Attentive Network (PATAN) to address PVDA. PATAN utilizes both spatial and temporal features to filter out source-only classes. Additionally, it constructs effective overall temporal features by focusing on local temporal features that contribute more to the class filtration process. To facilitate research on PVDA problems, we also provide new benchmarks covering various PVDA scenarios. Our empirical results demonstrate that PATAN achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple PVDA benchmarks. The code for PATAN is available at: https://github.com/xuyu0010/PATAN.
