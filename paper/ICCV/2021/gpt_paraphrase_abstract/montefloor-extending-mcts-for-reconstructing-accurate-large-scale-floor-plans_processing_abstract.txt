A new method is proposed for reconstructing floor plans from noisy 3D point clouds. The approach uses the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to efficiently maximize an objective function, overcoming the complexity of the problem. Similar to previous methods, the input point cloud is projected to a top view and a density map is created to extract room proposals. However, this method optimizes the polygonal shapes of the room proposals jointly to fit the density map, resulting in an accurate vectorized floor map even for large complex scenes. MCTS is adapted to select the room proposals by maximizing an objective function that combines fitness with the density map predicted by a deep network, along with regularizing terms on the room shapes. Additionally, a refinement step is introduced to adjust the shape of the room proposals using a differentiable method for rendering polygonal shapes. The proposed method is evaluated on challenging datasets and demonstrates significant improvement over existing techniques, without imposing any hard constraints or assumptions on the floor plan configurations.
