This study addresses the issue of tracking object poses at the category level in online scenarios using point cloud sequences. The authors propose a unified framework that can handle pose tracking for both novel rigid object instances and articulated objects from known categories. The 9 degrees of freedom (DoF) pose, consisting of 6D pose and 3D size, is represented as a 3D amodal bounding box with free 6D pose. The proposed pipeline consists of three modules: pose canonicalization, RotationNet, and CoordinateNet. The pose canonicalization module normalizes the input depth point cloud, RotationNet regresses small interframe delta rotations, and CoordinateNet predicts normalized coordinates and segmentation for analytical computation of 3D size and translation. By leveraging the small pose regime in the pose-canonicalized point clouds, the method combines dense coordinate prediction and direct rotation regression to achieve accurate 9DoF pose tracking without the need for non-differentiable RANSAC. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on category-level rigid object pose benchmarks (NOCS-REAL275) and articulated object pose benchmarks (SAPIEN, BMVC) at a fast framerate of 12 FPS.
