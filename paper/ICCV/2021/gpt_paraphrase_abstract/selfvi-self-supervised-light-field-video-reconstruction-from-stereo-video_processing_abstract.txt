Light-field imaging is becoming increasingly popular in the mobile devices market due to its ability to easily manipulate images after they are captured. However, capturing high-resolution light-field data poses challenges, especially in devices with limited space for bulky optics. On the other hand, stereo video capture, which is now common in consumer devices, can be seen as a sparse version of light-field capture. In this study, we investigate the use of small baseline stereo videos to reconstruct high-quality light-field videos. We propose a self-supervised learning-based algorithm that utilizes geometric information from individual stereo pairs and temporal information from the video sequence to reconstruct the light-field videos. Additionally, we apply a low-rank constraint based on layered light-field displays to further improve the accuracy of the light-field estimation. Our self-supervised algorithm offers advantages such as post-training fine-tuning and flexible angular view interpolation and extrapolation. Quantitatively, the reconstructed light-field videos demonstrate higher fidelity compared to previous unsupervised approaches. We validate our results by generating light-field videos from publicly available stereo videos captured using commercial stereoscopic cameras. Finally, we show that our reconstructed light-field videos enable post-capture focus control and region-of-interest-based focus tracking for videos.
