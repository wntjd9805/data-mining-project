Despite recent advancements in 3D human reconstruction methods, accurately and smoothly recovering 3D human motion from video remains a challenging task. Simply designing a temporal model during the encoding stage is not sufficient to address the trade-off between per-frame accuracy and motion smoothness. In order to tackle this problem, we propose a solution that simultaneously predicts 3D pose and 3D motion dynamics, addressing some of the fundamental issues in 3D reconstruction tasks.Firstly, we leverage the concept of uncertainty to handle situations where multiple 3D configurations result in the same 2D projections. By incorporating uncertainty into our approach, we are better equipped to handle these cases effectively. Secondly, we have found that dividing the body into local regions yields exceptional results in estimating 3D motion dynamics. This approach allows us to better capture the nuanced movements of different body parts.In this paper, we introduce two key components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder performs two different estimations: one for static features, which represents the 2D pose feature as a distribution, and another for dynamic features, which includes optical flow information. The decoder, on the other hand, divides the body into five distinct local regions to estimate the 3D motion dynamics of each region.Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in accurately and smoothly recovering human motion. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results for both constrained and in-the-wild videos.
