Shadow removal from a single image remains a challenging task, particularly due to the lack of sufficient training data. Most existing methods rely on supervised learning, which necessitates a large collection of paired images depicting shadows and their corresponding non-shadow counterparts. Recently, an unsupervised approach called Mask-ShadowGAN has emerged to tackle this limitation. However, this method is unable to handle soft shadows as it relies on a binary mask representation for shadow regions. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised network called DC-ShadowNet, which incorporates a domain-classifier guided generator and discriminator. By integrating a shadow/shadow-free domain classifier, our network effectively focuses on shadow regions during training. To improve the performance of our network, we introduce innovative loss functions based on physics-based shadow-free chromaticity, shadow-robust perceptual features, and boundary smoothness. Additionally, we demonstrate that our unsupervised network can be utilized for test-time training, resulting in further improvements. Through extensive experiments, we verify that our method can successfully handle both soft and hard shadows, surpassing the performance of existing state-of-the-art shadow removal techniques in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
