The core meaning of the abstract is as follows: Video instance segmentation is the task of segmenting and associating all instances of predefined classes for each frame in videos. Existing methods merge incomplete results obtained from individual frames or clips, which can lead to error accumulation. In contrast, our proposed paradigm, called Propose-Reduce, generates complete sequences for input videos in a single step. We also introduce a sequence propagation head to enable long-term propagation in the existing image-level instance segmentation network. To ensure robustness and high recall, we propose multiple sequences and reduce redundant sequences of the same instance. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets, with an AP of 47.6% on the YouTube-VIS validation set and a J&F score of 70.4% on the DAVIS-UVOS validation set.Paraphrased abstract (under 4000 characters):Video instance segmentation (VIS) involves segmenting and associating all instances of predefined classes in videos. Most previous approaches first obtain segmentations for individual frames or clips and then merge them through tracking or matching, which can lead to error accumulation during merging. In contrast, our proposed approach, called Propose-Reduce, generates complete sequences for input videos in a single step, avoiding error accumulation. We enhance the existing image-level instance segmentation network by adding a sequence propagation head for long-term propagation. To ensure the robustness and high recall of our framework, we propose multiple sequences and reduce redundant sequences of the same instance. Our approach achieves superior performance compared to existing methods on two widely used benchmark datasets. Specifically, we achieve an AP of 47.6% on the YouTube-VIS validation set and a J&F score of 70.4% on the DAVIS-UVOS validation set.
