The use of attention mechanisms, particularly channel attention, has been successful in the field of computer vision. However, most research focuses on designing efficient channel attention mechanisms without considering the problem of using scalar representation for channels, which results in significant information loss. In this study, we propose a different approach by treating the channel representation problem as a compression process using frequency analysis. Through mathematical proof, we demonstrate that the conventional global average pooling can be seen as a special case of feature decomposition in the frequency domain. Building on this proof, we introduce our method called FcaNet, which utilizes multi-spectral channel attention. FcaNet is a simple and effective solution that can be easily integrated into existing channel attention methods by making minor changes to the code. Furthermore, our method outperforms other channel attention methods in various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. We achieve state-of-the-art results comparable to the baseline SENet, with the same number of parameters and computational cost. Our code and models are publicly accessible at https://github.com/cfzd/FcaNet.
