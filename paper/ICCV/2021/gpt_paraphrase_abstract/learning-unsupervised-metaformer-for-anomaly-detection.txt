This paper focuses on anomaly detection (AD) in images, specifically the classification and localization of image anomalies. The paper addresses two key challenges in reconstruction-based AD approaches: model adaptation and reconstruction gap. Model adaptation involves developing an AD model that can be applied to a wide range of object categories, while the reconstruction gap refers to identifying abnormal regions in an image.   The proposed method, called Metaformer, is an unsupervised universal model that tackles both model adaptation and reconstruction gap. Metaformer utilizes meta-learned model parameters to achieve strong model adaptation capabilities. Additionally, it employs instance-aware attention to emphasize specific regions of interest for localizing abnormal regions. This attention mechanism helps explore the reconstruction gap in those focal regions.   The effectiveness of the Metaformer model is demonstrated through state-of-the-art results on the MVTec AD dataset, which consists of industrial images. The paper also highlights the adaptability of Metaformer in handling multi-class and few-shot scenarios.
