Goal-conditioned approaches have proven to be valuable in predicting human trajectories, but determining the goal itself can be challenging and requires additional learning. In this study, we propose a method to predict pedestrian trajectories by leveraging goal expertise, which can be obtained at a low cost through a novel goal-search mechanism using existing training examples. Our study has three main contributions. Firstly, we introduce a framework that utilizes nearest examples to accurately determine goal positions. This approach considers multiple possibilities, physical constraints, compatibility with existing methods, and does not require additional learning for goal inference. Secondly, we present an end-to-end trajectory predictor that efficiently associates goal retrievals with past motion information and dynamically infers potential future trajectories. Lastly, we conduct experiments on widely-used datasets (SDD and ETH/UCY) and demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods significantly and reduces the need for additional parameters.
