Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are widely used in safety-critical applications, making the security of these networks crucial. One specific vulnerability is the Trojan attack, where an attacker manipulates the model parameters during training to activate a predefined trigger during inference. This paper introduces ProFlip, the first targeted Trojan attack framework that diverts the DNN's prediction to a specific target class by progressively identifying and flipping a small set of bits in the model parameters.  ProFlip consists of three main phases. First, it determines the significant neurons in the last layer of the DNN. Next, it generates an effective trigger pattern for the target class. Finally, it identifies a sequence of susceptible bits in the DNN parameters stored in the main memory. After deploying the model, the adversary can insert the Trojan by flipping the critical bits found by ProFlip using techniques like Row Hammer or laser beams. This manipulation causes the altered DNN to predict the target class when the trigger pattern is present in any inputs.  The researchers conducted extensive evaluations of ProFlip on CIFAR10, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets using ResNet-18 and VGG-16 architectures. The empirical results demonstrate that ProFlip achieves an attack success rate (ASR) of over 94% with only 12 bit flips out of 88 million parameter bits for ResNet-18 with CIFAR-10, and 15 bit flips for ResNet-18 with ImageNet. Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, ProFlip significantly reduces the number of required bit flips by 28× to 34× while achieving the same or higher ASR.
