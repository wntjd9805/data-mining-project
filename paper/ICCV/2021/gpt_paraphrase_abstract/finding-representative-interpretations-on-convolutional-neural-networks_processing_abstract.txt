The success of deep learning models in image analysis can be enhanced by understanding the decision-making process of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, current methods for interpreting this decision logic are limited to specific cases, such as individual or a small number of images. To improve human understanding and generalization, it is crucial to develop representative interpretations that can explain the common decision logic of a CNN across a large group of similar images. In this paper, we propose an innovative unsupervised approach to generate highly representative interpretations for a large set of similar images. We frame the problem as a co-clustering task and transform it into a submodular cost submodular cover problem using linear decision boundaries obtained from a sample of the CNN. Additionally, we introduce a visualization and similarity ranking technique. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method.
