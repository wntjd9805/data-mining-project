The domain-adaptive semantic segmentation of aerial images using deep learning is a difficult task due to the differences in image domains. Existing convolutional neural network (CNN)-based domain adaptation methods have been developed to reduce these differences but still perform poorly when applied to images from different domains. This paper presents a new CNN-based approach called self-mutating network (SMN) that can adjust the parameters of convolutional filters in response to the domain of an input image, leading to improved domain-adaptive segmentation. The SMN incorporates a parameter mutation technique to adaptively change parameters and a parameter fluctuation technique to randomly modify the parameters. By utilizing these techniques, the SMN can dynamically adjust and fine-tune parameters for images from different domains, resulting in better segmentation predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the SMN outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with an 11.19% higher Intersection over Union value, highlighting its potential for domain-adaptive segmentation of aerial images.
