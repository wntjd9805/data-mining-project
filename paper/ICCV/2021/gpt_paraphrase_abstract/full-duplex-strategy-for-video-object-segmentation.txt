This paper introduces a new framework called FSNet (Full-duplex Strategy Network) for video object segmentation (VOS). The framework utilizes a relational cross-attention module (RCAM) to enable bidirectional message propagation between appearance and motion cues. It also incorporates a bidirectional purification module (BPM) to enhance model robustness by updating inconsistent features in spatial-temporal embeddings. The FSNet employs a full-duplex strategy, allowing simultaneous cross-modal feature-passing before fusion and decoding, making it effective in challenging VOS scenarios such as motion blur and occlusion. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that FSNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in VOS and video salient object detection tasks.
