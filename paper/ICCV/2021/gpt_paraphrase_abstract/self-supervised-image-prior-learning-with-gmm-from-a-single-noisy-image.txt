This paper proposes a novel Self-Supervised learning method for Gaussian Mixture Model (SS-GMM) to address the issue of lacking clean images in supervised image prior learning methods. These methods typically require a large number of clean images for training, which is burdensome. The SS-GMM method can estimate the noise level and learn image prior directly from a single noisy image, freeing image prior learning from the burden of image collection. The proposed method is based on the study of eigenvalues of the GMM's covariance matrix. Through statistical experiments and theoretical analysis, it is found that clean images have sparse covariance eigenvalues, while noisy images provide sufficient information for noise estimation. Based on these findings, a sparsity constraint is imposed on the covariance eigenvalues during the learning process to suppress the influence of noise. Additionally, a noise estimation module is developed to accurately estimate the noise level and determine the specific level of the sparsity constraint. The proposed method only requires minor modifications to the standard expectation-maximization algorithm, making it easy to implement. Interestingly, the GMM learned using the SS-GMM method outperforms the supervised image prior learning method (EPLL) in image denoising performance and is comparable to the state-of-the-art self-supervised deep learning method (Self2Self).
