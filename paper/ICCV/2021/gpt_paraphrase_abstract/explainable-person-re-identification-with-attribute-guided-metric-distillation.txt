Current person re-identification (ReID) models, despite their success in utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks, lack transparency as they only provide a scalar distance between two individuals without explaining the reasoning behind their identification. This paper introduces a post-hoc method called Attribute-guided Metric Distillation (AMD) to address this issue. AMD is the first approach to utilize attributes to answer questions such as what attributes differentiate two individuals and how much each attribute contributes to the dissimilarity. The proposed method incorporates an interpreter network into existing models to generate quantitative attribute contributions and visualize attention maps highlighting the most distinguishing attributes. To achieve this, a metric distillation loss is employed to train the interpreter network to decompose the distance between two individuals into attribute components, leveraging knowledge distilled from the target model. Additionally, an attribute prior loss is introduced to guide the interpreter in generating attribute-guided attention maps and alleviate biases caused by imbalanced attribute distributions. The experiments conducted demonstrate that the interpreter can effectively and intuitively explain various models and generalize well across different domains. Furthermore, the interpreter also contributes to improving the accuracy of the target models.
