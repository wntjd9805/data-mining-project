Recently, there have been significant advancements in single image super-resolution (SR) using powerful networks. However, these networks are designed for specific integer scale factors and are unable to handle non-integer and asymmetric SR. This study proposes a method to learn a scale-arbitrary image SR network from scale-specific networks. To achieve this, a plug-in module is developed for existing SR networks, which includes multiple scale-aware feature adaption blocks and a scale-aware upsampling layer. Additionally, conditional convolution is utilized in the plug-in module to generate dynamic scale-aware filters, enabling the network to adapt to arbitrary scale factors. By incorporating this plug-in module into existing networks, scale-arbitrary SR can be achieved using a single model. The networks equipped with this module can generate promising results for non-integer and asymmetric SR, while maintaining state-of-the-art performance for SR with integer scale factors. Furthermore, the computational and memory cost of the module is minimal.
