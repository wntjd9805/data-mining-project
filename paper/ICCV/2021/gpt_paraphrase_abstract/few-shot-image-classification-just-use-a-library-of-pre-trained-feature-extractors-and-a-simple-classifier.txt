Recent studies have proposed that transfer learning may surpass complex meta-learning techniques in few-shot image classification. Expanding on this idea, we propose leveraging a collection of top-notch, pre-trained feature extractors for effective few-shot image classification. Through experiments, we demonstrate that combining a library of pre-trained feature extractors with a straightforward feed-forward network, trained using an L2-regularizer, can serve as an exceptional solution for addressing cross-domain few-shot image classification challenges. Our experimental findings indicate that this uncomplicated approach significantly outperforms various established meta-learning algorithms.
