Compressive imaging using coded apertures (CA) is a powerful technique for recovering various quantities from a single snapshot. The performance of CA-based compressive imaging systems relies on the properties of the mask's attenuation pattern, known as "codification," and the computational techniques used for recovery. This study introduces the concept of using time-varying CAs synchronized with spatially varying pixel shutters. By dividing the sensor's exposure into sub-exposures, the CA mask changes simultaneously with the individual switching on or off of the sensor's pixels. This approach is practical as it requires no additional optical components and can be easily implemented electronically by changing the pixel shutter. The proposed time-multiplexed coded aperture (TMCA) is optimized end-to-end and produces better coded snapshots, leading to superior reconstructions in compressive light field imaging and hyperspectral imaging. Simulation and real captures taken with prototypes demonstrate that this codification significantly outperforms current compressive imaging systems in these applications.
