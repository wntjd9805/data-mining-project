The paper introduces a framework called MOSAICOS, which aims to improve object detection in complex scenes by leveraging object-centric images. These images contain objects that are not frequently found in scene-centric images, making it difficult to train accurate object detectors. MOSAICOS addresses this challenge by constructing pseudo scene-centric images from object-centric images, using the object-centric images' class labels to generate high-quality bounding box predictions, and employing a multi-stage training procedure. Experimental results on LVIS object detection demonstrate that MOSAICOS achieves a significant 60% relative improvement in average precision for rare object categories. The framework can also be used in combination with other existing approaches to achieve further gains. The pre-trained models are publicly available for use.
