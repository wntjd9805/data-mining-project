The calibration of label probabilities in semantic segmentation is often overlooked, as they are typically derived as a by-product of the segmentation task. While metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice score are commonly used to assess segmentation success, metrics related to label probabilities are not explored extensively. Although probability calibration methods exist for classification tasks, there is a lack of research in semantic segmentation. To address this gap, we propose a learning-based calibration method specifically designed for multi-label semantic segmentation. Our approach utilizes a convolutional neural network to predict local temperature values for probability calibration. One key advantage of our method is that it does not impact prediction accuracy, allowing calibration to be performed as a post-processing step. We conducted experiments on various datasets, including COCO, CamVid, and LPBA40, which demonstrated improved calibration performance across different metrics. Furthermore, we evaluated the effectiveness of our method in multi-atlas brain segmentation using magnetic resonance images and observed favorable results.
