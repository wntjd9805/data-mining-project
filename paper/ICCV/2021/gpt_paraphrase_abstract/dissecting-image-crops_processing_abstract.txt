This study examines the subtle effects of cropping, a fundamental operation in computer vision systems. It explores the traces left behind by cropping, such as chromatic aberration and vignetting caused by camera lenses, as well as clues relating to image aesthetics and scene composition left by photographers. The goal is to detect these traces and understand the impact of cropping on the distribution of images. In addition to dissecting the fundamental impact of spatial crops, the study also has practical implications, such as identifying faulty photojournalism and enhancing the understanding of shortcut learning for neural network researchers.
