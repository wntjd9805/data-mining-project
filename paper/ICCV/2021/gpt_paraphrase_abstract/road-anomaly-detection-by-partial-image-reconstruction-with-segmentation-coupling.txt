We have developed a new method for detecting unknown objects in autonomous driving scenarios. Instead of trying to learn the appearance of these objects, we approach the problem as anomaly detection. Our approach involves using a reconstruction module with existing semantic segmentation networks. This module is trained to recognize and reconstruct the drivable surface of the road. If the reconstruction is poor, it indicates that the area is outside of the training distribution and likely an anomaly. We combine the road structural similarity error with semantic segmentation to incorporate information from known classes and generate per-pixel anomaly scores. We evaluated our approach on four datasets and achieved state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing false positives and maintaining high average precision across a wide range of operation points.
