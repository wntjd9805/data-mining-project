Shape analysis has been crucial in diagnosing and predicting neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, finding effective ways to represent shapes accurately is still challenging. This study suggests using Alexandrov polyhedra as surface-based shape signatures for analyzing cortical morphology. Alexandrov polyhedra encode intrinsic geometry information and can be computed using a novel spherical optimal transport (OT) method. The experiments indicate that there are significant differences in the Alexandrov polyhedra of cortical surfaces between individuals with confirmed AD and those without cognitive impairment. Additionally, a visualization method is proposed to compare local geometry differences across cortical surfaces, effectively identifying regional cortical structural changes caused by AD.
