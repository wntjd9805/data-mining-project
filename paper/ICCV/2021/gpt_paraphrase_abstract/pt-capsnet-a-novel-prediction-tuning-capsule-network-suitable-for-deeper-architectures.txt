Capsule Networks (CapsNets) have not been widely used due to their computational expense. Existing variations of CapsNets have not surpassed CNN-based models on complex tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Prediction-Tuning Capsule Network (PT-CapsNet) that allows capsules to be used for more difficult vision tasks and provides better performance than or comparable to CNN-based models. We introduce fully connected PT-Capsules (FC-PT-Caps) and locally connected PT-Capsules (LC-PT-Caps). Our experiments demonstrate the robustness, lightweight nature, and scalability of PT-CapsNet. We achieve consistent performance improvement and significant parameter reduction compared to various baseline models in tasks such as classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. The code for PT-CapsNet is available at https://github.com/Christinepan881/PT-CapsNet.git.
