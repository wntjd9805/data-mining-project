We propose a method for reconstructing surfaces from aligned depth maps, which can be generated from regular photos or terrestrial LIDAR point clouds. Our approach utilizes total generalized variation minimization (TGV) due to its effective noise filtering and compatibility with GPUs. The key contribution of our work is the development of an out-of-core OpenCL-accelerated version of this numerical algorithm, capable of handling large-scale real-world scenes with varying scales.
