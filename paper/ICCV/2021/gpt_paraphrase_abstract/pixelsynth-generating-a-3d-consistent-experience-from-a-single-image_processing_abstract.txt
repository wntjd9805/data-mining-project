Recent advancements in differentiable rendering and 3D reasoning have led to promising outcomes in generating new views from a single image. However, existing methods are limited in their ability to generate immersive scenes with significant view changes. To address this, we propose an approach that combines 3D reasoning and autoregressive modeling to effectively generate large view changes in a manner that is consistent with the underlying 3D structure. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in synthesizing single-image large-angle views compared to various existing methods, both on simulated and real datasets. Moreover, we achieve increased 3D consistency compared to other accumulation methods.
