Correspondence pruning is a challenging task that involves removing false matches from an initial set of potential correspondences. This task is difficult because the initial matches are often unbalanced, with a majority of outliers, and the random distribution of these outliers makes it challenging for learning-based methods to effectively learn the pruning process. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel approach called progressive pruning.

Progressive pruning involves iteratively removing unreliable correspondences using a local-to-global consensus learning procedure. We introduce a "pruning" block that allows us to identify reliable candidates among the initial matches based on consensus scores estimated using local-to-global dynamic graphs. By stacking multiple pruning blocks sequentially, we achieve progressive pruning.

Our method outperforms existing approaches on various benchmarks, including robust line fitting, camera pose estimation, and retrieval-based image localization. We achieve significant improvements and demonstrate promising generalization ability across different datasets and detector/descriptor combinations.
