We present IntraTomo, a robust framework that combines learning-based and model-based approaches to effectively solve challenging inverse problems in Computed Tomography (CT). IntraTomo consists of two main modules: a unique sinogram prediction module and a geometry refinement module, which are used iteratively. In the sinogram prediction module, we represent the unknown density field as a continuous and differentiable function, parameterized by a deep neural network. This network is trained in a self-supervised manner using incomplete or degraded input sinograms. Once estimated, the density field is further refined in the geometry refinement module using both local and non-local geometrical priors. Our experiments demonstrate that IntraTomo outperforms existing methods on various ill-posed inverse problems, such as limited angle tomography (with a 45-degree range), sparse view tomographic reconstruction (with as few as eight views), and super-resolution tomography (with eight times increased resolution). We validate the effectiveness of our approach using simulated and real data, achieving unprecedented quality results.
