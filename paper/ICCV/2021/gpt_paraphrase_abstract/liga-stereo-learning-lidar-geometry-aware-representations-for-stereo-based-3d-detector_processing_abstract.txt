Stereo-based 3D detection is a cost-effective method for detecting 3D objects using stereo images. However, its performance is not as good as LiDAR-based detection algorithms. LiDAR-based detectors use high-level representations from LiDAR point clouds to accurately detect and localize 3D bounding boxes. In contrast, stereo-based detectors rely on depth estimation, which can be inaccurate and affect the learned high-level features. To address this problem, we propose LIGA-Stereo, a stereo-based 3D detector that learns under the guidance of high-level geometry-aware representations from LiDAR-based models. Additionally, we found that existing voxel-based stereo detectors struggle to effectively learn semantic features from indirect 3D supervisions. To overcome this, we include an auxiliary 2D detection head to provide direct 2D semantic supervisions. Our experiments demonstrate that these two strategies improve the geometric and semantic representation capabilities. Compared to the state-of-the-art stereo detector, our method achieves a significant improvement in 3D detection performance for cars, pedestrians, and cyclists on the KITTI benchmark. This narrows the gap between stereo-based and LiDAR-based 3D detectors. The code for our method is available at https://xy-guo.github.io/liga/.
