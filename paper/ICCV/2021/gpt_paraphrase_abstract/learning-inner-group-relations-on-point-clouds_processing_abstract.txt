This study investigates the prevalence of relation networks in computer vision compared to underexplored point-based methods. The authors explore the potential of local relation operators and examine their feasibility. They introduce a scalable and efficient module called the group relation aggregator, which calculates a group's feature by aggregating the features of the inner-group points using geometric and semantic relations. This module is incorporated into their RPNet design. The expandability of RPNet is verified in terms of depth and width for classification and segmentation tasks. Surprisingly, wider RPNet performs better for classification, while deeper RPNet is more effective for segmentation. RPNet achieves state-of-the-art results in both classification and segmentation on challenging benchmarks. The authors also compare their local aggregator with PointNet++, demonstrating significant parameter and computation savings. Furthermore, they conduct experiments to evaluate the robustness of RPNet to rigid transformations and noise.
