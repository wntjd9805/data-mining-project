This paper proposes a novel approach for the pose-guided virtual try-on task, which involves modifying fashion items based on pose transfer. The existing methods treat this task as two separate tasks and do not explore the correlations between them. In addition, these tasks are challenging due to misalignment and occlusions, resulting in unclear body structures and blurry textures. To address these issues, the authors propose a structure-transformed texture-enhanced network composed of two modules: the structure-transformed renderer and the texture-enhanced stylizer. The structure-transformed renderer transforms the source person's structure to match the target pose, while the texture-enhanced stylizer enhances detailed textures and injects fashion styles based on the structural transformation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results in generating high-quality person images with diverse poses and fashion styles.
