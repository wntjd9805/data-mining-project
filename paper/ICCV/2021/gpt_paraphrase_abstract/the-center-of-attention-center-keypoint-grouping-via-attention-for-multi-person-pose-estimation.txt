We present CenterGroup, a novel framework for estimating human poses from a collection of identity-independent keypoints and predictions of person centers in an image. Our approach utilizes a transformer to generate embeddings that consider the surrounding context for all detected keypoints and centers. We then employ multi-head attention to directly group joints according to their corresponding person centers. Unlike traditional bottom-up methods that rely on non-learnable clustering during inference, CenterGroup incorporates a fully differentiable attention mechanism that we train end-to-end along with our keypoint detector. Consequently, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and offers up to 2.5 times faster inference time compared to competing bottom-up approaches.
