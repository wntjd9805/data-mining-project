Current domain adaptation methods typically focus on adapting from a single source domain, but in practical scenarios, there are multiple relevant sources that could be utilized to enhance performance on the target domain. This paper introduces a new approach called T-SVDNet, which tackles the challenge of Multi-source Domain Adaptation (MDA) by incorporating Tensor Singular Value Decomposition (T-SVD) into the training pipeline of a neural network. The proposed method effectively explores high-order correlations among multiple domains and categories to bridge the gap between domains. Specifically, a Tensor-Low-Rank (TLR) constraint is imposed on a tensor formed by combining a group of prototypical similarity matrices, aiming to capture consistent data structures across domains. Moreover, to prevent negative transfer resulting from noisy source data, an innovative uncertainty-aware weighting strategy is introduced to assign adaptive weights to different source domains and samples based on uncertainty estimation. Extensive experiments conducted on public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model compared to state-of-the-art methods for MDA.
