We examine the analysis of deep point clouds where the networks' inputs are randomly rotated. The advancement in rotation-invariant point cloud analysis has primarily involved converting point clouds to their canonical poses using principal component analysis (PCA). However, current efforts have focused on improving network structures and features without thoroughly investigating the PCA-based canonical poses themselves. In this study, we extensively explore the PCA-based canonical poses of point clouds and discover that recent works inadequately address the ambiguity problem associated with these poses. To address this issue, we propose a simple pose selector module for disambiguation, which significantly improves classification accuracy (by 5.3%) compared to state-of-the-art approaches on a challenging real-world dataset.
