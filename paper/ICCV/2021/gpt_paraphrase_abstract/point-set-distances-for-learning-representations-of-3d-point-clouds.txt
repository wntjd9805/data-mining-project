Learning an effective representation of 3D point clouds requires a reliable metric to measure the differences between two sets of points. However, existing metrics like Chamfer discrepancy and Earth Mover's distance are either ineffective or computationally expensive. In this study, we extensively experiment with distance metrics for 3D point clouds and propose the use of sliced Wasserstein distance and its variations for learning representations. We also introduce a new algorithm to estimate sliced Wasserstein distance accurately. Our experiments show that sliced Wasserstein distance and its variants enable neural networks to learn more efficient representations compared to Chamfer discrepancy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these metrics in various tasks in 3D computer vision, such as point cloud autoencoder training, generative modeling, transfer learning, and point cloud registration.
