We introduce RePOSE, a rapid iterative refinement technique for estimating the pose of 6D objects. Existing methods use a CNN to refine the pose by feeding zoomed-in input and rendered RGB images, leading to slow runtime, particularly in cases of multiple-object pose refinement. To address this issue, RePOSE utilizes deep texture rendering, which employs a 3D model with a learnable texture for fast feature extraction. A shallow multi-layer perceptron is used to regress a view-invariant image representation of an object. Additionally, RePOSE employs differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) optimization to accurately and quickly refine the pose by minimizing the distance between the input and rendered image representations without zooming in. The image representations are trained to ensure that differentiable LM optimization converges within a few iterations. As a result, RePOSE achieves a runtime of 92 FPS and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 51.6% on the Occlusion LineMOD dataset, surpassing previous methods by a 4.1% improvement. It also achieves comparable results on the YCB-Video dataset with a much faster runtime. The code is available at https://github.com/sh8/repose.
