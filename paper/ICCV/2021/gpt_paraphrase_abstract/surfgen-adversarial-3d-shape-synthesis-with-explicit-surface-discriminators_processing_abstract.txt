Advancements in deep generative models have significantly improved 3D shape synthesis. However, current models only indirectly ensure the plausibility of the final 3D shape surface when synthesizing shapes represented as voxels, point-clouds, or implicit functions. In this study, we introduce SurfGen, a framework for 3D shape synthesis that directly applies adversarial training to the object surface. Our approach involves using a differentiable spherical projection layer to capture and represent the explicit zero isosurface of an implicit 3D generator as functions defined on the unit sphere. By subjecting the spherical representation of 3D object surfaces to a spherical CNN in an adversarial setting, our generator can effectively learn the statistical properties of natural shape surfaces. We assess the performance of our model on large-scale shape datasets and demonstrate that the end-to-end trained model is capable of generating high-quality 3D shapes with diverse topology.
