We present a novel approach to reconstruct high dynamic range (HDR) images from single low dynamic range (LDR) inputs. Existing methods struggle to accurately capture textures and colors, particularly for high-density pixels in ultra-high-definition (UHD) images. To address this, we propose a new HDR reconstruction network that collaboratively learns color and texture details. Our method involves a dual-path network that extracts content and chromatic features at a reduced resolution of the LDR input. These features are then used to fit bilateral-space affine models, enabling real-time HDR reconstruction. To extract the main data structure of the LDR input and prevent noise amplification and pseudo edges, we employ 3D Tucker decomposition and reconstruction on the learned bilateral grid. This enables the reconstruction of high-quality content and chromatic features using guided bilateral upsampling. Finally, we fuse the two full-resolution feature maps to obtain the HDR reconstructed results. Our approach achieves real-time processing for UHD images, operating at approximately 160 frames per second. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art HDR reconstruction methods on public benchmarks and real-world UHD images.
