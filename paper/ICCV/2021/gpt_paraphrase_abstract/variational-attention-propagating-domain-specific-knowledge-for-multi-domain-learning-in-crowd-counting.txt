Due to the difficulty of labeling and collecting a large-scale dataset with diverse images for crowd counting, this paper proposes a solution called Domain-specific Knowledge Propagating Network (DKPNet) that utilizes multi-domain joint learning. DKPNet is a simple yet effective model that learns from multiple diverse data domains simultaneously. This is achieved by introducing the Variational Attention (VA) technique, which explicitly models attention distributions for different domains. Additionally, the Intrinsic Variational Attention (InVA) is proposed to handle overlapping domains and sub-domains. Extensive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the superiority of DKPNet compared to popular datasets such as ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU.
