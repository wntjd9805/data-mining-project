This study presents a three-stage framework to address the challenges faced in generalized and incremental few-shot learning. These challenges include learning new classes with limited samples, preventing forgetting of previously learned classes, and calibrating classifiers for both new and previously learned classes.   The first stage focuses on learning base classes using a large number of samples. In the second stage, a calibrated classifier is developed for new classes using only a few samples, while also preventing forgetting of the base classes. Finally, calibration is achieved across all classes in the third stage.   The proposed framework is evaluated on four benchmark datasets for image and video few-shot classification. The results obtained demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance in both generalized and incremental few-shot learning.
