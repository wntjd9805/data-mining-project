We present three new solvers for estimating the relative pose of a multi-camera system using affine correspondences (ACs). We derive a new constraint that relates ACs to the generalized camera model and use it to develop efficient solvers for two types of assumed motions. For cameras undergoing planar motion, we propose a minimal solution using a single AC and a solver with two ACs to handle the degenerate case. Additionally, we propose a minimal solution using two ACs with a known vertical direction from an IMU. These methods require fewer correspondences compared to existing algorithms, making them suitable for outlier removal and initial motion estimation within RANSAC. We evaluate the solvers on synthetic data and real-world scenes from the KITTI odometry benchmark, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
