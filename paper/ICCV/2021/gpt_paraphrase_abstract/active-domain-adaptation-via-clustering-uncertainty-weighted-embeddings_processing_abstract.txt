Generalizing deep neural networks to new target domains is crucial for their practical usefulness. While it may be possible to obtain some labeled data for the target domain, it is more cost-effective to select a subset of this data that is maximally informative using active learning (AL). This study focuses on the problem of AL in the presence of a domain shift, which is referred to as Active Domain Adaptation (Active DA).

The effectiveness of existing AL methods that rely solely on model uncertainty or diversity sampling is found to be limited for Active DA. To address this issue, a novel label acquisition strategy called Clustering Uncertainty-weighted Embeddings (CLUE) is proposed. CLUE leverages uncertainty-weighted clustering to identify target instances that are both uncertain according to the model and diverse in terms of their features for labeling.

Experimental results demonstrate that CLUE consistently outperforms other label acquisition strategies for both Active DA and AL across various learning scenarios in the context of image classification. The study tests CLUE on six diverse domain shifts and provides evidence of its superior performance.
