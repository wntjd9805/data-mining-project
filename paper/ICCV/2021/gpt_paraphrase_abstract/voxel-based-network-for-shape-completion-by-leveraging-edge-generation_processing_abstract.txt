Existing methods for point cloud completion using deep learning techniques have shown significant improvements in completing missing object shapes. However, these methods often fail to produce realistic structures due to over-smoothing of fine-grained details. In this study, we propose a novel approach called VE-PCN (Voxel-based network for Point Cloud Completion) that addresses this issue. Our method involves embedding point clouds into regular voxel grids and generating complete objects by incorporating hallucinated shape edges. This decoupled architecture, combined with multi-scale grid feature learning, allows for the generation of more realistic on-surface details. We evaluate our model using publicly available completion datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively.
