The goal of Few-Shot Learning (FSL) is to classify samples into new unseen classes using only a few labeled samples. However, current methods primarily rely on image-level representation and neglect valuable local clues that can be transferred across tasks. In order to address this limitation, we propose an end-to-end Task-aware Part Mining Network (TPMN) that incorporates an automatic part mining process into the metric-based model for FSL.Our TPMN model offers several advantages. Firstly, we introduce a meta filter learner that generates task-aware part filters based on task embedding in a meta-learning manner. These task-aware part filters can adapt to any specific task and automatically extract task-related local parts, even for unseen tasks. Secondly, we propose an adaptive importance generator that identifies key local parts and assigns adaptive importance weights to different parts.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that automatically utilizes task-aware local parts in a meta-learning approach for FSL. We conduct extensive experiments on four standard benchmarks and the results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art FSL methods.In summary, our research introduces a novel approach for FSL, incorporating task-aware part mining into the metric-based model. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed model, showcasing its superiority over existing FSL methods.
