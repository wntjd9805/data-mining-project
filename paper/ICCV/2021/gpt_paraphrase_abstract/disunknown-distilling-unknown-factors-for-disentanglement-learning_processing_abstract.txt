To achieve controllable generation tasks, it is important to separate data into interpretable and independent factors. However, labeling every single factor for fully-supervised disentanglement is often expensive or impractical. This paper presents a flexible weakly-supervised multi-factor disentanglement framework called DisUnknown. In this framework, all factors that are difficult to label or identify are treated as a single unknown factor. The framework enables multi-conditional generation by distilling the unknown factors along with the labeled factors. The proposed approach involves a two-stage training process. First, the unknown factor is disentangled using an effective and robust training method. Then, the final generator is trained with the proper disentanglement of all labeled factors using the unknown distillation. The method is evaluated on various benchmark datasets and real-world applications, showcasing its generalization capacity and scalability.
