This study introduces a new system for integrated 3D object detection and tracking. Unlike existing methods that search for objects in each frame independently, this system utilizes a spatial-temporal memory constructed from previous detection results and object states. By incorporating the memory and ego-motion information, the detector can generate more efficient object proposals and improve object state estimation. The effectiveness of the proposed system is demonstrated through experiments on the ScanNet and KITTI datasets, showing stable bounding boxes and pose trajectories over time. The system is also capable of handling occluded and truncated objects. The code for this system is available at https://zju3dv.github.io/UDOLO.
