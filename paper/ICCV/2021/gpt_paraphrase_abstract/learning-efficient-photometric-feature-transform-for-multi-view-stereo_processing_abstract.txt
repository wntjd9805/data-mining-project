We propose a new approach for improving 3D reconstruction by converting per-pixel photometric information into spatially distinctive and view-invariant low-level features. This framework can be integrated into existing multi-view stereo pipelines. The optimization process simultaneously considers the illumination conditions during data acquisition and the transformation of per-pixel features, allowing for efficient adaptation to different types of input data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by generating high-quality 3D reconstructions of challenging objects using data captured with both an illumination multiplexing device and a point light. Our results surpass those of state-of-the-art techniques.
