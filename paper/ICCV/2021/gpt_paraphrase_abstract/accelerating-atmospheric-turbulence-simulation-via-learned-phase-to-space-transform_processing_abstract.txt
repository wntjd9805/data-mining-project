Developing turbulence mitigation algorithms requires fast and accurate simulation of imaging through atmospheric turbulence. Previous approaches have limitations, so we propose a new concept called the phase-to-space (P2S) transform to enhance simulation speed. P2S is based on three ideas: (1) reformulating the convolution with spatial variation as a series of invariant convolutions using basis functions, (2) learning the basis function through known turbulence statistics models, and (3) implementing the P2S transform using a lightweight network that directly converts phase representation to spatial representation. Our new simulator offers a significant speed boost of 300× – 1000× compared to mainstream split-step simulators, while still preserving the crucial turbulence statistics.
