DiscoBox is a new framework that simultaneously learns instance segmentation and semantic correspondence using bounding box supervision. The framework utilizes a self-ensembling approach, where a structured teacher model is introduced to guide both tasks. This teacher model incorporates a pairwise potential and a cross-image potential to capture pixel relationships within and across bounding boxes. By minimizing the teacher energy, the framework obtains refined object masks and dense correspondences between objects of the same class, which are then used as pseudo-labels to supervise the task network and provide positive/negative correspondence pairs for dense contrastive learning. The framework demonstrates a mutually beneficial relationship between instance segmentation and semantic correspondence tasks. The best model achieved 37.9% average precision on COCO instance segmentation, outperforming previous weakly supervised methods and competing with supervised methods. Additionally, DiscoBox achieved state-of-the-art weakly supervised results on PASCAL VOC12 and PF-PASCAL datasets with real-time inference.
