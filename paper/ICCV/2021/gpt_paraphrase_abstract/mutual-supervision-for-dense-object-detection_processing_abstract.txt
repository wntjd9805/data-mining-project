This paper introduces a new approach called Mutual Supervision (MuSu) for training dense object detectors. Unlike conventional methods, MuSu does not use the same training samples for the classiÔ¨Åcation and regression heads. Instead, it assigns training samples for each head based on the predictions of the other head. The regression head uses classification scores to define training samples, while the classification head uses localization scores from the regression head. Experimental results demonstrate that detectors trained using MuSu achieve guaranteed convergence and perform effectively on the challenging MS COCO benchmark. Additionally, the paper suggests that tiling more anchors at the same location improves detectors under this training scheme. The authors hope that their work will inspire further research on the interaction between classification and regression tasks in object detection, as well as the supervision paradigm for detectors, particularly when considering these two heads separately.
