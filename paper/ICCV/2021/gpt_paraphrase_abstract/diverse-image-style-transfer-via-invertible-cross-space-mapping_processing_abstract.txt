Image style transfer aims to create artistic images by transferring the styles of art-works onto arbitrary photographs. However, existing approaches fail to capture the full range of possible outputs because they assume a deterministic solution. In order to address this limitation, we propose a framework called Diverse Image Style Transfer (DIST) that achieves significant diversity by enforcing an invertible cross-space mapping. The DIST framework consists of three branches: disentanglement branch, inverse branch, and stylization branch. The disentanglement branch separates artworks into content space and style space, while the inverse branch encourages an invertible mapping between the latent space of input noise vectors and the style space of generated artistic images. The stylization branch renders the input content image with the style of an artist. By utilizing these three branches, our approach is capable of synthesizing diverse stylized images without compromising quality. We have conducted extensive experiments and comparisons to evaluate our approach both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
