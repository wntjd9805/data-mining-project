The field of face recognition has made significant advancements with the rise of deep learning. Effective loss functions are crucial for face recognition. This paper observes that many existing loss functions, such as triplet loss and softmax-based cross-entropy loss, optimize to reduce the difference between inter-class (negative) similarity and intra-class (positive) similarity during training. However, current verification metrics directly use the absolute similarity between features to determine belonging to the same identity, creating a disparity between training and verification. To address this gap, a new metric called Discrepancy Alignment Metric (DAM) is proposed. DAM introduces Local Inter-class Discrepancy (LID) to normalize the absolute similarity score for each face image during verification. Two methods for estimating LID, reference-based and learning-based estimation, are proposed for the verification process. DAM is a plug-and-play metric that can be easily integrated into existing methods. Extensive experiments on popular face recognition benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
