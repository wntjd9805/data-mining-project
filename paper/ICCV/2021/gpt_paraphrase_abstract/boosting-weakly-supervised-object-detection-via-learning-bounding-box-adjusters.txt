This study focuses on weakly-supervised object detection (WSOD), which aims to reduce the need for expensive instance-level object annotations. However, existing WSOD methods have limitations in accurately localizing objects due to the reliance on precomputed proposals for bounding box determination. To address this issue, the authors propose leveraging bounding box regression knowledge from a well-annotated auxiliary dataset to improve localization performance. They introduce learnable bounding box adjusters (LBBAs) in a multi-stage training approach, which is class-agnostic. Only LBBAs and a weakly-annotated dataset with non-overlapping classes are used to train the LBBA-boosted WSOD, making the method more convenient and cost-effective while avoiding the leakage of the auxiliary dataset. The authors formulate learning bounding box adjusters as a bi-level optimization problem and propose an EM-like multi-stage training algorithm. They also present a multi-stage scheme for LBBA-boosted WSOD and adopt a masking strategy to enhance proposal classification. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, outperforming state-of-the-art WSOD methods and knowledge transfer models with similar problem settings. The code for the method is publicly available at https://github.com/DongSky/lbba_boosted_wsod.
