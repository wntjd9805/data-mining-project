We address the task of object category discovery in a large unlabeled dataset. While previous methods have achieved success on datasets with fewer objects per image and less clutter, we present our findings on the more challenging COCO dataset. Instead of starting from scratch, we suggest that discovery algorithms can benefit from identifying known categories and focusing on uncovering the unknown. To achieve this, we propose a method that utilizes prior knowledge and employs two memory modules, namely Working and Semantic memory. We evaluate the performance of our detector on the COCO mini-val dataset to showcase its ability to handle real-world scenarios.
