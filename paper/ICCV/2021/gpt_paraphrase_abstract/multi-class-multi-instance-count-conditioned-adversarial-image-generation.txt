In recent years, there has been significant progress in the generation of images using adversarial training. Advanced architectures now allow for the creation of high-resolution images with exceptional quality. However, there is a growing focus on controlling the content of these generated images. This paper presents a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) that can generate images with a specified number of objects from given classes. This requires two key abilities: the generation of high-quality images based on complex constraints, and the ability to count the instances of objects per class in a given image.  To achieve this, we propose an extension to the successful StyleGAN2 architecture. Our model incorporates count-based conditioning and a regression sub-network to accurately count the number of generated objects per class during training. We evaluate our approach on three different datasets and demonstrate that our proposed model successfully generates images based on the specified multi-class count condition, even in the presence of complex backgrounds. To further evaluate our model, we introduce a new dataset called CityCount, derived from the Cityscapes street scenes dataset, which provides a challenging and practical scenario for testing.  The implementation of our model is publicly available at https://github.com/boschresearch/MCCGAN.
