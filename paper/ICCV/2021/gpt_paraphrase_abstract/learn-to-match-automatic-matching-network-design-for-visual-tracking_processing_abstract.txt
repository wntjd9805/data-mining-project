In recent years, Siamese tracking has made significant advancements in performance, primarily due to the efficient matching operator cross-correlation and its variations. However, it is important to acknowledge that the design of the matching network heavily relies on expert experience and lacks robustness in challenging environments. To address this limitation, we propose six novel matching operators that focus on feature fusion rather than explicit similarity learning: Concatenation, Pointwise-Addition, Pairwise-Relation, FiLM, Simple-Transformer, and Transductive-Guidance. Through our analyses, we discover that these operators have selective adaptability to different types of environmental degradation, prompting us to combine them to leverage complementary features. To achieve this, we introduce binary channel manipulation (BCM), which determines the optimal combination of operators by learning their contributions to tracking steps. By integrating the learned matching networks into the baseline tracker Ocean, our model, named AutoMatch, achieves significant improvements in success rates on OTB100, LaSOT, and TrackingNet datasets. Notably, AutoMatch utilizes less training data and time than the baseline tracker and operates at a faster speed of 50 FPS using PyTorch. The code and model for AutoMatch can be accessed at https://github.com/JudasDie/SOTS.
