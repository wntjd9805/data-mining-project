Surface registration performance relies heavily on the metric used to measure the alignment error between two shapes. Traditionally, this metric is based on the distance between points on the source surface and their closest points on the target surface, but this approach can be unreliable due to instability in the closest-point correspondence. In this study, we introduce a new metric that is based on the intersection points between the two shapes and a random straight line, eliminating the need for a specific correspondence. Through extensive experiments, including direct optimization for a single registration problem and unsupervised learning for multiple registration problems, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed metric. The results show that algorithms utilizing our metric outperform current optimization-based and unsupervised learning-based methods.
