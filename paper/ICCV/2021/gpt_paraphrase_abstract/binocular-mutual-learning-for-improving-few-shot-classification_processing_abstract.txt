Most existing few-shot learning methods either focus on utilizing all classes in a global view or train meta-tasks within few classes in a local view. However, the interaction between these two views is rarely explored. This study proposes a unified framework called Binocular Mutual Learning (BML) that combines the global and local views through intra-view and cross-view modeling. The global view captures inter-class relationships, while the local view focuses on matching positive pairs. Cross-view mutual interaction promotes collaborative learning and the exploration of useful knowledge. During meta-test, binocular embeddings are aggregated to improve classification accuracy. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks, including cross-domain validation, validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
