In recent years, image enhancement techniques such as encoder-decoder and intensity transformation have shown promising results. However, these methods have certain drawbacks. The encoder-decoder method often loses important details in images during the down-sampling and up-sampling processes. Additionally, the intensity transformation approach has limited ability to handle color transformation between low-quality and high-quality images. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a new approach called representative color transform (RCT). The RCT method addresses the shortcomings of existing techniques by identifying different representative colors specific to each input image. It then estimates transformed colors for these representative colors and uses them to enhance the overall color scheme based on the similarity between the input and representative colors. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed RCT algorithm. The results demonstrate that this approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art algorithms in various image enhancement tasks.
