This paper explores the concept of visual engagement in social media platforms, specifically focusing on interactions with photo posts such as comments, shares, and likes. The authors propose a novel approach called VisE, which utilizes visual engagement clues as supervisory signals for representation learning. However, the challenge lies in understanding how to connect low-level visual information with high-level social interactions.To address this challenge, the authors propose a weakly supervised learning approach, where social images are mapped to pseudo labels generated from clustered engagement signals. The effectiveness of VisE is then evaluated by examining its impact on subjective downstream computer vision tasks, such as emotion recognition and political bias detection. The authors conduct extensive studies and provide empirical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of VisE across a diverse range of classification tasks that go beyond conventional recognition.
