We present a new approach to image clustering that combines joint representation learning and clustering. Our method involves two heads, a "representation learning" head and a "clustering" head, both sharing the same backbone network. The representation learning head captures detailed patterns of objects at the individual level, providing clues for the clustering head to extract broader information that separates objects into clusters. The entire model is trained end-to-end by minimizing the weighted sum of two contrastive losses, one for each head, applied to their respective outputs. To optimize the contrastive loss for the clustering head, we introduce a novel critic function called "log-of-dot-product". Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing single-stage clustering methods on various image datasets, achieving a 5-7% increase in accuracy compared to the best baseline on CIFAR10/20, STL10, and ImageNet-Dogs. Additionally, our two-stage variant also surpasses baselines on three challenging subsets of ImageNet.
