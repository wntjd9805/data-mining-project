This paper presents a straightforward yet effective approach for estimating the 3D poses of multiple individuals from multi-view images. The proposed method follows a coarse-to-fine pipeline, where it first combines the noisy 2D observations from multiple camera views into 3D space and then assigns them to individual instances using a confidence-aware majority voting technique. The final pose estimates are obtained through a novel optimization scheme that connects high-confidence 2D observations and 3D joint candidates. Additionally, a statistical parametric body model, such as SMPL, is utilized as a prior to regularize these 3D joint candidates. The optimization process alternates between optimizing the 3D poses and SMPL parameters jointly. This integration of parametric models helps correct implausible 3D pose estimates and fill in missing joint detections, while the updated 3D poses guide better SMPL estimations. By establishing a link between 2D and 3D observations, the proposed method achieves high accuracy and generalizes well to different data sources. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets, and the code and video demonstration can be found on the project page: https://ait.ethz.ch/projects/2021/multi-human-pose/.
