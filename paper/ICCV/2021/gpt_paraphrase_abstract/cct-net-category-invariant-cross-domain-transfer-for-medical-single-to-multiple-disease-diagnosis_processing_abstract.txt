The conventional approach to medical imaging models focuses on diagnosing a single disease. However, there is a growing need for multi-disease diagnosis in clinical settings, requiring the exploration of solutions that can address this demand. Previous studies have proposed methods such as transfer learning through fine-tuning using different disease labels or transferring knowledge across similar disease domains. However, these approaches do not fully address the challenge faced in clinical practice, which is the lack of annotations for each disease in a multi-disease model. In this paper, we introduce a task of transferring knowledge from single-disease diagnosis to improve multi-disease diagnosis. We propose a method called category-invariant cross-domain transfer (CCT) to address this extension from single to multiple diseases. Firstly, for domain-specific learning, we present a technique called confidence weighted pooling (CWP) to generate approximate heatmaps for different disease categories. Then, based on these heatmaps, we introduce category-invariant feature refinement (CIFR) blocks to localize discriminative semantic regions associated with each disease. The category-invariant characteristic allows for transferability from the source domain to the target domain. We validate our method in two popular areas: extending diabetic retinopathy diagnosis to the identification of multiple ocular diseases, and extending glioma identification to the diagnosis of other brain tumors.
