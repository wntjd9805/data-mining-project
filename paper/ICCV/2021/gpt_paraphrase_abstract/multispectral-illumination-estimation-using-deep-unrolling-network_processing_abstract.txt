This study addresses the issue of estimating illumination spectra in multispectral images. We approach the problem by formulating it as a constrained matrix factorization problem. We propose a method that utilizes a deep unrolling network constructed from the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) optimization to solve the matrix factorization problem. In order to overcome the scarcity of multispectral training data, we create a large dataset of multispectral reflectance images to generate synthesized data for training and evaluating our model. Our simulations and real experiments demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses existing spectral illumination estimation methods and exhibits strong generalization across various scenes and spectra.
