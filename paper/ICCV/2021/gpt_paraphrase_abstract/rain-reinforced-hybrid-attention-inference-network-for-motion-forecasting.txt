Motion forecasting is crucial in various domains such as autonomous driving and human-robot interaction, where the goal is to predict future motion sequences based on past observations. However, not all observed elements are equally important and some may even be irrelevant or distracting in certain situations. To tackle this issue, we introduce a motion forecasting framework called RAIN, which utilizes a hybrid attention mechanism to dynamically select and rank key information. This generic framework is applied to two specific tasks: multi-agent trajectory prediction and human motion forecasting. In the former task, the model learns to understand the relationships between agents using a graph representation and determine their relative significance. In the latter task, the model captures the temporal proximity and dependency in long-term human motions. We also propose a double-stage training pipeline with an alternating training strategy to optimize the parameters in different modules of the framework. Our framework is evaluated on synthetic simulations and motion forecasting benchmarks in various domains, and the results show that our approach not only achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance but also provides interpretable and reasonable hybrid attention weights.
