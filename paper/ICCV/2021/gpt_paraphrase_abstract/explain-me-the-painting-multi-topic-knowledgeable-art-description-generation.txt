This study introduces a framework that aims to make art more accessible to people by generating comprehensive descriptions of fine-art paintings. Describing artworks is a difficult task as it involves capturing various aspects of the image, such as style, content, and composition, while also providing background information about the artist, their influences, and the historical period. To overcome these challenges, the researchers propose a multi-topic and knowledgeable art description framework. This framework categorizes the generated sentences into three artistic topics and enriches each description with external knowledge. The effectiveness of the framework is validated through a thorough analysis, including quantitative and qualitative measures, as well as a comparative human evaluation. The results demonstrate the framework's exceptional performance in terms of topic diversity and accuracy of information. The output of the framework consists solely of abstract descriptions.
