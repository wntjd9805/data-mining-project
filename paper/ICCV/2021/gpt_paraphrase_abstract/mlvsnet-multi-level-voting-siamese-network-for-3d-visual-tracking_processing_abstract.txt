This paper introduces a Multi-level Voting Siamese Network (MLVSNet) for 3D visual tracking using outdoor point cloud sequences. While Siamese-based trackers have made significant progress in 2D visual tracking, 3D visual tracking remains under-explored. Inspired by Hough voting in 3D object detection, the proposed MLVSNet performs Hough voting on multi-level features to address sparsity in outdoor 3D point clouds. This approach allows for more vote centers and retains more useful information compared to previous methods that only vote on the final level feature. Additionally, the paper presents a lightweight Target-Guided Attention (TGA) module to transfer target information and highlight target points in the search area. Furthermore, a Vote-cluster Feature Enhancement (VFE) module is proposed to leverage the relationships between different vote clusters. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset's 3D tracking benchmark demonstrate that MLVSNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.
