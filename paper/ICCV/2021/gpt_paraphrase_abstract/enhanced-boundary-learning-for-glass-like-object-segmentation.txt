Glass-like objects such as windows, bottles, and mirrors are common in the real world. Sensing and identifying these objects is important for various applications like robot navigation and grasping. However, it is a challenging task due to the complex scenes behind these objects. This paper presents a solution to the segmentation problem of glass-like objects using enhanced boundary learning. The proposed method includes a refined differential module that provides more precise boundary cues and an edge-aware point-based graph convolution network module to capture the global shape along the boundary. These modules are integrated into a decoder that generates accurate and clean segmentation results, especially along the object contours. The lightweight and effective nature of these modules allows them to be easily incorporated into different segmentation models. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on three recent glass-like object segmentation datasets (Trans10k, MSD, and GDD), where it achieves state-of-the-art results. Additionally, the strong generalization capabilities of the method are showcased on three generic segmentation datasets (Cityscapes, BDD, and COCO Stuff). The code and models of the proposed approach will be made available for further research.
