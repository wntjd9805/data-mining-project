We introduce PR-RRN, a new neural-network based technique for Non-rigid Structure-from-Motion (NRSfM). PR-RRN includes Residual-Recursive Networks (RRN) and two additional regularization losses. RRN is developed to effectively reconstruct 3D shape and camera parameters using 2D keypoints, utilizing a unique residual-recursive structure. Since NRSfM is a problem with limited constraints, we propose two novel pairwise regularization techniques to further enhance the reconstruction process. The Rigidity-based Pairwise Contrastive Loss aims to improve the shape representation by promoting higher similarity between the representations of frames with high rigidity compared to those with low rigidity. We measure the pairwise rigidity using the minimum singular-value ratio. The Pairwise Consistency Loss enforces consistency in the reconstruction when the estimated shapes and cameras are swapped between pairs. Our approach achieves remarkable performance on the CMU MOCAP and PASCAL3D+ datasets, surpassing existing methods.
