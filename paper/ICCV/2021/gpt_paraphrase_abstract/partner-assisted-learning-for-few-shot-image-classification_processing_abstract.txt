Few-shot Learning aims to develop models that can learn effectively with minimal human annotation, mimicking human visual capabilities. While meta-learning for adaptation has been the dominant approach in few-shot learning methods, training a feature extractor remains a challenge. This paper focuses on designing a training strategy to obtain an elemental representation that allows estimating the prototype of each new class from a small number of labeled samples.

To address this, the authors propose a two-stage training scheme called Partner-Assisted Learning (PAL). In the first stage, a Partner Encoder is trained to model pairwise similarities and extract features that serve as soft-anchors. In the second stage, a Main Encoder is trained by aligning its outputs with the soft-anchors, while simultaneously maximizing classification performance. Two alignment constraints are designed at both the logit-level and feature-level.

For each few-shot task, the proposed method performs prototype classification. Experimental results demonstrate that PAL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four benchmark datasets. Furthermore, detailed ablation studies are conducted to justify the selection of each component involved in the training process.

Overall, this paper presents a novel training strategy, PAL, for few-shot learning. The proposed method achieves superior performance compared to existing approaches and provides insights into the selection of training components.
