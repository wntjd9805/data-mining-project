Recent advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made it crucial for media and visual forensics to develop detectors capable of identifying and attributing images to their corresponding GAN models. While existing methods have shown high accuracy in attributing images to known GAN sources, they fail to generalize to unseen GANs during training, making them unsuitable for handling a continuous influx of new GANs. To address this limitation, we propose an iterative algorithm that can discover images generated from previously unseen GANs by leveraging the unique fingerprints left by each GAN on its generated images. Our algorithm comprises several components, including network training, out-of-distribution detection, clustering, merge, and refine steps. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm achieves high accuracy in discovering unseen GANs and can also generalize to GANs trained on unseen real datasets. Moreover, we apply our algorithm to online attribution and discovery of GANs, as well as the conventional task of real/fake detection. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach in discovering new GANs, making it suitable for an open-world scenario.
