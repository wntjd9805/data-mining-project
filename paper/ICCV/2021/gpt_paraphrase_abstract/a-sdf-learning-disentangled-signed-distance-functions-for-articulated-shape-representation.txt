There has been significant progress in using implicit functions to reconstruct 3D rigid object shapes. However, less attention has been given to modeling general articulated objects, which have more degrees of freedom and pose challenges in generalization to unseen shapes. To address this, we introduce Articulated Signed Distance Functions (A-SDF) that represent articulated shapes using a disentangled latent space, separating shape and articulation codes. With this representation, we demonstrate the ability to control articulation input and animate unseen instances with unseen joint angles. Additionally, we propose a Test-Time Adaptation algorithm for adjusting the model during inference. Our model shows good generalization to out-of-distribution and unseen data, including partial point clouds and real-world depth images.
