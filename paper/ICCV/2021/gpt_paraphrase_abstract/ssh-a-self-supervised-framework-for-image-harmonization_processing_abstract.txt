The goal of image harmonization is to enhance the quality of image compositing by matching the visual characteristics of foreground and background images. However, creating annotated datasets for this task can be challenging and time-consuming. To address this issue, we present a novel framework called Self-Supervised Harmonization (SSH) that can be trained using unedited natural images. Our approach involves redefining the image harmonization problem from a representation fusion perspective, which allows us to separately process the foreground and background examples and overcome background occlusion challenges. We also introduce a dual data augmentation method that generates diverse triplets [foreground, background, pseudo GT] by cropping images with perturbations using 3D color lookup tables. Additionally, we have curated a real-world harmonization dataset created by expert users for evaluation and benchmarking purposes. Our experimental results demonstrate that our self-supervised method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of reference metrics, visual quality, and subjective user study. The code and dataset for our framework are publicly available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/SSHarmonization.
