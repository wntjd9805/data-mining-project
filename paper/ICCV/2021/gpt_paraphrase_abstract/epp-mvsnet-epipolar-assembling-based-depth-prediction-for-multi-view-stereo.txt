This paper presents EPP-MVSNet, a new deep learning network for 3D reconstruction from multi-view stereo (MVS). EPP-MVSNet effectively aggregates features at high resolution within a limited cost volume, resulting in efficient and accurate 3D construction. Unlike existing methods that measure feature cost at discrete positions, which can impact reconstruction accuracy, EPP-MVSNet introduces an epipolar-assembling-based kernel that operates on adaptive intervals along epipolar lines, utilizing the image resolution fully. Additionally, an entropy-based refining strategy is introduced to reduce redundancy in the cost volume and describe the space geometry more accurately. To achieve both high accuracy and efficiency, a lightweight network with Pseudo-3D convolutions is designed. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including Tanks & Temples (TNT), ETH3D, and DTU, demonstrate promising results, with the highest F-Score achieved on the TNT intermediate benchmark.
