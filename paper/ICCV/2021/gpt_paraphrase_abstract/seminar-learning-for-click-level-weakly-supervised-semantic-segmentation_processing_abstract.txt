The annotation burden has become a major obstacle in semantic segmentation. Approaches using click-level annotations have gained attention due to their balance between supervision and annotation cost. This paper introduces seminar learning, a new learning paradigm for semantic segmentation with click-level supervision. The goal of seminar learning is to utilize knowledge from different networks to compensate for the limited information provided by click-level annotations. The approach involves a teacher-student module and a student-student module. The teacher-student module utilizes a teacher network to guide the training of the student network. The student-student module uses heterogeneous pseudo-labels to enhance knowledge transfer among students. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of seminar learning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset. The proposed approach outperforms previous methods by a significant margin. The paper includes a figure illustrating the limitations of generic models trained with click-level annotations and the improvements achieved with seminar learning.
