This paper introduces a new approach to binarizing graph neural networks (GNNs) by developing a 1-bit GNN framework that binarizes both the GNN parameters and the graph features. However, this vanilla framework lacks the ability to accurately distinguish between different graph topologies, resulting in a significant decrease in performance. To address this issue, the authors propose two meta aggregators: the Greedy Gumbel Neighborhood Aggregator (GNA) and the Adaptable Hybrid Neighborhood Aggregator (ANA). GNA selects the optimal aggregator from a pool of candidates, while ANA combines the benefits of multiple individual aggregators. These meta aggregators can also be easily integrated into existing full-precision GNNs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in various domains.
