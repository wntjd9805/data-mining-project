This study focuses on the assessment of compliance with social distancing measures in busy public areas using wide field-of-view cameras. The researchers introduce a dataset of crowd scenes with annotations and ground truth for measuring distances. They propose several measures to evaluate social distance detection systems. They also propose a multi-branch network called BEV-Net, which uses head and feet detection, camera pose estimation, a module for mapping images into bird's eye view (BEV) coordinates, and geometric reasoning to create a BEV map of people's locations. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and its superior performance compared to existing methods. The study concludes by discussing the potential applications for public health decision makers. The dataset, code, and pretrained models are publicly available on GitHub.
