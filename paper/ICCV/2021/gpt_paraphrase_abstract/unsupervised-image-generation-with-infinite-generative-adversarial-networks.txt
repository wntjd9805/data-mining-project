The use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image generation in computer vision has been successful. However, GANs suffer from various issues such as mode collapse, non-structured latent space, and inability to compute likelihoods. In this study, we propose a new method called mixture of infinite conditional GANs (MIC-GANs) that addresses these issues. MIC-GANs aim to generate images with minimal prior knowledge and offer improvements over existing methods. Through evaluations on different datasets, we demonstrate that MIC-GANs effectively structure the latent space, avoid mode collapse, and outperform state-of-the-art techniques. MIC-GANs are adaptive, versatile, and robust, providing a promising solution to common GAN problems. The code for MIC-GANs is available at github.com/yinghdb/MICGANs.
