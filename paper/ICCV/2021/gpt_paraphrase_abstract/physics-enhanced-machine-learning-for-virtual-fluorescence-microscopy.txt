This study presents a novel approach to designing microscopes for virtual fluorescence microscopy using data-driven techniques. The researchers employ a deep neural network (DNN) to optimize the illumination patterns for specimen imaging, leading to improved fluorescence image inference from unstained microscope images. The illumination model is integrated into the initial layers of the DNN and jointly optimized during network training. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments conducted on two different setups, showcasing consistent performance enhancements compared to traditional microscope imaging methods. Furthermore, the researchers investigate the impact of the learned illumination on the inference task by varying the number of optimized illumination patterns and analyzing the corresponding changes in pattern structure. This research highlights the potential of programmable optical elements in enhancing machine learning algorithms and gaining insights into the future of machine-controlled imaging systems.
