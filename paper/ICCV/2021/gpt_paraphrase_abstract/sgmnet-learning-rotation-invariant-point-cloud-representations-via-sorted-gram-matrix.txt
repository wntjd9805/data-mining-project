Recent studies on introducing rotation invariance to point cloud analysis have focused on using point-pair features such as angles and distances. However, these methods only consider the center point and its adjacent points in a vicinity, leading to potential loss of information in the local feature representation. In this paper, we propose a different approach where each point is connected densely with all other points in its local neighborhood to create point-pairs. We introduce a local feature representation called sorted Gram matrix (SGM) that not only preserves rotation invariance but also captures the pairwise relationships between all points in a neighborhood. The SGM utilizes the vector inner product to model the distance and angle information between two points, forming a Gram matrix within a local patch. To ensure permutation invariance, we sort the correlation values in the Gram matrix for each point, resulting in the sorted Gram matrix geometric feature. We mathematically prove that the Gram matrix is rotation-invariant and effectively captures the underlying structure of a point cloud patch. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of using SGM as features in convolution, which can be seamlessly integrated into any point-based networks. Experimental evaluations on two widely-used datasets show that our proposed method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in both shape classification and part segmentation tasks.
