While deep learning succeeds in a wide range of tasks, it highly depends on the massive collection of annotated data which is expensive and time-consuming. To lower the cost of data annotation, active learning has been proposed to in-teractively query an oracle to annotate a small proportion of informative samples in an unlabeled dataset.Inspired by the fact that the samples with higher loss are usually more informative to the model than the samples with lower loss, in this paper we present a novel deep active learn-ing approach that queries the oracle for data annotation when the unlabeled sample is believed to incorporate high loss. The core of our approach is a measurement TemporalOutput Discrepancy (TOD) that estimates the sample loss by evaluating the discrepancy of outputs given by models at different optimization steps. Our theoretical investiga-tion shows that TOD lower-bounds the accumulated sample loss thus it can be used to select informative unlabeled sam-ples. On basis of TOD, we further develop an effective un-labeled data sampling strategy as well as an unsupervised learning criterion that enhances model performance by in-corporating the unlabeled data. Due to the simplicity ofTOD, our active learning approach is efﬁcient, ﬂexible, and task-agnostic. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performances than the state-of-the-art active learning methods on image classiﬁ-cation and semantic segmentation tasks.
