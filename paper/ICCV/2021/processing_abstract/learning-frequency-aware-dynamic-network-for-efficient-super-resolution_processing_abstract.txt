Deep learning based methods, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully applied in the ﬁeld of single image super-resolution (SISR). To obtain better ﬁdelity and visual quality, most of existing networks are of heavy design with massive computation. However, the computation resources of modern mobile devices are limited, which cannot easily support the expensive cost. To this end, this paper explores a novel frequency-aware dy-namic network for dividing the input into multiple parts according to its coefﬁcients in the discrete cosine trans-form (DCT) domain. In practice, the high-frequency part will be processed using expensive operations and the lower-frequency part is assigned with cheap operations to relieve the computation burden. Since pixels or image patches be-long to low-frequency areas contain relatively few textural details, this dynamic network will not affect the quality of resulting super-resolution images. In addition, we embed predictors into the proposed dynamic network to end-to-endﬁne-tune the handcrafted frequency-aware masks. Exten-sive experiments conducted on benchmark SISR models and datasets show that the frequency-aware dynamic network can be employed for various SISR neural architectures to obtain the better tradeoff between visual quality and compu-tational complexity. For instance, we can reduce the FLOPs of SR models by approximate 50% while preserving state-of-the-art SISR performance.
