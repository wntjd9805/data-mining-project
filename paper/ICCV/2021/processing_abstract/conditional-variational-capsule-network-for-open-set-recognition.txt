In open set recognition, a classiﬁer has to detect un-known classes that are not known at training time. In or-der to recognize new categories, the classiﬁer has to project the input samples of known classes in very compact and separated regions of the features space for discriminating samples of unknown classes. Recently proposed CapsuleNetworks have shown to outperform alternatives in manyﬁelds, particularly in image recognition, however they have not been fully applied yet to open-set recognition. In cap-sule networks, scalar neurons are replaced by capsule vec-tors or matrices, whose entries represent different proper-ties of objects. In our proposal, during training, capsules features of the same known class are encouraged to match a pre-deﬁned gaussian, one for each class. To this end, we use the variational autoencoder framework, with a set of gaussian priors as the approximation for the posterior dis-tribution. In this way, we are able to control the compact-ness of the features of the same class around the center of the gaussians, thus controlling the ability of the classiﬁer in detecting samples from unknown classes. We conducted several experiments and ablation of our model, obtaining state of the art results on different datasets in the open set recognition and unknown detection tasks.
