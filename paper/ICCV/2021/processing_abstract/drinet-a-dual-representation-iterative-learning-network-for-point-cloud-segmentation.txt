We present a novel and flexible architecture for point cloud segmentation with dual-representation iterative learning.In point cloud processing, different representa-tions have their own pros and cons. Thus, finding suitable ways to represent point cloud data structure while keeping its own internal physical property such as permutation and scale-invariant is a fundamental problem. Therefore, we propose our work, DRINet, which serves as the basic net-work structure for dual-representation learning with great flexibility at feature transferring and less computation cost, especially for large-scale point clouds. DRINet mainly con-sists of two modules called Sparse Point-Voxel Feature Ex-traction and Sparse Voxel-Point Feature Extraction. By uti-lizing these two modules iteratively, features can be prop-agated between two different representations. We further propose a novel multi-scale pooling layer for pointwise lo-cality learning to improve context information propagation.Our network achieves state-of-the-art results for point cloud classification and segmentation tasks on several datasets while maintaining high runtime efficiency. For large-scale outdoor scenarios, our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a real-time inference time of 62ms per frame.
