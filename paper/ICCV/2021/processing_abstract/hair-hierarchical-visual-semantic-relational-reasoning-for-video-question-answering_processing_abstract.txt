Q: What does the woman do after hold bucket?                 A: Dump bucketRelational reasoning is at the heart of video question an-swering. However, existing approaches suffer from several common limitations: (1) they only focus on either object-level or frame-level relational reasoning, and fail to inte-grate the both; and (2) they neglect to leverage semantic knowledge for relational reasoning. In this work, we pro-pose a Hierarchical VisuAl-Semantic RelatIonal Reasoning (HAIR) framework to address these limitations. Speciﬁ-cally, we present a novel graph memory mechanism to per-form relational reasoning, and further develop two types of graph memory: a) visual graph memory that leverages visual information of video for relational reasoning; b) se-mantic graph memory that is speciﬁcally designed to explic-itly leverage semantic knowledge contained in the classes and attributes of video objects, and perform relational rea-soning in the semantic space. Taking advantage of both graph memory mechanisms, we build a hierarchical frame-work to enable visual-semantic relational reasoning from object level to frame level. Experiments on four challeng-ing benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework leads to state-of-the-art performance, with fewer parame-ters and faster inference speed. Besides, our approach also shows superior performance on other video+language task.
