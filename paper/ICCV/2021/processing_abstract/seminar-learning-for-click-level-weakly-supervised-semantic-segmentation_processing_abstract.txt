Annotation burden has become one of the biggest barri-ers to semantic segmentation. Approaches based on click-level annotations have therefore attracted increasing atten-tion due to their superior trade-off between supervision and annotation cost. In this paper, we propose seminar learn-ing, a new learning paradigm for semantic segmentation with click-level supervision. The fundamental rationale of seminar learning is to leverage the knowledge from differ-ent networks to compensate for insufficient information pro-vided in click-level annotations. Mimicking a seminar, our seminar learning involves a teacher-student and a student-student module, where a student can learn from both skill-ful teachers and other students. The teacher-student mod-ule uses a teacher network based on the exponential mov-ing average to guide the training of the student network.In the student-student module, heterogeneous pseudo-labels are proposed to bridge the transfer of knowledge among students to enhance each otherâ€™s performance. Experimen-tal results demonstrate the effectiveness of seminar learn-ing, which achieves the new state-of-the-art performance of 72.51% (mIOU), surpassing previous methods by a large margin of up to 16.88% on the Pascal VOC 2012 dataset.Figure 1. Weakly supervised segmentation with the click-level an-notations. (a) A generic model trained only with click-level anno-tations overfits to the labels and cannot recognize the whole object. (b) Previous works (e.g. regularized loss) apply low-dimensional continuity information to the training, also failing to correctly seg-ment the object. (c) With seminar learning, our teacher-student module enables the network to generalize to the whole object, as indicated by the arrows. Meanwhile, by integrating diverse in-formation from the two networks, the student-student module can smooth the boundary area in the marked boxes.
