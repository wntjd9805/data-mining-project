In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning frame-work to reconstruct 3D hand poses and shapes of two interacting hands from a single color image. Previous methods designed for single hand cannot be easily ap-plied for the two hand scenario because of the heavyIn or-inter-hand occlusion and larger solution space. der to address the occlusion and similar appearance be-tween hands that may confuse the network, we design a hand pose-aware attention module to extract features asso-ciated to each individual hand respectively. We then lever-age the two hand context presented in interaction to pro-pose a context-aware cascaded reÔ¨Ånement that improves the hand pose and shape accuracy of each hand condi-tioned on the context between interacting hands. Exten-sive experiments on the main benchmark datasets demon-strate that our method predicts accurate 3D hand pose and shape from single color image, and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
