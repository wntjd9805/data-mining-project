Satellite multi-view stereo (MVS) imagery is particularly suited for large-scale Earth surface reconstruction. Differ-ing from the perspective camera model (pin-hole model) that is commonly used for close-range and aerial cam-eras, the cubic rational polynomial camera (RPC) model is the mainstream model for push-broom linear-array satel-lite cameras. However, the homography warping used in the prevailing learning based MVS methods is only appli-cable to pin-hole cameras.In order to apply the SOTA learning based MVS technology to the satellite MVS task for large-scale Earth surface reconstruction, RPC warping should be considered. In this work, we propose, for the first time, a rigorous RPC warping module. The rational poly-nomial coefficients are recorded as a tensor, and the RPC warping is formulated as a series of tensor transformations.Based on the RPC warping, we propose the deep learning based satellite MVS (SatMVS) framework for large-scale and wide depth range Earth surface reconstruction. We also introduce a large-scale satellite image dataset con-sisting of 519 5120Ã—5120 images, which we call the TLCSatMVS dataset. The satellite images were acquired from a three-line camera (TLC) that catches triple-view images simultaneously, forming a valuable supplement to the exist-ing open-source WorldView-3 datasets with single-scanline images. Experiments show that the proposed RPC warp-ing module and the SatMVS framework can achieve a supe-rior reconstruction accuracy compared to the pin-hole fit-ting method and conventional MVS methods.
