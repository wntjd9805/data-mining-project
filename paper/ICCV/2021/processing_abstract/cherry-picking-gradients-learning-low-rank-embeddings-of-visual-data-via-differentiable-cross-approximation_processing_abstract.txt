We propose an end-to-end trainable framework that pro-cesses large-scale visual data tensors by looking at a frac-tion of their entries only. Our method combines a neu-ral network encoder with a tensor train decomposition to learn a low-rank latent encoding, coupled with cross-approximation (CA) to learn the representation through a subset of the original samples. CA is an adaptive sam-pling algorithm that is native to tensor decompositions and avoids working with the full high-resolution data explicitly.Instead, it actively selects local representative samples that we fetch out-of-core and on demand. The required number of samples grows only logarithmically with the size of the input. Our implicit representation of the tensor in the net-work enables processing large grids that could not be oth-erwise tractable in their uncompressed form. The proposed approach is particularly useful for large-scale multidimen-sional grid data (e.g., 3D tomography), and for tasks that require context over a large receptive Ô¨Åeld (e.g., predicting the medical condition of entire organs). The code is avail-able at https://github.com/aelphy/c-pic.
