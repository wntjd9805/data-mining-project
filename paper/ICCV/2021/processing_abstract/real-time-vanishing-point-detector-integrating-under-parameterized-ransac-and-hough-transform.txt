In our algorithm,We propose a novel approach that integrates under-parameterized RANSAC (UPRANSAC) with Hough Trans-form to detect vanishing points (VPs) from un-calibrated monocular images. the UPRANSAC chooses one hypothetical inlier in a sample set to ﬁnd a portion of the VP’s degrees of freedom, which is followed by a highly reliable brute-force voting scheme (1-D HoughTransform) to ﬁnd the VP’s remaining degrees of freedom along the extension line of the hypothetical inlier. Our ap-proach is able to sequentially ﬁnd a series of VPs by re-peatedly removing inliers of any detected VPs from minimal sample sets until the stop criterion is reached. Compared to traditional RANSAC that selects 2 edges as a hypotheti-cal inlier pair to ﬁt a model of VP hypothesis and requires hitting a pair of inliners, the UPRANSAC has a higher like-lihood to hit one inliner and is more reliable in VP de-tection. Meanwhile, the tremendously scaled-down voting space with the requirement of only 1 parameter for pro-cessing signiﬁcantly increased the performance efﬁciency of Hough Transform in our scheme. Testing results with well-known benchmark datasets show that the detection ac-curacies of our approach were higher or on par with theSOTA while running in deeply real-time zone.
