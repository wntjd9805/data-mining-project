A distinctive feature of Doppler radar is the measure-ment of velocity in the radial direction for radar points.However, the missing tangential velocity component ham-pers object velocity estimation as well as temporal integra-tion of radar sweeps in dynamic scenes. Recognizing that fusing camera with radar provides complementary informa-tion to radar, in this paper we present a closed-form so-lution for the point-wise, full-velocity estimate of Doppler returns using the corresponding optical ﬂow from camera images. Additionally, we address the association problem between radar returns and camera images with a neural network that is trained to estimate radar-camera correspon-dences. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset ver-ify the validity of the method and show signiﬁcant improve-ments over the state-of-the-art in velocity estimation and accumulation of radar points.
