Event cameras, which output events by detecting spatio-temporal brightness changes, bring a novel paradigm to image sensors with high dynamic range and low latency.Previous works have achieved impressive performances on event-based video reconstruction by introducing convolu-tional neural networks (CNNs). However, intrinsic lo-cality of convolutional operations is not capable of mod-eling long-range dependency, which is crucial to manyIn this paper, we present a hybrid CNN-vision tasks.Transformer network for event-based video reconstruction (ET-Net), which merits the Ô¨Åne local information from CNN and global contexts from Transformer. In addition, we fur-ther propose a Token Pyramid Aggregation strategy to im-plement multi-scale token integration for relating internal and intersected semantic concepts in the token-space. Ex-perimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art meth-ods on multiple real-world event datasets.
