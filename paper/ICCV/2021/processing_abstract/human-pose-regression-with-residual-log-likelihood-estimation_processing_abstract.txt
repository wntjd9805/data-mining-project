Heatmap-based methods dominate in the field of hu-man pose estimation by modelling the output distribu-tion through likelihood heatmaps. In contrast, regression-based methods are more efficient but suffer from inferior performance.In this work, we explore maximum likeli-hood estimation (MLE) to develop an efficient and effective regression-based method. From the perspective of MLE, adopting different regression losses is making different as-sumptions about the output density function. A density func-tion closer to the true distribution leads to a better regres-sion performance. In light of this, we propose a novel re-gression paradigm with Residual Log-likelihood Estima-tion (RLE) to capture the underlying output distribution.Concretely, RLE learns the change of the distribution in-stead of the unreferenced underlying distribution to facil-itate the training process. With the proposed reparame-terization design, our method is compatible with off-the-shelf flow models. The proposed method is effective, ef-ficient and flexible. We show its potential in various hu-man pose estimation tasks with comprehensive experiments.Compared to the conventional regression paradigm, regres-sion with RLE bring 12.4 mAP improvement on MSCOCO without any test-time overhead. Moreover, for the first time, especially on multi-person pose estimation, our re-gression method is superior to the heatmap-based methods.Our code is available at https://github.com/Jeff-sjtu/res-loglikelihood-regression.
