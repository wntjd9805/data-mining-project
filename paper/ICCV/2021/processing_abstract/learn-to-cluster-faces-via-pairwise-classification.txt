Face clustering plays an essential role in exploiting mas-sive unlabeled face data. Recently, graph-based face clus-tering methods are getting popular for their satisfying per-formances. However, they usually suffer from excessive memory consumption especially on large-scale graphs, and rely on empirical thresholds to determine the connectivities between samples in inference, which restricts their appli-cations in various real-world scenes. To address such prob-lems, in this paper, we explore face clustering from the pair-wise angle. Specifically, we formulate the face clustering task as a pairwise relationship classification task, avoiding the memory-consuming learning on large-scale graphs. The classifier can directly determine the relationship between samples and is enhanced by taking advantage of the con-textual information. Moreover, to further facilitate the effi-ciency of our method, we propose a rank-weighted density to guide the selection of pairs sent to the classifier. Experi-mental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performances on several public clustering bench-marks at the fastest speed and shows a great advantage in comparison with graph-based clustering methods on mem-ory consumption.Figure 1. An overview of the main differences between popular graph-based face clustering methods and ours. The nodes with dif-ferent colors represent different classes. (a) Graph-based methods focus on the learning of discriminative embeddings but need to set an empirical threshold to connect or disconnect samples. (b) Our method can directly determine the pairwise relationship through a classifier and generate the final clusters. Besides, by dealing with the face clustering task from graph-level to pair-level, our method largely reduces the memory consumption.
