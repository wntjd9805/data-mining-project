Active learning aims to reduce labeling costs by select-ing only the most informative samples on a dataset. Few existing works have addressed active learning for object de-tection. Most of these methods are based on multiple mod-els or are straightforward extensions of classiﬁcation meth-ods, hence estimate an image’s informativeness using only the classiﬁcation head. In this paper, we propose a novel deep active learning approach for object detection. Our approach relies on mixture density networks that estimate a probabilistic distribution for each localization and classi-ﬁcation head’s output. We explicitly estimate the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in a single forward pass of a sin-gle model. Our method uses a scoring function that aggre-gates these two types of uncertainties for both heads to ob-tain every image’s informativeness score. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our approach in PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets. Our approach outperforms single-model based methods and performs on par with multi-model based methods at a fraction of the computing cost. Code is avail-able at https://github.com/NVlabs/AL-MDN .
