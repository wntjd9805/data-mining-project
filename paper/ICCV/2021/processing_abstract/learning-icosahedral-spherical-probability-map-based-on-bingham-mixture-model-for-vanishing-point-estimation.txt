Existing vanishing point (VP) estimation methods rely on pre-extracted image lines and/or prior knowledge of the number of VPs. However, in practice, this information may be insufﬁcient or unavailable. To solve this problem, we propose a network that treats a perspective image as input and predicts a spherical probability map of VP. Based on this map, we can detect all the VPs. Our method is reliable thanks to four technical novelties. First, we leverage the icosahedral spherical representation to express our proba-bility map. This representation provides uniform pixel dis-tribution, and thus facilitates estimating arbitrary positions of VPs. Second, we design a loss function that enforces the antipodal symmetry and sparsity of our spherical prob-ability map to prevent over-ﬁtting. Third, we generate the ground truth probability map that reasonably expresses the locations and uncertainties of VPs. This map unnecessar-ily peaks at noisy annotated VPs, and also exhibits various anisotropic dispersions. Fourth, given a predicted probabil-ity map, we detect VPs by ﬁtting a Bingham mixture model.This strategy can robustly handle close VPs and provide the conﬁdence level of VP useful for practical applications. Ex-periments showed that our method achieves the best com-promise between generality, accuracy, and efﬁciency, com-pared with state-of-the-art approaches.
