In this work, we develop a method to generate inﬁnite high-resolution images with diverse and complex content.It is based on a perfectly equivariant patch-wise genera-tor with synchronous interpolations in the image and latent spaces. Latent codes, when sampled, are positioned on the coordinate grid, and each pixel is computed from an inter-polation of the neighboring codes. We modify the AdaIN mechanism to work in such a setup and train a GAN model to generate images positioned between any two latent vec-tors. At test time, this allows for generating inﬁnitely large images of diverse scenes that transition naturally from one into another. Apart from that, we introduce LHQ: a new dataset of 90k high-resolution nature landscapes. We test the approach on LHQ, LSUN Tower and LSUN Bridge and outperform the baselines by at least 4 times in terms of qual-ity and diversity of the produced inﬁnite images.
