Todayâ€™s state-of-the-art methods for 3D object detec-tion are based on lidar, stereo, or monocular cameras.Lidar-based methods achieve the best accuracy, but have a large footprint, high cost, and mechanically-limited an-gular sampling rates, resulting in low spatial resolution at long ranges. Recent approaches using low-cost monocu-lar or stereo cameras promise to overcome these limita-tions but struggle in low-light or low-contrast regions as they rely on passive CMOS sensors. We propose a novel 3D object detection modality that exploits temporal illumina-tion cues from a low-cost monocular gated imager. We in-troduce a novel deep detection architecture, Gated3D, that is tailored to temporal illumination cues in gated images.This modality allows us to exploit mature 2D object feature extractors that guide the 3D predictions through a frustum segment estimation. We assess the proposed method ex-perimentally on a 3D detection dataset that includes gated images captured over 10,000 km of driving data. We val-idate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art monoc-ular and stereo methods, opening up a new sensor modal-ity as an avenue to replace lidar in autonomous driving. https://light.princeton.edu/gated3d
