Many super-resolution (SR) models are optimized for high performance only and therefore lack efﬁciency due to large model complexity. As large models are often not prac-tical in real-world applications, we investigate and pro-pose novel loss functions, to enable SR with high percep-tual quality from much more efﬁcient models. The represen-tative power for a given low-complexity generator network can only be fully leveraged by strong guidance towards the optimal set of parameters. We show that it is possible to improve the performance of a recently introduced efﬁcient generator architecture solely with the application of ourIn particular, we use a Fourier proposed loss functions. space supervision loss for improved restoration of missing high-frequency (HF) content from the ground truth image and design a discriminator architecture working directly in the Fourier domain to better match the target HF distribu-tion. We show that our losses’ direct emphasis on the fre-quencies in Fourier-space signiﬁcantly boosts the percep-tual image quality, while at the same time retaining high restoration quality in comparison to previously proposed loss functions for this task. The performance is further im-proved by utilizing a combination of spatial and frequency domain losses, as both representations provide complemen-tary information during training. On top of that, the trained generator achieves comparable results with and is 2.4× and 48× faster than state-of-the-art perceptual SR methodsRankSRGAN and SRFlow respectively.
