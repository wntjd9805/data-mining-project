The convolutional neural network (CNN) is vulnerable to degraded images with even very small variations (e.g. corrupted and adversarial samples). One of the possible reasons is that CNN pays more attention to the most dis-criminative regions, but ignores the auxiliary features when learning, leading to the lack of feature diversity for ﬁnal judgment. In our method, we propose to dynamically sup-press signiﬁcant activation values of CNN by group-wise inhibition, but not ﬁxedly or randomly handle them when training. The feature maps with different activation dis-tribution are then processed separately to take the feature independence into account. CNN is ﬁnally guided to learn richer discriminative features hierarchically for robust clas-siﬁcation according to the proposed regularization. Our method is comprehensively evaluated under multiple set-tings, including classiﬁcation against corruptions, adver-sarial attacks and low data regime. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve signiﬁ-cant improvements in terms of both robustness and general-ization performances, when compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
