While single-view 3D reconstruction has made signifi-cant progress benefiting from deep shape representations in recent years, garment reconstruction is still not solved well due to open surfaces, diverse topologies and complex geometric details. In this paper, we propose a novel learn-able Anchored Unsigned Distance Function (AnchorUDF) representation for 3D garment reconstruction from a sin-gle image. AnchorUDF represents 3D shapes by predict-ing unsigned distance fields (UDFs) to enable open gar-ment surface modeling at arbitrary resolution. To capture diverse garment topologies, AnchorUDF not only computes pixel-aligned local image features of query points, but also leverages a set of anchor points located around the surface to enrich 3D position features for query points, which pro-vides stronger 3D space context for the distance function.Furthermore, in order to obtain more accurate point pro-jection direction at inference, we explicitly align the spa-tial gradient direction of AnchorUDF with the ground-truth direction to the surface during training. Extensive experi-ments on two public 3D garment datasets, i.e., MGN andDeep Fashion3D, demonstrate that AnchorUDF achieves the state-of-the-art performance on single-view garment re-construction.
