Most existing domain adaptation methods focus on adaptation from only one source domain, however, in prac-tice there are a number of relevant sources that could be leveraged to help improve performance on target domain.We propose a novel approach named T-SVDNet to address the task of Multi-source Domain Adaptation (MDA), which is featured by incorporating Tensor Singular Value Decom-position (T-SVD) into a neural network’s training pipeline.Overall, high-order correlations among multiple domains and categories are fully explored so as to better bridge the domain gap. Speciﬁcally, we impose Tensor-Low-Rank (TLR) constraint on a tensor obtained by stacking up a group of prototypical similarity matrices, aiming at cap-turing consistent data structure across different domains.Furthermore, to avoid negative transfer brought by noisy source data, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware weight-ing strategy to adaptively assign weights to different source domains and samples based on the result of uncertainty esti-mation. Extensive experiments conducted on public bench-marks demonstrate the superiority of our model in address-ing the task of MDA compared to state-of-the-art meth-ods.
