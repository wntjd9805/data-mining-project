Deep Learning architectures, albeit successful in most computer vision tasks, were designed for data with an un-derlying Euclidean structure, which is not usually fulfilled since pre-processed data may lie on a non-linear space.In this paper, we propose a geometry aware deep learn-ing approach using rigid and non rigid transformation opti-mization for skeleton-based action recognition. Skeleton se-quences are first modeled as trajectories on Kendallâ€™s shape space and then mapped to the linear tangent space. The re-sulting structured data are then fed to a deep learning archi-tecture, which includes a layer that optimizes over rigid and non rigid transformations of the 3D skeletons, followed by a CNN-LSTM network. The assessment on two large scale skeleton datasets, namely NTU-RGB+D and NTU-RGB+D 120, has proven that the proposed approach outperforms existing geometric deep learning methods and exceeds re-cently published approaches with respect to the majority of configurations.
