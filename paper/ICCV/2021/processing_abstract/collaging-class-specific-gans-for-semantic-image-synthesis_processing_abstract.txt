We propose a new approach for high resolution seman-tic image synthesis. It consists of one base image generator and multiple class-specific generators. The base genera-tor generates high quality images based on a segmentation map. To further improve the quality of different objects, we create a bank of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by separately training class-specific models. This has sev-eral benefits including – dedicated weights for each class; centrally aligned data for each model; additional training data from other sources, potential of higher resolution and quality; and easy manipulation of a specific object in the scene. Experiments show that our approach can generate high quality images in high resolution while having flexibil-ity of object-level control by using class-specific generators.
