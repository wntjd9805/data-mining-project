This paper examines the problem of illumination spec-tra estimation in multispectral images. We cast the prob-lem into a constrained matrix factorization problem and present a method for both single-global and multiple illu-mination estimation in which a deep unrolling network is constructed from the alternating direction method of mul-tipliers(ADMM) optimization for solving the matrix factor-ization problem. To alleviate the lack of multispectral train-ing data, we build a large multispectral reï¬‚ectance image dataset for generating synthesized data and use them for training and evaluating our model. The results of simula-tions and real experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is able to outperform state-of-the-art spectral illu-mination estimation methods, and that it generalizes well to a wide variety of scenes and spectra.
