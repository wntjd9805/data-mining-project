Point cloud registration is the task of estimating the rigid transformation that aligns a pair of point cloud fragments.We present an efﬁcient and robust framework for pairwise registration of real-world 3D scans, leveraging Hough vot-ing in the 6D transformation parameter space. First, deep geometric features are extracted from a point cloud pair to compute putative correspondences. We then construct a set of triplets of correspondences to cast votes on the 6D Hough space, representing the transformation param-eters in sparse tensors. Next, a fully convolutional reﬁne-ment module is applied to reﬁne the noisy votes. Finally, we identify the consensus among the correspondences from the Hough space, which we use to predict our ﬁnal trans-formation parameters. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 3DMatch and 3DLoMatch benchmarks while achieving comparable performance on KITTI odom-etry dataset. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by setting a new state-of-the-art on ICL-NUIM dataset, where we integrate our module into a multi-way registration pipeline.
