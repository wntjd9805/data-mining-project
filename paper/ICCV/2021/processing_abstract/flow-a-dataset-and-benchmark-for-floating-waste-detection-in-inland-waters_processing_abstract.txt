Marine debris is severely threatening the marine lives and causing sustained pollution to the whole ecosystem. To prevent the wastes from getting into the ocean, it is helpful to clean up the floating wastes in inland waters using the au-tonomous cleaning devices like unmanned surface vehicles.The cleaning efficiency relies on a high-accurate and robust object detection system. However, the small size of the tar-get, the strong light reflection over water surface, and the reflection of other objects on bank-side all bring challenges to the vision-based object detection system. To promote the practical application for autonomous floating wastes cleaning, we present FloWâ€ , the first dataset for floating waste detection in inland water areas. The dataset con-sists of an image sub-dataset FloW-Img and a multimodal sub-dataset FloW-RI which contains synchronized millime-ter wave radar data and images. Accurate annotations for images and radar data are provided, supporting float-ing waste detection strategies based on image, radar data, and the fusion of two sensors. We perform several base-line experiments on our dataset, including vision-based and radar-based detection methods. The results show that, the detection accuracy is relatively low and floating waste de-tection still remains a challenging task.
