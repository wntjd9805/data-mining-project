Deep Convolution Neural Networks have been adopted for pansharpening and achieved state-of-the-art perfor-mance. However, most of the existing works mainly fo-cus on single-scale feature fusion, which leads to fail-ure in fully considering relationships of information be-tween high-level semantics and low-level features, despite the network is deep enough. In this paper, we propose a dynamic cross feature fusion network (DCFNet) for pan-sharpening. Speciﬁcally, DCFNet contains multiple par-allel branches, including a high-resolution branch served as the backbone, and the low-resolution branches progres-sively supplemented into the backbone. Thus our DCFNet can represent the overall information well. In order to en-hance the relationships of inter-branches, dynamic cross feature transfers are embedded into multiple branches to obtain high-resolution representations. Then contextual-ized features will be learned to improve the fusion of in-formation. Experimental results indicate that DCFNet sig-niﬁcantly outperforms the prior arts in both quantitative in-dicators and visual qualities.
