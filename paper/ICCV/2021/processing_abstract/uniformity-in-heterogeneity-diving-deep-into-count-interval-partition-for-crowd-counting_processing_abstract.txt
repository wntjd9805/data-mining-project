Recently, the problem of inaccurate learning targets in crowd counting draws increasing attention. Inspired by a few pioneering work, we solve this problem by trying to predict the indices of pre-deﬁned interval bins of counts in-stead of the count values themselves. However, an inappro-priate interval setting might make the count error contribu-tions from different intervals extremely imbalanced, lead-ing to inferior counting performance. Therefore, we pro-pose a novel count interval partition criterion called Uni-form Error Partition (UEP), which always keeps the ex-pected counting error contributions equal for all intervals to minimize the prediction risk. Then to mitigate the in-evitably introduced discretization errors in the count quan-tization process, we propose another criterion called MeanCount Proxies (MCP). The MCP criterion selects the best count proxy for each interval to represent its count value during inference, making the overall expected discretiza-tion error of an image nearly negligible. As far as we are aware, this work is the ﬁrst to delve into such a classiﬁca-tion task and ends up with a promising solution for count interval partition. Following the above two theoretically demonstrated criterions, we propose a simple yet effec-tive model termed Uniform Error Partition Network (UEP-Net), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on sev-eral challenging datasets. The codes will be available at:TencentYoutuResearch/CrowdCounting-UEPNet.
