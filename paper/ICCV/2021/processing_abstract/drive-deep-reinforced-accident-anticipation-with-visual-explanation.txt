Traffic accident anticipation aims to accurately and promptly predict the occurrence of a future accident from dashcam videos, which is vital for a safety-guaranteedTo encourage an early and accu-self-driving system. rate decision, existing approaches typically focus on cap-turing the cues of spatial and temporal context before a future accident occurs. However, their decision-making lacks visual explanation and ignores the dynamic interac-tion with the environment. In this paper, we propose DeepReInforced accident anticipation with Visual Explanation, named DRIVE. The method simulates both the bottom-up and top-down visual attention mechanism in a dashcam ob-servation environment so that the decision from the pro-posed stochastic multi-task agent can be visually explained by attentive regions. Moreover, the proposed dense an-ticipation reward and sparse fixation reward are effective in training the DRIVE model with our improved reinforce-ment learning algorithm. Experimental results show that the DRIVE model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple real-world traffic accident datasets.
