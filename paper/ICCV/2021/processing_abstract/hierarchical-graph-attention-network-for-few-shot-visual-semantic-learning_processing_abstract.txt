Deep learning has made tremendous success in com-puter vision, natural language processing and even visual-semantic learning, which requires a huge amount of la-beled training data. Nevertheless, the goal of human-level intelligence is to enable a model to quickly obtain an in-depth understanding given a small number of sam-ples, especially with heterogeneity in the multi-modal sce-narios such as visual question answering and image cap-tioning. In this paper, we study the few-shot visual-semantic learning and present the Hierarchical Graph ATtention net-work (HGAT). This two-stage network models the intra- and inter-modal relationships with limited image-text samples.The main contributions of HGAT can be summarized as follows: 1) it sheds light on tackling few-shot multi-modal learning problems, which focuses primarily, but not exclu-sively on visual and semantic modalities, through better exploitation of the intra-relationship of each modality and an attention-based co-learning framework between modal-ities using a hierarchical graph-based architecture; 2) it achieves superior performance on both visual question an-swering and image captioning in the few-shot setting; 3) it can be easily extended to the semi-supervised setting where image-text samples are partially unlabeled. We show via extensive experiments that HGAT delivers state-of-the-art performance on three widely-used benchmarks of two visual-semantic learning tasks.
