In this paper we contribute a simple yet effective ap-proach for estimating 3D poses of multiple people from multi-view images. Our proposed coarse-to-fine pipeline first aggregates noisy 2D observations from multiple cam-era views into 3D space and then associates them into indi-vidual instances based on a confidence-aware majority vot-ing technique. The final pose estimates are attained from a novel optimization scheme which links high-confidence multi-view 2D observations and 3D joint candidates. More-over, a statistical parametric body model such as SMPL is leveraged as a regularizing prior for these 3D joint candi-dates. Specifically, both 3D poses and SMPL parameters are optimized jointly in an alternating fashion. Here the parametric models help in correcting implausible 3D pose estimates and filling in missing joint detections while up-dated 3D poses in turn guide obtaining better SMPL esti-mations. By linking 2D and 3D observations, our method is both accurate and generalizes to different data sources because it better decouples the final 3D pose from the inter-person constellation and is more robust to noisy 2D de-tections. We systematically evaluate our method on pub-lic datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance.
