The paper proposes a Dynamic ResBlock Generative Ad-versarial Network (DRB-GAN) for artistic style transfer.The style code is modeled as the shared parameters for Dy-namic ResBlocks connecting both the style encoding net-work and the style transfer network.In the style encod-ing network, a style class-aware attention mechanism is used to attend the style feature representation for gener-ating the style codes. In the style transfer network, multi-ple Dynamic ResBlocks are designed to integrate the style code and the extracted CNN semantic feature and then feed into the spatial window Layer-Instance Normalization (SW-LIN) decoder, which enables high-quality synthetic images with artistic style transfer. Moreover, the style collection conditional discriminator is designed to equip our DRB-GAN model with abilities for both arbitrary style trans-fer and collection style transfer during the training stage.No matter for arbitrary style transfer or collection style transfer, extensive experiments strongly demonstrate that our proposed DRB-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art meth-ods and exhibits its superior performance in terms of vi-sual quality and efÔ¨Åciency.
