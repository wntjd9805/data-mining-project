Recently, some approaches are proposed to harness deep convolutional networks to facilitate superpixel segmenta-tion. The common practice is to first evenly divide the image into a pre-defined number of grids and then learn to asso-ciate each pixel with its surrounding grids. However, sim-ply applying a series of convolution operations with lim-ited receptive fields can only implicitly perceive the rela-tions between the pixel and its surrounding grids. Con-sequently, existing methods often fail to provide an effec-tive context when inferring the association map. To rem-edy this issue, we propose a novel Association Implantation (AI) module to enable the network to explicitly capture the relations between the pixel and its surrounding grids.The proposed AI module directly implants the grid fea-tures to the surrounding of its corresponding central pixel, and conducts convolution on the padded window to adap-tively transfer knowledge between them. With such an im-plantation operation, the network could explicitly harvest the pixel-grid level context, which is more in line with the target of superpixel segmentation comparing to the pixel-wise relation. Furthermore, to pursue better boundary pre-cision, we design a boundary-perceiving loss to help the network discriminate the pixels around boundaries in hid-den feature level, which could benefit the subsequent infer-ring modules to accurately identify more boundary pixels.Extensive experiments on BSDS500 and NYUv2 datasets show that our method could achieve state-of-the-art per-formance.
