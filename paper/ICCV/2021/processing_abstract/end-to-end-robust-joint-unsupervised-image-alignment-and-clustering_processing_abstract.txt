Computing dense pixel-to-pixel image correspondences is a fundamental task of computer vision. Often, the objec-tive is to align image pairs from the same semantic cate-gory for manipulation or segmentation purposes. Despite achieving superior performance, existing deep learning alignment methods cannot cluster images; consequently, clustering and pairing images needed to be a separate la-borious and expensive step.Given a dataset with diverse semantic categories, we that can directly propose a multi-task model, Jim-Net, learn to cluster and align images without any pixel-level or image-level annotations. We design a pair-matching alignment unsupervised training algorithm that selectively matches and aligns image pairs from the clustering branch.Our unsupervised Jim-Net achieves comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art supervised methods on benchmark 2D image alignment dataset PF-PASCAL. Specifically, we ap-ply Jim-Net to cryo-electron tomography, a revolutionary 3D microscopy imaging technique of native subcellular structures. After extensive evaluation on seven datasets, we demonstrate that Jim-Net enables systematic discovery and recovery of representative macromolecular structures in situ, which is essential for revealing molecular mechanisms underlying cellular functions. To our knowledge, Jim-Net is the first end-to-end model that can simultaneously align and cluster images, which significantly improves the perfor-mance as compared to performing each task alone.
