Due to the stochasticity of human behaviors, predict-ing the future trajectories of road agents is challenging for autonomous driving. Recently, goal-based multi-trajectory prediction methods are proved to be effective, where theyﬁrst score over-sampled goal candidates and then select a ﬁnal set from them. However, these methods usually in-volve goal predictions based on sparse pre-deﬁned anchors and heuristic goal selection algorithms. In this work, we propose an anchor-free and end-to-end trajectory predic-tion model, named DenseTNT, that directly outputs a set of trajectories from dense goal candidates.In addition, we introduce an ofﬂine optimization-based technique to pro-vide multi-future pseudo-labels for our ﬁnal online model.Experiments show that DenseTNT achieves state-of-the-art performance, ranking 1st on the Argoverse motion forecast-ing benchmark and being the 1st place winner of the 2021Waymo Open Dataset Motion Prediction Challenge.
