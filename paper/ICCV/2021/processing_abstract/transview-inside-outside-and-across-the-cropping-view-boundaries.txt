We show that relation modeling between visual elements matters in cropping view recommendation. Cropping view recommendation addresses the problem of image recompo-sition conditioned on the composition quality and the rank-ing of views (cropped sub-regions). This task is challeng-ing because the visual difference is subtle when a visual element is reserved or removed. Existing methods repre-sent visual elements by extracting region-based convolu-tional features inside and outside the cropping view bound-aries, without probing a fundamental question: why some visual elements are of interest or of discard? In this work, we observe that the relation between different visual ele-ments significantly affects their relative positions to the de-sired cropping view, and such relation can be characterized by the attraction inside/outside the cropping view bound-aries and the repulsion across the boundaries. By instan-tiating a transformer-based solution that represents visual elements as visual words and that models the dependen-cies between visual words, we report not only state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks, but also interesting visualizations that depict the attraction and repulsion be-tween visual elements, which may shed light on what makes for effective cropping view recommendation.
