Learning socially-aware motion representations is at the core of recent advances in multi-agent problems, such as human motion forecasting and robot navigation in crowds. Despite promising progress, existing representa-tions learned with neural networks still struggle to general-ize in closed-loop predictions (e.g., output colliding trajec-tories). This issue largely arises from the non-i.i.d. nature of sequential prediction in conjunction with ill-distributed training data. Intuitively, if the training data only comes from human behaviors in safe spaces, i.e., from “positive” examples, it is difficult for learning algorithms to capture the notion of “negative” examples like collisions. In this work, we aim to address this issue by explicitly modeling negative examples through self-supervision: (i) we intro-duce a social contrastive loss that regularizes the extracted motion representation by discerning the ground-truth posi-tive events from synthetic negative ones; (ii) we construct informative negative samples based on our prior knowl-edge of rare but dangerous circumstances. Our method substantially reduces the collision rates of recent trajectory forecasting, behavioral cloning and reinforcement learn-ing algorithms, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks.
