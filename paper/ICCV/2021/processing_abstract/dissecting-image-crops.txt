The elementary operation of cropping underpins nearly every computer vision system, ranging from data augmen-tation and translation invariance to computational photog-raphy and representation learning. This paper investigates the subtle traces introduced by this operation. For exam-ple, despite reÔ¨Ånements to camera optics, lenses will leave behind certain clues, notably chromatic aberration and vi-gnetting. Photographers also leave behind other clues re-lating to image aesthetics and scene composition. We study how to detect these traces, and investigate the impact that cropping has on the image distribution. While our aim is to dissect the fundamental impact of spatial crops, there are also a number of practical implications to our work, such as revealing faulty photojournalism and equipping neural network researchers with a better understanding of short-cut learning.
