Video instance segmentation is a challenging task that extends image instance segmentation to the video domain.Existing methods either rely only on single-frame informa-tion for the detection and segmentation subproblems or han-dle tracking as a separate post-processing step, which limit their capability to fully leverage and share useful spatial-temporal information for all the subproblems. In this pa-per, we propose a novel graph-neural-network (GNN) based method to handle the aforementioned limitation. Speciﬁ-cally, graph nodes representing instance features are used for detection and segmentation while graph edges repre-senting instance relations are used for tracking. Both in-ter and intra-frame information is effectively propagated and shared via graph updates and all the subproblems (i.e. detection, segmentation and tracking) are jointly op-timized in an uniﬁed framework. The performance of our method shows great improvement on the YoutubeVIS vali-dation dataset compared to existing methods and achieves 36.5% AP with a ResNet-50 backbone, operating at 22 FPS.
