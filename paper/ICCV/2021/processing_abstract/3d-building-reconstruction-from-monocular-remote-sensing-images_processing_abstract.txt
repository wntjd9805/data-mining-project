3D building reconstruction from monocular remote sens-ing imagery is an important research problem and an eco-nomic solution to large-scale city modeling, compared with reconstruction from LiDAR data and multi-view imagery.However, several challenges such as the partial invisibil-ity of building footprints and facades, the serious shadow effect, and the extreme variance of building height in large-scale areas, have restricted the existing monocular image based building reconstruction studies to certain application scenes, i.e., modeling simple low-rise buildings from near-nadir images. In this study, we propose a novel 3D building reconstruction method for monocular remote sensing im-ages, which tackles the above difﬁculties, thus providing an appealing solution for more complicated scenarios. We de-sign a multi-task building reconstruction network, namedMTBR-Net, to learn the geometric property of oblique im-ages, the key components of a 3D building model and their relations via four semantic-related and three offset-related tasks. The network outputs are further integrated by a prior knowledge based 3D model optimization method to produce the the ﬁnal 3D building models. Results on a public 3D reconstruction dataset and a novel released dataset demon-strate that our method improves the height estimation per-formance by over 40% and the segmentation F1-score by 2% - 4% compared with current state-of-the-art.
