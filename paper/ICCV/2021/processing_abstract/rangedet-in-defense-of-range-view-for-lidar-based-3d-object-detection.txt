In this paper, we propose an anchor-free single-stageLiDAR-based 3D object detector – RangeDet. The most no-table difference with previous works is that our method is purely based on the range view representation. Compared with the commonly used voxelized or Bird’s Eye View (BEV) representations, the range view representation is more com-pact and without quantization error. Although there are works adopting it for semantic segmentation, its perfor-mance in object detection is largely behind voxelized orBEV counterparts. We ﬁrst analyze the existing range-view-based methods and ﬁnd two issues overlooked by previ-ous works: 1) the scale variation between nearby and far away objects; 2) the inconsistency between the 2D range image coordinates used in feature extraction and the 3DCartesian coordinates used in output. Then we deliber-ately design three components to address these issues in our RangeDet. We test our RangeDet in the large-scaleWaymo Open Dataset (WOD). Our best model achieves 72.9/75.9/65.8 3D AP on vehicle/pedestrian/cyclist. These results outperform other range-view-based methods by a large margin, and are overall comparable with the state-of-the-art multi-view-based methods. Codes will be released at https://github.com/TuSimple/RangeDet.
