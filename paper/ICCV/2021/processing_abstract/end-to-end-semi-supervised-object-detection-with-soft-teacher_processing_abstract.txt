This paper presents an end-to-end semi-supervised ob-ject detection approach, in contrast to previous more com-plex multi-stage methods. The end-to-end training grad-ually improves pseudo label qualities during the curricu-lum, and the more and more accurate pseudo labels in turn benefit object detection training. We also propose two sim-ple yet effective techniques within this framework: a soft teacher mechanism where the classification loss of each un-labeled bounding box is weighed by the classification score produced by the teacher network; a box jittering approach to select reliable pseudo boxes for the learning of box re-gression. On the COCO benchmark, the proposed approach outperforms previous methods by a large margin under var-ious labeling ratios, i.e. 1%, 5% and 10%. Moreover, our approach proves to perform also well when the amount of labeled data is relatively large. For example, it can improve a 40.9 mAP baseline detector trained using the full COCO training set by +3.6 mAP, reaching 44.5 mAP, by leverag-ing the 123K unlabeled images of COCO. On the state-of-the-art Swin Transformer based object detector (58.9 mAP on test-dev), it can still significantly improve the detection accuracy by +1.5 mAP, reaching 60.4 mAP, and improve the instance segmentation accuracy by +1.2 mAP, reaching 52.4 mAP. Further incorporating with the Object365 pre-trained model, the detection accuracy reaches 61.3 mAP and the instance segmentation accuracy reaches 53.0 mAP, pushing the new state-of-the-art. The code and models will be made publicly available at https://github.com/ microsoft/SoftTeacher.
