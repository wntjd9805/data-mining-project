We propose a new approach to detect atypicality in per-suasive imagery. Unlike atypicality which has been stud-ied in prior work, persuasive atypicality has a particular purpose to convey meaning, and relies on understanding the common-sense spatial relations of objects. We propose a self-supervised attention-based technique which captures contextual compatibility, and models spatial relations in a precise manner. We further experiment with capturing com-mon sense through the semantics of co-occurring object classes. We verify our approach on a dataset of atypicality in visual advertisements, as well as a second dataset cap-turing atypicality that has no persuasive intent.
