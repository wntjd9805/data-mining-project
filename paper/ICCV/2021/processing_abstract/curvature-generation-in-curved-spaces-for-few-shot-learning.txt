Few-shot learning describes the challenging problem of recognizing samples from unseen classes given very few la-beled examples. In many cases, few-shot learning is cast as learning an embedding space that assigns test samples to their corresponding class prototypes. Previous meth-ods assume that data of all few-shot learning tasks com-ply with a ﬁxed geometrical structure, mostly a Euclidean structure. Questioning this assumption that is clearly difﬁ-cult to hold in real-world scenarios and incurs distortions to data, we propose to learn a task-aware curved embedding space by making use of the hyperbolic geometry. As a re-sult, task-speciﬁc embedding spaces where suitable curva-tures are generated to match the characteristics of data are constructed, leading to more generic embedding spaces. We then leverage on intra-class and inter-class context infor-mation in the embedding space to generate class prototypes for discriminative classiﬁcation. We conduct a comprehen-sive set of experiments on inductive and transductive few-shot learning, demonstrating the beneﬁts of our proposed method over existing embedding methods.
