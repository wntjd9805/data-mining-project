yNormalizing flows have recently demonstrated promis-ing results for low-level vision tasks. For image super-resolution (SR), it learns to predict diverse photo-realistic high-resolution (HR) images from the low-resolution (LR) image rather than learning a deterministic mapping. For image rescaling, it achieves high accuracy by jointly mod-elling the downscaling and upscaling processes. While ex-isting approaches employ specialized techniques for these two tasks, we set out to unify them in a single formula-In this paper, we propose the hierarchical condi-tion. tional flow (HCFlow) as a unified framework for image SR and image rescaling. More specifically, HCFlow learns a bijective mapping between HR and LR image pairs by modelling the distribution of the LR image and the rest high-frequency component simultaneously.In particular, the high-frequency component is conditional on the LR im-age in a hierarchical manner. To further enhance the per-formance, other losses such as perceptual loss and GAN loss are combined with the commonly used negative log-likelihood loss in training. Extensive experiments on gen-eral image SR, face image SR and image rescaling have demonstrated that the proposed HCFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both quantitative metrics and visual quality.
