Recent strategies achieved ensembling “for free” by fit-ting concurrently diverse subnetworks inside a single base network. The main idea during training is that each sub-network learns to classify only one of the multiple inputs simultaneously provided. However, the question of how to best mix these multiple inputs has not been studied so far.In this paper, we introduce MixMo, a new generalized framework for learning multi-input multi-output deep sub-networks. Our key motivation is to replace the subopti-mal summing operation hidden in previous approaches by a more appropriate mixing mechanism. For that purpose, we draw inspiration from successful mixed sample data aug-mentations. We show that binary mixing in features - par-ticularly with rectangular patches from CutMix - enhances results by making subnetworks stronger and more diverse.We improve state of the art for image classification onCIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets. Our easy to im-plement models notably outperform data augmented deep ensembles, without the inference and memory overheads.As we operate in features and simply better leverage the expressiveness of large networks, we open a new line of re-search complementary to previous works.
