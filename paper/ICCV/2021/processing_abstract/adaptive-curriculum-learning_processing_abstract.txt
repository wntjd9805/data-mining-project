Inspired by the human learning principle that learning easier concepts ﬁrst and then gradually paying more at-tention to harder ones, curriculum learning uses the non-uniform sampling of mini-batches according to the order of examples’ difﬁculty. Just as a teacher adjusts the curricu-lum according to the learning progress of each student, a proper curriculum should be adapted to the current state of the model. Therefore, in contrast to recent works us-ing a ﬁxed curriculum, we devise a new curriculum learn-ing method, Adaptive Curriculum Learning (Adaptive CL), adapting the difﬁculty of examples to the current state of the model. Speciﬁcally, we make use of the loss of the current model to adjust the difﬁculty score while retaining previ-ous useful learned knowledge by KL divergence. Moreover, under a non-linear model and binary classiﬁcation, we the-oretically prove that the expected convergence rate of cur-riculum learning monotonically decreases with respect to the loss of a point regarding the optimal hypothesis, and monotonically increases with respect to the loss of a point regarding the current hypothesis. The analyses indicate thatAdaptive CL could improve the convergence properties dur-ing the early stages of learning. Extensive experimental re-sults demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over existing competitive curriculum learning methods.
