We tackle data-driven 3D point cloud registration. Given point correspondences, the standard Kabsch algorithm pro-vides an optimal rotation estimate. This allows to train registration models in an end-to-end manner by differen-tiating the SVD operation. However, given the initial rota-tion estimate supplied by Kabsch, we show we can improve point correspondence learning during model training by ex-tending the original optimization problem.In particular, we linearize the governing constraints of the rotation ma-trix and solve the resulting linear system of equations. We then iteratively produce new solutions by updating the ini-tial estimate. Our experiments show that, by plugging our differentiable layer to existing learning-based registration methods, we improve the correspondence matching qual-ity. This yields up to a 7% decrease in rotation error for correspondence-based data-driven registration methods.
