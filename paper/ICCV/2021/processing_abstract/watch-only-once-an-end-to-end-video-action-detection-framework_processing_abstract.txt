We propose an end-to-end pipeline, named Watch OnceOnly (WOO), for video action detection. Current meth-ods either decouple video action detection task into sep-arated stages of actor localization and action classifica-tion or train two separated models within one stage.In contrast, our approach solves the actor localization and action classification simultaneously in a unified network.The whole pipeline is significantly simplified by unifying the backbone network and eliminating many hand-crafted components. WOO takes a unified video backbone to si-multaneously extract features for actor location and action classification.In addition, we introduce spatial-temporal action embeddings into our framework and design a spatial-temporal fusion module to obtain more discriminative fea-tures with richer information, which further boosts the ac-tion classification performance. Extensive experiments onAVA and JHMDB datasets show that WOO achieves state-of-the-art performance, while still reduces up to 16.7%GFLOPs compared with existing methods. We hope our work can inspire re-thinking the convention of action de-tection and serve as a solid baseline for end-to-end action detection. Code is available at https://github.com/ShoufaChen/WOO.
