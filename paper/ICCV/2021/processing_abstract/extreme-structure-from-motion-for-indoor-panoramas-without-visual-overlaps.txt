This paper proposes an extreme Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm for residential indoor panoramas that have little to no visual overlaps. Only a single panorama is present in a room for many cases, making the task infeasible for existing SfM algorithms. Our idea is to learn to evaluate the realism of room/door/window arrangements in the top-down semantic space. After using heuristics to enumerate possible arrangements based on door detections, we eval-uate their realism scores, pick the most realistic arrange-ment, and return the corresponding camera poses. We eval-uate the proposed approach on a dataset of 1029 panorama images with 286 houses. Our qualitative and quantita-tive evaluations show that an existing SfM approach com-pletely fails for most of the houses. The proposed approach achieves the mean positional error of less than 1.0 meter for 47% of the houses and even 78% when considering the top five reconstructions. We will share the code and data in https://github.com/aminshabani/extreme-indoor-sfm.
