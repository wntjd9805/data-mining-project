Deep learning for image and video compression has demonstrated promising results both as a standalone tech-nology and a hybrid combination with existing codecs.However, these systems still come with high computational costs. Deep learning models are typically applied directly in pixel space, making them expensive when resolutions be-come large.In this work, we propose an online-trained upsampler to augment an existing codec. The upsampler is a small neural network trained on an isolated group of frames. Its param-eters are signalled to the decoder. This hybrid solution has a small scope of only 10s or 100s of frames and allows for a low complexity both on the encoding and the decoding side.Our algorithm works in ofï¬‚ine and in zero-latency set-tings. Our evaluation employs the popular x265 codec on several high-resolution datasets ranging from Full HD to 8K. We demonstrate rate savings between 8.6% and 27.5% and provide ablation studies to show the impact of our de-sign decisions.In comparison to similar works, our ap-proach performs favourably.Conventional CodecsHand-tuningOnline-trained Upsampler (this work)Motion VectorsFrame-Level FiltersScopeLearned CodecsSequence DatasetsMachine Learning 100s of Frames 10s of FramesSeveral FramesSingle Frame (Optical) FlowBlockwiseTransformBlock orRecep.
