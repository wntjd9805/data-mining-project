Shape analysis has been playing an important role in early diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative dis-eases such as Alzheimer’s diseases (AD). However, ob-taining effective shape representations remains challeng-ing. This paper proposes to use the Alexandrov polyhedra as surface-based shape signatures for cortical morphome-try analysis. Given a closed genus-0 surface, its Alexan-drov polyhedron is a convex representation that encodes its intrinsic geometry information. We propose to com-pute the polyhedra via a novel spherical optimal trans-In our experiments, we observe port (OT) computation. that the Alexandrov polyhedra of cortical surfaces between pathology-conﬁrmed AD and cognitively unimpaired indi-viduals are signiﬁcantly different. Moreover, we propose a visualization method by comparing local geometry differ-ences across cortical surfaces. We show that the proposed method is effective in pinpointing regional cortical struc-tural changes impacted by AD.
