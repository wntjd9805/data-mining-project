Synchronization refers to the problem of inferring the un-known values attached to vertices of a graph where edges are labelled with the ratio of the incident vertices, and labels belong to a group. This paper addresses the syn-chronization problem on multi-graphs, that are graphs with more than one edge connecting the same pair of nodes. The problem naturally arises when multiple measures are avail-able to model the relationship between two vertices. This happens when different sensors measure the same quantity, or when the original graph is partitioned into sub-graphs that are solved independently. In this case, the relationships among sub-graphs give rise to multi-edges and the prob-lem can be traced back to a multi-graph synchronization.The baseline solution reduces multi-graphs to simple ones by averaging their multi-edges, however this approach falls short because: i) averaging is well defined only for some groups and ii) the resulting estimator is less precise and accurate, as we prove empirically. Specifically, we presentMULTISYNC, a synchronization algorithm for multi-graphs that is based on a principled constrained eigenvalue opti-mization. MULTISYNC is a general solution that can cope with any linear group and we show to be profitably usable both on synthetic and real problems.
