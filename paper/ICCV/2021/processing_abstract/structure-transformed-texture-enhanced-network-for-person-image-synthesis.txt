Pose-guided virtual try-on task aims to modify the fash-ion item based on pose transfer task. These two tasks that belong to person image synthesis have strong corre-lations and similarities. However, existing methods treat them as two individual tasks and do not explore correla-tions between them. Moreover, these two tasks are chal-lenging due to large misalignment and occlusions, thus most of these methods are prone to generate unclear hu-man body structure and blurry Ô¨Åne-grained textures. In this paper, we devise a structure-transformed texture-enhanced network to generate high-quality person images and con-It consists of struct the relationships between two tasks. two modules: structure-transformed renderer and texture-enhanced stylizer. The structure-transformed renderer is introduced to transform the source person structure to the target one, while the texture-enhanced stylizer is served to enhance detailed textures and controllably inject the fash-ion style founded on the structural transformation. With the two modules, our model can generate photorealistic per-son images in diverse poses and even with various fash-ion styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ap-proach achieves state-of-the-art results on two tasks.
