Research in media forensics has gained traction to com-bat the spread of misinformation. However, most of this research has been directed towards content generated on social media. Biomedical image forensics is a related prob-lem, where manipulation or misuse of images reported in biomedical research documents is of serious concern. The problem has failed to gain momentum beyond an academic discussion due to an absence of benchmark datasets andIn this paper we present BioFors1 – standardized tasks. the ﬁrst dataset for benchmarking common biomedical im-age manipulations. BioFors comprises 47,805 images ex-Images tracted from 1,031 open-source research papers. in BioFors are divided into four categories – Microscopy,Blot/Gel, FACS and Macroscopy. We also propose three tasks for forensic analysis – external duplication detection, internal duplication detection and cut/sharp-transition de-tection. We benchmark BioFors on all tasks with suitable state-of-the-art algorithms. Our results and analysis show that existing algorithms developed on common computer vi-sion datasets are not robust when applied to biomedical im-ages, validating that more research is required to address the unique challenges of biomedical image forensics.
