The instance discrimination paradigm has become dom-inant in unsupervised learning. It always adopts a teacher-student framework, in which the teacher provides embed-ded knowledge as a supervision signal for the student. The student learns meaningful representations by enforcing in-stance spatial consistency with the views from the teacher.However, the outputs of the teacher can vary dramatically on the same instance during different training stages, in-troducing unexpected noise and leading to catastrophic for-getting caused by inconsistent objectives. In this paper, we first integrate instance temporal consistency into current instance discrimination paradigms, and propose a novel and strong algorithm named Temporal Knowledge Consis-tency (TKC). Specifically, our TKC dynamically ensembles the knowledge of temporal teachers and adaptively selects useful information according to its importance to learning instance temporal consistency. Experimental result shows that TKC can learn better visual representations on bothResNet and AlexNet on linear evaluation protocol while transfer well to downstream tasks. All experiments suggest the good effectiveness and generalization of our method.Code will be made available.Figure 1. Mainstream unsupervised methods adopt the teacher-student framework, where the teacher is an EMA ensemble of pre-vious student encoders. This figure illustrates the proportion of previous students in the teacher with respect to training steps. The red curve shows that the EMA teacher ensembles the previous en-coders by a predesigned factor α, where only alomst encoders in the very close steps are ensembled. Our TKC (the green curve) reuses the early models and adaptively learns the importance ω for each of them, thus leads to temporal consistent representations.
