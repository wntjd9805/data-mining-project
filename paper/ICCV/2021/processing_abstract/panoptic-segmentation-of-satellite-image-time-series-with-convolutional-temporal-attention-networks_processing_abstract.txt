Unprecedented access to multi-temporal satellite im-agery has opened new perspectives for a variety of Earth observation tasks. Among them, pixel-precise panoptic seg-mentation of agricultural parcels has major economic and environmental implications. While researchers have ex-plored this problem for single images, we argue that the complex temporal patterns of crop phenology are better ad-dressed with temporal sequences of images.In this pa-per, we present the first end-to-end, single-stage method for panoptic segmentation of Satellite Image Time Series (SITS). This module can be combined with our novel image sequence encoding network which relies on temporal self-attention to extract rich and adaptive multi-scale spatio-temporal features. We also introduce PASTIS, the first open-access SITS dataset with panoptic annotations. We demon-strate the superiority of our encoder for semantic segmen-tation against multiple competing architectures, and set up the first state-of-the-art of panoptic segmentation of SITS.Our implementation and PASTIS are publicly available.
