Self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised fine-tuning has seen success in image recognition, especially when labeled examples are scarce, but has received lim-ited attention in medical image analysis. This paper stud-ies the effectiveness of self-supervised learning as a pre-training strategy for medical image classification. We con-duct experiments on two distinct tasks: dermatology con-dition classification from digital camera images and multi-label chest X-ray classification, and demonstrate that self-supervised learning on ImageNet, followed by additional self-supervised learning on unlabeled domain-specific med-ical images significantly improves the accuracy of medical image classifiers. We introduce a novel Multi-Instance Con-trastive Learning (MICLe) method that uses multiple im-ages of the underlying pathology per patient case, when available, to construct more informative positive pairs for self-supervised learning. Combining our contributions, we achieve an improvement of 6.7% in top-1 accuracy and an improvement of 1.1% in mean AUC on dermatology and chest X-ray classification respectively, outperforming strong supervised baselines pretrained on ImageNet. In ad-dition, we show that big self-supervised models are robust to distribution shift and can learn efficiently with a small number of labeled medical images.
