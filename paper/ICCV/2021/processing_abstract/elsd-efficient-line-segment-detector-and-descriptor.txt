We present the novel Efficient Line Segment Detector andDescriptor (ELSD) to simultaneously detect line segments and extract their descriptors in an image. Unlike the tradi-tional pipelines that conduct detection and description sep-arately, ELSD utilizes a shared feature extractor for both detection and description, to provide the essential line fea-tures to the higher-level tasks like SLAM and image match-ing in real time. First, we design a one-stage compact model, and propose to use the mid-point, angle and length as the minimal representation of line segment, which also guarantees the center-symmetry. The non-centerness sup-pression is proposed to filter out the fragmented line seg-ments caused by linesâ€™ intersections. The fine offset predic-tion is designed to refine the mid-point localization. Sec-ond, the line descriptor branch is integrated with the detec-tor branch, and the two branches are jointly trained in an end-to-end manner. In the experiments, the proposed ELSD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the Wireframe dataset and YorkUrban dataset, in both accuracy and effi-ciency. The line description ability of ELSD also outper-forms the previous works on the line matching task.
