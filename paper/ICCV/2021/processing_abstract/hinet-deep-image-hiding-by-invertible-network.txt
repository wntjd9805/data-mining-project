Image hiding aims to hide a secret image into a cover image in an imperceptible way, and then recover the secret image perfectly at the receiver end. Capacity, invisibility and security are three primary challenges in image hiding task. This paper proposes a novel invertible neural network (INN) based framework, HiNet, to simultaneously overcome the three challenges in image hiding. For large capacity, we propose an inverse learning mechanism by simultaneously learning the image concealing and revealing processes. Our method is able to achieve the concealing of a full-size secret image into a cover image with the same size. For high invis-ibility, instead of pixel domain hiding, we propose to hide the secret information in wavelet domain. Furthermore, we propose a new low-frequency wavelet loss to constrain that secret information is hidden in high-frequency wavelet sub-bands, which signiﬁcantly improves the hiding security. Ex-perimental results show that our HiNet signiﬁcantly outper-forms other state-of-the-art image hiding methods, with more than 10 dB PSNR improvement in secret image recovery onImageNet, COCO and DIV2K datasets.
