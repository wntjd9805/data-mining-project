Reconstructing delicate geometric details with consumerRGB-D sensors is challenging due to sensor depth and poses uncertainties. To tackle this problem, we propose a unique geometry-guided fusion framework: 1) First, we characterize fusion correspondences with the geodesic curves derived from the mass transport problem, also known as the Monge-Kantorovich problem. Compared with the depth map back-projection methods, the geodesic curves reveal the geometric structures of the local surface. 2) Mov-ing the points along the geodesic curves is the core of our fusion approach, guided by local geometric properties, i.e.,Gaussian curvature and mean curvature. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our novel geometry-guided displacement interpolation fully utilizes the meaningful ge-ometric features of the local surface. It makes the recon-struction accuracy and completeness improved. Finally, a significant number of experimental results on real ob-ject data verify the superior performance of the proposed method. Our technique achieves the most delicate geomet-ric details on thin objects for which the original depth map back-projection fusion scheme suffers from severe artifacts (See Fig.1).
