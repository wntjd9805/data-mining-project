This presentation addresses the problem of reconstruct-ing a high-resolution image from multiple lower-resolution snapshots captured from slightly different viewpoints in space and time. Key challenges for solving this super-resolution problem include (i) aligning the input pictures with sub-pixel accuracy, (ii) handling raw (noisy) images for maximal faithfulness to native camera data, and (iii) designing/learning an image prior (regularizer) well suited to the task. We address these three challenges with a hy-brid algorithm building on the insight from [45] that alias-ing is an ally in this setting, with parameters that can be learned end to end, while retaining the interpretability of classical approaches to inverse problems. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on synthetic and real im-age bursts, setting a new state of the art on several bench-marks and delivering excellent qualitative results on real raw bursts captured by smartphones and prosumer cam-eras.
