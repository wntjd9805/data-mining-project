We present a novel semi-supervised semantic segmenta-tion method which jointly achieves two desiderata of seg-mentation model regularities: the label-space consistency property between image augmentations and the feature-space contrastive property among different pixels. We lever-age the pixel-level â„“2 loss and the pixel contrastive loss for the two purposes respectively. To address the compu-tational efficiency issue and the false negative noise issue involved in the pixel contrastive loss, we further introduce and investigate several negative sampling techniques. Ex-tensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art perfor-mance of our method (PC2Seg) with the DeepLab-v3+ ar-chitecture, in several challenging semi-supervised settings derived from the VOC, Cityscapes, and COCO datasets.
