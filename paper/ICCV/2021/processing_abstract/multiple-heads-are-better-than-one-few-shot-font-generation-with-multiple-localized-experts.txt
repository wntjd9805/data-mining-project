A few-shot font generation (FFG) method has to sat-isfy two objectives: the generated images should preserve the underlying global structure of the target character and present the diverse local reference style. Existing FFG methods aim to disentangle content and style either by ex-tracting a universal representation style or extracting mul-tiple component-wise style representations. However, pre-vious methods either fail to capture diverse local styles or cannot be generalized to a character with unseen compo-nents, e.g., unseen language systems. To mitigate the is-sues, we propose a novel FFG method, named Multiple Lo-calized Experts Few-shot Font Generation Network (MX-Font). MX-Font extracts multiple style features not explic-itly conditioned on component labels, but automatically by multiple experts to represent different local concepts, e.g., left-side sub-glyph. Owing to the multiple experts, MX-Font can capture diverse local concepts and show the general-izability to unseen languages. During training, we utilize component labels as weak supervision to guide each ex-pert to be specialized for different local concepts. We for-mulate the component assign problem to each expert as the graph matching problem, and solve it by the Hungar-ian algorithm. We also employ the independence loss and the content-style adversarial loss to impose the content-style disentanglement. In our experiments, MX-Font outper-forms previous state-of-the-art FFG methods in the Chinese generation and cross-lingual, e.g., Chinese to Korean, gen-eration.
