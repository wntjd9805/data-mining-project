With the development of computational power and tech-niques for data collection, deep learning demonstrates a superior performance over most existing algorithms on vi-sual benchmark data sets. Many efforts have been devoted to studying the mechanism of deep learning. One impor-tant observation is that deep learning can learn the dis-criminative patterns from raw materials directly in a task-dependent manner. Therefore, the representations obtained by deep learning outperform hand-crafted features signifi-cantly. However, for some real-world applications, it is too expensive to collect the task-specific labels, such as visual search in online shopping. Compared to the limited avail-ability of these task-specific labels, their coarse-class labels are much more affordable, but representations learned from them can be suboptimal for the target task. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an algorithm to learn the fine-grained patterns for the target task, when only its coarse-class labels are available. More importantly, we provide a theoretical guarantee for this. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of learned repre-sentations on the target task, when only coarse-class infor-mation is available for training.
