Frame sampling is a fundamental problem in video ac-tion recognition due to the essential redundancy in time and limited computation resources. The existing sampling strategy often employs a ﬁxed frame selection and lacks the ﬂexibility to deal with complex variations in videos.In this paper, we present a simple, sparse, and explain-able frame sampler, termed as Motion-Guided Sampler (MGSampler). Our basic motivation is that motion is an important and universal signal that can drive us to adap-tively select frames from videos. Accordingly, we propose two important properties in our MGSampler design: mo-tion sensitive and motion uniform. First, we present two different motion representations to enable us to efﬁciently distinguish the motion-salient frames from the background.Then, we devise a motion-uniform sampling strategy based on the cumulative motion distribution to ensure the sam-pled frames evenly cover all the important segments with high motion salience. Our MGSampler yields a new prin-cipled and holistic sampling scheme, that could be in-corporated into any existing video architecture. Experi-ments on ﬁve benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our MGSampler over the previous ﬁxed sampling strate-gies, and its generalization power across different back-bones, video models, and datasets.
