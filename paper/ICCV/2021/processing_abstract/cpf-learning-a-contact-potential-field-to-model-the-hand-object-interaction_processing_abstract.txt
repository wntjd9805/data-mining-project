Modeling the hand-object (HO) interaction not only re-quires estimation of the HO pose, but also pays attention to the contact due to their interaction. Significant progress has been made in estimating hand and object separately with deep learning methods, simultaneous HO pose estimation and contact modeling has not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we present an explicit contact representation namelyContact Potential Field (CPF), and a learning-fitting hy-brid framework namely MIHO to Modeling the Interaction of Hand and Object. In CPF, we treat each contacting HO vertex pair as a spring-mass system. Hence the whole sys-tem forms a potential field with minimal elastic energy at the grasp position. Extensive experiments on the two com-monly used benchmarks have demonstrated that our method can achieve state-of-the-art in several reconstruction met-rics, and allow us to produce more physically plausibleHO pose even when the ground-truth exhibits severe in-terpenetration or disjointedness.
