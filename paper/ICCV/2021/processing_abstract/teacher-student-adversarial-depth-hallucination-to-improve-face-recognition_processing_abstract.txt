We present the Teacher-Student Generative AdversarialNetwork (TS-GAN) to generate depth images from singleRGB images in order to boost the performance of face recognition systems. For our method to generalize well across unseen datasets, we design two components in the architecture, a teacher and a student. The teacher, which itself consists of a generator and a discriminator, learns a latent mapping between input RGB and paired depth im-ages in a supervised fashion. The student, which consists of two generators (one shared with the teacher) and a discrim-inator, learns from new RGB data with no available paired depth information, for improved generalization. The fully trained shared generator can then be used in runtime to hal-lucinate depth from RGB for downstream applications such as face recognition. We perform rigorous experiments to show the superiority of TS-GAN over other methods in gen-erating synthetic depth images. Moreover, face recognition experiments demonstrate that our hallucinated depth along with the input RGB images boost performance across vari-ous architectures when compared to a single RGB modality by average values of +1.2%, +2.6%, and +2.6% for IIIT-D, EURECOM, and LFW datasets respectively. We make our implementation public at: https://github.com/hardik-uppal/teacher-student-gan.git.
