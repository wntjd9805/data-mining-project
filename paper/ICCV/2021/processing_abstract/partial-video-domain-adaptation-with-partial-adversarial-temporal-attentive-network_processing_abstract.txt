Partial Domain Adaptation (PDA) is a practical and general domain adaptation scenario, which relaxes the fully shared label space assumption such that the source la-bel space subsumes the target one. The key challenge ofPDA is the issue of negative transfer caused by source-only classes. For videos, such negative transfer could be trig-gered by both spatial and temporal features, which leads to a more challenging Partial Video Domain Adaptation (PVDA) problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Par-tial Adversarial Temporal Attentive Network (PATAN) to address the PVDA problem by utilizing both spatial and temporal features for filtering source-only classes. Besides,PATAN constructs effective overall temporal features by at-tending to local temporal features that contribute more to-ward the class filtration process. We further introduce new benchmarks to facilitate research on PVDA problems, cov-ering a wide range of PVDA scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our pro-posed PATAN across the multiple PVDA benchmarks. Code will be provided at: https://github.com/xuyu0010/PATAN.
