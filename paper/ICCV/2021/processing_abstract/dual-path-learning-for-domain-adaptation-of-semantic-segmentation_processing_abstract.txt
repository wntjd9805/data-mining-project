Domain adaptation for semantic segmentation enables to alleviate the need for large-scale pixel-wise annotations.Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) with a combina-tion of image-to-image translation shows great effectiveness in adaptive segmentation. The most common practice is to perform SSL along with image translation to well align a single domain (the source or target). However, in this single-domain paradigm, unavoidable visual inconsistency raised by image translation may affect subsequent learn-ing. In this paper, based on the observation that domain adaptation frameworks performed in the source and tar-get domain are almost complementary in terms of image translation and SSL, we propose a novel dual path learning (DPL) framework to alleviate visual inconsistency. Con-cretely, DPL contains two complementary and interactive single-domain adaptation pipelines aligned in source and target domain respectively. The inference of DPL is ex-tremely simple, only one segmentation model in the tar-get domain is employed. Novel technologies such as dual path image translation and dual path adaptive segmenta-tion are proposed to make two paths promote each other in an interactive manner. Experiments on GTA5→Cityscapes and SYNTHIA→Cityscapes scenarios demonstrate the su-periority of our DPL model over the state-of-the-art meth-ods.
