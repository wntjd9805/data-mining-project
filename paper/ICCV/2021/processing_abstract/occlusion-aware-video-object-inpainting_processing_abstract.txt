Conventional video inpainting is neither object-oriented nor occlusion-aware, making it liable to obvious artifacts when large occluded object regions are inpainted. This paper presents occlusion-aware video object inpainting, which recovers both the complete shape and appearance for occluded objects in videos given their visible mask segmen-tation.To facilitate this new research, we construct the ﬁrst large-scale video object inpainting benchmark YouTube-VOI to provide realistic occlusion scenarios with both oc-cluded and visible object masks available. Our techni-cal contribution VOIN jointly performs video object shapeIn particu-completion and occluded texture generation. lar, the shape completion module models long-range ob-ject coherence while the ﬂow completion module recovers accurate ﬂow with sharp motion boundary, for propagat-ing temporally-consistent texture to the same moving ob-ject across frames. For more realistic results, VOIN is op-timized using both T-PatchGAN and a new spatio-temporal attention-based multi-class discriminator.Finally, we compare VOIN and strong baselines onYouTube-VOI. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our method including inpainting complex and dy-namic objects. VOIN degrades gracefully with inaccurate input visible mask.
