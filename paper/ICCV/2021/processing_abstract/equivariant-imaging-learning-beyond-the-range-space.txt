In various imaging problems, we only have access to compressed measurements of the underlying signals, hin-dering most learning-based strategies which usually require pairs of signals and associated measurements for train-ing. Learning only from compressed measurements is im-possible in general, as the compressed observations do not contain information outside the range of the forward sens-ing operator. We propose a new end-to-end self-supervised framework that overcomes this limitation by exploiting the equivariances present in natural signals. Our proposed learning strategy performs as well as fully supervised meth-ods. Experiments demonstrate the potential of this frame-work on inverse problems including sparse-view X-ray com-puted tomography on real clinical data and image inpaint-ing on natural images.
