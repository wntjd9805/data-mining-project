Assessing action quality is challenging due to the subtle differences between videos and large variations in scores.Most existing approaches tackle this problem by regressing a quality score from a single video, suffering a lot fromIn this paper, we the large inter-video score variations. show that the relations among videos can provide impor-tant clues for more accurate action quality assessment dur-ing both training and inference. Speciﬁcally, we reformu-late the problem of action quality assessment as regressing the relative scores with reference to another video that has shared attributes (e.g., category and difﬁculty), instead of learning unreferenced scores. Following this formulation, we propose a new Contrastive Regression (CoRe) frame-work to learn the relative scores by pair-wise comparison, which highlights the differences between videos and guides the models to learn the key hints for assessment. In order to further exploit the relative information between two videos, we devise a group-aware regression tree to convert the con-ventional score regression into two easier sub-problems: coarse-to-ﬁne classiﬁcation and regression in small inter-vals. To demonstrate the effectiveness of CoRe, we conduct extensive experiments on three mainstream AQA datasets including AQA-7, MTL-AQA and JIGSAWS. Our approach outperforms previous methods by a large margin and estab-lishes new state-of-the-art on all three benchmarks.
