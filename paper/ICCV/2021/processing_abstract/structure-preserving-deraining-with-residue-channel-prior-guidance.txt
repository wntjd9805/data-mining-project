Single image deraining is important for many high-level computer vision tasks since the rain streaks can severely de-grade the visibility of images, thereby affecting the recogni-tion and analysis of the image. Recently, many CNN-based methods have been proposed for rain removal. Although these methods can remove part of the rain streaks, it is difﬁcult for them to adapt to real-world scenarios and re-store high-quality rain-free images with clear and accurate structures. To solve this problem, we propose a Structure-Preserving Deraining Network (SPDNet) with RCP guid-ance. SPDNet directly generates high-quality rain-free im-ages with clear and accurate structures under the guidance of RCP but does not rely on any rain-generating assump-tions. Speciﬁcally, we found that the RCP of images con-tains more accurate structural information than rainy im-ages. Therefore, we introduced it to our deraining net-work to protect structure information of the rain-free image.Meanwhile, a Wavelet-based Multi-Level Module (WMLM) is proposed as the backbone for learning the background in-formation of rainy images and an Interactive Fusion Mod-ule (IFM) is designed to make full use of RCP informa-tion. In addition, an iterative guidance strategy is proposed to gradually improve the accuracy of RCP, reﬁning the re-sult in a progressive path. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves new state-of-the-art results.Code: https://github.com/Joyies/SPDNet
