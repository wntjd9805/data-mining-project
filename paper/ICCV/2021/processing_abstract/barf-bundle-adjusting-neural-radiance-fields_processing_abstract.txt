Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [31] have recently gained a surge of interest within the computer vision community for its power to synthesize photorealistic novel views of real-world scenes. One limitation of NeRF, however, is its re-quirement of accurate camera poses to learn the scene rep-resentations. In this paper, we propose Bundle-AdjustingNeural Radiance Fields (BARF) for training NeRF from im-perfect (or even unknown) camera poses — the joint problem of learning neural 3D representations and registering cam-era frames. We establish a theoretical connection to classical image alignment and show that coarse-to-ﬁne registration is also applicable to NeRF. Furthermore, we show that naïvely applying positional encoding in NeRF has a negative impact on registration with a synthesis-based objective. Experi-ments on synthetic and real-world data show that BARF can effectively optimize the neural scene representations and re-solve large camera pose misalignment at the same time. This enables view synthesis and localization of video sequences from unknown camera poses, opening up new avenues for visual localization systems (e.g. SLAM) and potential appli-cations for dense 3D mapping and reconstruction.
