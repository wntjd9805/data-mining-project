Few-shot learning (FSL) attempts to learn with limited data. In this work, we perform the feature extraction in theEuclidean space and the geodesic distance metric on theOblique Manifold (OM). Specially, for better feature extrac-tion, we propose a non-parametric Region Self-attention with Spatial Pyramid Pooling (RSSPP), which realizes a trade-off between the generalization and the discrimina-tive ability of the single image feature. Then, we embed the feature to OM as a point. Furthermore, we design an Oblique Distance-based Classiﬁer (ODC) that achieves classiﬁcation in the tangent spaces which better approxi-mate OM locally by learnable tangency points. Finally, we introduce a new method for parameters initialization and a novel loss function in the transductive settings. Exten-sive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our al-gorithm and it outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the popular benchmarks: mini-ImageNet, tiered-ImageNet, andCaltech-UCSD Birds-200-2011 (CUB).
