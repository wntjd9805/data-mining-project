The vast majority of modern consumer-grade cameras employ a rolling shutter mechanism, leading to image dis-tortions if the camera moves during image acquisition. In this paper, we present a novel deep network to solve the generic rolling shutter correction problem with two con-secutive frames. Our pipeline is symmetrically designed to predict the global shutter image corresponding to the intermediate time of these two frames, which is difﬁcult for existing methods because it corresponds to a camera pose that differs most from the two frames. First, two time-symmetric dense undistortion ﬂows are estimated by using well-established principles: pyramidal construction, warp-ing, and cost volume processing. Then, both rolling shut-ter images are warped into a common global shutter one in the feature space, respectively. Finally, a symmetric consis-tency constraint is constructed in the image decoder to ef-fectively aggregate the contextual cues of two rolling shutter images, thereby recovering the high-quality global shutter image. Extensive experiments with both synthetic and real data from public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach over the state-of-the-art methods.
