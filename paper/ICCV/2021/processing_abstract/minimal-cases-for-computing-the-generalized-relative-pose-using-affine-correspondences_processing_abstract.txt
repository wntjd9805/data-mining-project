We propose three novel solvers for estimating the rela-tive pose of a multi-camera system from afﬁne correspon-dences (ACs). A new constraint is derived interpreting the relationship of ACs and the generalized camera model. Us-ing the constraint, we demonstrate efﬁcient solvers for two types of motions assumed. Considering that the cameras undergo planar motion, we propose a minimal solution us-ing a single AC and a solver with two ACs to overcome the degenerate case. Also, we propose a minimal solution using two ACs with known vertical direction, e.g., from an IMU.Since the proposed methods require signiﬁcantly fewer cor-respondences than state-of-the-art algorithms, they can be efﬁciently used within RANSAC for outlier removal and ini-tial motion estimation. The solvers are tested both on syn-thetic data and on real-world scenes from the KITTI odom-etry benchmark. It is shown that the accuracy of the esti-mated poses is superior to the state-of-the-art techniques.
