Data-driven sky models have gained much attention in outdoor illumination prediction recently, showing superior performance against analytical models. However, naively compressing an outdoor panorama into a low-dimensional latent vector, as existing models have done, causes two ma-jor problems. One is the mutual interference between theHDR intensity of the sun and the complex textures of the surrounding sky, and the other is the lack of ﬁne-grained control over independent lighting factors due to the entan-gled representation. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical disentangled sky model (HDSky) for out-door illumination prediction. With this model, any outdoor panorama can be hierarchically disentangled into several factors based on three well-designed autoencoders. Theﬁrst autoencoder compresses each sunny panorama into a sky vector and a sun vector with some constraints. The sec-ond autoencoder and the third autoencoder further disen-tangle the sun intensity and the sky intensity from the sun vector and the sky vector with several customized loss func-tions respectively. Moreover, a uniﬁed framework is de-signed to predict all-weather sky information from a single outdoor image. Through extensive experiments, we demon-strate that the proposed model signiﬁcantly improves the accuracy of outdoor illumination prediction.It also al-lows users to intuitively edit the predicted panorama (e.g., changing the position of the sun while preserving others), without sacriﬁcing physical plausibility.
