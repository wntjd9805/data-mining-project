Arbitrary shape text detection is a challenging task dueIn this to the high complexity and variety of scene texts. work, we propose a novel adaptive boundary proposal net-work for arbitrary shape text detection, which can learn to directly produce accurate boundary for arbitrary shape text without any post-processing. Our method mainly con-sists of a boundary proposal model and an innovative adap-tive boundary deformation model. The boundary proposal model constructed by multi-layer dilated convolutions is adopted to produce prior information (including classiﬁ-cation map, distance ﬁeld, and direction ﬁeld) and coarse boundary proposals. The adaptive boundary deformation model is an encoder-decoder network, in which the encoder mainly consists of a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). It aims to per-form boundary deformation in an iterative way for obtain-ing text instance shape guided by prior information from the boundary proposal model. In this way, our method can directly and efﬁciently generate accurate text boundaries without complex post-processing. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method. Code is available at the web-site: https://github.com/GXYM/TextBPN .
