Instance segmentation on point clouds is a fundamen-tal task in 3D scene perception. In this work, we propose a concise clustering-based framework named HAIS, which makes full use of spatial relation of points and point sets.Considering clustering-based methods may result in over-segmentation or under-segmentation, we introduce the hi-erarchical aggregation to progressively generate instance proposals, i.e., point aggregation for preliminarily cluster-ing points to sets and set aggregation for generating com-plete instances from sets. Once the complete 3D instances are obtained, a sub-network of intra-instance prediction is adopted for noisy points Ô¨Åltering and mask quality scoring.HAIS is fast (only 410ms per frame on Titan X)) and does not require non-maximum suppression. It ranks 1st on theScanNet v2 benchmark 1, achieving the highest 69.9% AP50 and surpassing previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by a large margin. Besides, the SOTA results on the S3DIS dataset validate the good generalization ability. Code is available at https://github.com/hustvl/HAIS.
