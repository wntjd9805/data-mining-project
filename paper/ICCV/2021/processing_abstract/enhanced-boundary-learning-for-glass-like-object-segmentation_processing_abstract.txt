Glass-like objects such as windows, bottles, and mirrors exist widely in the real world. Sensing these objects has many applications, including robot navigation and grasp-ing. However, this task is very challenging due to the ar-bitrary scenes behind glass-like objects. This paper aims to solve the glass-like object segmentation problem via en-hanced boundary learning. In particular, we ﬁrst propose a novel reﬁned differential module that outputs ﬁner bound-ary cues. We then introduce an edge-aware point-based graph convolution network module to model the global shape along the boundary. We use these two modules to de-sign a decoder that generates accurate and clean segmen-tation results, especially on the object contours. Both mod-ules are lightweight and effective: they can be embedded into various segmentation models. In extensive experiments on three recent glass-like object segmentation datasets, in-cluding Trans10k, MSD, and GDD, our approach estab-lishes new state-of-the-art results. We also illustrate the strong generalization properties of our method on three generic segmentation datasets, including Cityscapes, BDD, and COCO Stuff. Code and models will be available for further research.
