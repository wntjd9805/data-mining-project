Change captioning is the task of identifying the change and describing it with a concise caption. Despite recent advancements, ﬁltering out insigniﬁcant changes still re-mains as a challenge. Namely, images from different cam-era perspectives can cause issues; a mere change in view-point should be disregarded while still capturing the actual changes. In order to tackle this problem, we present a newViewpoint-Agnostic change captioning network with CycleConsistency (VACC) that requires only one image each for the before and after scene, without depending on any other information. We achieve this by devising a new difference encoder module which can encode viewpoint information and model the difference more effectively. In addition, we propose a cycle consistency module that can potentially im-prove the performance of any change captioning networks in general by matching the composite feature of the gen-erated caption and before image with the after image fea-ture. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model across three datasets for change captioning, including a novel dataset we introduce here that contains images with changes under extreme viewpoint shifts. Through our ex-periments, we show the excellence of our method with re-spect to the CIDEr, BLEU-4, METEOR and SPICE scores.Moreover, we demonstrate that attaching our proposed cy-cle consistency module yields a performance boost for ex-isting change captioning networks, even with varying image encoding mechanisms.
