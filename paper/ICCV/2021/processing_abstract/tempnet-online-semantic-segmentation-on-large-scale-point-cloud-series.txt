Online semantic segmentation on a time series of point cloud frames is an essential task in autonomous driving.Existing models focus on single-frame segmentation, which cannot achieve satisfactory segmentation accuracy and of-fer unstably ﬂicker among frames. In this paper, we propose a light-weight semantic segmentation framework for large-scale point cloud series, called TempNet, which can improve both the accuracy and the stability of existing semantic seg-mentation models by combining a novel frame aggregation scheme. To be computational cost-efﬁcient, feature extrac-tion and aggregation are only conducted on a small portion of key frames via a temporal feature aggregation (TFA) net-work using an attentional pooling mechanism, and such en-hanced features are propagated to the intermediate non-key frames. To avoid information loss from non-key frames, a partial feature update (PFU) network is designed to par-tially update the propagated features with the local features extracted on a non-key frame if a large disparity between the two is quickly assessed. As a result, consistent and information-rich features can be obtained for each frame.We implement TempNet on ﬁve state-of-the-art (SOTA) point cloud segmentation models and conduct extensive experi-ments on the SemanticKITTI dataset. Results demonstrate that TempNet outperforms SOTA competitors by wide mar-gins with little extra computational cost.
