In this paper, we propose an instance similarity learn-ing (ISL) method for unsupervised feature representation.Conventional methods assign close instance pairs in the feature space with high similarity, which usually leads to wrong pairwise relationship for large neighborhoods be-cause the Euclidean distance fails to depict the true se-mantic similarity on the feature manifold. On the contrary, our method mines the feature manifold in an unsupervised manner, through which the semantic similarity among in-stances is learned in order to obtain discriminative repre-sentations. Speciﬁcally, we employ the Generative Adver-sarial Networks (GAN) to mine the underlying feature man-ifold, where the generated features are applied as the prox-ies to progressively explore the feature manifold so that the semantic similarity among instances is acquired as reliable pseudo supervision. Extensive experiments on image clas-siﬁcation demonstrate the superiority of our method com-pared with the state-of-the-art methods. The code is avail-able at https://github.com/ZiweiWangTHU/ISL.git.
