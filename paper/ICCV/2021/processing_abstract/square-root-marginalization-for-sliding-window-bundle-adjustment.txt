In this paper we propose a novel square root sliding-window bundle adjustment suitable for real-time odometry applications. The square root formulation pervades three major aspects of our optimization-based sliding-window estimator: for bundle adjustment we eliminate landmark variables with nullspace projection; to store the marginal-ization prior we employ a matrix square root of the Hes-sian; and when marginalizing old poses we avoid form-ing normal equations and update the square root prior di-rectly with a specialized QR decomposition. We show that the proposed square root marginalization is algebraically equivalent to the conventional use of Schur complement (SC) on the Hessian. Moreover, it elegantly deals with rank-deﬁcient Jacobians producing a prior equivalent toSC with Moore–Penrose inverse. Our evaluation of visual and visual-inertial odometry on real-world datasets demon-strates that the proposed estimator is 36% faster than the baseline. It furthermore shows that in single precision, con-ventional Hessian-based marginalization leads to numeric failures and reduced accuracy. We analyse numeric proper-ties of the marginalization prior to explain why our square root form does not suffer from the same effect and therefore entails superior performance.
