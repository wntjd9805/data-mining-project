A cornerstone of geometric reconstruction, rotation aver-aging seeks the set of absolute rotations that optimally ex-plains a set of measured relative orientations between them.In spite of being an integral part of bundle adjustment and structure-from-motion, averaging rotations is both a non-convex and high-dimensional optimization problem. In this paper, we address it from a maximum likelihood estimation standpoint and make a twofold contribution. Firstly, we set forth a novel initialization-free primal-dual method which we show empirically to converge to the global optimum.Further, we derive what is to our knowledge, the ﬁrst op-timal closed-form solution for rotation averaging in cycle graphs and contextualize this result within spectral graph theory. Our proposed methods achieve a signiﬁcant gain both in precision and performance.
