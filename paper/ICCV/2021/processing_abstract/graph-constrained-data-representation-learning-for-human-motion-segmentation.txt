Recently, transfer subspace learning based approaches have shown to be a valid alternative to unsupervised sub-space clustering and temporal data clustering for human motion segmentation (HMS). These approaches leverage prior knowledge from a source domain to improve clus-tering performance on a target domain, and currently they represent the state of the art in HMS. Bucking this trend, in this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised model that learns a representation of the data and digs clustering in-formation from the data itself. Our model is reminiscent of temporal subspace clustering, but presents two critical differences. First, we learn an auxiliary data matrix that can deviate from the initial data, hence confers more de-grees of freedom to the coding matrix. Second, we intro-duce a regularization term for this auxiliary data matrix that preserves the local geometrical structure present in the high-dimensional space. The proposed model is efﬁ-ciently optimized by using an original Alternating Direc-tion Method of Multipliers (ADMM) formulation allowing to learn jointly the auxiliary data representation, a non-negative dictionary and a coding matrix. Experimental re-sults on four benchmark datasets for HMS demonstrate that our approach achieves signiﬁcantly better clustering per-formance then state-of-the-art methods, including both un-supervised and more recent semi-supervised transfer learn-ing approaches1.
