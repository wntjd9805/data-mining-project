Being able to infer 3D structures from 2D images with geometric principles, vanishing points have been a well-recognized concept in 3D vision research.It has been widely used in autonomous driving, SLAM, and AR/VR for applications including road direction estimation, camera calibration, and camera pose estimation. Existing vanish-ing point detection methods often need to trade off between robustness, precision, and inference speed. In this paper, we introduce VaPiD, a novel neural network-based rapidVanishing Point Detector that achieves unprecedented efﬁ-ciency with learned vanishing point optimizers. The core of our method contains two components: a vanishing point proposal network that gives a set of vanishing point propos-als as coarse estimations; and a neural vanishing point op-timizer that iteratively optimizes the positions of the vanish-ing point proposals to achieve high-precision levels. Exten-sive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method provides competitive, if not better, performance as compared to the previous state-of-the-art vanishing point detection approaches, while being signiﬁ-cantly faster.
