With the development of deep convolutional neural net-works, image matting has ushered in a new phase. Regard-ing the nature of image matting, most researches have fo-cused on solutions for transition regions. However, we ar-gue that many existing approaches are excessively focused on transition-dominant local fields and ignored the inher-ent coordination between global information and transi-In this paper, we propose the Tripar-tion optimisation. tite Information Mining and Integration Network (TIMI-Net) to harmonize the coordination between global and lo-cal attributes formally. Specifically, we resort to a novel 3-branch encoder to accomplish comprehensive mining of the input information, which can supplement the neglected coordination between global and local fields. In order to achieve effective and complete interaction between such multi-branches information, we develop the Tripartite In-*Joint first authors.â€ Joint corresponding authors.

Finally, we con-duct extensive experiments to prove the performance of our proposed TIMI-Net, which demonstrates that our method performs favourably against the SOTA approaches on the alphamatting.com (Rank First), Composition-1K (MSE-0.006, Grad-11.5), Distinctions-646 and our Human-2K.Also, we have developed an online evaluation website to perform natural image matting.
