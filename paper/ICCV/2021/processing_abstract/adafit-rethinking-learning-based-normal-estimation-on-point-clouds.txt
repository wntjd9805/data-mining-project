This paper presents a neural network for robust nor-mal estimation on point clouds, named AdaFit, that can deal with point clouds with noise and density variations.Existing works use a network to learn point-wise weights for weighted least squares surface ﬁtting to estimate the normals, which has difﬁculty in ﬁnding accurate normals in complex regions or containing noisy points. By ana-lyzing the step of weighted least squares surface ﬁtting, we ﬁnd that it is hard to determine the polynomial order of the ﬁtting surface and the ﬁtting surface is sensitive to outliers. To address these problems, we propose a simple yet effective solution that adds an additional offset predic-tion to improve the quality of normal estimation. Further-more, in order to take advantage of points from different neighborhood sizes, a novel Cascaded Scale Aggregation layer is proposed to help the network predict more accu-rate point-wise offsets and weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdaFit achieves state-of-the-art perfor-mance on both the synthetic PCPNet dataset and the real-word SceneNN dataset.
