Lesion segmentation in medical imaging has been an im-portant topic in clinical research. Researchers have pro-posed various detection and segmentation algorithms to ad-dress this task. Recently, deep learning-based approaches have significantly improved the performance over conven-tional methods. However, most state-of-the-art deep learn-ing methods require the manual design of multiple net-work components and training strategies. In this paper, we propose a new automated machine learning algorithm, T-AutoML, which not only searches for the best neural ar-chitecture, but also finds the best combination of hyper-parameters and data augmentation strategies simultane-ously. The proposed method utilizes the modern trans-former model, which is introduced to adapt to the dynamic length of the search space embedding and can significantly improve the ability of the search. We validate T-AutoML on several large-scale public lesion segmentation data-sets and achieve state-of-the-art performance.
