Although having achieved great success in medical im-age segmentation, deep convolutional neural networks usu-ally require a large dataset with manual annotations for training and are difficult to generalize to unseen classes.Few-shot learning has the potential to address these chal-lenges by learning new classes from only a few labeled ex-In this work, we propose a new framework for amples. few-shot medical image segmentation based on prototypical networks. Our innovation lies in the design of two key mod-ules: 1) a context relation encoder (CRE) that uses corre-lation to capture local relation features between foreground and background regions; and 2) a recurrent mask refine-ment module that repeatedly uses the CRE and a prototypi-cal network to recapture the change of context relationship and refine the segmentation mask iteratively. Experiments on two abdomen CT datasets and an abdomen MRI dataset show the proposed method obtains substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art methods by an average of 16.32%, 8.45% and 6.24% in terms of DSC, respectively.
