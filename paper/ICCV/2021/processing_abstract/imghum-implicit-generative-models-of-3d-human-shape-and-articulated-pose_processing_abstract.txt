We present imGHUM, the first holistic generative model of 3D human shape and articulated pose, represented as a signed distance function. In contrast to prior work, we model the full human body implicitly as a function zero-level-set and without the use of an explicit template mesh.We propose a novel network architecture and a learning paradigm, which make it possible to learn a detailed im-plicit generative model of human pose, shape, and seman-tics, on par with state-of-the-art mesh-based models. Our model features desired detail for human models, such as articulated pose including hand motion and facial expres-sions, a broad spectrum of shape variations, and can be queried at arbitrary resolutions and spatial locations. Addi-tionally, our model has attached spatial semantics making it straightforward to establish correspondences between dif-ferent shape instances, thus enabling applications that are difficult to tackle using classical implicit representations. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate the model accuracy and its applicability to current research problems.
