The ﬁeld of face recognition (FR) has witnessed remark-able progress with the surge of deep learning. The effec-tive loss functions play an important role for FR. In this pa-per, we observe that a majority of loss functions, including the widespread triplet loss and softmax-based cross-entropy loss, embed inter-class (negative) similarity sn and intra-class (positive) similarity sp into similarity pairs and opti-mize to reduce (sn − sp) in the training process. However, in the veriﬁcation process, existing metrics directly take the absolute similarity between two features as the conﬁdence of belonging to the same identity, which inevitably causes a gap between the training and veriﬁcation process. To bridge the gap, we propose a new metric called Discrep-ancy Alignment Metric (DAM) for veriﬁcation, which in-troduces the Local Inter-class Discrepancy (LID) for each face image to normalize the absolute similarity score. To estimate the LID of each face image in the veriﬁcation pro-cess, we propose two types of LID Estimation (LIDE) meth-ods, which are reference-based and learning-based estima-tion methods, respectively. The proposed DAM is plug-and-play and can be easily applied to the most existing meth-ods. Extensive experiments on multiple popular face recog-nition benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
