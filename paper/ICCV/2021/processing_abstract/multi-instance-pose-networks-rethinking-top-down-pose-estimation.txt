A key assumption of top-down human pose estimation approaches is their expectation of having a single per-son/instance present in the input bounding box. This often leads to failures in crowded scenes with occlusions. We propose a novel solution to overcome the limitations of this fundamental assumption. Our Multi-Instance Pose Network (MIPNet) allows for predicting multiple 2D pose instances within a given bounding box. We introduce a Multi-InstanceModulation Block (MIMB) that can adaptively modulate channel-wise feature responses for each instance and is parameter efﬁcient. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our ap-proach by evaluating on COCO, CrowdPose, and OCHuman datasets. Speciﬁcally, we achieve 70.0 AP on CrowdPose and 42.5 AP on OCHuman test sets, a signiﬁcant improve-ment of 2.4 AP and 6.5 AP over the prior art, respectively.When using ground truth bounding boxes for inference, MIP-Net achieves an improvement of 0.7 AP on COCO, 0.9 AP onCrowdPose, and 9.1 AP on OCHuman validation sets com-pared to HRNet. Interestingly, when fewer, high conﬁdence bounding boxes are used, HRNet’s performance degrades (by 5 AP) on OCHuman, whereas MIPNet maintains a rela-tively stable performance (drop of 1 AP) for the same inputs.
