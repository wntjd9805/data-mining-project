Example Gabor filterLearned CNN filterConvolutional layers in CNNs implement linear filters which decompose the input into different frequency bands.However, most modern architectures neglect standard prin-ciples of filter design when optimizing their model choices regarding the size and shape of the convolutional kernel. In this work, we consider the well-known problem of spectral leakage caused by windowing artifacts in filtering opera-tions in the context of CNNs. We show that the small size of CNN kernels make them susceptible to spectral leakage, which may induce performance-degrading artifacts. To ad-dress this issue, we propose the use of larger kernel sizes along with the Hamming window function to alleviate leak-age in CNN architectures. We demonstrate improved clas-sification accuracy on multiple benchmark datasets includ-ing Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet with the simple use of a standard window function in con-volutional layers. Finally, we show that CNNs employing the Hamming window display increased robustness against various adversarial attacks. Our code is available online1.
