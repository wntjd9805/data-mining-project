We investigate the weakly-supervised scene graph gener-ation, which is a challenging task since no correspondence of label and object is provided. The previous work regards such correspondence as a latent variable which is itera-tively updated via nested optimization of the scene graph generation objective. However, we further reduce the com-plexity by decoupling it into an efficient first-order graph matching module optimized via contrastive learning to ob-tain such correspondence, which is used to train a standard scene graph generation model. The extensive experiments show that such a simple pipeline can significantly surpass the previous state-of-the-art by more than 30% on the VisualGenome dataset, both in terms of graph matching accuracy and scene graph quality. We believe this work serves as a strong baseline for future research. Code is available at https://github.com/jshi31/WS-SGG.
