Intelligent agents with visual sensors are allowed to ac-tively explore their observations for better recognition per-formance. This task is referred to as Active Recognition (AR). Currently, most methods toward AR are implemented under a fixed-category setting, which constrains their ap-plicability in realistic scenarios that need to incrementally learn new classes without retraining from scratch. Further, collecting massive data for novel categories is expensive.To address this demand, in this paper, we propose a unified framework towards Few-sample Lifelong Active Recogni-tion (FLAR), which aims at performing active recognition on progressively arising novel categories that only have few training samples. Three difficulties emerge with FLAR: the lifelong recognition policy learning, the knowledge preser-vation of old categories, and the lack of training samples.To this end, our approach integrates prototypes, a robust representation for limited training samples, into a reinforce-ment learning solution, which motivates the agent to move towards views resulting in more discriminative features.Catastrophic forgetting during lifelong learning is then al-leviated with knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments across two datasets, respectively for object and scene recog-nition, demonstrate that even without large training sam-ples, the proposed approach could learn to actively recog-nize novel categories in a class-incremental behavior.
