Most existing style transfer methods follow the assump-tion that styles can be represented with global statistics (e.g., Gram matrices or covariance matrices), and thus ad-dress the problem by forcing the output and style images to have similar global statistics. An alternative is the assump-tion of local style patterns, where algorithms are designed to swap similar local features of content and style images.However, the limitation of these existing methods is that they neglect the semantic structure of the content image which may lead to corrupted content structure in the output. In this paper, we make a new assumption that image features from the same semantic region form a manifold and an im-age with multiple semantic regions follows a multi-manifold distribution. Based on this assumption, the style trans-fer problem is formulated as aligning two multi-manifold distributions and a Manifold Alignment based Style Trans-fer (MAST) framework is proposed. The proposed frame-work allows semantically similar regions between the out-put and the style image share similar style patterns. More-over, the proposed manifold alignment method is flexible to allow user editing or using semantic segmentation mapsâˆ—Corresponding author. as guidance for style transfer. To allow the method to be applicable to photorealistic style transfer, we propose a new adaptive weight skip connection network structure to preserve the content details. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework for both artis-tic and photorealistic style transfer. Code is available at https://github.com/NJUHuoJing/MAST.
