Classical close-set semantic segmentation networks have limited ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) ob-jects, which is important for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Incrementally learning theseOOD objects with few annotations is an ideal way to en-large the knowledge base of the deep learning models. In this paper, we propose an open world semantic segmenta-tion system that includes two modules: (1) an open-set se-mantic segmentation module to detect both in-distribution and OOD objects. (2) an incremental few-shot learning module to gradually incorporate those OOD objects into its existing knowledge base. This open world semantic segmentation system behaves like a human being, which is able to identify OOD objects and gradually learn them with corresponding supervision. We adopt the Deep Met-ric Learning Network (DMLNet) with contrastive cluster-ing to implement open-set semantic segmentation. Com-pared to other open-set semantic segmentation methods, our DMLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging open-set semantic segmentation datasets with-out using additional data or generative models. On this basis, two incremental few-shot learning methods are fur-ther proposed to progressively improve the DMLNet with the annotations of OOD objects.
