In this paper, we propose a Frequency-Aware Spatiotem-poral Transformer (FAST) for video inpainting detection, which aims to simultaneously mine the traces of video in-painting from spatial, temporal, and frequency domains.Unlike existing deep video inpainting detection methods that usually rely on hand-designed attention modules and memory mechanism, our proposed FAST have innate global self-attention mechanisms to capture the long-range rela-tions. While existing video inpainting methods usually ex-ploit the spatial and temporal connections in a video, our method employs a spatiotemporal transformer framework to detect the spatial connections between patches and tem-poral dependency between frames. As the inpainted videos usually lack high frequency details, our proposed FAST syn-chronously exploits the frequency domain information with a speciÔ¨Åcally designed decoder. Extensive experimental re-sults demonstrate that our approach achieves very compet-itive performance and generalizes well.
