Light-ﬁeld imaging is appealing to the mobile devices market because of its capability for intuitive post-capture processing. Acquiring light ﬁeld (LF) data with high angu-lar, spatial and temporal resolution poses signiﬁcant chal-lenges, especially with space constraints preventing bulky optics. At the same time, stereo video capture, now avail-able on many consumer devices, can be interpreted as a sparse LF-capture. We explore the application of small baseline stereo videos for reconstructing high ﬁdelity LF videos.We propose a self-supervised learning-based algorithm for LF video reconstruction from stereo video. The self-supervised LF video reconstruction is guided via the geo-metric information from the individual stereo pairs and the temporal information from the video sequence. LF estima-tion is further regularized by a low-rank constraint based on layered LF displays. The proposed self-supervised al-gorithm facilitates advantages such as post-training ﬁne-tuning on test sequences and variable angular view interpo-lation and extrapolation. Quantitatively the reconstructedLF videos show higher ﬁdelity than previously proposed un-supervised approaches.We demonstrate our results via LF videos generated from publicly available stereo videos ac-quired from commercially available stereoscopic cameras.Finally, we demonstrate that our reconstructed LF videos allow applications such as post-capture focus control and region-of-interest (RoI) based focus tracking for videos.
