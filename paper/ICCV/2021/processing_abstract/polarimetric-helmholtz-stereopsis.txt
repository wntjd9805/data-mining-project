Helmholtz stereopsis (HS) exploits the reciprocity prin-ciple of light propagation (i.e., the Helmholtz reciprocity) for 3D reconstruction of surfaces with arbitrary reflectance.In this paper, we present the polarimetric Helmholtz stere-opsis (polar-HS), which extends the classical HS by con-sidering the polarization state of light in the reciprocal paths. With the additional phase information from polar-ization, polar-HS requires only one reciprocal image pair.We formulate new reciprocity and diffuse/specular polari-metric constraints to recover surface depths and normals using an optimization framework. Using a hardware proto-type, we show that our approach produces high-quality 3D reconstruction for different types of surfaces, ranging from diffuse to highly specular.
