Ref. imagesGround TruthGT patchLR patchThis paper proposes a novel Attention-based Multi-Reference Super-resolution network (AMRSR) that, given a low-resolution image, learns to adaptively transfer the most similar texture from multiple reference images to the super-resolution output whilst maintaining spatial coher-ence. The use of multiple reference images together with attention-based sampling is demonstrated to achieve sig-niﬁcantly improved performance over state-of-the-art ref-erence super-resolution approaches on multiple benchmark datasets. Reference super-resolution approaches have re-cently been proposed to overcome the ill-posed problem of image super-resolution by providing additional information from a high-resolution reference image. Multi-reference super-resolution extends this approach by providing a more diverse pool of image features to overcome the inherent in-formation deﬁcit whilst maintaining memory efﬁciency. A novel hierarchical attention-based sampling approach is introduced to learn the similarity between low-resolution image features and multiple reference images based on a perceptual loss. Ablation demonstrates the contribution of both multi-reference and hierarchical attention-based sam-pling to overall performance. Perceptual and quantitative ground-truth evaluation demonstrates signiﬁcant improve-ment in performance even when the reference images devi-ate signiﬁcantly from the target image.
