We present DetCo, a simple yet effective self-supervised approach for object detection. Unsupervised pre-training methods have been recently designed for object detection, but they are usually deficient in image classification, or the opposite. Unlike them, DetCo transfers well on downstream instance-level dense prediction tasks, while maintaining competitive image-level classification accuracy. The advan-tages are derived from (1) multi-level supervision to inter-mediate representations, (2) contrastive learning between global image and local patches. These two designs facil-itate discriminative and consistent global and local repre-sentation at each level of feature pyramid, improving detec-tion and classification, simultaneously.Extensive experiments on VOC, COCO, Cityscapes, andImageNet demonstrate that DetCo not only outperforms re-cent methods on a series of 2D and 3D instance-level de-tection tasks, but also competitive on image classification.For example, on ImageNet classification, DetCo is 6.9% and 5.0% top-1 accuracy better than InsLoc and DenseCL, which are two contemporary works designed for object de-tection. Moreover, on COCO detection, DetCo is 6.9 AP better than SwAV with Mask R-CNN C4. Notably, DetCo largely boosts up Sparse R-CNN, a recent strong detector, from 45.0 AP to 46.5 AP (+1.5 AP), establishing a newSOTA on COCO.
