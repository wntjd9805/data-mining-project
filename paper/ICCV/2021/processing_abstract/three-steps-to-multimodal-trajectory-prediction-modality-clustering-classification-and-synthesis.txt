Multimodal prediction results are essential for trajec-tory prediction task as there is no single correct answer for the future. Previous frameworks can be divided into three categories: regression, generation and classification frameworks. However, these frameworks have weaknesses in different aspects so that they cannot model the multi-modal prediction task comprehensively. In this paper, we present a novel insight along with a brand-new prediction framework by formulating multimodal prediction into three steps: modality clustering, classification and synthesis, and address the shortcomings of earlier frameworks. Ex-haustive experiments on popular benchmarks have demon-strated that our proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art works even without introducing social and map informa-tion. Specifically, we achieve 19.2% and 20.8% improve-ment on ADE and FDE respectively on ETH/UCY dataset.
