Recent advances in trajectory prediction have shown that explicit reasoning about agents’ intent is important to accurately forecast their motion. However, the current research activities are not directly applicable to intelli-gent and safety critical systems. This is mainly because very few public datasets are available, and they only con-sider pedestrian-speciﬁc intents for a short temporal hori-zon from a restricted egocentric view. To this end, we pro-pose LOKI (LOng term and Key Intentions), a novel large-scale dataset that is designed to tackle joint trajectory and intention prediction for heterogeneous trafﬁc agents (pedes-trians and vehicles) in an autonomous driving setting. TheLOKI dataset is created to discover several factors that may affect intention, including i) agent’s own will, ii) social in-teractions, iii) environmental constraints, and iv) contex-tual information. We also propose a model that jointly per-forms trajectory and intention prediction, showing that re-currently reasoning about intention can assist with trajec-tory prediction. We show our method outperforms state-of-the-art trajectory prediction methods by upto 27% and also provide a baseline for frame-wise intention estimation.The dataset is available at https://usa.honda-ri. com/loki
