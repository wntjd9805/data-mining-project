Image-to-image translation has been revolutionized withGAN-based methods. However, existing methods lack the ability to preserve the identity of the source domain. As a result, synthesized images can often over-adapt to the ref-erence domain, losing important structural characteristics and suffering from suboptimal visual quality. To solve these challenges, we propose a novel frequency domain image translation (FDIT) framework, exploiting frequency infor-mation for enhancing the image generation process. Our key idea is to decompose the image into low-frequency and high-frequency components, where the high-frequency fea-ture captures object structure akin to the identity. Our train-ing objective facilitates the preservation of frequency infor-mation in both pixel space and Fourier spectral space. We broadly evaluate FDIT across five large-scale datasets and multiple tasks including image translation and GAN inver-sion. Extensive experiments and ablations show that FDIT effectively preserves the identity of the source image, and produces photo-realistic images. FDIT establishes state-of-the-art performance, reducing the average FID score by 5.6% compared to the previous best method.
