Advanced self-supervised visual representation learning methods rely on the instance discrimination (ID) pretext task. We point out that the ID task has an implicit semantic consistency (SC) assumption, which may not hold in uncon-strained datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel con-trastive mask prediction (CMP) task for visual representa-tion learning and design a mask contrast (MaskCo) frame-work to implement the idea. MaskCo contrasts region-level features instead of view-level features, which makes it possi-ble to identify the positive sample without any assumptions.To solve the domain gap between masked and unmasked features, we design a dedicated mask prediction head inMaskCo. This module is shown to be the key to the success of the CMP. We evaluated MaskCo on training datasets be-yond ImageNet and compare its performance with MoCo V2[4]. Results show that MaskCo achieves comparable per-formance with MoCo V2 using ImageNet training dataset, but demonstrates a stronger performance across a range of downstream tasks when COCO or Conceptual Captions are used for training. MaskCo provides a promising alternative to the ID-based methods for self-supervised learning in the wild.
