Curvilinear structure segmentation (CSS) is under se-mantic segmentation, whose applications include crack de-tection, aerial road extraction, and biomedical image seg-mentation. In general, geometric topology and pixel-wise features are two critical aspects of CSS. However, most se-mantic segmentation methods only focus on enhancing fea-ture representations while existing CSS techniques empha-size preserving topology alone. In this paper, we present a Joint Topology-preserving and Feature-reﬁnement Net-work (JTFN) that jointly models global topology and reﬁned features based on an iterative feedback learning strategy.Speciﬁcally, we explore the structure of objects to help pre-serve corresponding topologies of predicted masks, thus de-sign a reciprocative two-stream module for CSS and bound-ary detection.In addition, we introduce such topology-aware predictions as feedback guidance that reﬁnes atten-tive features by supplementing and enhancing saliencies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work that jointly addresses topology preserving and feature reﬁnement forCSS. We evaluate JTFN on four datasets of diverse appli-cations: Crack500, CrackTree200, Roads, and DRIVE. Re-sults show that JTFN performs best in comparison with al-ternative methods.
