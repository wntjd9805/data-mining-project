of the crystalline lens.We present a method for optimization-based recovery of eye motion from rolling shutter video of the retina. Our ap-proach formulates eye tracking as an optimization problem that jointly estimates the retina’s motion and appearance using convex optimization and a constrained version of gra-dient descent. By incorporating the rolling shutter imag-ing model into the formulation of our joint optimization, we achieve state-of-the-art accuracy both ofﬂine and in real-time. We apply our method to retina video captured with an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO), demonstrating eye tracking at 1 kHz with accuracies be-low one arcminute—over an order of magnitude higher than conventional eye tracking systems.
