Unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmen-tation aims to assign the pixel-level labels for unlabeled target domain by transferring knowledge from the labeled source domain. A typical self-supervised learning approach generates pseudo labels from the source model and then re-trains the model to fit the target distribution. However, it suffers from noisy pseudo labels due to the existence of do-main shift. Related works alleviate this problem by select-ing high-confidence predictions, but uncertain classes with low confidence scores have rarely been considered. This informative uncertainty is essential to enhance feature rep-resentation and align source and target domains.In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware pseudo la-bel refinery framework considering two crucial factors si-multaneously. First, we progressively enhance the feature alignment model via the target-guided uncertainty rectify-ing framework. Second, we provide an uncertainty-aware pseudo label assignment strategy without any manually de-signed threshold to reduce the noisy labels. Extensive ex-periments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and achieve state-of-the-art performance on two standard synthetic-2-real tasks.
