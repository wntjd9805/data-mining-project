In this paper, we introduce a new framework for unsu-pervised deep homography estimation. Our contributions are 3 folds. First, unlike previous methods that regress 4 offsets for a homography, we propose a homography flow representation, which can be estimated by a weighted sum of 8 pre-defined homography flow bases. Second, consider-ing a homography contains 8 Degree-of-Freedoms (DOFs) that is much less than the rank of the network features, we propose a Low Rank Representation (LRR) block that re-duces the feature rank, so that features corresponding to the dominant motions are retained while others are rejected.Last, we propose a Feature Identity Loss (FIL) to enforce the learned image feature warp-equivariant, meaning that the result should be identical if the order of warp opera-tion and feature extraction is swapped. With this constraint, the unsupervised optimization is achieved more effectively and more stable features are learned. Extensive experi-ments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of all the newly proposed components, and results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art on the homog-raphy benchmark datasets both qualitatively and quanti-tatively.
