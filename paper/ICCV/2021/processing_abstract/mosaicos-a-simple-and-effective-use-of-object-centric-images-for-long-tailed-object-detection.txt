Many objects do not appear frequently enough in com-plex scenes (e.g., certain handbags in living rooms) for training an accurate object detector, but are often found frequently by themselves (e.g., in product images). Yet, these object-centric images are not effectively leveraged for improving object detection in scene-centric images.In this paper, we propose Mosaic of Object-centric im-ages as Scene-centric images (MOSAICOS), a simple and novel framework that is surprisingly effective at tackling the challenges of long-tailed object detection. Keys to our approach are three-fold: (i) pseudo scene-centric im-age construction from object-centric images for mitigating domain differences, (ii) high-quality bounding box impu-tation using the object-centric imagesâ€™ class labels, and (iii) a multi-stage training procedure. On LVIS object de-tection (and instance segmentation), MOSAICOS leads to a massive 60% (and 23%) relative improvement in aver-age precision for rare object categories. We also show that our framework can be compatibly used with other existing approaches to achieve even further gains.
