Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) using image-level classification labels usually utilizes the ClassActivation Maps (CAMs) to localize objects of interest in images. While pointing out that CAMs only highlight the most discriminative regions of the classes of interest, adver-sarial erasing (AE) methods have been proposed to furtherIn this paper, we explore the less discriminative regions. review the potential of the pre-trained classifier which is trained on the raw images. We experimentally verify that the ordinary classifier1 already has the capability to acti-vate the less discriminative regions if the most discrimina-tive regions are erased to some extent. Based on that, we propose a class-specific AE-based framework that fully ex-ploits the potential of an ordinary classifier. Our framework (1) adopts the ordinary classifier to notify the regions to be erased and (2) generates a class-specific mask for erasing by randomly sampling a single specific class to be erased (target class) among the existing classes on the image for obtaining more precise CAMs. Specifically, with the guid-ance of the ordinary classifier, the proposed CAMs Gen-eration Network (CGNet) is enforced to generate a CAM of the target class while constraining the CAM not to in-trude the object regions of the other classes. Along with the pseudo-labels refined from our CAMs, we achieve the state-of-the-art WSSS performance on both PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS-COCO dataset only with image-level supervi-sion.
