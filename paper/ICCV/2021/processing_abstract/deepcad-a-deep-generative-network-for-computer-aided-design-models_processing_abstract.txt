Deep generative models of 3D shapes have received a great deal of research interest. Yet, almost all of them gen-erate discrete shape representations, such as voxels, point clouds, and polygon meshes. We present the ﬁrst 3D genera-tive model for a drastically different shape representation— describing a shape as a sequence of computer-aided de-sign (CAD) operations. Unlike meshes and point clouds,CAD models encode the user creation process of 3D shapes, widely used in numerous industrial and engineering design tasks. However, the sequential and irregular structure ofCAD operations poses signiﬁcant challenges for existing 3D generative models. Drawing an analogy between CAD operations and natural language, we propose a CAD gener-ative network based on the Transformer. We demonstrate the performance of our model for both shape autoencoding and random shape generation. To train our network, we create a new CAD dataset consisting of 178,238 models and theirCAD construction sequences. We have made this dataset publicly available to promote future research on this topic.
