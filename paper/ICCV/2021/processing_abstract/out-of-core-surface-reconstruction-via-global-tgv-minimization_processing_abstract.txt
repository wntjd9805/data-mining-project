We present an out-of-core variational approach for sur-face reconstruction from a set of aligned depth maps. Input depth maps are supposed to be reconstructed from regular photos or/and can be a representation of terrestrial LIDAR point clouds. Our approach is based on surface reconstruc-tion via total generalized variation minimization (T GV ) because of its strong visibility-based noise-Ô¨Åltering prop-erties and GPU-friendliness. Our main contribution is an out-of-core OpenCL-accelerated adaptation of this numeri-cal algorithm which can handle arbitrarily large real-world scenes with scale diversity.
