Deformable templates are essential to large-scale medi-cal image registration, segmentation, and population anal-ysis. Current conventional and deep network-based meth-ods for template construction use only regularized regis-tration objectives and often yield templates with blurry and/or anatomically implausible appearance, confounding downstream biomedical interpretation. We reformulate de-formable registration and conditional template estimation as an adversarial game wherein we encourage realism in the moved templates with a generative adversarial regis-tration framework conditioned on flexible image covariates.The resulting templates exhibit significant gain in specificity to attributes such as age and disease, better fit underlying group-wise spatiotemporal trends, and achieve improved sharpness and centrality. These improvements enable more accurate population modeling with diverse covariates for standardized downstream analyses and easier anatomical delineation for structures of interest.
