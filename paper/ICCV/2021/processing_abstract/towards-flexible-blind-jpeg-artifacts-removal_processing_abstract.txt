Training a single deep blind model to handle differ-ent quality factors for JPEG image artifacts removal has been attracting considerable attention due to its conve-nience for practical usage. However, existing deep blind methods usually directly reconstruct the image without pre-dicting the quality factor, thus lacking the flexibility to con-trol the output as the non-blind methods. To remedy this problem, in this paper, we propose a flexible blind convo-lutional neural network, namely FBCNN, that can predict the adjustable quality factor to control the trade-off be-tween artifacts removal and details preservation. Specifi-cally, FBCNN decouples the quality factor from the JPEG image via a decoupler module and then embeds the pre-dicted quality factor into the subsequent reconstructor mod-ule through a quality factor attention block for flexible con-trol. Besides, We find existing methods are prone to fail on non-aligned double JPEG images even with only one pixel shift, and we thus propose a double JPEG degrada-tion model to augment the training data. Extensive experi-ments on single JPEG images, more general double JPEG images and real-world JPEG images demonstrate that our proposed FBCNN achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quantitative met-rics and visual quality.
