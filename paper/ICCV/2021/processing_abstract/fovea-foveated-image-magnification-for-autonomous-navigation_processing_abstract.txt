Efficient processing of high-resolution video streams is safety-critical for many robotics applications such as au-tonomous driving.Image downsampling is a commonly adopted technique to ensure the latency constraint is met.However, this naive approach greatly restricts an object de-tectorâ€™s capability to identify small objects. In this paper, we propose an attentional approach that elastically mag-nifies certain regions while maintaining a small input can-vas. The magnified regions are those that are believed to have a high probability of containing an object, whose sig-nal can come from a dataset-wide prior or frame-level prior computed from recent object predictions. The magnification is implemented by a KDE-based mapping to transform the bounding boxes into warping parameters, which are then fed into an image sampler with anti-cropping regulariza-tion. The detector is then fed with the warped image and we apply a differentiable backward mapping to get bounding box outputs in the original space. Our regional magnifica-tion allows algorithms to make better use of high-resolution input without incurring the cost of high-resolution process-ing. On the autonomous driving datasets Argoverse-HD and BDD100K, we show our proposed method boosts the detection AP over standard Faster R-CNN, with and with-out finetuning. Additionally, building on top of the previous state-of-the-art in streaming detection, our method sets a new record for streaming AP on Argoverse-HD (from 17.8 to 23.0 on a GTX 1080 Ti GPU), suggesting that it has achieved a superior accuracy-latency tradeoff.
