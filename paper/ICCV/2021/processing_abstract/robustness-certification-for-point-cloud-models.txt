The use of deep 3D point cloud models in safety-critical applications, such as autonomous driving, dictates the need to certify the robustness of these models to real-world trans-formations. This is technically challenging, as it requires a scalable veriﬁer tailored to point cloud models that handles a wide range of semantic 3D transformations. In this work, we address this challenge and introduce 3DCertify, the ﬁrst veriﬁer able to certify the robustness of point cloud models. 3DCertify is based on two key insights: (i) a generic relax-ation based on ﬁrst-order Taylor approximations, applica-ble to any differentiable transformation, and (ii) a precise relaxation for global feature pooling, which is more com-plex than pointwise activations (e.g., ReLU or sigmoid) but commonly employed in point cloud models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3DCertify by performing an extensive evaluation on a wide range of 3D transformations (e.g., ro-tation, twisting) for both classiﬁcation and part segmenta-tion tasks. For example, we can certify robustness against rotations by ±60° for 95.7% of point clouds, and our max pool relaxation increases certiﬁcation by up to 15.6%.
