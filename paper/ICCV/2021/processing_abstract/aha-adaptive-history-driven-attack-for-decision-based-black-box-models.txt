The decision-based black-box attack means to craft ad-versarial examples with only the top-1 label of the victim model available. A common practice is to start from a large perturbation and then iteratively reduce it with a determin-istic direction and a random one while keeping it adversar-ial. The limited information obtained from each query and inefﬁcient direction sampling impede attack efﬁciency, mak-ing it hard to obtain a small enough perturbation within a limited number of queries. To tackle this problem, we pro-pose a novel attack method termed Adaptive History-drivenAttack (AHA) which gathers information from all histori-cal queries as the prior for current sampling. Moreover, to balance between the deterministic direction and the random one, we dynamically adjust the coefﬁcient according to the ratio of the actual magnitude reduction to the expected one.Such a strategy improves the success rate of queries dur-ing optimization, letting adversarial examples move swiftly along the decision boundary. Our method can also integrate with subspace optimization like dimension reduction to fur-ther improve efﬁciency. Extensive experiments on both Im-ageNet and CelebA datasets demonstrate that our method achieves at least 24.3% lower magnitude of perturbation on average with the same number of queries. Finally, we prove the practical potential of our method by evaluating it on popular defense methods and a real-world system pro-vided by MEGVII Face++.
