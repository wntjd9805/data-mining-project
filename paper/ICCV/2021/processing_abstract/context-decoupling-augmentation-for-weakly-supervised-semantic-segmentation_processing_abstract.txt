Data augmentation is vital for deep learning neural net-works. By providing massive training samples, it helps to improve the generalization ability of the model. Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) is a challeng-ing problem that has been deeply studied in recent years, conventional data augmentation approaches for WSSS usu-ally employ geometrical transformations, random crop-ping and color jittering. However, merely increasing the same contextual semantic data does not bring much gain to the networks to distinguish the objects, e.g., the correct image-level classification of “aeroplane” may be not only due to the recognition of the object itself, but also its co-occurrence context like “sky”, which will cause the model to focus less on the object features. To this end, we present a Context Decoupling Augmentation (CDA) method, to change the inherent context in which the objects appear and thus drive the network to remove the dependence be-tween object instances and contextual information. To vali-date the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive ex-periments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO datasets with several alternative network architectures demonstrate thatCDA can boost various popular WSSS methods to the new state-of-the-art by a large margin.
