In this paper, we focus on recognizing 3D shapes from arbitrary views, i.e., arbitrary numbers and positions of viewpoints. It is a challenging and realistic setting for view-based 3D shape recognition. We propose a canonical view representation to tackle this challenge. We ﬁrst transform the original features of arbitrary views to a ﬁxed number of view features, dubbed canonical view representation, by aligning the arbitrary view features to a set of learnable reference view features using optimal transport. In this way, each 3D shape with arbitrary views is represented by a ﬁxed number of canonical view features, which are further ag-gregated to generate a rich and robust 3D shape represen-tation for shape recognition. We also propose a canonical view feature separation constraint to enforce that the view features in canonical view representation can be embedded into scattered points in a Euclidean space. Experiments on the ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and RGBD datasets show that our method achieves competitive results under the ﬁxed viewpoint settings, and signiﬁcantly outperforms the appli-cable methods under the arbitrary view setting.
