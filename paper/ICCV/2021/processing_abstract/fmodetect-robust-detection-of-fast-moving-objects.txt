We propose the first learning-based approach for fast moving objects detection. Such objects are highly blurred and move over large distances within one video frame. Fast moving objects are associated with a deblurring and mat-ting problem, also called deblatting. We show that the sep-aration of deblatting into consecutive matting and deblur-ring allows achieving real-time performance, i.e. an order of magnitude speed-up, and thus enabling new classes of application. The proposed method detects fast moving ob-jects as a truncated distance function to the trajectory by learning from synthetic data. For the sharp appearance es-timation and accurate trajectory estimation, we propose a matting and fitting network that estimates the blurred ap-pearance without background, followed by an energy min-imization based deblurring. The state-of-the-art methods are outperformed in terms of recall, precision, trajectory estimation, and sharp appearance reconstruction. Com-pared to other methods, such as deblatting, the inference is of several orders of magnitude faster and allows appli-cations such as real-time fast moving object detection and retrieval in large video collections.
