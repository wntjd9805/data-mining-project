City modeling is the foundation for computational ur-ban planning, navigation, and entertainment. In this work, we present the ﬁrst generative model of city blocks namedBlockPlanner, and showcase its ability to synthesize valid city blocks with varying land lots conﬁgurations. We pro-pose a novel vectorized city block representation utilizing a ring topology and a two-tier graph to capture the global and local structures of a city block. Each land lot is abstracted into a vector representation covering both its 3D geome-try and land use semantics. Such vectorized representation enables us to deploy a lightweight network to capture the underlying distribution of land lots conﬁgurations in a city block. To enforce intrinsic spatial constraints of a valid city block, a set of effective loss functions are imposed to shape rational results. We contribute a pilot city block dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of our repre-sentation and framework over the state-of-the-art. Notably, our BlockPlanner is also able to edit and manipulate city blocks, enabling several useful applications, e.g., topology reﬁnement and footprint generation.
