Most weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods follow the pipeline that generates pseudo-masks initially and trains the segmentation model with the pseudo-masks in fully supervised manner after. However, weﬁnd some matters related to the pseudo-masks, including high quality pseudo-masks generation from class activation maps (CAMs), and training with noisy pseudo-mask super-vision. For these matters, we propose the following designs to push the performance to new state-of-art: (i) Coefﬁcient of Variation Smoothing to smooth the CAMs adaptively; (ii) Proportional Pseudo-mask Generation to project the ex-panded CAMs to pseudo-mask based on a new metric indi-cating the importance of each class on each location, in-stead of the scores trained from binary classiﬁers. (iii) Pre-tended Under-Fitting strategy to suppress the inﬂuence of noise in pseudo-mask; (iv) Cyclic Pseudo-mask to boost the pseudo-masks during training of fully supervised semantic segmentation (FSSS). Experiments based on our methods achieve new state-of-art results on two changeling weakly supervised semantic segmentation datasets, pushing the mIoU to 70.0% and 40.2% on PAS-CAL VOC 2012 and MSCOCO 2014 respectively.
