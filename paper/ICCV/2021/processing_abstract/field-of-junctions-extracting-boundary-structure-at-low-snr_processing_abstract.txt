We introduce a bottom-up model for simultaneously find-ing many boundary elements in an image, including con-tours, corners and junctions. The model explains boundary shape in each small patch using a ‘generalized M -junction’ comprising M angles and a freely-moving vertex. Images are analyzed using non-convex optimization to coopera-tively find M + 2 junction values at every location, with spatial consistency being enforced by a novel regularizer that reduces curvature while preserving corners and junc-tions. The resulting ‘field of junctions’ is simultaneously a contour detector, corner/junction detector, and boundary-aware smoothing of regional appearance. Notably, its uni-fied analysis of contours, corners, junctions and uniform re-gions allows it to succeed at high noise levels, where other methods for segmentation and boundary detection fail.
