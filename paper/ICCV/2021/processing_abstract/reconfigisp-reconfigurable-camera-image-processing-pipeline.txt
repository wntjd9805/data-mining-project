Image Signal Processor (ISP) is a crucial component in digital cameras that transforms sensor signals into im-ages for us to perceive and understand. Existing ISP de-signs always adopt a fixed architecture, e.g., several se-quential modules connected in a rigid order. Such a fixedISP architecture may be suboptimal for real-world applica-tions, where camera sensors, scenes and tasks are diverse.In this study, we propose a novel Reconfigurable ISP (Re-configISP) whose architecture and parameters can be au-tomatically tailored to specific data and tasks. In particu-lar, we implement several ISP modules, and enable back-propagation for each module by training a differentiable proxy, hence allowing us to leverage the popular differen-tiable neural architecture search and effectively search for the optimal ISP architecture. A proxy tuning mechanism is adopted to maintain the accuracy of proxy networks in all cases. Extensive experiments conducted on image restora-tion and object detection, with different sensors, light con-ditions and efficiency constraints, validate the effectiveness of ReconfigISP. Only hundreds of parameters need tuning for every task1.
