In crowd counting, due to the problem of laborious la-belling, it is perceived intractability of collecting a new large-scale dataset which has plentiful images with large diversity in density, scene, etc. Thus, for learning a general model, training with data from multiple different datasets might be a remedy and be of great value. In this paper, we resort to the multi-domain joint learning and propose a sim-ple but effective Domain-specific Knowledge PropagatingNetwork (DKPNet) for unbiasedly learning the knowledge from multiple diverse data domains at the same time. It is mainly achieved by proposing the novel Variational Atten-tion(VA) technique for explicitly modeling the attention dis-tributions for different domains. And as an extension to VA,Intrinsic Variational Attention(InVA) is proposed to handle the problems of over-lapped domains and sub-domains. Ex-tensive experiments have been conducted to validate the su-periority of our DKPNet over several popular datasets, in-cluding ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF and NWPU.
