Most recent studies on detecting and localizing tempo-ral anomalies have mainly employed deep neural networks to learn the normal patterns of temporal data in an unsu-pervised manner. Unlike them, the goal of our work is to fully utilize instance-level (or weak) anomaly labels, which only indicate whether any anomalous events occurred or not in each instance of temporal data.In this paper, we present WETAS, a novel framework that effectively iden-tifies anomalous temporal segments (i.e., consecutive time points) in an input instance. WETAS learns discriminative features from the instance-level labels so that it infers the sequential order of normal and anomalous segments within each instance, which can be used as a rough segmentation mask. Based on the dynamic time warping (DTW) align-ment between the input instance and its segmentation mask,WETAS obtains the result of temporal segmentation, and si-multaneously, it further enhances itself by using the mask as additional supervision. Our experiments show that WETAS considerably outperforms other baselines in terms of the lo-calization of temporal anomalies, and also it provides more informative results than point-level detection methods.
