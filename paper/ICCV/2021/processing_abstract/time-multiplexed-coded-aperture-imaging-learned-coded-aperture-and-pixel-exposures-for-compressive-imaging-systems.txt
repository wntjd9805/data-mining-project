Compressive imaging using coded apertures (CA) is a powerful technique that can be used to recover depth, lightﬁelds, hyperspectral images and other quantities from a sin-gle snapshot. The performance of compressive imaging sys-tems based on CAs mostly depends on two factors: the prop-erties of the mask’s attenuation pattern, that we refer to as“codiﬁcation”, and the computational techniques used to recover the quantity of interest from the coded snapshot. In this work, we introduce the idea of using time-varying CAs synchronized with spatially varying pixel shutters. We di-vide the exposure of a sensor into sub-exposures at the be-ginning of which the CA mask changes and at which the sen-sor’s pixels are simultaneously and individually switched“on” or “off”. This is a practically appealing codiﬁcation as it does not introduce additional optical components other than the already present CA but uses a change in the pixel shutter that can be easily realized electronically. We show that our proposed time-multiplexed coded aperture (TMCA) can be optimized end to end and induces better coded snap-shots enabling superior reconstructions in two different ap-plications: compressive light ﬁeld imaging and hyperspec-tral imaging. We demonstrate both in simulation and with real captures (taken with prototypes we built) that this codi-ﬁcation outperforms the state-of-the-art compressive imag-ing systems by a large margin in those applications.
