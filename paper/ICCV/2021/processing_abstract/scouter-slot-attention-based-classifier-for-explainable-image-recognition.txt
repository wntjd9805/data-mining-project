Explainable artificial intelligence has been gaining at-tention in the past few years. However, most existing meth-ods are based on gradients or intermediate features, which are not directly involved in the decision-making process of the classifier.In this paper, we propose a slot attention-based classifier called SCOUTER for transparent yet ac-curate classification. Two major differences from other attention-based methods include: (a) SCOUTER’s expla-nation is involved in the final confidence for each category, offering more intuitive interpretation, and (b) all the cat-egories have their corresponding positive or negative ex-planation, which tells “why the image is of a certain cate-gory” or “why the image is not of a certain category.” We design a new loss tailored for SCOUTER that controls the model’s behavior to switch between positive and negative explanations, as well as the size of explanatory regions. Ex-perimental results show that SCOUTER can give better vi-sual explanations in terms of various metrics while keeping good accuracy on small and medium-sized datasets. Code is available1.
