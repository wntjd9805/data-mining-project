Existing methods often rely on estimated pseudo labels via itera-tive clustering and classiﬁcation, and they are unfortunately highly susceptible to performance penalties incurred by the inaccurate estimated number of clusters. Alternatively, we propose the Meta Pairwise Relationship Distillation (MPRD) method to estimate the pseudo labels of sample pairs for unsupervised person Re-ID. Speciﬁcally, it consists of a Con-volutional Neural Network (CNN) and Graph ConvolutionalNetwork (GCN), in which the GCN estimates the pseudo la-bels of sample pairs based on the current features extracted by CNN, and the CNN learns better features by involving high-ﬁdelity positive and negative sample pairs imposed by GCN. To achieve this goal, a small amount of labeled samples are used to guide GCN training, which can distill meta knowledge to judge the difference in the neighborhood structure between positive and negative sample pairs. Ex-tensive experiments on Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID andMSMT17 datasets show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches.
