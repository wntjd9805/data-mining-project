Existing research on autonomous driving primarily fo-cuses on urban driving, which is insufficient for charac-terising the complex driving behaviour underlying high-speed racing. At the same time, existing racing simula-tion frameworks struggle in capturing realism, with respect to visual rendering, vehicular dynamics, and task objec-tives, inhibiting the transfer of learning agents to real-world contexts. We introduce a new environment, where agents Learn-to-Race (L2R) in simulated competition-style racing, using multimodal informationâ€”from virtual cameras to a comprehensive array of inertial measure-ment sensors. Our environment, which includes a sim-ulator and an interfacing training framework, accuratelyIn this models vehicle dynamics and racing conditions. paper, we release the Arrival simulator for autonomous racing. Next, we propose the L2R task with challenging metrics, inspired by learning-to-drive challenges, Formula-style racing, and multimodal trajectory prediction for au-tonomous driving. Additionally, we provide the L2R frame-work suite, facilitating simulated racing on high-precision models of real-world tracks. Finally, we provide an offi-cial L2R task dataset of expert demonstrations, as well as a series of baseline experiments and reference implementa-tions. We make all code available: https://github. com/learn-to-race/l2r.Figure 1: Learn-to-Race interfaces with a racing simulator, which features numerous real-world racetracks such as the Thrux-ton Circuit (top-left) and Las Vegas Motor Speedway (top-right).Simulated race cars (bottom) are empowered with learning agents, tasked with the challenge of learning to race for the fastest lap-times and best metrics.
