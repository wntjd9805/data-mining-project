In this paper, we study a novel meta aggregation scheme towards binarizing graph neural networks (GNNs). We be-gin by developing a vanilla 1-bit GNN framework that bi-narizes both the GNN parameters and the graph features.Despite the lightweight architecture, we observed that this vanilla framework suffered from insufficient discriminative power in distinguishing graph topologies, leading to a dra-matic drop in performance. This discovery motivates us to devise meta aggregators to improve the expressive power of vanilla binarized GNNs, of which the aggregation schemes can be adaptively changed in a learnable manner based on the binarized features. Towards this end, we propose two dedicated forms of meta neighborhood aggregators, an ex-clusive meta aggregator termed as Greedy Gumbel Neigh-borhood Aggregator (GNA), and a diffused meta aggrega-tor termed as Adaptable Hybrid Neighborhood Aggregator (ANA). GNA learns to exclusively pick one single optimal aggregator from a pool of candidates, while ANA learns a hybrid aggregation behavior to simultaneously retain the benefits of several individual aggregators. Furthermore, the proposed meta aggregators may readily serve as a generic plugin module into existing full-precision GNNs. Exper-iments across various domains demonstrate that the pro-posed method yields results superior to the state of the art.
