Rapid progress in 3D semantic segmentation is insepara-ble from the advances of deep network models, which highly rely on large-scale annotated data for training. To address the high cost and challenges of 3D point-level labeling, we present a method for semi-supervised point cloud semantic segmentation to adopt unlabeled point clouds in training to boost the model performance. Inspired by the recent con-trastive loss in self-supervised tasks, we propose the guided point contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation and model generalization ability in semi-supervised setting.Semantic predictions on unlabeled point clouds serve as pseudo-label guidance in our loss to avoid negative pairs in the same category. Also, we design the confidence guid-ance to ensure high-quality feature learning. Besides, a category-balanced sampling strategy is proposed to col-lect positive and negative samples to mitigate the class im-balance problem. Extensive experiments on three datasets (ScanNet V2, S3DIS, and SemanticKITTI) show the effec-tiveness of our semi-supervised method to improve the pre-diction quality with unlabeled data.
