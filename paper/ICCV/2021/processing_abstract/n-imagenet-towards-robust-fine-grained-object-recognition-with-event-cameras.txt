We introduce N-ImageNet, a large-scale dataset targeted for robust, ﬁne-grained object recognition with event cam-eras. The dataset is collected using programmable hard-ware in which an event camera consistently moves around a monitor displaying images from ImageNet. N-ImageNet serves as a challenging benchmark for event-based object recognition, due to its large number of classes and sam-ples. We empirically show that pretraining on N-ImageNet improves the performance of event-based classiﬁers and helps them learn with few labeled data.In addition, we present several variants of N-ImageNet to test the robust-ness of event-based classiﬁers under diverse camera trajec-tories and severe lighting conditions, and propose a novel event representation to alleviate the performance degrada-tion. To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to quanti-tatively investigate the consequences caused by various en-vironmental conditions on event-based object recognition algorithms. N-ImageNet and its variants are expected to guide practical implementations for deploying event-based object recognition algorithms in the real world.
