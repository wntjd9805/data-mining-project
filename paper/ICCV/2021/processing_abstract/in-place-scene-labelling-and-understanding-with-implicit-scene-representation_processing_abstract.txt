Semantic labelling is highly correlated with geometry and radiance reconstruction, as scene entities with similar shape and appearance are more likely to come from similar classes. Recent implicit neural reconstruction techniques are appealing as they do not require prior training data, but the same fully self-supervised approach is not possible for semantics because labels are human-deﬁned properties.We extend neural radiance ﬁelds (NeRF) to jointly en-code semantics with appearance and geometry, so that com-plete and accurate 2D semantic labels can be achieved us-ing a small amount of in-place annotations speciﬁc to the scene. The intrinsic multi-view consistency and smoothness of NeRF beneﬁt semantics by enabling sparse labels to ef-ﬁciently propagate. We show the beneﬁt of this approach when labels are either sparse or very noisy in room-scale scenes. We demonstrate its advantageous properties in var-ious interesting applications such as an efﬁcient scene la-belling tool, novel semantic view synthesis, label denoising, super-resolution, label interpolation and multi-view seman-tic label fusion in visual semantic mapping systems.
