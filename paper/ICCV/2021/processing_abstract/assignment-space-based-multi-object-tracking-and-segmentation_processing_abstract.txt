Multi-object tracking and segmentation (MOTS) is im-portant for understanding dynamic scenes in video data.Existing methods perform well on multi-object detection and segmentation for independent video frames, but track-ing of objects over time remains a challenge. MOTS meth-ods formulate tracking locally, i.e., frame-by-frame, leading to sub-optimal results. Classical global methods on track-ing operate directly on object detections, which leads to a combinatorial growth in the detection space. In contrast, we formulate a global method for MOTS over the space of assignments rather than detections: First, we ﬁnd all top-k assignments of objects detected and segmented between any two consecutive frames and develop a structured prediction formulation to score assignment sequences across any num-ber of consecutive frames. We use dynamic programming toﬁnd the global optimizer of this formulation in polynomial time. Second, we connect objects which reappear after hav-ing been out of view for some time. For this we formulate an assignment problem. On the challenging KITTI-MOTS andMOTSChallenge datasets, this achieves state-of-the-art re-sults among methods which don’t use depth data.
