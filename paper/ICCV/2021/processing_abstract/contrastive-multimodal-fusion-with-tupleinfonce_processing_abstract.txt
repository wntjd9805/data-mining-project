This paper proposes a method for representation learning of multimodal data using contrastive losses. A traditional approach is to contrast different modalities to learn the infor-mation shared among them. However, that approach could fail to learn the complementary synergies between modal-ities that might be useful for downstream tasks. Another approach is to concatenate all the modalities into a tuple and then contrast positive and negative tuple correspondences.However, that approach could consider only the stronger modalities while ignoring the weaker ones. To address these issues, we propose a novel contrastive learning objective,TupleInfoNCE. It contrasts tuples based not only on posi-tive and negative correspondences, but also by composing new negative tuples using modalities describing different scenes. Training with these additional negatives encourages the learning model to examine the correspondences among modalities in the same tuple, ensuring that weak modalities are not ignored. We provide a theoretical justiﬁcation based on mutual-information for why this approach works, and we propose a sample optimization algorithm to generate posi-tive and negative samples to maximize training efﬁcacy. Weﬁnd that TupleInfoNCE signiﬁcantly outperforms previous state of the arts on three different downstream tasks.
