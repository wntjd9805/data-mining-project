Adversarial training is promising for improving robust-ness of deep neural networks towards adversarial pertur-bations, especially on the classification task. The effect of this type of training on semantic segmentation, contrarily, just commences. We make the initial attempt to explore the defense strategy on semantic segmentation by formulat-ing a general adversarial training procedure that can per-form decently on both adversarial and clean samples. We propose a dynamic divide-and-conquer adversarial training (DDC-AT) strategy to enhance the defense effect, by set-ting additional branches in the target model during train-ing, and dealing with pixels with diverse properties to-wards adversarial perturbation. Our dynamical division mechanism divides pixels into multiple branches automat-ically. Note all these additional branches can be aban-doned during inference and thus leave no extra parame-ter and computation cost. Extensive experiments with var-ious segmentation models are conducted on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, in which DDC-AT yields sat-isfying performance under both white- and black-box at-tack.
