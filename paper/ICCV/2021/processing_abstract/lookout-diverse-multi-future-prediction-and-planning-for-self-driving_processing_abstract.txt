In this paper, we present LOOKOUT, a novel autonomy system that perceives the environment, predicts a diverse set of futures of how the scene might unroll and estimates the trajectory of the SDV by optimizing a set of contingency plans over these future realizations. In particular, we learn a diverse joint distribution over multi-agent future trajec-tories in a trafﬁc scene that covers a wide range of future modes with high sample efﬁciency while leveraging the ex-pressive power of generative models. Unlike previous work in diverse motion forecasting, our diversity objective ex-plicitly rewards sampling future scenarios that require dis-tinct reactions from the self-driving vehicle for improved safety. Our contingency planner then ﬁnds comfortable and non-conservative trajectories that ensure safe reactions to a wide range of future scenarios. Through extensive evalu-ations, we show that our model demonstrates signiﬁcantly more diverse and sample-efﬁcient motion forecasting in a large-scale self-driving dataset as well as safer and less-conservative motion plans in long-term closed-loop simula-tions when compared to current state-of-the-art models.
