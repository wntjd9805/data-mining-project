CityCount ExamplesImage generation has rapidly evolved in recent years.Modern architectures for adversarial training allow to gen-erate even high resolution images with remarkable qual-ity. At the same time, more and more effort is dedicated towards controlling the content of generated images. In this paper, we take one further step in this direction and pro-pose a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) that generates images with a defined number of objects from given classes. This entails two fundamental abilities (1) being able to generate high-quality images given a com-plex constraint and (2) being able to count object instances per class in a given image. Our proposed model modu-larly extends the successful StyleGAN2 architecture with a count-based conditioning as well as with a regression sub-network to count the number of generated objects per class during training. In experiments on three different datasets, we show that the proposed model learns to generate im-ages according to the given multiple-class count condition even in the presence of complex backgrounds.In partic-ular, we propose a new dataset, CityCount, which is de-rived from the Cityscapes street scenes dataset, to eval-uate our approach in a challenging and practically rele-vant scenario.
