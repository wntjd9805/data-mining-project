Image and video enhancement such as color constancy, low light enhancement, and tone mapping on smartphones is challenging, because high-quality images should be achieved efﬁciently with a limited resource budget. Unlike prior works that either used very deep CNNs or large Trans-former models, we propose a structure-aware lightweightTransformer, termed STAR, for real-time image enhance-ment. STAR is formulated to capture long-range dependen-cies between image patches, which naturally and implicitly captures the structural relationships of different regions in an image. STAR is a general architecture that can be eas-ily adapted to different image enhancement tasks. Exten-sive experiments show that STAR can effectively boost the quality and efﬁciency of many tasks such as illumination enhancement, auto white balance, and photo retouching, which are indispensable components for image processing on smartphones. For example, STAR reduces model com-plexity and improves image quality compared to the recent state-of-the-art [19] on the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset [7] (i.e., 1.8dB PSNR improvements with 25% parameters and 13% ﬂoat operations.)
