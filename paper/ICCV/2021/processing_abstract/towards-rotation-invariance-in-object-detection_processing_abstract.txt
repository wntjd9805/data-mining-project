Rotation augmentations generally improve a modelâ€™s in-variance/equivariance to rotation - except in object detec-tion. In object detection the shape is not known, therefore rotation creates a label ambiguity. We show that the de-facto method for bounding box label rotation, the LargestBox Method, creates very large labels, leading to poor per-formance and in many cases worse performance than us-ing no rotation at all. We propose a new method of rota-tion augmentation that can be implemented in a few lines of code. First, we create a differentiable approximation of label accuracy and show that axis-aligning the bounding box around an ellipse is optimal. We then introduce Ro-tation Uncertainty (RU) Loss, allowing the model to adapt to the uncertainty of the labels. On five different datasets (including COCO, PascalVOC, and Transparent Object BinPicking), this approach improves the rotational invariance of both one-stage and two-stage architectures when mea-sured with AP, AP50, and AP75.
