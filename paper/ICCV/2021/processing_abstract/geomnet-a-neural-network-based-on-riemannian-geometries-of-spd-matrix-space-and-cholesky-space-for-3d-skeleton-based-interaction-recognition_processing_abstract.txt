In this paper, we propose a novel method for representa-tion and classiﬁcation of two-person interactions from 3D skeleton sequences. The key idea of our approach is to useGaussian distributions to capture statistics on Rn and those on the space of symmetric positive deﬁnite (SPD) matrices.The main challenge is how to parametrize those distribu-tions. Towards this end, we develop methods for embeddingGaussian distributions in matrix groups based on the the-ory of Lie groups and Riemannian symmetric spaces. Our method relies on the Riemannian geometry of the under-lying manifolds and has the advantage of encoding high-order statistics from 3D joint positions. We show that the proposed method achieves competitive results in two-person interaction recognition on three benchmarks for 3D human activity understanding.
