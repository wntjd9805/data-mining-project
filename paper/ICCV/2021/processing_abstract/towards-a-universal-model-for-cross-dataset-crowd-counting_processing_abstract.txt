This paper proposes to handle the practical problem of learning a universal model for crowd counting across scenes and datasets. We dissect that the crux of this prob-lem is the catastrophic sensitivity of crowd counters to scale shift, which is very common in the real world and caused by factors such as different scene layouts and image reso-lutions. Therefore it is difﬁcult to train a universal model that can be applied to various scenes. To address this prob-lem, we propose scale alignment as a prime module for es-tablishing a novel crowd counting framework. We derive a closed-form solution to get the optimal image rescaling factors for alignment by minimizing the distances between their scale distributions. A novel neural network together with a loss function based on an efﬁcient sliced Wasser-stein distance is also proposed for scale distribution es-timation. Beneﬁting from the proposed method, we have learned a universal model that generally works well on sev-eral datasets where can even outperform state-of-the-art models that are particularly ﬁne-tuned for each dataset sig-niﬁcantly. Experiments also demonstrate the much better generalizability of our model to unseen scenes.
