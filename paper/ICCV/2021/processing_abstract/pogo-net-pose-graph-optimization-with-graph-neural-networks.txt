Accurate camera pose estimation or global camera re-localization is a core component in Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and SLAM systems. Given pair-wise relative cam-era poses, pose-graph optimization (PGO) involves solving for an optimized set of globally-consistent absolute camera poses. In this work, we propose a novel PGO scheme fu-eled by graph neural networks (GNN), namely PoGO-Net, to conduct the absolute camera pose regression leverag-ing multiple rotation averaging (MRA). Speciﬁcally, PoGO-Net takes a noisy view-graph as the input, where the nodes and edges are designed to encode the geometric constraints and local graph consistency. Besides, we address the out-lier edge removal by exploiting an implicit edge-dropping scheme where the noisy or corrupted edges are effectivelyﬁltered out with parameterized networks. Furthermore, we introduce a joint loss function embedding MRA formulation such that the robust inference is capable of achieving real-time performances even for large-scale scenes. Our pro-posed network is trained end-to-end on public benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches in extensive ex-periments that demonstrate the efﬁciency and robustness of our proposed network.
