w/o Prior  adaptation w/ Prior  adaptationCategory-level 6D object pose estimation aims to predict the position and orientation for unseen objects, which plays a pillar role in many scenarios such as robotics and aug-mented reality. The signiﬁcant intra-class variation is the bottleneck challenge in this task yet remains unsolved so far.In this paper, we take advantage of category prior to over-come this problem by innovating a structure-guided prior adaptation scheme to accurately estimate 6D pose for in-dividual objects. Different from existing prior based meth-ods, given one object and its corresponding category prior, we propose to leverage their structure similarity to dynam-ically adapt the prior to the observed object. The prior adaptation intrinsically associates the adopted prior with different objects, from which we can accurately reconstruct the 3D canonical model of the speciﬁc object for pose es-timation. To further enhance the structure characteristic of objects, we extract low-rank structure points from the dense object point cloud, therefore more efﬁciently incorporating sparse structural information during prior adaptation. Ex-tensive experiments on CAMERA25 and REAL275 bench-marks demonstrate signiﬁcant performance improvement.Project homepage: https://www.cse.cuhk.edu. hk/˜kaichen/projects/sgpa/sgpa.html.
