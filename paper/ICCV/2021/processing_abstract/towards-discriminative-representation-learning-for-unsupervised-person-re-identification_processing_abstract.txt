In this work, we address the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for person re-ID where annotations are available for the source domain but not for target. Previous methods typically follow a two-stage optimization pipeline, where the network is ﬁrst pre-trained on source and thenﬁne-tuned on target with pseudo labels created by feature clustering. Such methods sustain two main limitations. (1)The label noise may hinder the learning of discriminative features for recognizing target classes. (2) The domain gap may hinder knowledge transferring from source to target.We propose three types of technical schemes to alleviate these issues. First, we propose a cluster-wise contrastive learning algorithm (CCL) by iterative optimization of fea-ture learning and cluster reﬁnery to learn noise-tolerant representations in the unsupervised manner. Second, we adopt a progressive domain adaptation (PDA) strategy to gradually mitigate the domain gap between source and tar-get data. Third, we propose Fourier augmentation (FA) for further maximizing the class separability of re-ID models by imposing extra constraints in the Fourier space. We observe that these proposed schemes are capable of facilitating the learning of discriminative feature representations. Exper-iments demonstrate that our method consistently achieves notable improvements over the state-of-the-art unsupervised re-ID methods on multiple benchmarks, e.g., surpassingMMT largely by 8.1%, 9.9%, 11.4% and 11.1% mAP on the Market-to-Duke, Duke-to-Market, Market-to-MSMT andDuke-to-MSMT tasks, respectively.*Corresponding authorFigure 1. Given labeled source data and unlabeled target data, our goal is to learn feature representations for recognizing target classes.For this unsupervised domain adaptation task, we propose three technical schemes to learn discriminative target features: (a) cluster-wise contrastive learning, (b) progressive domain adaptation (c)Fourier augmentation.
