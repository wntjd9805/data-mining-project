Fast arbitrary neural style transfer has attracted widespread attention from academic, industrial and art communities due to its flexibility in enabling various ap-plications. Existing solutions either attentively fuse deep style feature into deep content feature without considering feature distributions, or adaptively normalize deep content feature according to the style such that their global statistics are matched. Although effective, leaving shallow feature unexplored and without locally considering feature statis-tics, they are prone to unnatural output with unpleasing lo-cal distortions. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel attention and normalization module, namedAdaptive Attention Normalization (AdaAttN), to adaptively perform attentive normalization on per-point basis. Specif-ically, spatial attention score is learnt from both shallow and deep features of content and style images. Then per-point weighted statistics are calculated by regarding a style feature point as a distribution of attention-weighted out-put of all style feature points. Finally, the content fea-ture is normalized so that they demonstrate the same lo-cal feature statistics as the calculated per-point weighted style feature statistics. Besides, a novel local feature loss is derived based on AdaAttN to enhance local visual qual-ity. We also extend AdaAttN to be ready for video style transfer with slight modifications. Experiments demon-strate that our method achieves state-of-the-art arbitrary image/video style transfer. Codes and models are available on https://github.com/wzmsltw/AdaAttN.
