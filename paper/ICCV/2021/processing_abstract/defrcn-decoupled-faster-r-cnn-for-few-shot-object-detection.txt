Few-shot object detection, which aims at detecting novel objects rapidly from extremely few annotated examples of previously unseen classes, has attracted significant research interest in the community. Most existing approaches employ the Faster R-CNN as basic detection framework, yet, due to the lack of tailored considerations for data-scarce scenario, their performance is often not satisfactory. In this paper, we look closely into the conventional Faster R-CNN and an-alyze its contradictions from two orthogonal perspectives, namely multi-stage (RPN vs. RCNN) and multi-task (clas-sification vs. localization). To resolve these issues, we pro-pose a simple yet effective architecture, named DecoupledFaster R-CNN (DeFRCN). To be concrete, we extend FasterR-CNN by introducing Gradient Decoupled Layer for multi-stage decoupling and Prototypical Calibration Block for multi-task decoupling. The former is a novel deep layer with redefining the feature-forward operation and gradient-backward operation for decoupling its subsequent layer and preceding layer, and the latter is an offline prototype-based classification model with taking the proposals from detec-tor as input and boosting the original classification scores with additional pairwise scores for calibration. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show our framework is remarkably superior to other existing approaches and es-tablishes a new state-of-the-art in few-shot literature 1.
