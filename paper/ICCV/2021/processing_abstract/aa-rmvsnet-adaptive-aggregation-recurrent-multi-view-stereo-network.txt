In this paper, we present a novel recurrent multi-view stereo network based on long short-term memory (LSTM) with adaptive aggregation, namely AA-RMVSNet. We firstly introduce an intra-view aggregation module to adaptively extract image features by using context-aware convolution and multi-scale aggregation, which efficiently improves the performance on challenging regions, such as thin objects and large low-textured surfaces. To overcome the diffi-culty of varying occlusion in complex scenes, we propose an inter-view cost volume aggregation module for adap-tive pixel-wise view aggregation, which is able to pre-serve better-matched pairs among all views. The two pro-posed adaptive aggregation modules are lightweight, ef-fective and complementary regarding improving the ac-curacy and completeness of 3D reconstruction.Instead of conventional 3D CNNs, we utilize a hybrid network with recurrent structure for cost volume regularization, which allows high-resolution reconstruction and finer hy-pothetical plane sweep. The proposed network is trained end-to-end and achieves excellent performance on variousIt ranks 1st among all submissions on Tanks datasets. and Temples benchmark and achieves competitive results on DTU dataset, which exhibits strong generalizability and robustness.
