Point cloud segmentation is a fundamental task in 3D.Despite recent progress on point cloud segmentation with the power of deep networks, current deep learning meth-ods based on the clean label assumptions may fail with noisy labels. Yet, object class labels are often mislabeled in real-world point cloud datasets. In this work, we take the lead in solving this issue by proposing a novel PointNoise-Adaptive Learning (PNAL) framework. Compared to existing noise-robust methods on image tasks, our PNAL is noise-rate blind, to cope with the spatially variant noise rate problem speciﬁc to point clouds . Speciﬁcally, we pro-pose a novel point-wise conﬁdence selection to obtain reli-able labels based on the historical predictions of each point.A novel cluster-wise label correction is proposed with a vot-ing strategy to generate the best possible label taking the neighbor point correlations into consideration. We con-duct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of PNAL on both synthetic and real-world noisy datasets. In particular, even with 60% symmetric noisy labels, our pro-posed method produces much better results than its baseline counterpart without PNAL and is comparable to the ideal upper bound trained on a completely clean dataset. More-over, we fully re-labeled the validation set of a popular but noisy real-world scene dataset ScanNetV2 to make it clean, for rigorous experiment and future research. Our code and data will be released.
