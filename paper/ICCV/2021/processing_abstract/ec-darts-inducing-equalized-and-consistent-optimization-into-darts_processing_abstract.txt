However, the unbalanced com-petition among operations that have different trainable pa-rameters causes the model collapse. Besides, the inconsis-tent structures in the search and retraining stages causes cross-stage evaluation to be unstable.In this paper, we call these issues as an operation gap and a structure gap inDARTS. To shrink these gaps, we propose to induce equal-ized and consistent optimization in differentiable architec-ture search (EC-DARTS). EC-DARTS decouples different operations based on their categories to optimize the op-eration weights so that the operation gap between them is shrinked. Besides, we introduce an induced structural tran-sition to bridge the structure gap between the model struc-tures in the search and retraining stages. Extensive experi-ments on CIFAR10 and ImageNet demonstrate the effective-ness of our method. Speciﬁcally, on CIFAR10, we achieve a test error of 2.39%, while only 0.3 GPU days on NVIDIATITAN V. On ImageNet, our method achieves a top-1 error of 23.6% under the mobile setting.
