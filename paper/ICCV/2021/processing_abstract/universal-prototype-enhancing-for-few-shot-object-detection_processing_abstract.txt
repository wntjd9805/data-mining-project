Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to strengthen the performance of novel object detection with few labeled sam-ples. To alleviate the constraint of few samples, enhancing the generalization ability of learned features for novel ob-jects plays a key role. Thus, the feature learning process ofFSOD should focus more on intrinsical object characteris-tics, which are invariant under different visual changes and therefore are helpful for feature generalization. Unlike pre-vious attempts of the meta-learning paradigm, in this paper, we explore how to enhance object features with intrinsical characteristics that are universal across different object cat-egories. We propose a new prototype, namely universal pro-totype, that is learned from all object categories. Besides the advantage of characterizing invariant characteristics, the universal prototypes alleviate the impact of unbalanced object categories. After enhancing object features with the universal prototypes, we impose a consistency loss to max-imize the agreement between the enhanced features and the original ones, which is beneÔ¨Åcial for learning invari-ant object characteristics. Thus, we develop a new frame-work of few-shot object detection with universal prototypes (F SODup) that owns the merit of feature generalization towards novel objects. Experimental results on PASCALVOC and MS COCO show the effectiveness of F SODup.Particularly, for the 1-shot case of VOC Split2, F SODup outperforms the baseline by 6.8% in terms of mAP.
