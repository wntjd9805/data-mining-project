Localizing individuals in crowds is more in accordance with the practical demands of subsequent high-level crowd analysis tasks than simply counting. However, existing localization based methods relying on intermediate rep-resentations (i.e., density maps or pseudo boxes) serving as learning targets are counter-intuitive and error-prone.In this paper, we propose a purely point-based framework for joint crowd counting and individual localization. For this framework, instead of merely reporting the absolute counting error at image level, we propose a new metric, called density Normalized Average Precision (nAP), to pro-vide more comprehensive and more precise performance evaluation. Moreover, we design an intuitive solution un-der this framework, which is called Point to Point Network (P2PNet). P2PNet discards superﬂuous steps and directly predicts a set of point proposals to represent heads in an image, being consistent with the human annotation results.By thorough analysis, we reveal the key step towards im-plementing such a novel idea is to assign optimal learn-ing targets for these proposals. Therefore, we propose to conduct this crucial association in an one-to-one match-ing manner using the Hungarian algorithm. The P2PNet not only signiﬁcantly surpasses state-of-the-art methods on popular counting benchmarks, but also achieves promis-ing localization accuracy. The codes will be available at:TencentYoutuResearch/CrowdCounting-P2PNet.
