Group activity recognition aims to understand the ac-In order to solve tivity performed by a group of people. it, modeling complex spatio-temporal interactions is the key. Previous methods are limited in reasoning on a prede-fined graph, which ignores the inherent person-specific in-teraction context. Moreover, they adopt inference schemes that are computationally expensive and easily result in the over-smoothing problem.In this paper, we manage to achieve spatio-temporal person-specific inferences by proposing Dynamic Inference Network (DIN), which com-poses of Dynamic Relation (DR) module and Dynamic Walk (DW) module. We firstly propose to initialize interaction fields on a primary spatio-temporal graph. Within each interaction field, we apply DR to predict the relation ma-trix and DW to predict the dynamic walk offsets in a joint-processing manner, thus forming a person-specific interac-tion graph. By updating features on the specific graph, a person can possess a global-level interaction field with a local initialization. Experiments indicate both modulesâ€™ ef-fectiveness. Moreover, DIN1 achieves significant improve-ment compared to previous state-of-the-art methods on two popular datasets under the same setting, while costing much less computation overhead of the reasoning module.
