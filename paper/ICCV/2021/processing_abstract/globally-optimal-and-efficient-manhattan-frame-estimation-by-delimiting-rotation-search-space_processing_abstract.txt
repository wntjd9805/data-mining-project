A typical man-made structure can be abstracted as theManhattan world assumption, in which notion is further represented as a Manhattan Frame (MF) deﬁned by three orthogonal axes. The problem of MF estimation can be for-mulated as the solution of the rotation between the MF and the camera frame (called the ”MF rotation”). However, the whole rotation space is quite redundant for solving the MF rotation, which is one of the main factors that disturb the computational efﬁciency of those methods associated with a rotation space search. This paper proves that the vol-ume of the space that just contains all MF rotations (called the ”MFR space”) is only 1 / 24 of that of the whole ro-tation space, and then an exact MFR space is delimited from the rotation space. Searching in the delimited MFR space, the MF estimation solved by a branch-and-bound (BnB) framework guarantees stability and efﬁciency simul-taneously. Furthermore, the general rotation problems as-sociated with a rotation space search are solved more ef-ﬁciently. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets have successfully conﬁrmed the validity of our approach.
