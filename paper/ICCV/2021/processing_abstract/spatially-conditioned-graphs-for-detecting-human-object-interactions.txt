We address the problem of detecting humanâ€“object inter-actions in images using graphical neural networks. Unlike conventional methods, where nodes send scaled but oth-erwise identical messages to each of their neighbours, we propose to condition messages between pairs of nodes on their spatial relationships, resulting in different messages going to neighbours of the same node. To this end, we ex-plore various ways of applying spatial conditioning under a multi-branch structure. Through extensive experimentation we demonstrate the advantages of spatial conditioning for the computation of the adjacency structure, messages and the refined graph features.In particular, we empirically show that as the quality of the bounding boxes increases, their coarse appearance features contribute relatively less to the disambiguation of interactions compared to the spa-tial information. Our method achieves an mAP of 31.33% on HICO-DET and 54.2% on V-COCO, significantly out-performing state-of-the-art on fine-tuned detections.
