We derive computed tomography (CT) of a time-varying volumetric scattering object, using a small number of mov-ing cameras. We focus on passive tomography of dynamic clouds, as clouds have a major effect on the Earth’s cli-mate. State of the art scattering CT assumes a static object.Existing 4D CT methods rely on a linear image formation model and often on signiﬁcant priors. In this paper, the an-gular and temporal sampling rates needed for a proper re-covery are discussed. Spatiotemporal CT is achieved using gradient-based optimization, which accounts for the corre-lation time of the dynamic object content. We demonstrate this in physics-based simulations and on experimental real-world data.
