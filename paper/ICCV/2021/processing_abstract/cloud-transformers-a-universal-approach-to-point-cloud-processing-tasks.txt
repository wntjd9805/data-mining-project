We present a new versatile building block for deep point cloud processing architectures that is equally suited for diverse tasks. This building block combines the ideas of spatial transformers and multi-view convolutional networks with the efﬁciency of standard convolutional layers in two and three-dimensional dense grids. The new block oper-ates via multiple parallel heads, whereas each head dif-ferentiably rasterizes feature representations of individual points into a low-dimensional space, and then uses dense convolution to propagate information across points. The results of the processing of individual heads are then com-bined together resulting in the update of point features.Using the new block, we build architectures for both dis-criminative (point cloud segmentation, point cloud classiﬁ-cation) and generative (point cloud inpainting and image-based point cloud reconstruction) tasks. The resulting ar-chitectures achieve state-of-the-art performance for these tasks, demonstrating the versatility of the new block for point cloud processing.
