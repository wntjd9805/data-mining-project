Image style transfer aims to transfer the styles of art-works onto arbitrary photographs to create novel artistic images. Although style transfer is inherently an underde-termined problem, existing approaches usually assume a deterministic solution, thus failing to capture the full dis-tribution of possible outputs. To address this limitation, we propose a Diverse Image Style Transfer (DIST) framework which achieves significant diversity by enforcing an invert-ible cross-space mapping. Specifically, the framework con-sists of three branches: disentanglement branch, inverse branch, and stylization branch. Among them, the disen-tanglement branch factorizes artworks into content space and style space; the inverse branch encourages the invert-ible mapping between the latent space of input noise vec-tors and the style space of generated artistic images; the* Corresponding author stylization branch renders the input content image with the style of an artist. Armed with these three branches, our ap-proach is able to synthesize significantly diverse stylized im-ages without loss of quality. We conduct extensive experi-ments and comparisons to evaluate our approach qualita-tively and quantitatively. The experimental results demon-strate the effectiveness of our method.
