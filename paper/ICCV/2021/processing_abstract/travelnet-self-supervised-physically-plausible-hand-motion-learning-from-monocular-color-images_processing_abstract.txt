This paper aims to reconstruct physically plausible hand motion from monocular color images. Existing frame-by-frame estimating approaches can not guarantee the physi-cal plausibility (e.g. penetration, jittering) directly. In this paper, we embed physical constraints on the per-frame esti-mated motions in both spatial and temporal space. Our key idea is to adopt a self-supervised learning strategy to train a novel encoder-decoder, named TravelNet, whose training motion data is prepared by the physics engine using discrete pose states. TravelNet captures key pose states from hand motion sequences as compact motion descriptors, inspired by the concept of keyframes in animation. Finally, it man-ages to extract those key states out of perturbations without manual annotations, and reconstruct the motions preserv-In the experiments, ing details and physical plausibility. we show that the outputs of the TravelNet contain both ﬁn-ger synergism and time consistency. Through the proposed framework, hand motions can be accurately reconstructed and ﬂexibly re-edited, which is superior to the state-of-the-art methods.
