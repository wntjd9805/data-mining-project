The classiﬁcation and regression head are both indis-pensable components to build up a dense object detector, which are usually supervised by the same training samples and thus expected to have consistency with each other forIn detecting objects accurately in the detection pipeline. this paper, we break the convention of the same training samples for these two heads in dense detectors and explore a novel supervisory paradigm, termed as Mutual Supervi-sion (MuSu), to respectively and mutually assign training samples for the classiﬁcation and regression head to en-sure this consistency. MuSu deﬁnes training samples for the regression head mainly based on classiﬁcation predict-ing scores and in turn, deﬁnes samples for the classiﬁcation head based on localization scores from the regression head.Experimental results show that the convergence of detec-tors trained by this mutual supervision is guaranteed and the effectiveness of the proposed method is veriﬁed on the challenging MS COCO benchmark. We also ﬁnd that tiling more anchors at the same location beneﬁts detectors and leads to further improvements under this training scheme.We hope this work can inspire further researches on the in-teraction of the classiﬁcation and regression task in detec-tion and the supervision paradigm for detectors, especially separately for these two heads.
