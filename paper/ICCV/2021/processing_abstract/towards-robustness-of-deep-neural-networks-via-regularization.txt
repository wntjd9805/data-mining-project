Recent studies have demonstrated the vulnerability of deep neural networks against adversarial examples.In-spired by the observation that adversarial examples often lie outside the natural image data manifold and the intrin-sic dimension of image data is much smaller than its pixel space dimension, we propose to embed high-dimensional input images into a low-dimensional space and apply regu-larization on the embedding space to push the adversarial examples back to the manifold. The proposed framework is called Embedding Regularized Classiﬁer (ER-Classiﬁer), which improves the adversarial robustness of the classi-ﬁer through embedding regularization. Besides improving classiﬁcation accuracy against adversarial examples, the framework can be combined with detection methods to de-tect adversarial examples. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that, our proposed framework achieves good performance against strong adversarial at-tack methods.
