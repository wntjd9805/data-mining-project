Semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have at-tracted much attentions in medical image segmentation by leveraging unlabeled data, which challenge in acquir-ing massive pixel-wise annotated samples. However, most of the existing SSLs neglected the geometric shape con-straint in object, leading to unsatisfactory boundary and non-smooth of object.In this paper, we propose a novel boundary-aware semi-supervised medical image segmenta-tion network, named Graph-BAS3Net, which incorporates the boundary information and learns duality constraints between semantics and geometrics in the graph domain.Speciﬁcally, the proposed method consists of two compo-nents: a multi-task learning framework BAS3Net and a graph-based cross-task module BGCM. The BAS3Net im-proves the existing GAN-based SSL by adding a bound-ary detection task, which encodes richer features of object shape and surface. Moreover, the BGCM further explores the co-occurrence relations between the semantics segmen-tation and boundary detection task, so that the network learns stronger semantic and geometric correspondences from both labeled and unlabeled data. Experimental results on the LiTS dataset and COVID-19 dataset conﬁrm that our proposed Graph-BAS3Net outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in semi-supervised segmentation task.
