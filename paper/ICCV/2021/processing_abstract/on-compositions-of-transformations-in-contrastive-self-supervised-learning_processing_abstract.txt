In the image domain, excellent representations can be learned by inducing invariance to content-preserving trans-formations via noise contrastive learning. In this paper, we generalize contrastive learning to a wider set of transforma-tions, and their compositions, for which either invariance or distinctiveness is sought. We show that it is not imme-diately obvious how existing methods such as SimCLR can be extended to do so. Instead, we introduce a number of formal requirements that all contrastive formulations must satisfy, and propose a practical construction which satisﬁes these requirements. In order to maximise the reach of this analysis, we express all components of noise contrastive formulations as the choice of certain generalized transfor-mations of the data (GDTs), including data sampling. We then consider videos as an example of data in which a large variety of transformations are applicable, accounting for the extra modalities – for which we analyze audio and text – and the dimension of time. We ﬁnd that being invariant to certain transformations and distinctive to others is crit-ical to learning effective video representations, improving the state-of-the-art for multiple benchmarks by a large mar-gin, and even surpassing supervised pretraining.
