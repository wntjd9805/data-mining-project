Recent research has shown that it is possible to find in-terpretable directions in the latent spaces of pre-trainedGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs). These directions enable controllable image generation and support a wide range of semantic editing operations, such as zoom or ro-tation. The discovery of such directions is often done in a supervised or semi-supervised manner and requires manual annotations which limits their use in practice. In compari-son, unsupervised discovery allows finding subtle directions that are difficult to detect a priori. In this work, we propose a contrastive learning-based approach to discover semantic†Equal contribution.
