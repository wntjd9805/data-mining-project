We propose a new method to detect deepfake images us-ing the cue of the source feature inconsistency within the forged images. It is based on the hypothesis that imagesâ€™ distinct source features can be preserved and extracted af-ter going through state-of-the-art deepfake generation pro-cesses. We introduce a novel representation learning ap-proach, called pair-wise self-consistency learning (PCL), for training ConvNets to extract these source features and detect deepfake images.It is accompanied by a new im-age synthesis approach, called inconsistency image genera-tor (I2G), to provide richly annotated training data for PCL.Experimental results on seven popular datasets show that our models improve averaged AUC over the state of the art from 96.45% to 98.05% in the in-dataset evaluation and from 86.03% to 92.18% in the cross-dataset evaluation.
