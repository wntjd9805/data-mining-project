Reversible image conversion (RIC) aims to build a re-versible transformation between speciﬁc visual content (e.g., short videos) and an embedding image, where the original content can be restored from the embedding when necessary.This work develops Invertible Image Conversion Net (IIC-Net) as a generic solution to various RIC tasks due to its strong capacity and task-independent design. Unlike pre-vious encoder-decoder based methods, IICNet maintains a highly invertible structure based on invertible neural net-*Joint ﬁrst authors works (INNs) to better preserve the information during con-version. We use a relation module and a channel squeeze layer to improve the INN nonlinearity to extract cross-image relations and the network ﬂexibility, respectively. Exper-imental results demonstrate that IICNet outperforms the speciﬁcally-designed methods on existing RIC tasks and can generalize well to various newly-explored tasks. With our generic IICNet, we no longer need to hand-engineer task-speciﬁc embedding networks for rapidly occurring vi-sual content.
