Interpreting the decision logic behind effective deep con-volutional neural networks (CNN) on images complements the success of deep learning models. However, the existing methods can only interpret some speciﬁc decision logic on individual or a small number of images. To facilitate hu-man understandability and generalization ability, it is im-portant to develop representative interpretations that inter-pret common decision logics of a CNN on a large group of similar images, which reveal the common semantics data contributes to many closely related predictions. In this pa-per, we develop a novel unsupervised approach to produce a highly representative interpretation for a large number of similar images. We formulate the problem of ﬁnding rep-resentative interpretations as a co-clustering problem, and convert it into a submodular cost submodular cover prob-lem based on a sample of the linear decision boundaries of aCNN. We also present a visualization and similarity ranking method. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the excel-lent performance of our method.
