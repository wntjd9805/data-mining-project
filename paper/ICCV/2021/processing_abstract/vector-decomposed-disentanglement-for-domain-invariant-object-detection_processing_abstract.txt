To improve the generalization of detectors, for domain adaptive object detection (DAOD), recent advances mainly explore aligning feature-level distributions between the source and single-target domain, which may neglect the im-pact of domain-speciﬁc information existing in the aligned features. Towards DAOD, it is important to extract domain-invariant object representations. To this end, in this pa-per, we try to disentangle domain-invariant representations from domain-speciﬁc representations. And we propose a novel disentangled method based on vector decomposition.Firstly, an extractor is devised to separate domain-invariant representations from the input, which are used for extract-ing object proposals. Secondly, domain-speciﬁc represen-tations are introduced as the differences between the input and domain-invariant representations. Through the differ-ence operation, the gap between the domain-speciﬁc and domain-invariant representations is enlarged, which pro-motes domain-invariant representations to contain more domain-irrelevant information. In the experiment, we sep-arately evaluate our method on the single- and compound-target case. For the single-target case, experimental results of four domain-shift scenes show our method obtains a sig-niﬁcant performance gain over baseline methods. More-over, for the compound-target case (i.e., the target is a com-pound of two different domains without domain labels), our method outperforms baseline methods by around 4%, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.
