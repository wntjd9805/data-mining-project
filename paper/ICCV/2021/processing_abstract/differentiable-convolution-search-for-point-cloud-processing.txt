Exploiting convolutional neural networks for point cloud processing is quite challenging, due to the inherent irregu-lar distribution and discrete shape representation of point clouds. To address these problems, many handcrafted con-volution variants have sprung up in recent years. Though with elaborate design, these variants could be far from op-timal in sufﬁciently capturing diverse shapes formed by dis-crete points. In this paper, we propose PointSeaConv, i.e., a novel differential convolution search paradigm on point clouds.It can work in a purely data-driven manner and thus is capable of auto-creating a group of suitable con-volutions for geometric shape modeling. We also propose a joint optimization framework for simultaneous search of internal convolution and external architecture, and intro-duce epsilon-greedy algorithm to alleviate the effect of dis-cretization error. As a result, PointSeaNet, a deep network that is sufﬁcient to capture geometric shapes at both con-volution level and architecture level, can be searched out for point cloud processing. Extensive experiments strong-ly evidence that our proposed PointSeaNet surpasses cur-rent handcrafted deep models on challenging benchmarks across multiple tasks with remarkable margins.
