Crowd counting is a difﬁcult task because of the diver-sity of scenes. Most of the existing crowd counting meth-ods adopt complex structures with massive backbones to enhance the generalization ability. Unfortunately, the per-formance of existing methods on large-scale data sets is not satisfactory. In order to handle various scenarios with less complex network, we explored how to efﬁciently use the multi-expert model for crowd counting tasks. We mainly fo-cus on how to train more efﬁcient expert networks and how to choose the most suitable expert. Speciﬁcally, we pro-pose a task-driven similarity metric based on sample’s mu-tual enhancement, referred as co-ﬁne-tune similarity, which can ﬁnd a more efﬁcient subset of data for training the ex-pert network. Similar samples are considered as a clus-ter which is used to obtain parameters of an expert. Be-sides, to make better use of the proposed method, we design a simple network called FPN with Deconvolution Count-ing Network, which is a more suitable base model for the multi-expert counting network. Experimental results show that multiple experts FDC (MFDC) achieves the best per-formance on four public data sets, including the large scaleNWPU-Crowd data set. Furthermore, the MFDC trained on an extensive dense crowd data set can generalize well on the other data sets without extra training or ﬁne-tuning.1
