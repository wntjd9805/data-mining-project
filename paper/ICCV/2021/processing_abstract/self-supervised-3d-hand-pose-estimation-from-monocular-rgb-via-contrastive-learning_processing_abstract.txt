Encouraged by the success of contrastive learning on im-age classification tasks, we propose a new self-supervised method for the structured regression task of 3D hand pose estimation. Contrastive learning makes use of unlabeled data for the purpose of representation learning via a loss formulation that encourages the learned feature represen-tations to be invariant under any image transformation. For 3D hand pose estimation, it too is desirable to have in-variance to appearance transformation such as color jit-ter. However, the task requires equivariance under affine transformations, such as rotation and translation. To ad-dress this issue, we propose an equivariant contrastive ob-jective and demonstrate its effectiveness in the context of 3D hand pose estimation. We experimentally investigate the impact of invariant and equivariant contrastive objec-tives and show that learning equivariant features leads to better representations for the task of 3D hand pose esti-mation. Furthermore, we show that standard ResNets with sufficient depth, trained on additional unlabeled data, at-tain improvements of up to 14.5% in PA-EPE on FreiHAND and thus achieves state-of-the-art performance without any task specific, specialized architectures.
