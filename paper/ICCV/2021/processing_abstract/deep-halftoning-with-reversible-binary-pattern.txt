Existing halftoning algorithms usually drop colors andﬁne details when dithering color images with binary dot patterns, which makes it extremely difﬁcult to recover the original information. To dispense the recovery trouble in fu-ture, we propose a novel halftoning technique that converts a color image into binary halftone with full restorability to the original version. The key idea is to implicitly embed those previously dropped information into the halftone pat-terns. So, the halftone pattern not only serves to reproduce the image tone, maintain the blue-noise randomness, but al-so represents the color information and ﬁne details. To this end, we exploit two collaborative convolutional neural net-works (CNNs) to learn the dithering scheme, under a non-trivial self-supervision formulation. To tackle the ﬂatness degradation issue of CNNs, we propose a novel noise incen-tive block (NIB) that can serve as a generic CNN plug-in for performance promotion. At last, we tailor a guiding-aware training scheme that secures the convergence direction as regulated. We evaluate the invertible halftones in multiple aspects, which evidences the effectiveness of our method.
