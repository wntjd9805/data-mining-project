In click-based interactive segmentation, the mask extrac-tion process is dictated by positive/negative user clicks; however, most existing methods do not fully exploit the user cues, requiring excessive numbers of clicks for sat-isfactory results. We propose Conditional Diffusion Net-work (CDNet), which propagates labeled representations from clicks to conditioned destinations with two levels of affinities: Feature Diffusion Module (FDM) spreads fea-tures from clicks to potential target regions with global simi-larity; Pixel Diffusion Module (PDM) diffuses the predicted logits of clicks within locally connected regions. Thus, the information inferred by user clicks could be generalized to proper destinations. In addition, we put forward DiversifiedTraining (DT), which reduces the optimization ambiguity caused by click simulation. With FDM,PDM and DT, CD-Net could better understand userâ€™s intentions and make bet-ter predictions with limited interactions. CDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.
