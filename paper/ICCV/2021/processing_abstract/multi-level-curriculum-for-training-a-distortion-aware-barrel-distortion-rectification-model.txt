Barrel distortion rectiﬁcation aims at removing the ra-dial distortion in a distorted image captured by a wide-angle lens. Previous deep learning methods mainly solve this problem by learning the implicit distortion parameters or the nonlinear rectiﬁed mapping function in a direct man-ner. However, this type of manner results in an indistinct learning process of rectiﬁcation and thus limits the deep perception of distortion. In this paper, inspired by the cur-riculum learning, we analyze the barrel distortion rectiﬁ-cation task in a progressive and meaningful manner. By considering the relationship among different construction levels in an image, we design a multi-level curriculum that disassembles the rectiﬁcation task into three levels, struc-ture recovery, semantics embedding, and texture rendering.With the guidance of the curriculum that corresponds to the construction of images, the proposed hierarchical architec-ture enables a progressive rectiﬁcation and achieves more accurate results. Moreover, we present a novel distortion-aware pre-training strategy to facilitate the initial learning of neural networks, promoting the model to converge faster and better. Experimental results on the synthesized and real-world distorted image datasets show that the proposed approach signiﬁcantly outperforms other learning methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
