Motion forecasting plays a signiﬁcant role in various do-mains (e.g., autonomous driving, human-robot interaction), which aims to predict future motion sequences given a set of historical observations. However, the observed elements may be of different levels of importance. Some informa-tion may be irrelevant or even distracting to the forecasting in certain situations. To address this issue, we propose a generic motion forecasting framework (named RAIN) with dynamic key information selection and ranking based on a hybrid attention mechanism. The general framework is in-stantiated to handle multi-agent trajectory prediction and human motion forecasting tasks, respectively. In the former task, the model learns to recognize the relations between agents with a graph representation and to determine their relative signiﬁcance.In the latter task, the model learns to capture the temporal proximity and dependency in long-term human motions. We also propose an effective double-stage training pipeline with an alternating training strat-egy to optimize the parameters in different modules of the framework. We validate the framework on both synthetic simulations and motion forecasting benchmarks in different domains, demonstrating that our method not only achieves state-of-the-art forecasting performance, but also provides interpretable and reasonable hybrid attention weights.
