Existing calibration algorithms address the problem of covariate shift via unsupervised domain adaptation. How-ever, these methods suffer from the following limitations: 1) they require unlabeled data from the target domain, which may not be available at the stage of calibration in real-world applications and 2) their performance depends heav-ily on the disparity between the distributions of the source and target domains. To address these two limitations, we present novel calibration solutions via domain generaliza-tion. Our core idea is to leverage multiple calibration do-mains to reduce the effective distribution disparity between the target and calibration domains for improved calibration transfer without needing any data from the target domain.We provide theoretical justification and empirical experi-mental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our pro-posed algorithms. Compared against state-of-the-art cal-ibration methods designed for domain adaptation, we ob-serve a decrease of 8.86 percentage points in expected cali-bration error or, equivalently, an increase of 35 percentage points in improvement ratio for multi-class classification on the Office-Home dataset.
