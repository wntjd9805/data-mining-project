The ability to capture inter-frame dynamics has been critical to the development of video salient object detec-tion (VSOD). While many works have achieved great suc-cess in this ﬁeld, a deeper insight into its dynamic na-In this work, we aim to an-ture should be developed. swer the following questions: How can a model adjust it-self to dynamic variations as well as perceive ﬁne differ-ences in the real-world environment; How are the tem-poral dynamics well introduced into spatial information over time? To this end, we propose a dynamic context-sensitive ﬁltering network (DCFNet) equipped with a dy-namic context-sensitive ﬁltering module (DCFM) and an effective bidirectional dynamic fusion strategy. The pro-posed DCFM sheds new light on dynamic ﬁlter generation by extracting location-related afﬁnities between consecutive frames. Our bidirectional dynamic fusion strategy encour-ages the interaction of spatial and temporal information in a dynamic manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art perfor-mance on most VSOD datasets while ensuring a real-time speed of 28 fps.
