Trajectory forecasting is a crucial step for autonomous vehicles and mobile robots in order to navigate and in-teract safely.In order to handle the spatial interactions between objects, graph-based approaches have been pro-posed. These methods, however, model motion on a frame-to-frame basis and do not provide a strong temporal model.To overcome this limitation, we propose a compact model called Spatial-Temporal Consistency Network (STC-Net). InSTC-Net, dilated temporal convolutions are introduced to model long-range dependencies along each trajectory for better temporal modeling while graph convolutions are em-ployed to model the spatial interaction among different tra-jectories. Furthermore, we propose a feature-wise convolu-tion to generate the predicted trajectories in one pass and re-fine the forecast trajectories together with the reconstructed observed trajectories. We demonstrate that STC-Net gen-erates spatially and temporally consistent trajectories and outperforms other graph-based methods. Since STC-Net re-quires only 0.7k parameters and forecasts the future with a latency of only 1.3ms, it advances the state-of-the-art and satisfies the requirements for realistic applications.
