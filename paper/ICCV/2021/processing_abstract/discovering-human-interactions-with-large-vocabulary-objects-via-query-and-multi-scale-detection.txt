In this work, we study the problem of human-object in-teraction (HOI) detection with large vocabulary object cat-egories. Previous HOI studies are mainly conducted in the regime of limit object categories (e.g., 80 categories). Their solutions may face new difficulties in both object detection and interaction classification due to the increasing diver-sity of objects (e.g., 1000 categories). Different from pre-vious methods, we formulate the HOI detection as a query problem. We propose a unified model to jointly discover the target objects and predict the corresponding interac-tions based on the human queries, thereby eliminating the need of using generic object detectors, extra steps to as-sociate human-object instances, and multi-stream interac-tion recognition. This is achieved by a repurposed Trans-former unit and a novel cascade detection over multi-scale feature maps. We observe that such a highly-coupled solu-tion brings benefits for both object detection and interac-tion classification in a large vocabulary setting. To study the new challenges of the large vocabulary HOI detection, we assemble two datasets from the publicly available SWiG and 100 Days of Hands datasets. Experiments on these datasets validate that our proposed method can achieve a notable mAP improvement on HOI detection with a faster inference speed than existing one-stage HOI detectors.
