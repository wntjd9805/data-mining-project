People often use physical intuition when manipulating articulated objects, irrespective of object semantics. Moti-vated by this observation, we identify an important embod-ied task where an agent must play with objects to recover their parts. To this end, we introduce Act the Part (AtP) to learn how to interact with articulated objects to dis-cover and segment their pieces. By coupling action selec-tion and motion segmentation, AtP is able to isolate struc-tures to make perceptual part recovery possible without se-mantic labels. Our experiments show AtP learns efﬁcient strategies for part discovery, can generalize to unseen cat-egories, and is capable of conditional reasoning for the task. Although trained in simulation, we show convincing transfer to real world data with no ﬁne-tuning. A sum-mery video, interactive demo, and code will be available at https://atp.cs.columbia.edu.
