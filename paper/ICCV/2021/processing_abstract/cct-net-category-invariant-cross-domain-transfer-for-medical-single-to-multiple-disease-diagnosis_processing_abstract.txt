A medical imaging model is usually explored for the di-agnosis of a single disease. However, with the expanding demand for multi-disease diagnosis in clinical applications, multi-function solutions need to be investigated. Previous works proposed to either exploit different disease labels to conduct transfer learning through ﬁne-tuning, or transfer knowledge across different domains with similar diseases.However, these methods still cannot address the real clini-cal challenge - a multi-disease model is required but anno-tations for each disease are not always available. In this paper, we introduce the task of transferring knowledge from single-disease diagnosis (source domain) to enhance multi-disease diagnosis (target domain). A category-invariant cross-domain transfer (CCT) method is proposed to address this single-to-multiple extension. First, for domain-speciﬁc task learning, we present a conﬁdence weighted pooling (CWP) to obtain coarse heatmaps for different disease cat-egories. Then, conditioned on these heatmaps, category-invariant feature reﬁnement (CIFR) blocks are proposed to better localize discriminative semantic regions related to the corresponding diseases. The category-invariant char-acteristic enables transferability from the source domain to the target domain. We validate our method in two popular areas: extending diabetic retinopathy to identifying multi-ple ocular diseases, and extending glioma identiﬁcation to the diagnosis of other brain tumors.
