Current state-of-the-art object detection and segmenta-tion methods work well under the closed-world assump-tion. This closed-world setting assumes that the list of object categories is available during training and deploy-ment. However, many real-world applications require de-tecting or segmenting novel objects, i.e., object categories never seen during training. In this paper, we present, UVO (Unidentified Video Objects), a new benchmark for open-world class-agnostic object segmentation in videos. Be-sides shifting the focus to the open-world setup, UVO is significantly larger, providing approximately 6 times more videos compared with DAVIS, and 7 times more mask (in-stance) annotations per video compared with YouTube-VO(I)S. UVO is also more challenging as it includes many videos with crowded scenes and complex background mo-tions. We also demonstrated that UVO can be used for other applications, such as object tracking and super-voxel segmentation. We believe that UVO is a versatile testbed for researchers to develop novel approaches for open-world class-agnostic object segmentation, and inspires new re-search directions towards a more comprehensive video un-derstanding beyond classification and detection.
