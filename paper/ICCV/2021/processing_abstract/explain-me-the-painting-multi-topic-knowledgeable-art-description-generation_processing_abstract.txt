Have you ever looked at a painting and wondered what is the story behind it? This work presents a framework to bring art closer to people by generating comprehensive descriptions of ﬁne-art paintings. Generating informative descriptions for artworks, however, is extremely challeng-ing, as it requires to 1) describe multiple aspects of the im-age such as its style, content, or composition, and 2) pro-vide background and contextual knowledge about the artist, their inﬂuences, or the historical period. To address these challenges, we introduce a multi-topic and knowledgeable art description framework, which modules the generated sentences according to three artistic topics and, addition-ally, enhances each description with external knowledge.The framework is validated through an exhaustive analy-sis, both quantitative and qualitative, as well as a compar-ative human evaluation, demonstrating outstanding results in terms of both topic diversity and information veracity.
