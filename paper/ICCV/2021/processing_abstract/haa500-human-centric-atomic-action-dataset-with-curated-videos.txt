We contribute HAA5001, a manually annotated human-centric atomic action dataset for action recognition on 500 classes with over 591K labeled frames. To minimize ambi-guities in action classification, HAA500 consists of highly diversified classes of fine-grained atomic actions, where only consistent actions fall under the same label, e.g.,“Baseball Pitching” vs “Free Throw in Basketball”. ThusHAA500 is different from existing atomic action datasets, where coarse-grained atomic actions were labeled with coarse action-verbs such as “Throw”. HAA500 has been carefully curated to capture the precise movement of hu-man figures with little class-irrelevant motions or spatio-temporal label noises.The advantages of HAA500 are fourfold: 1) human-centric actions with a high average of 69.7% detectable joints for the relevant human poses; 2) high scalability since adding a new class can be done under 20–60 minutes; 3) curated videos capturing essential elements of an atomic action without irrelevant frames; 4) fine-grained atomic ac-tion classes. Our extensive experiments including cross-data validation using datasets collected in the wild demon-strate the clear benefits of human-centric and atomic char-acteristics of HAA500, which enable training even a base-line deep learning model to improve prediction by attend-ing to atomic human poses. We detail the HAA500 dataset statistics and collection methodology and compare quanti-tatively with existing action recognition datasets.
