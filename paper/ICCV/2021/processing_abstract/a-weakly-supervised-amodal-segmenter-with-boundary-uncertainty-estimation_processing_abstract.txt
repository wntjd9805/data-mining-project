This paper addresses weakly supervised amodal instance segmentation, where the goal is to segment both visible and occluded (amodal) object parts, while training pro-vides only ground-truth visible (modal) segmentations. Fol-lowing prior work, we use data manipulation to generate occlusions in training images and thus train a segmenter to predict amodal segmentations of the manipulated data.The resulting predictions on training images are taken as the pseudo-ground truth for the standard training of Mask-RCNN, which we use for amodal instance segmentation of test images. For generating the pseudo-ground truth, we specify a new Amodal Segmenter based on BoundaryUncertainty estimation (ASBU) and make two contribu-tions. First, while prior work uses the occluderâ€™s mask, our ASBU uses the occlusion boundary as input. Second,ASBU estimates an uncertainty map of the prediction. The estimated uncertainty regularizes learning such that lower segmentation loss is incurred on regions with high uncer-tainty. ASBU achieves significant performance improve-ment relative to the state of the art on the COCOA andKINS datasets in three tasks: amodal instance segmenta-tion, amodal completion, and ordering recovery.
