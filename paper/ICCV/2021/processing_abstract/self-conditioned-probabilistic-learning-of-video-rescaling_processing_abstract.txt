Bicubic downscaling is a prevalent technique used to re-duce the video storage burden or to accelerate the down-stream processing speed. However, the inverse upscaling step is non-trivial, and the downscaled video may also dete-riorate the performance of downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a self-conditioned probabilistic framework for video rescaling to learn the paired downscaling and upscal-ing procedures simultaneously. During the training, we de-crease the entropy of the information lost in the downscal-ing by maximizing its probability conditioned on the strong spatial-temporal prior information within the downscaled video. After optimization, the downscaled video by our framework preserves more meaningful information, which is beneﬁcial for both the upscaling step and the downstream tasks, e.g., video action recognition task. We further ex-tend the framework to a lossy video compression system, in which a gradient estimator for non-differential industrial lossy codecs is proposed for the end-to-end training of the whole system. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach on video rescaling, video compression, and efﬁcient action recognition tasks.
