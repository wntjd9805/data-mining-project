This paper presents a new vision Transformer, calledSwin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adaptingTransformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with Shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efﬁciency by lim-iting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection.This hierarchical architecture has the ﬂexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Trans-former make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classiﬁcation (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP onCOCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the po-tential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones.The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneﬁcial for all-MLP architectures.
