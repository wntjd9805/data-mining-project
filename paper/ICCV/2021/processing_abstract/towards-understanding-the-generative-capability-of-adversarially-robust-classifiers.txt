other generative methods.Recently, some works found an interesting phenomenon that adversarially robust classiﬁers can generate good im-ages comparable to generative models. We investigate this phenomenon from an energy perspective and provide a novel explanation. We reformulate adversarial example generation, adversarial training, and image generation in terms of an energy function. We ﬁnd that adversarial train-ing contributes to obtaining an energy function that is ﬂat and has low energy around the real data, which is the key for generative capability. Based on our new understanding, we further propose a better adversarial training method,Joint Energy Adversarial Training (JEAT), which can gen-erate high-quality images and achieve new state-of-the-art robustness under a wide range of attacks. The InceptionScore of the images (CIFAR-10) generated by JEAT is 8.80, much better than original robust classiﬁers (7.50). In par-ticular, we ﬁnd that the robustness of JEAT is better than other hybrid models.
