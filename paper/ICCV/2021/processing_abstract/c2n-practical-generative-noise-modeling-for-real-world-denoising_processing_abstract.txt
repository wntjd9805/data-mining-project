Learning-based image denoising methods have been bounded to situations where well-aligned noisy and clean images are given, or samples are synthesized from prede-termined noise models, e.g., Gaussian. While recent gener-ative noise modeling methods aim to simulate the unknown distribution of real-world noise, several limitations still ex-ist. In a practical scenario, a noise generator should learn to simulate the general and complex noise distribution with-out using paired noisy and clean images. However, since existing methods are constructed on the unrealistic assump-tion of real-world noise, they tend to generate implausi-ble patterns and cannot express complicated noise maps.Therefore, we introduce a Clean-to-Noisy image genera-tion framework, namely C2N, to imitate complex real-world noise without using any paired examples. We construct the noise generator in C2N accordingly with each component of real-world noise characteristics to express a wide range of noise accurately. Combined with our C2N, conventional denoising CNNs can be trained to outperform existing un-supervised methods on challenging real-world benchmarks by a large margin.
