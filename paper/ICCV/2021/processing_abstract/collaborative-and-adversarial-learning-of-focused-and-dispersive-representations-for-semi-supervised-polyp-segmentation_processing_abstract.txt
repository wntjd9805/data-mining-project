Automatic polyp segmentation from colonoscopy images is an essential step in computer aided diagnosis for colorec-tal cancer. Most of polyp segmentation methods reported in recent years are based on fully supervised deep learn-ing. However, annotation for polyp images by physicians during the diagnosis is time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we present a novel semi-supervised polyp segmenta-tion via collaborative and adversarial learning of focused and dispersive representations learning model, where fo-cused and dispersive extraction module are used to deal with the diversity of location and shape of polyps. In ad-dition, confidence maps produced by a discriminator in an adversarial training framework shows the effectiveness of leveraging unlabeled data and improving the performance of segmentation network. Consistent regularization is fur-ther employed to optimize the segmentation networks to strengthen the representation of the outputs of focused and dispersive extraction module. We also propose an aux-iliary adversarial learning method to better leverage un-labeled examples to further improve semantic segmenta-tion accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments on two famous polyp datasets: Kvasir-SEG and CVC-Clinic DB.Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation models based on adversarial training and even some advanced fully supervised models.
