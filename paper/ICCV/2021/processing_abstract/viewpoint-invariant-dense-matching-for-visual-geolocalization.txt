In this paper we propose a novel method for image matching based on dense local features and tailored for visual geolocalization. Dense local features matching is robust against changes in illumination and occlusions, but not against viewpoint shifts which are a fundamental as-pect of geolocalization. Our method, called GeoWarp, di-rectly embeds invariance to viewpoint shifts in the process of extracting dense features. This is achieved via a train-able module which learns from the data an invariance that is meaningful for the task of recognizing places. We also devise a new self-supervised loss and two new weakly su-pervised losses to train this module using only unlabeled data and weak labels. GeoWarp is implemented efficiently as a re-ranking method that can be easily embedded into pre-existing visual geolocalization pipelines. Experimental validation on standard geolocalization benchmarks demon-strates that GeoWarp boosts the accuracy of state-of-the-art retrieval architectures. The code and trained models will be released upon acceptance of this paper.
