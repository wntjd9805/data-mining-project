Most monocular depth sensing methods use convention-ally captured images that are created without considering scene content. In contrast, animal eyes have fast mechani-cal motions, called saccades, that control how the scene is imaged by the fovea, where resolution is highest. In this pa-per, we present the SaccadeCam framework for adaptively distributing resolution onto regions of interest in the scene.Our algorithm for adaptive resolution is a self-supervised network and we demonstrate results for end-to-end learning for monocular depth estimation. We also show preliminary results with a real SaccadeCam hardware prototype.
