Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a funda-mental visual task aiming at localizing and recognizing in-teractions between humans and objects. Existing works fo-cus on the visual and linguistic features of the humans and objects. However, they do not capitalise on the high-level and semantic relationships present in the image, which pro-vides crucial contextual and detailed relational knowledge for HOI inference. We propose a novel method to exploit this information, through the scene graph, for the Human-Object Interaction (SG2HOI) detection task. Our method,SG2HOI, incorporates the SG information in two ways: (1) we embed a scene graph into a global context clue, serving as the scene-specific environmental context; and (2) we build a relation-aware message-passing module to gather relationships from objectsâ€™ neighborhood and trans-fer them into interactions. Empirical evaluation shows that our SG2HOI method outperforms the state-of-the-art meth-ods on two benchmark HOI datasets: V-COCO and HICO-DET. Code will be available at https://github.com/ ht014/SG2HOI.
