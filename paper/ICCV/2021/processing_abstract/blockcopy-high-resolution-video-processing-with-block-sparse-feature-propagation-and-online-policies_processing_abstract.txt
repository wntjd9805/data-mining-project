In this paper we propose BlockCopy, a scheme that ac-celerates pretrained frame-based CNNs to process video more efﬁciently, compared to standard frame-by-frame pro-cessing. To this end, a lightweight policy network deter-mines important regions in an image, and operations are applied on selected regions only, using custom block-sparse convolutions. Features of non-selected regions are simply copied from the preceding frame, reducing the number of computations and latency. The execution policy is trained using reinforcement learning in an online fashion without requiring ground truth annotations. Our universal frame-work is demonstrated on dense prediction tasks such as pedestrian detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation, using both state of the art (Center and ScalePredictor, MGAN, SwiftNet) and standard baseline net-works (Mask-RCNN, DeepLabV3+). BlockCopy achieves signiﬁcant FLOPS savings and inference speedup with min-imal impact on accuracy.
