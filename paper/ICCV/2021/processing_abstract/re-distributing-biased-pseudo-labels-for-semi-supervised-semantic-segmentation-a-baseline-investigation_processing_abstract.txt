While self-training has advanced semi-supervised se-mantic segmentation, it severely suffers from the long-tailed class distribution on real-world semantic segmenta-tion datasets that make the pseudo-labeled data bias to-ward majority classes.In this paper, we present a sim-ple and yet effective Distribution Alignment and RandomSampling (DARS) method to produce unbiased pseudo la-bels that match the true class distribution estimated from the labeled data. Besides, we also contribute a progres-sive data augmentation and labeling strategy to facilitate model training with pseudo-labeled data. Experiments on both Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets demon-strate the effectiveness of our approach. Albeit simple, our method performs favorably in comparison with state-of-the-art approaches. Code will be available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/DARS.
