In unconstrained real-world surveillance scenarios, per-son re-identification (Re-ID) models usually suffer from dif-ferent low-level perceptual variations, e.g., cross-resolution and insufficient lighting. Due to the limited variation range of training data, existing models are difficult to general-ize to scenes with unknown perceptual interference types.To address the above problem, in this paper, we propose two disjoint data-generation ways to complement existing training samples to improve the robustness of Re-ID mod-els. Firstly, considering the sparsity and imbalance of sam-ples in the perceptual space, a dense resampling method from the estimated perceptual distribution is performed.Secondly, to dig more representative generated samples for identity representation learning, we introduce a graph-based white-box attacker to guide the data generation pro-cess with intra-batch ranking and discriminate attention. In addition, two synthetic-to-real feature constraints are intro-duced into the Re-ID training to prevent the generated data from bringing domain bias. Our method is effective, easy-to-implement, and independent of the specific network ar-chitecture. Applying our approach to a ResNet-50 base-line can already achieve competitive results, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by +1.2% at Rank-1 on the MLR-CUHK03 dataset.
