Weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL) enables finding an object using a dataset without any localization information. By simply training a classification model using only image-level annotations, the feature map of the model can be utilized as a score map for localization.In spite of many WSOL methods proposing novel strategies, there has not been any de facto standard about how to normal-ize the class activation map (CAM). Consequently, manyWSOL methods have failed to fully exploit their own capac-ity because of the misuse of a normalization method. In this paper, we review many existing normalization methods and point out that they should be used according to the property of the given dataset. Additionally, we propose a new nor-malization method which substantially enhances the perfor-mance of any CAM-based WSOL methods. Using the pro-posed normalization method, we provide a comprehensive evaluation over three datasets (CUB, ImageNet and Open-Images) on three different architectures and observe signifi-cant performance gains over the conventional min-max nor-malization method in all the evaluated cases (See Fig. 1).Figure 1: Comparison of several WSOL methods with differ-ent kinds of normalization methods for a class activation map.The accuracy has been evaluated under the evaluation metric sug-gested in [6] with CUB-200-2011 dataset. All scores in this figure are the average scores of ResNet50, VGG16, and InceptionV3.In all WSOL methods, the performance using our normalization method, IVR, is the best.
