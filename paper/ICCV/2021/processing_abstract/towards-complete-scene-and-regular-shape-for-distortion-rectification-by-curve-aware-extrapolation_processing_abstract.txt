ROPThe wide-angle lens gains increasing attention since it can capture a wide ﬁeld-of-view (FoV) scene. However, the obtained image is contaminated with radial distortion, mak-ing the scene not realistic. Previous distortion rectiﬁcation methods rectify the image in a rectangle or invagination, failing to display the complete content and regular shape si-multaneously. In this paper, we rethink the representation of rectiﬁcation results and present a Rectiﬁcation OutPainting (ROP) method, aiming to extrapolate the coherent seman-tics to the blank area and create a wider FoV beyond the original wide-angle lens. To address the speciﬁc challenges such as the variable painting region and curve boundary, a rectiﬁcation module is designed to rectify the image with geometry supervision, and the extrapolated results are gen-erated using a dual conditional expansion strategy. In terms of the spatially discounted correlation, a curve-aware cor-relation measurement is proposed to focus on the generated region to enforce the local consistency. To our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to tackle the challenging rectiﬁcation via outpainting, and our curve-aware strategy can reach a rec-tiﬁcation construction with complete content and regular shape. Extensive experiments well demonstrate the supe-riority of our ROP over other state-of-the-art solutions.
