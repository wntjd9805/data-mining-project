We consider the deep point cloud analysis tasks where the inputs of the networks are randomly rotated. Recent progress in rotation-invariant point cloud analysis is mainly driven by converting point clouds into their respective canonical poses, and principal component analysis (PCA) is a prac-tical tool to achieve this. Due to the imperfect alignment of PCA, most of the current works are devoted to develop-ing powerful network structures and features to overcome this deﬁciency, without thoroughly analyzing the PCA-based canonical poses themselves. In this work, we present a de-tailed study w.r.t. the PCA-based canonical poses of point clouds. Our investigation reveals that the ambiguity problem associated with the PCA-based canonical poses is handled insufﬁciently in some recent works. To this end, we develop a simple pose selector module for disambiguation, which presents noticeable enhancement (i.e., 5.3% classiﬁcation accuracy) over state-of-the-art approaches on the challeng-ing real-world dataset.1
