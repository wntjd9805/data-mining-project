This paper tackles the problem of learning a ﬁner rep-resentation than the one provided by training labels. This enables ﬁne-grained category retrieval of images in a col-lection annotated with coarse labels only.Our network is learned with a nearest-neighbor clas-siﬁer objective, and an instance loss inspired by self-supervised learning. By jointly leveraging the coarse labels and the underlying ﬁne-grained latent space, it signiﬁcantly improves the accuracy of category-level retrieval methods.Our strategy outperforms all competing methods for re-trieving or classifying images at a ﬁner granularity than that available at train time. It also improves the accuracy for transfer learning tasks to ﬁne-grained datasets.
