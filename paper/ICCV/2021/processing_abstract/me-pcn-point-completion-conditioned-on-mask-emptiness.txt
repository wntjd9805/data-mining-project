Point completion refers to completing the missing ge-ometries of an object from incomplete observations. Main-stream methods predict the missing shapes by decoding a global feature learned from the input point cloud, which of-ten leads to deficient results in preserving topology consis-tency and surface details.In this work, we present ME-PCN, a point completion network that leverages emptiness in 3D shape space. Given a single depth scan, previous methods often encode the occupied partial shapes while ig-noring the empty regions (e.g. holes) in depth maps. In con-trast, we argue that these ‘emptiness’ clues indicate shape boundaries that can be used to improve topology represen-tation and detail granularity on surfaces. Specifically, ourME-PCN encodes both the occupied point cloud and the neighboring ‘empty points’. It estimates coarse-grained but complete and reasonable surface points in the first stage, followed by a refinement stage to produce fine-grained sur-face details. Comprehensive experiments verify that ourME-PCN presents better qualitative and quantitative per-formance against the state-of-the-art. Besides, we further prove that our ‘emptiness’ design is lightweight and easy to embed in existing methods, which shows consistent effec-tiveness in improving the CD and EMD scores.
