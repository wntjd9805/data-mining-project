Unsupervised person re-identification (ReID) aims at learning discriminative identity features without annota-tions. Recently, self-supervised contrastive learning has gained increasing attention for its effectiveness in unsu-pervised representation learning. The main idea of in-stance contrastive learning is to match a same instance in different augmented views. However, the relationship between different instances has not been fully explored in previous contrastive methods, especially for instance-level contrastive loss. To address this issue, we propose Inter-instance Contrastive Encoding (ICE) that leverages inter-instance pairwise similarity scores to boost previous class-level contrastive ReID methods. We first use pairwise sim-ilarity ranking as one-hot hard pseudo labels for hard in-stance contrast, which aims at reducing intra-class vari-ance. Then, we use similarity scores as soft pseudo labels to enhance the consistency between augmented and orig-inal views, which makes our model more robust to aug-mentation perturbations. Experiments on several large-scale person ReID datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed unsupervised method ICE, which is competitive with even supervised methods.
