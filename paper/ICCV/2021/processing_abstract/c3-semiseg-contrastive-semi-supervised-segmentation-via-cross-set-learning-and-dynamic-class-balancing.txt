The semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods uti-lize the unlabeled data to increase the feature discrimina-tive ability to alleviate the burden of the annotated data.However, the dominant consistency learning diagram is limited by a) the misalignment between features from la-beled and unlabeled data; b) treating each image and re-gion separately without considering crucial semantic de-pendencies among classes.In this work, we introduce a novel C 3-SemiSeg to improve consistency-based semi-supervised learning by exploiting better feature alignment under perturbations and enhancing the capability of dis-criminative feature cross images. Specifically, we first in-troduce a cross-set region-level data augmentation strat-egy to reduce the feature discrepancy between labeled data and unlabeled data. Cross-set pixel-wise contrastive learn-ing is further integrated into the pipeline to facilitate fea-ture representation ability. To stabilize training from the noisy label, we propose a dynamic confidence region se-lection strategy to focus on the high confidence region for loss calculation. We validate the proposed approach onCityscapes and BDD100K dataset, which significantly out-performs other state-of-the-art semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods.
