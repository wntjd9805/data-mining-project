Cross-domain object detection and semantic segmenta-tion have witnessed impressive progress recently. Exist-ing approaches mainly consider the domain shift result-ing from external environments including the changes of background, illumination or weather, while distinct cam-era intrinsic parameters appear commonly in different do-mains and their influence for domain adaptation has beenIn this paper, we observe that the very rarely explored.Field of View (FoV) gap induces noticeable instance ap-pearance differences between the source and target do-mains. We further discover that the FoV gap between two domains impairs domain adaptation performance un-der both the FoV-increasing (source FoV < target FoV) and FoV-decreasing cases. Motivated by the observa-tions, we propose the Position-Invariant Transform (PIT) to better align images in different domains. We also intro-duce a reverse PIT for mapping the transformed/aligned images back to the original image space, and design a loss re-weighting strategy to accelerate the training pro-cess. Our method can be easily plugged into existing cross-domain detection/segmentation frameworks, while bringing about negligible computational overhead. Extensive ex-periments demonstrate that our method can soundly boost the performance on both cross-domain object detection and segmentation for state-of-the-art techniques.
