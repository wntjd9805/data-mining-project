Removing noise from scanned pages is a vital step before their submission to optical character recognition (OCR) system. Most available image denoising methods are su-pervised where the pairs of noisy/clean pages are required.However, this assumption is rarely met in real settings. Be-sides, there is no single model that can remove various noise types from documents. Here, we propose a uniﬁed end-to-end unsupervised deep learning model, for the ﬁrst time, that can effectively remove multiple types of noise, includ-ing salt & pepper noise, blurred and/or faded text, as well as watermarks from documents at various levels of inten-sity. We demonstrate that the proposed model signiﬁcantly improves the quality of scanned images and the OCR of the pages on several test datasets.
