Visual surface anomaly detection aims to detect local image regions that signiﬁcantly deviate from normal ap-pearance. Recent surface anomaly detection methods rely on generative models to accurately reconstruct the nor-mal areas and to fail on anomalies. These methods are trained only on anomaly-free images, and often require hand-crafted post-processing steps to localize the anoma-lies, which prohibits optimizing the feature extraction for maximal detection capability.In addition to reconstruc-tive approach, we cast surface anomaly detection primar-ily as a discriminative problem and propose a discrimi-natively trained reconstruction anomaly embedding model (DRÆM). The proposed method learns a joint representa-tion of an anomalous image and its anomaly-free recon-struction, while simultaneously learning a decision bound-ary between normal and anomalous examples. The method enables direct anomaly localization without the need for additional complicated post-processing of the network out-put and can be trained using simple and general anomaly simulations. On the challenging MVTec anomaly detec-tion dataset, DRÆM outperforms the current state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a large margin and even de-livers detection performance close to the fully-supervised methods on the widely used DAGM surface-defect detection dataset, while substantially outperforming them in localiza-tion accuracy.
