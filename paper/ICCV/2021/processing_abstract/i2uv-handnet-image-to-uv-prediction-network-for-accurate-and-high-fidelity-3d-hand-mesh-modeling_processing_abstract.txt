The results of current methods are lacking in accuracy and fidelity due to various hand poses and severe occlusions. In this study, we propose an I2UV-HandNet model for accurate hand pose and shape estimation as well as 3D hand super-resolution reconstruc-tion. Specifically, we present the first UV-based 3D hand shape representation. To recover a 3D hand mesh from anRGB image, we design an AffineNet to predict a UV posi-tion map from the input in an image-to-image translation fashion. To obtain a higher fidelity shape, we exploit an additional SRNet to transform the low-resolution UV map outputted by AffineNet into a high-resolution one. For the first time, we demonstrate the characterization capability of the UV-based hand shape representation. Our experi-
