We introduce DiscoBox, a novel framework that jointly learns instance segmentation and semantic correspondence using bounding box supervision. Speciﬁcally, we propose a self-ensembling framework where instance segmentation and semantic correspondence are jointly guided by a struc-tured teacher in addition to the bounding box supervision.The teacher is a structured energy model incorporating a pairwise potential and a cross-image potential to model the pairwise pixel relationships both within and across the box-es. Minimizing the teacher energy simultaneously yields reﬁned object masks and dense correspondences between intra-class objects, which are taken as pseudo-labels to su-pervise the task network and provide positive/negative cor-respondence pairs for dense contrastive learning. We show a symbiotic relationship where the two tasks mutually ben-eﬁt from each other. Our best model achieves 37.9% AP onCOCO instance segmentation, surpassing prior weakly su-pervised methods and is competitive to supervised methods.We also obtain state of the art weakly supervised results onPASCAL VOC12 and PF-PASCAL with real-time inference.
