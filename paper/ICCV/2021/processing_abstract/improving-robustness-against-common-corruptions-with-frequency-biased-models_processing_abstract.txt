CNNs perform remarkably well when the training and test distributions are i.i.d, but unseen image corruptions can cause a surprisingly large drop in performance.In various real scenarios, unexpected distortions, such as ran-dom noise, compression artefacts or weather distortions are common phenomena. Improving performance on corrupted images must not result in degraded i.i.d performance â€“ a challenge faced by many state-of-the-art robust approaches.Image corruption types have different characteristics in the frequency spectrum and would benefit from a targeted type of data augmentation, which, however, is often unknownIn this paper, we introduce a mixture of during training. two expert models specializing in high and low-frequency robustness, respectively. Moreover, we propose a new reg-ularization scheme that minimizes the total variation (TV) of convolution feature-maps to increase high-frequency ro-bustness. The approach improves on corrupted images without degrading in-distribution performance. We demon-strate this on ImageNet-C and also for real-world corrup-tions on an automotive dataset, both for object classifica-tion and object detection.
