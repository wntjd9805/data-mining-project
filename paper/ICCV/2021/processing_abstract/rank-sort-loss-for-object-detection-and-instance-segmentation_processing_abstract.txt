We propose Rank & Sort (RS) Loss, a ranking-based loss function to train deep object detection and instance seg-mentation methods (i.e. visual detectors). RS Loss super-vises the classiﬁer, a sub-network of these methods, to rank each positive above all negatives as well as to sort positives among themselves with respect to (wrt.) their localisation qualities (e.g. Intersection-over-Union - IoU). To tackle the non-differentiable nature of ranking and sorting, we refor-mulate the incorporation of error-driven update with back-propagation as Identity Update, which enables us to model our novel sorting error among positives. With RS Loss, we signiﬁcantly simplify training: (i) Thanks to our sorting ob-jective, the positives are prioritized by the classiﬁer with-out an additional auxiliary head (e.g. for centerness, IoU, mask-IoU), (ii) due to its ranking-based nature, RS Loss is robust to class imbalance, and thus, no sampling heuris-tic is required, and (iii) we address the multi-task nature of visual detectors using tuning-free task-balancing coefﬁ-cients. Using RS Loss, we train seven diverse visual detec-tors only by tuning the learning rate, and show that it con-sistently outperforms baselines: e.g. our RS Loss improves (i) Faster R-CNN by ∼ 3 box AP and aLRP Loss (ranking-based baseline) by ∼ 2 box AP on COCO dataset, (ii) MaskR-CNN with repeat factor sampling (RFS) by 3.5 mask AP (∼ 7 AP for rare classes) on LVIS dataset; and also out-performs all counterparts.
