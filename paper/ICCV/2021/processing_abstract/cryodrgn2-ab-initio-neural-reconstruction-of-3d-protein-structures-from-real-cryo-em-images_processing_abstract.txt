Protein structure determination from cryo-EM data re-quires reconstructing a 3D volume (or distribution of vol-umes) from many noisy and randomly oriented 2D projec-tion images. While the standard homogeneous reconstruc-tion task aims to recover a single static structure, recently-proposed neural and non-neural methods can reconstruct distributions of structures, thereby enabling the study of protein complexes that possess intrinsic structural or confor-mational heterogeneity. These heterogeneous reconstruction methods, however, require Ô¨Åxed image poses, which are typically estimated from an upstream homogeneous recon-struction and are not guaranteed to be accurate under highly heterogeneous conditions.In this work we describe cryoDRGN2, an ab initio recon-struction algorithm, which can jointly estimate image poses and learn a neural model of a distribution of 3D structures on real heterogeneous cryo-EM data. To achieve this, we adapt search algorithms from the traditional cryo-EM literature, and describe the optimizations and design choices required to make such a search procedure computationally tractable in the neural model setting. We show that cryoDRGN2 is robust to the high noise levels of real cryo-EM images, trains faster than earlier neural methods, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on real cryo-EM datasets.
