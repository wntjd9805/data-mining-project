The key challenge in designing a sketch representa-tion lies with handling the abstract and iconic nature of sketches. Existing work predominantly utilizes either, (i) a pixelative format that treats sketches as natural images em-ploying off-the-shelf CNN-based networks, or (ii) an elabo-rately designed vector format that leverages the structural information of drawing orders using sequential RNN-based methods. While the pixelative format lacks intuitive ex-ploitation of structural cues, sketches in vector format are absent in most cases limiting their practical usage. Hence, in this paper, we propose a lattice structured sketch repre-sentation that not only removes the bottleneck of requiring vector data but also preserves the structural cues that vec-tor data provides. Essentially, sketch lattice is a set of points sampled from the pixelative format of the sketch using a lattice graph. We show that our lattice structure is par-ticularly amenable to structural changes that largely ben-efits sketch abstraction modeling for generation tasks. Our lattice representation could be effectively encoded using a graph model, that uses significantly fewer model parame-ters (13.5 times lesser) than existing state-of-the-art. Exten-sive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of sketch lat-tice for sketch manipulation, including sketch healing and image-to-sketch synthesis.
