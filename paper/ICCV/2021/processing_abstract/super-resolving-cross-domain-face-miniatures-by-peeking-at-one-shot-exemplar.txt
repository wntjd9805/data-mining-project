Conventional face super-resolution methods usually as-sume testing low-resolution (LR) images lie in the same do-main as the training ones. Due to different lighting condi-tions and imaging hardware, domain gaps between train-ing and testing images inevitably occur in many real-world scenarios. Neglecting those domain gaps would lead to in-ferior face super-resolution (FSR) performance. However, how to transfer a trained FSR model to a target domain ef-ﬁciently and effectively has not been investigated. To tackle this problem, we develop a Domain-Aware Pyramid-basedFace Super-Resolution network, named DAP-FSR network.Our DAP-FSR makes the ﬁrst attempt to super-resolve LR faces from a target domain by exploiting only a pair of high-resolution (HR) and LR exemplar in the target domain. To be speciﬁc, our DAP-FSR ﬁrstly employs its encoder to ex-tract the multi-scale latent representations of the input LR face. Considering only one target domain example is avail-able, we propose to augment the target domain data by mix-ing the latent representations of the target domain face and source domain ones, and then feed the mixed representa-tions to the decoder of our DAP-FSR. The decoder will gen-erate new face images resembling the target domain image style. The generated HR faces in turn are used to optimize our decoder to reduce the domain gap. By iteratively updat-ing the latent representations and our decoder, our DAP-FSR will be adapted to the target domain, thus achieving authentic and high-quality upsampled HR faces. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superior performance of our DAP-FSR compared to the state-of-the-art methods.
