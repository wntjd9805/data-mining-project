3D Shape representation has substantial effects on 3D shape reconstruction. Primitive-based representations ap-proximate a 3D shape mainly by a set of simple implicit primitives, but the low geometrical complexity of the prim-itives limits the shape resolution. Moreover, setting a suffi-cient number of primitives for an arbitrary shape is chal-lenging. To overcome these issues, we propose a con-strained implicit algebraic surface as the primitive with few learnable coefficients and higher geometrical complexities and a deep neural network to produce these primitives. Our experiments demonstrate the superiorities of our method in terms of representation power compared to the state-of-the-art methods in single RGB image 3D shape reconstruction.Furthermore, we show that our method can semantically learn segments of 3D shapes in an unsupervised manner.The code is publicly available from this link.
