In autonomous driving, a LiDAR-based object detector should perform reliably at different geographic locations and under various weather conditions. While recent 3D de-tection research focuses on improving performance within a single domain, our study reveals that the performance ofIn modern detectors can drop drastically cross-domain. this paper, we investigate unsupervised domain adapta-tion (UDA) for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. On theWaymo Domain Adaptation [49] dataset, we identify the de-teriorating point cloud quality as the root cause of the per-formance drop. To address this issue, we present SemanticPoint Generation (SPG), a general approach to enhance the reliability of LiDAR detectors against domain shifts. Specif-ically, SPG generates semantic points at the predicted fore-ground regions and faithfully recovers missing parts of the foreground objects, which are caused by phenomena such as occlusions, low reflectance, or weather interference. By merging the semantic points with the original points, we ob-tain an augmented point cloud, which can be directly con-â€ Work done during internship at Waymo LLC. sumed by modern LiDAR-based detectors. To validate the wide applicability of SPG, we experiment with two repre-sentative detectors, PointPillars [22] and PV-RCNN [45].On the UDA task, SPG significantly improves both detectors across all object categories of interest and at all difficulty levels. SPG can also benefit object detection in the original domain. On the Waymo Open Dataset [49] and KITTI [17],SPG improves 3D detection results of these two methods across all categories. Combined with PV-RCNN [45], SPG achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection results on KITTI.
