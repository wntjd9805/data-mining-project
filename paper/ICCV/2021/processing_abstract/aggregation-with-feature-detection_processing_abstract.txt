Aggregating features from different depths of a network is widely adopted to improve the network capability. Lots of modern architectures are equipped with skip connections, which actually makes the feature aggregation happen in all these networks. Since different features tell different seman-tic meanings, there are inconsistencies and incompatibili-ties to be solved. However, existing works na¨ıvely blend deep features via element-wise summation or concatena-tion with a convolution behind. Better feature aggregation method beyond summation or concatenation is rarely ex-plored.In this paper, given two layers of features to be aggregated together, we first detect and identify where and what needs to be updated in one layer, then replace the fea-ture at the identified location with the information of the other layer. This process, which we call DEtect-rePLAce (DEPLA), enables us to avoid inconsistent patterns while keeping useful information in the merged outputs. Experi-mental results demonstrate our method largely boosts multi-ple baselines e.g. ResNet, FishNet and FPN on three major vision tasks including ImageNet classification, MS COCO object detection and instance segmentation.
