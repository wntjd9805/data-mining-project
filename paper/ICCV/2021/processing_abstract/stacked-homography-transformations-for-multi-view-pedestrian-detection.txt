Multi-view pedestrian detection aims to predict a birdâ€™s eye view (BEV) occupancy map from multiple camera views.This task is confronted with two challenges: how to estab-lish the 3D correspondences from views to the BEV map and how to assemble occupancy information across views.In this paper, we propose a novel Stacked HOmographyTransformations (SHOT) approach, which is motivated by approximating projections in 3D world coordinates via a stack of homographies. We first construct a stack of trans-formations for projecting views to the ground plane at dif-ferent height levels. Then we design a soft selection mod-ule so that the network learns to predict the likelihood of the stack of transformations. Moreover, we provide an in-depth theoretical analysis on constructing SHOT and how well SHOT approximates projections in 3D world coordi-nates. SHOT is empirically verified to be capable of esti-mating accurate correspondences from individual views to the BEV map, leading to new state-of-the-art performance on standard evaluation benchmarks.
