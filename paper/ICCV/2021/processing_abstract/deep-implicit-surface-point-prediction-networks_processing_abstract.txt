Deep neural representations of 3D shapes as implicit func-tions have been shown to produce high ﬁdelity models sur-passing the resolution-memory trade-off faced by the ex-plicit representations using meshes and point clouds. How-ever, most such approaches focus on representing closed shapes. Unsigned distance function (UDF) based ap-proaches have been proposed recently as a promising al-ternative to represent both open and closed shapes. How-ever, since the gradients of UDFs vanish on the surface, it is challenging to estimate local (differential) geometric prop-erties like the normals and tangent planes which are needed for many downstream applications in vision and graphics.There are additional challenges in computing these prop-erties efﬁciently with a low-memory footprint. This paper presents a novel approach that models such surfaces us-ing a new class of implicit representations called the closest surface-point (CSP) representation. We show that CSP al-lows us to represent complex surfaces of any topology (open or closed) with high ﬁdelity. It also allows for accurate and*indicates two authors equally advised efﬁcient computation of local geometric properties. We fur-ther demonstrate that it leads to efﬁcient implementation of downstream algorithms like sphere-tracing for render-ing the 3D surface as well as to create explicit mesh-based representations. Extensive experimental evaluation on theShapeNet dataset validate the above contributions with re-sults surpassing the state-of-the-art.
