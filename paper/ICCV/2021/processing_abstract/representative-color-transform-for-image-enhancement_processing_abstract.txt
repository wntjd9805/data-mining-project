Recently, the encoder-decoder and intensity transfor-mation approaches lead to impressive progress in image enhancement. However, the encoder-decoder often loses details in input images during down-sampling and up-sampling processes. Also, the intensity transformation has a limited capacity to cover color transformation between low-quality and high-quality images. In this paper, we pro-pose a novel approach, called representative color trans-form (RCT), to tackle these issues in existing methods. RCT determines different representative colors specialized in in-put images and estimates transformed colors for the repre-sentative colors.It then determines enhanced colors us-ing these transformed colors based on the similarity be-tween input and representative colors. Extensive exper-iments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outper-forms recent state-of-the-art algorithms on various image enhancement problems.
