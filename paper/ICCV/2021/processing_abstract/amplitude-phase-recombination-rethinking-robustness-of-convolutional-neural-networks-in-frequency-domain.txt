Recently, the generalization behavior of ConvolutionalNeural Networks (CNN) is gradually transparent through explanation techniques with the frequency components de-composition. However, the importance of the phase spec-trum of the image for a robust vision system is still ig-nored. In this paper, we notice that the CNN tends to con-verge at the local optimum which is closely related to the high-frequency components of the training images, while the amplitude spectrum is easily disturbed such as noises or common corruptions. In contrast, more empirical stud-ies found that humans rely on more phase components to achieve robust recognition. This observation leads to more explanations of the CNNâ€™s generalization behaviors in both robustness to common perturbations and out-of-distribution detection, and motivates a new perspective on data aug-mentation designed by re-combing the phase spectrum of the current image and the amplitude spectrum of the dis-tracter image. That is, the generated samples force theCNN to pay more attention to the structured information from phase components and keep robust to the variation of the amplitude. Experiments on several image datasets in-dicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performances on multiple generalizations and calibration tasks, including adaptability for common corruptions and surface variations, out-of-distribution detection, and adver-sarial attack. The code is released on github/iCGY96/APR.
