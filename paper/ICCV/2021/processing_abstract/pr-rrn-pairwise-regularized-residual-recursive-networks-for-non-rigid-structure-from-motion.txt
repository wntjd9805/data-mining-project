We propose PR-RRN, a novel neural-network based method for Non-rigid Structure-from-Motion (NRSfM). PR-RRN consists of Residual-Recursive Networks (RRN) and two extra regularization losses. RRN is designed to effec-tively recover 3D shape and camera from 2D keypoints with novel residual-recursive structure. As NRSfM is a highly under-constrained problem, we propose two new pairwise regularization to further regularize the reconstruction. TheRigidity-based Pairwise Contrastive Loss regularizes the shape representation by encouraging higher similarity be-tween the representations of high-rigidity pairs of frames than low-rigidity pairs. We propose minimum singular-value ratio to measure the pairwise rigidity. The PairwiseConsistency Loss enforces the reconstruction to be consis-tent when the estimated shapes and cameras are exchanged between pairs. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art per-formance on CMU MOCAP and PASCAL3D+ dataset.
