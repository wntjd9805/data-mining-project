A high quality disparity remapping method that pre-serves 2D shapes and 3D structures, and adjusts disparities of important objects in stereo image pairs is proposed. It is formulated as a constrained optimization problem, whose solution is challenging, since we need to meet multiple requirements of disparity remapping simultaneously. The one-stage optimization process either degrades the qual-ity of important objects or introduces serious distortions in background regions. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage warping process to solve it. In the ﬁrst stage, we develop a warping model that ﬁnds the optimal warping grids for important objects to fulﬁll multiple requirements of disparity remapping. In the second stage, we derive an-other warping model to reﬁne warping results in less im-portant regions by eliminating serious distortions in shape, disparity and 3D structure. The superior performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by experimental results.
