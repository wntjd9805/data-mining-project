Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) is a powerful technique in high-resolution atomic imaging of materials. Decreasing scanning time and reducing elec-tron beam exposure with an acceptable signal-to-noise ratio are two popular research aspects when applying STEM to beam-sensitive materials. Speciﬁcally, partially sampling with ﬁxed electron doses is one of the most important so-lutions, and then the lost information is restored by com-putational methods. Following successful applications of deep learning in image in-painting, we have developed an encoder-decoder network to reconstruct STEM images in extremely sparse sampling cases. In our model, we com-bine both local pixel information from convolution opera-tors and global texture features, by applying speciﬁc ﬁlter operations on the frequency domain to acquire initial re-construction and global structure prior. Our method can effectively restore texture structures and be robust in differ-ent sampling ratios with Poisson noise. A comprehensive study demonstrates that our method gains about 50% per-formance enhancement in comparison with the state-of-art methods.
