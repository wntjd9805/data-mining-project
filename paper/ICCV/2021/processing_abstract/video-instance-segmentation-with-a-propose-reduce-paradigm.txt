Video instance segmentation (VIS) aims to segment and associate all instances of predeﬁned classes for each frame in videos. Prior methods usually obtain segmentation for a frame or clip ﬁrst, and merge the incomplete results by tracking or matching. These methods may cause error ac-cumulation in the merging step. Contrarily, we propose a new paradigm – Propose-Reduce, to generate complete sequences for input videos by a single step. We further build a sequence propagation head on the existing image-level instance segmentation network for long-term propa-gation. To ensure robustness and high recall of our pro-posed framework, multiple sequences are proposed where redundant sequences of the same instance are reduced. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on two representative benchmark datasets – we obtain 47.6% in terms of AP onYouTube-VIS validation set and 70.4 % for J&F on DAVIS-UVOS validation set.
