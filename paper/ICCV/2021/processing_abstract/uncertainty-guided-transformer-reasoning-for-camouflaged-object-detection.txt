Spotting objects that are visually adapted to their sur-roundings is challenging for both humans and AI. Con-ventional generic / salient object detection techniques are suboptimal for this task because they tend to only discover easy and clear objects, while overlooking the difﬁcult-to-detect ones with inherent uncertainties derived from indis-tinguishable textures. In this work, we contribute a novel approach using a probabilistic representational model in combination with transformers to explicitly reason under uncertainties, namely uncertainty-guided transformer rea-soning (UGTR), for camouﬂaged object detection. The core idea is to ﬁrst learn a conditional distribution over the backbone’s output to obtain initial estimates and as-sociated uncertainties, and then reason over these uncer-tain regions with attention mechanism to produce ﬁnal predictions. Our approach combines the beneﬁts of bothBayesian learning and Transformer-based reasoning, al-lowing the model to handle camouﬂaged object detection by leveraging both deterministic and probabilistic informa-tion. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed ap-proach can achieve higher accuracy than existing state-of-the-art models on CHAMELEON, CAMO and COD10K datasets.
