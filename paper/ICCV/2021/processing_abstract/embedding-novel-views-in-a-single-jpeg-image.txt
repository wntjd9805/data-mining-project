We propose a novel approach for embedding novel views in a single JPEG image while preserving the perceptual fi-delity of the modified JPEG image and the restored novel views. We adopt the popular novel view synthesis repre-sentation of multiplane images (MPIs). Our model first en-codes 32 MPI layers (totally 128 channels) into a 3-channelJPEG image that can be decoded for MPIs to render novel views, with an embedding capacity of 1024 bits per pixel.We conducted experiments on public datasets with different novel view synthesis methods, and the results show that the proposed method can restore high-fidelity novel views from a slightly modified JPEG image. Furthermore, our method is robust to JPEG compression, color adjusting, and crop-ping. Our source code will be publicly available.
