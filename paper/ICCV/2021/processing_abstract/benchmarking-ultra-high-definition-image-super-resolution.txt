Increasingly, modern mobile devices allow capturing im-ages at Ultra-High-Deﬁnition (UHD) resolution, which in-cludes 4K and 8K images. However, current single image super-resolution (SISR) methods focus on super-resolving images to ones with resolution up to high deﬁnition (HD) and ignore higher-resolution UHD images. To explore their performance on UHD images, in this paper, we ﬁrst in-troduce two large-scale image datasets, UHDSR4K andUHDSR8K, to benchmark existing SISR methods. With 70,000 V100 GPU hours of training, we benchmark these methods on 4K and 8K resolution images under seven differ-ent settings to provide a set of baseline models. Moreover, we propose a baseline model, called Mesh Attention Net-work (MANet) for SISR. The MANet applies the attention mechanism in both different depths (horizontal) and differ-ent levels of receptive ﬁeld (vertical). In this way, correla-tions among feature maps are learned, enabling the network to focus on more important features.
