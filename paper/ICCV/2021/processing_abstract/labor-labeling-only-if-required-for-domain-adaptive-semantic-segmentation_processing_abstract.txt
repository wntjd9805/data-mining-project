Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation has been actively studied to mitigate the do-main gap between label-rich source data and unlabeled tar-get data. Despite these efforts, UDA still has a long way to go to reach the fully supervised performance. To this end, we propose a Labeling Only if Required strategy, La-bOR, where we introduce a human-in-the-loop approach to adaptively give scarce labels to points that a UDA model is uncertain about. In order to find the uncertain points, we generate an inconsistency mask using the proposed adap-tive pixel selector and we label these segment-based regions to achieve near supervised performance with only a small fraction (about 2.2%) ground truth points, which we call“Segment based Pixel-Labeling (SPL).” To further reduce the efforts of the human annotator, we also propose “Point based Pixel-Labeling (PPL),” which finds the most repre-sentative points for labeling within the generated inconsis-tency mask. This reduces efforts from 2.2% segment label→ 40 points label while minimizing performance degrada-tion. Through extensive experimentation, we show the ad-vantages of this new framework for domain adaptive seman-tic segmentation while minimizing human labor costs.
