We propose a novel pointwise descriptor, called DWKS, aimed at finding correspondences across two deformable shape collections. Unlike the majority of existing descrip-tors, rather than capturing local geometry, DWKS cap-tures the deformation around a point within a collection in a multi-scale and informative manner. This, in turn, allows to compute inter-collection correspondences with-out using landmarks. To this end, we build upon the suc-cessful spectral WKS descriptors, but rather than using the Laplace-Beltrami operator, show that a similar con-struction can be performed on shape difference operators, that capture differences or distortion within a collection.By leveraging the collection information our descriptor fa-cilitates difficult non-rigid shape matching tasks, even in the presence of strong partiality and significant deforma-tions. We demonstrate the utility of our approach across a range of challenging matching problems on both meshes and point clouds. The code for this paper can be found at https://github.com/RobinMagnet/DWKS
