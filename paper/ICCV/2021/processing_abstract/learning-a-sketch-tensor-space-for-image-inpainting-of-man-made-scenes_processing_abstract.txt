This paper studies the task of inpainting man-made scenes. It is very challenging due to the difficulty in preserv-ing the visual patterns of images, such as edges, lines, and junctions. Especially, most previous works are failed to re-store the object/building structures for images of man-made scenes. To this end, this paper proposes learning a SketchTensor (ST) space for inpainting man-made scenes. Such a space is learned to restore the edges, lines, and junctions in images, and thus makes reliable predictions of the holis-tic image structures. To facilitate the structure refinement, we propose a Multi-scale Sketch Tensor inpainting (MST) network, with a novel encoder-decoder structure. The en-coder extracts lines and edges from the input images to project them into an ST space. From this space, the decoder is learned to restore the input images. Extensive experi-ments validate the efficacy of our model. Furthermore, our model can also achieve competitive performance in inpaint-ing general nature images over the competitors.
