Unsupervised domain adaptive person re-identification (UDA re-ID) aims at transferring the labeled source do-main’s knowledge to improve the model’s discriminability on the unlabeled target domain. From a novel perspective, we argue that the bridging between the source and target domains can be utilized to tackle the UDA re-ID task, and we focus on explicitly modeling appropriate intermediate domains to characterize this bridging. Specifically, we pro-pose an Intermediate Domain Module (IDM) to generate intermediate domains’ representations on-the-fly by mixing the source and target domains’ hidden representations us-ing two domain factors. Based on the “shortest geodesic path” definition, i.e., the intermediate domains along the shortest geodesic path between the two extreme domains can play a better bridging role, we propose two properties that these intermediate domains should satisfy. To ensure these two properties to better characterize appropriate in-termediate domains, we enforce the bridge losses on inter-mediate domains’ prediction space and feature space, and enforce a diversity loss on the two domain factors. The bridge losses aim at guiding the distribution of appropri-ate intermediate domains to keep the right distance to the source and target domains. The diversity loss serves as a regularization to prevent the generated intermediate do-mains from being over-fitting to either of the source and tar-get domains. Our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-arts by a large margin in all the common UDA re-ID tasks, and the mAP gain is up to 7.7% on the challeng-ing MSMT17 benchmark.
