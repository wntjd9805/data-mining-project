Existing single image high dynamic range (HDR) recon-struction methods attempt to expand the range of illumi-nance. They are not effective in generating plausible tex-tures and colors in the reconstructed results, especially for high-density pixels in ultra-high-deﬁnition (UHD) images.To address these problems, we propose a new HDR re-construction network for UHD images by collaboratively learning color and texture details. First, we propose a dual-path network to extract the content and chromatic fea-tures at a reduced resolution of the low dynamic range (LDR) input. These two types of features are used to ﬁt bilateral-space afﬁne models for real-time HDR reconstruc-tion. To extract the main data structure of the LDR input, we propose to use 3D Tucker decomposition and reconstruc-tion to prevent pseudo edges and noise ampliﬁcation in the learned bilateral grid. As a result, the high-quality con-tent and chromatic features can be reconstructed capital-ized on guided bilateral upsampling. Finally, we fuse these two full-resolution feature maps into the HDR reconstructed results. Our proposed method can achieve real-time pro-cessing for UHD images (about 160 fps). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art HDR reconstruction approaches on public benchmarks and real-world UHD im-ages.
