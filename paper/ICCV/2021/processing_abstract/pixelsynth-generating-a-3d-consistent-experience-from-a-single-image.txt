Synthesized SceneRecent advancements in differentiable rendering and 3D reasoning have driven exciting results in novel view syn-thesis from a single image. Despite realistic results, meth-In order ods are limited to relatively small view change. to synthesize immersive scenes, models must also be able to extrapolate. We present an approach that fuses 3D rea-soning with autoregressive modeling to outpaint large view changes in a 3D-consistent manner, enabling scene synthe-sis. We demonstrate considerable improvement in single-image large-angle view synthesis results compared to a va-riety of methods and possible variants across simulated and real datasets. In addition, we show increased 3D consis-tency compared to alternative accumulation methods.
