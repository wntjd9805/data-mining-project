We present a novel method for single image depth es-timation using surface normal constraints. Existing depth estimation methods either suffer from the lack of geomet-ric constraints, or are limited to the difficulty of reliably capturing geometric context, which leads to a bottleneck of depth estimation quality. We therefore introduce a sim-ple yet effective method, named Adaptive Surface Normal (ASN) constraint, to effectively correlate the depth estima-tion with geometric consistency. Our key idea is to adap-tively determine the reliable local geometry from a set of randomly sampled candidates to derive surface normal con-straint, for which we measure the consistency of the ge-ometric contextual features. As a result, our method can faithfully reconstruct the 3D geometry and is robust to local shape variations, such as boundaries, sharp corners and noises. We conduct extensive evaluations and comparisons using public datasets. The experimental results demonstrate our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and has superior efficiency and robustness. Codes are available at: https://github.com/xxlong0/ASNDepth
