We propose a method for the unsupervised recon-struction of a temporally-coherent sequence of surfaces from a sequence of time-evolving point clouds, yielding dense, semantically meaningful correspondences between all keyframes. We represent the reconstructed surface as an atlas, using a neural network. Using canonical corre-spondences defined via the atlas, we encourage the recon-struction to be as isometric as possible across frames, lead-ing to semantically-meaningful reconstruction. Through ex-periments and comparisons, we empirically show that our method achieves results that exceed that state of the art in the accuracy of unsupervised correspondences and accu-racy of surface reconstruction.
