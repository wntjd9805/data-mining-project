Existing optical flow methods are erroneous in challeng-ing scenes, such as fog, rain, and night because the ba-sic optical flow assumptions such as brightness and gra-dient constancy are broken. To address this problem, we present an unsupervised learning approach that fuses gy-roscope into optical flow learning. Specifically, we first convert gyroscope readings into motion fields named gyro field. Second, we design a self-guided fusion module to fuse the background motion extracted from the gyro field with the optical flow and guide the network to focus on motion details. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based framework that fuses gyroscope data and image content for optical flow learning. To vali-date our method, we propose a new dataset that covers reg-ular and challenging scenes. Experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-art methods in both regu-lar and challenging scenes. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/megvii-research/GyroFlow.
