Deep learning algorithms have made significant progress in dynamic scene deblurring. However, several challenges are still unsettled: 1) The degree and scale of blur in different regions of a blurred image can have a con-siderable variation in a large range. However, the tradi-tional input pyramid or downscaling-upscaling, is designed to have limited and inflexible perceptual variousness to cope with large blur scale variation. 2) The nonlocal block is proved to be effective in the image enhancement tasks, but it requires high computation and memory cost. In this paper, we are the first to propose a light-weight globally-analyzing module into the image deblurring field, namedLight Global Context Refinement (LGCR) module. With ex-ponentially lower cost, it achieves even better performance than the nonlocal unit. Moreover, we propose the Percep-tual Variousness Block (PVB) and PVB-piling strategy. By placing PVB repeatedly, the whole method possesses abun-dant reception field spectrum to be aware of the blur with various degrees and scales. Comprehensive experimental results from the different benchmarks and assessment met-rics show that our method achieves excellent performance to set a new state-of-the-art in motion deblurring. 1
