Most existing few-shot classification methods only con-sider generalization on one dataset (i.e., single-domain), failing to transfer across various seen and unseen domains.In this paper, we consider the more realistic multi-domain few-shot classification problem to investigate the cross-domain generalization. Two challenges exist in this new setting: (1) how to efficiently generate multi-domain fea-ture representation, and (2) how to explore domain correla-tions for better cross-domain generalization. We propose a parameter-efficient multi-mode modulator to address both challenges. First, the modulator is designed to maintain multiple modulation parameters (one for each domain) in a single network, thus achieving single-network multi-domain representation. Given a particular domain, domain-aware features can be efficiently generated with the well-devised separative selection module and cooperative query module.Second, we further divide the modulation parameters into the domain-specific set and the domain-cooperative set to explore the intra-domain information and inter-domain cor-relations, respectively. The intra-domain information de-scribes each domain independently to prevent negative in-terference. The inter-domain correlations guide informa-tion sharing among relevant domains to enrich their own representation. Moreover, unseen domains can utilize the correlations to obtain an adaptive combination of seen do-mains for extrapolation. We demonstrate that the proposed multi-mode modulator achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging META-DATASET benchmark, especially for unseen test domains.
