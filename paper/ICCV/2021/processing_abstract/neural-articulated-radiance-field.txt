We present Neural Articulated Radiance Field (NARF), a novel deformable 3D representation for articulated ob-jects learned from images. While recent advances in 3D im-plicit representation have made it possible to learn models of complex objects, learning pose-controllable representa-tions of articulated objects remains a challenge, as current methods require 3D shape supervision and are unable to render appearance. In formulating an implicit representa-tion of 3D articulated objects, our method considers only the rigid transformation of the most relevant object part in solving for the radiance ﬁeld at each 3D location.In this way, the proposed method represents pose-dependent changes without signiﬁcantly increasing the computational complexity. NARF is fully differentiable and can be trained from images with pose annotations. Moreover, through the use of an autoencoder, it can learn appearance variations over multiple instances of an object class. Experiments show that the proposed method is efﬁcient and can general-ize well to novel poses. The code is available for research purposes at https://github.com/nogu-atsu/NARF.
