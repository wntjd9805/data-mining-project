A table arranging data in rows and columns is a very ef-fective data structure, which has been widely used in busi-ness and scientific research. Considering large-scale tab-ular data in online and offline documents, automatic table recognition has attracted increasing attention from the doc-ument analysis community. Though human can easily un-derstand the structure of tables, it remains a challenge for machines to understand that, especially due to a variety of different table layouts and styles. Existing methods usually model a table as either the markup sequence or the adja-cency matrix between different table cells, failing to address the importance of the logical location of table cells, e.g., a cell is located in the first row and the second column of the table. In this paper, we reformulate the problem of ta-ble structure recognition as the table graph reconstruction, and propose an end-to-end trainable table graph recon-struction network (TGRNet) for table structure recognition.Specifically, the proposed method has two main branches, a cell detection branch and a cell logical location branch, to jointly predict the spatial location and the logical location of different cells. Experimental results on three popular ta-ble recognition datasets and a new dataset with table graph annotations (TableGraph-350K) demonstrate the effective-ness of the proposed TGRNet for table structure recogni-tion. Code and annotations will be made publicly available at https://github.com/xuewenyuan/TGRNet.
