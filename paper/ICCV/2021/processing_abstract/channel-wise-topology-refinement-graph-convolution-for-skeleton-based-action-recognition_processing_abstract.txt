Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been widely used and achieved remarkable results in skeleton-basedIn GCNs, graph topology dominates action recognition. feature aggregation and therefore is the key to extract-ing representative features.In this work, we propose a novel Channel-wise Topology Refinement Graph Convolu-tion (CTR-GC) to dynamically learn different topologies and effectively aggregate joint features in different chan-nels for skeleton-based action recognition. The proposedCTR-GC models channel-wise topologies through learning a shared topology as a generic prior for all channels and re-fining it with channel-specific correlations for each channel.Our refinement method introduces few extra parameters and significantly reduces the difficulty of modeling channel-wise topologies. Furthermore, via reformulating graph convo-lutions into a unified form, we find that CTR-GC relaxes strict constraints of graph convolutions, leading to stronger representation capability. Combining CTR-GC with tempo-ral modeling modules, we develop a powerful graph convo-lutional network named CTR-GCN which notably outper-forms state-of-the-art methods on the NTU RGB+D, NTURGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets.1
