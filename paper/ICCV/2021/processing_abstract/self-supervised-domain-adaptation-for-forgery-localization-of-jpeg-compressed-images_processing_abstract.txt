With wide applications of image editing tools, forged im-ages (splicing, copy-move, removal and etc.) have been becoming great public concerns. Although existing im-age forgery localization methods could achieve fairly good results on several public datasets, most of them perform poorly when the forged images are JPEG compressed as they are usually done in social networks. To tackle this in this paper, a self-supervised domain adapta-issue, tion network, which is composed of a backbone network with Siamese architecture and a compression approxima-tion network (ComNet), is proposed for JPEG-resistant image forgery localization. To improve the performance against JPEG compression, ComNet is customized to ap-proximate the JPEG compression operation through self-supervised learning, generating JPEG-agent images with general JPEG compression characteristics. The backbone network is then trained with domain adaptation strategy to localize the tampering boundary and region, and alleviate the domain shift between uncompressed and JPEG-agent images. Extensive experimental results on several public datasets show that the proposed method outperforms or ri-vals to other state-of-the-art methods in image forgery lo-calization, especially for JPEG compression with unknownQFs.
