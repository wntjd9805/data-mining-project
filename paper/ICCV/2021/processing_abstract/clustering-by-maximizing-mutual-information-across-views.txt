We propose a novel framework for image clustering that incorporates joint representation learning and clustering.Our method consists of two heads that share the same back-bone network - a “representation learning” head and a“clustering” head. The “representation learning” head captures ﬁne-grained patterns of objects at the instance level which serve as clues for the “clustering” head to ex-tract coarse-grain information that separates objects into clusters. The whole model is trained in an end-to-end manner by minimizing the weighted sum of two sample-oriented contrastive losses applied to the outputs of the two heads. To ensure that the contrastive loss correspond-ing to the “clustering” head is optimal, we introduce a novel critic function called “log-of-dot-product”. Exten-sive experimental results demonstrate that our method sig-niﬁcantly outperforms state-of-the-art single-stage cluster-ing methods across a variety of image datasets, improving over the best baseline by about 5-7% in accuracy on CI-FAR10/20, STL10, and ImageNet-Dogs. Further, the “two-stage” variant of our method also achieves better results than baselines on three challenging ImageNet subsets.
