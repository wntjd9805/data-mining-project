Coarse-to-ﬁne strategies have been extensively used for the architecture design of single image deblurring net-works. Conventional methods typically stack sub-networks with multi-scale input images and gradually improve sharp-ness of images from the bottom sub-network to the top sub-network, yielding inevitably high computational costs. To-ward a fast and accurate deblurring network design, we re-visit the coarse-to-ﬁne strategy and present a multi-input multi-output U-net (MIMO-UNet). The MIMO-UNet has three distinct features. First, the single encoder of theMIMO-UNet takes multi-scale input images to ease the difﬁculty of training. Second, the single decoder of theMIMO-UNet outputs multiple deblurred images with dif-ferent scales to mimic multi-cascaded U-nets using a sin-gle U-shaped network. Last, asymmetric feature fusion is introduced to merge multi-scale features in an efﬁcient manner. Extensive experiments on the GoPro and Real-Blur datasets demonstrate that the proposed network out-performs the state-of-the-art methods in terms of both ac-curacy and computational complexity.
