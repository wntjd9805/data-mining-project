Siamese tracking has achieved groundbreaking perfor-mance in recent years, where the essence is the efﬁcient matching operator cross-correlation and its variants. Be-sides the remarkable success, it is important to note that the heuristic matching network design relies heavily on ex-pert experience. Moreover, we experimentally ﬁnd that one sole matching operator is difﬁcult to guarantee stable track-ing in all challenging environments. Thus, in this work, we introduce six novel matching operators from the perspec-tive of feature fusion instead of explicit similarity learn-ing, namely Concatenation, Pointwise-Addition, Pairwise-Relation, FiLM, Simple-Transformer and Transductive-Guidance, to explore more feasibility on matching oper-ator selection. The analyses reveal these operators’ se-lective adaptability on different environment degradation types, which inspires us to combine them to explore comple-mentary features. To this end, we propose binary channel manipulation (BCM) to search for the optimal combination of these operators. BCM determines to retrain or discard one operator by learning its contribution to other track-ing steps. By inserting the learned matching networks to a strong baseline tracker Ocean [47], our model achieves fa-vorable gains by 67.2 → 71.4, 52.6 → 58.3, 70.3 → 76.0 success on OTB100, LaSOT, and TrackingNet, respectively.Notably, Our tracker, dubbed AutoMatch, uses less than half of training data/time than the baseline tracker, and runs at 50 FPS using PyTorch.
