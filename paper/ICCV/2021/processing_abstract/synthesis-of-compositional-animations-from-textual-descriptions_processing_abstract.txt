“How can we animate 3D-characters from a movie script or move robots by simply telling them what we would like them to do?” “How unstructured and complex can we make a sentence and still generate plausible movements from it?” These are questions that need to be answered in the long-run, as the field is still in its infancy. Inspired by these problems, we present a new technique for gener-ating compositional actions, which handles complex input sentences. Our output is a 3D pose sequence depicting the actions in the input sentence. We propose a hierarchical two-stream sequential model to explore a finer joint-level mapping between natural language sentences and 3D pose sequences corresponding to the given motion. We learn two manifold representations of the motion, one each for the up-per body and the lower body movements. Our model can generate plausible pose sequences for short sentences de-scribing single actions as well as long complex sentences describing multiple sequential and compositional actions.We evaluate our proposed model on the publicly avail-able KIT Motion-Language Dataset containing 3D pose data with human-annotated sentences. Experimental results show that our model advances the state-of-the-art on text-based motion synthesis in objective evaluations by a margin of 50%. Qualitative evaluations based on a user study in-dicate that our synthesized motions are perceived to be the closest to the ground-truth motion captures for both short and compositional sentences.
