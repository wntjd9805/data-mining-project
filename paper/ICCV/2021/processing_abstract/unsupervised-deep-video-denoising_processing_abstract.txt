Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for video denoising are typically trained with supervision, assuming the availability of clean videos. However, in many appli-cations, such as microscopy, noiseless videos are not avail-able. To address this, we propose an Unsupervised DeepVideo Denoiser (UDVD1), a CNN architecture designed to be trained exclusively with noisy data. The performance of UDVD is comparable to the supervised state-of-the-art, even when trained only on a single short noisy video. We demonstrate the promise of our approach in real-world imaging applications by denoising raw video, ï¬‚uorescence-microscopy and electron-microscopy data.In contrast to many current approaches to video denoising, UDVD does not require explicit motion compensation. This is advan-tageous because motion compensation is computationally expensive, and can be unreliable when the input data are noisy. A gradient-based analysis reveals that UDVD auto-matically adapts to local motion in the input noisy videos.Thus, the network learns to perform implicit motion com-pensation, even though it is only trained for denoising.
