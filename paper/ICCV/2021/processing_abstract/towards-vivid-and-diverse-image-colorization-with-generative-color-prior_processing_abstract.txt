Colorization has attracted increasing interest in recent years. Classic reference-based methods usually rely on external color images for plausible results. A large im-age database or online search engine is inevitably required for retrieving such exemplars. Recent deep-learning-based methods could automatically colorize images at a low cost.However, unsatisfactory artifacts and incoherent colors are always accompanied. In this work, we aim at recovering vivid colors by leveraging the rich and diverse color priors encapsulated in a pretrained Generative Adversarial Net-works (GAN). Specifically, we first “retrieve” matched fea-tures (similar to exemplars) via a GAN encoder and then in-corporate these features into the colorization process with feature modulations. Thanks to the powerful generative color prior and delicate designs, our method could pro-duce vivid colors with a single forward pass. Moreover, it is highly convenient to obtain diverse results by modify-ing GAN latent codes. Our method also inherits the merit of interpretable controls of GANs and could attain control-lable and smooth transitions by walking through GAN latent space. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance than previ-ous works.
