Various SCI systems have been built in recent years to capture data such as high-speed videos, hyperspectral images, and the state-of-the-art reconstruc-tion is obtained by the deep neural networks. However, most of these networks are trained in an end-to-end man-ner by a large amount of corpus with sometimes simulated ground truth, measurement pairs.In this paper, inspired by the untrained neural networks such as deep image pri-ors (DIP) and deep decoders, we develop a framework by integrating DIP into the plug-and-play regime, leading to a self-supervised network for spectral SCI reconstruction.Extensive synthetic and real data results show that the pro-posed algorithm without training is capable of achieving competitive results to the training based networks. Further-more, by integrating the proposed method with a pre-trained deep denoising prior, we have achieved state-of-the-art re-sults.
