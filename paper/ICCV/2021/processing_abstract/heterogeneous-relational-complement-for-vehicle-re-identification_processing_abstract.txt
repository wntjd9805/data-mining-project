The crucial problem in vehicle re-identiﬁcation is to ﬁnd the same vehicle identity when reviewing this object from cross-view cameras, which sets a higher demand for learn-ing viewpoint-invariant representations. In this paper, we propose to solve this problem from two aspects: construct-ing robust feature representations and proposing camera-sensitive evaluations. We ﬁrst propose a novel Heteroge-neous Relational Complement Network (HRCN) by incor-porating region-speciﬁc features and cross-level features as complements for the original high-level output. Con-sidering the distributional differences and semantic mis-alignment, we propose graph-based relation modules to embed these heterogeneous features into one uniﬁed high-dimensional space. On the other hand, considering the de-ﬁciencies of cross-camera evaluations in existing measures (i.e., CMC and AP), we then propose a Cross-camera Gen-eralization Measure (CGM) to improve the evaluations by introducing position-sensitivity and cross-camera general-ization penalties. We further construct a new benchmark of existing models with our proposed CGM and experimental results reveal that our proposed HRCN model achieves new state-of-the-art in VeRi-776, VehicleID, and VERI-Wild.
