Although CNNs have achieved remarkable progress on the shadow detection task, they tend to make mistakes in dark non-shadow regions and relatively bright shadow re-gions. They are also susceptible to brightness change.These two phenomenons reveal that deep shadow detec-tors heavily depend on the intensity cue, which we refer toIn this paper, we propose a novel fea-as intensity bias. ture decomposition and reweighting scheme to mitigate this intensity bias, in which multi-level integrated features are decomposed into intensity-variant and intensity-invariant components through self-supervision. By reweighting these two types of features, our method can reallocate the atten-tion to the corresponding latent semantics and achieves bal-anced exploitation of them. Extensive experiments on three popular datasets show that the proposed method outper-forms state-of-the-art shadow detectors.
