High-quality point clouds have practical signiﬁcance for point-based rendering, semantic understanding, and sur-face reconstruction. Upsampling sparse, noisy and non-uniform point clouds for a denser and more regular ap-proximation of target objects is a desirable but challeng-ing task. Most existing methods duplicate point features for upsampling, constraining the upsampling scales at a ﬁxed rate. In this work, the arbitrary point clouds upsampling rates are achieved via edge-vector based afﬁne combina-tions, and a novel design of Edge-Vector based Approxima-tion for Flexible-scale Point clouds Upsampling (PU-EVA) is proposed. The edge-vector based approximation encodes neighboring connectivity via afﬁne combinations based on edge vectors, and restricts the approximation error within a second-order term of Taylor’s Expansion. Moreover, theEVA upsampling decouples the upsampling scales with net-work architecture, achieving the arbitrary upsampling rates in one-time training. Qualitative and quantitative evalua-tions demonstrate that the proposed PU-EVA outperforms the state-of-the-arts in terms of proximity-to-surface, distri-bution uniformity, and geometric details preservation.
