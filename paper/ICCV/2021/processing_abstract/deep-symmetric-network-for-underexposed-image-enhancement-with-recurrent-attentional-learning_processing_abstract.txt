Underexposed image enhancement is of importance in many research domains. In this paper, we take this prob-lem as image feature transformation between the underex-posed image and its paired enhanced version, and we pro-pose a deep symmetric network for the issue. Our sym-metric network adapts invertible neural networks (INN) for bidirectional feature learning between images, and to en-sure the mutual propagation invertible we specifically con-struct two pairs of encoder-decoder with the same pre-trained parameters. This invertible mechanism with bidi-rectional feature transformations enable us to both avoid colour bias and recover the content effectively for im-In addition, we propose a new recur-age enhancement. rent residual-attention module (RRAM), where the recur-rent learning network is designed to gradually perform the desired colour adjustments. Ablation experiments are exe-cuted to show the role of each component of our new ar-chitecture. We conduct a large number of experiments on two datasets to demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art effect in underexposed image enhancement.Code is available at https://www.shaopinglu. net/proj-iccv21/ImageEnhancement.html.
