In this paper, we study the problem of Novel Class Dis-covery (NCD). NCD aims at inferring novel object cate-gories in an unlabeled set by leveraging from prior knowl-edge of a labeled set containing different, but related classes. Existing approaches tackle this problem by con-sidering multiple objective functions, usually involving spe-cialized loss terms for the labeled and the unlabeled sam-ples respectively, and often requiring auxiliary regulariza-tion terms.In this paper we depart from this traditional scheme and introduce a UNified Objective function (UNO) for discovering novel classes, with the explicit purpose of favoring synergy between supervised and unsupervised learning. Using a multi-view self-labeling strategy, we gen-erate pseudo-labels that can be treated homogeneously with ground truth labels. This leads to a single classification ob-jective operating on both known and unknown classes. De-spite its simplicity, UNO outperforms the state of the art by a significant margin on several benchmarks (â‰ˆ+10% onCIFAR-100 and +8% on ImageNet).
