Recently, various works that attempted to introduce rota-tion invariance to point cloud analysis have devised point-pair features, such as angles and distances. In these meth-ods, however, the point-pair is only comprised of the center point and its adjacent points in a vicinity, which may bring information loss to the local feature representation. In this paper, we instead connect each point densely with all other points in a local neighborhood to compose the point-pairs.Speciﬁcally, we present a simple but effective local feature representation, called sorted Gram matrix(SGM), which is not only invariant to arbitrary rotations, but also models the pair-wise relationship of all the points in a neighbor-hood.In more detail, we utilize vector inner product to model distance- and angle-information between two points, and in a local patch it naturally forms a Gram matrix. In order to guarantee permutation invariance, we sort the cor-relation value in Gram matrix for each point, therefore this geometric feature names sorted Gram matrix. Furthermore, we mathematically prove that the Gram matrix is rotation-invariant and sufﬁcient to model the inherent structure of a point cloud patch. We then use SGM as features in convo-lution, which can be readily integrated as a drop-in module into any point-based networks. Finally, we evaluated the proposed method on two widely used datasets, and it out-performs previous state-of-the-arts on both shape classiﬁ-cation and part segmentation tasks by a large margin.
