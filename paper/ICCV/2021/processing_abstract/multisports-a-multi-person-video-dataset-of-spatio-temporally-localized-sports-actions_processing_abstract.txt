Spatio-temporal action detection is an important and challenging problem in video understanding. The exist-ing action detection benchmarks are limited in aspects of small numbers of instances in a trimmed video or low-level atomic actions. This paper aims to present a new multi-person dataset of spatio-temporal localized sports actions, coined as MultiSports. We first analyze the important ingre-dients of constructing a realistic and challenging dataset for spatio-temporal action detection by proposing three crite-ria: (1) multi-person scenes and motion dependent identifi-cation, (2) with well-defined boundaries, (3) relatively fine-grained classes of high complexity. Based on these guide-lines, we build the dataset of MultiSports v1.0 by selecting 4 sports classes, collecting 3200 video clips, and annotat-ing 37701 action instances with 902k bounding boxes. Our datasets are characterized with important properties of high diversity, dense annotation, and high quality. Our Multi-Sports, with its realistic setting and detailed annotations, exposes the intrinsic challenges of spatio-temporal action detection. To benchmark this, we adapt several baseline methods to our dataset and give an in-depth analysis on the action detection results in our dataset. We hope ourMultiSports can serve as a standard benchmark for spatio-temporal action detection in the future. Our dataset website is at https://deeperaction.github.io/multisports/.
