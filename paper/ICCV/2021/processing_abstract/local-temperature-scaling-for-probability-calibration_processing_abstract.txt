For semantic segmentation, label probabilities are often uncalibrated as they are typically only the by-product of a segmentation task. Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice score are often used as criteria for segmentation success, while metrics related to label probabilities are not often ex-plored. However, probability calibration approaches have been studied, which match probability outputs with exper-imentally observed errors. These approaches mainly fo-cus on classiÔ¨Åcation tasks, but not on semantic segmenta-tion. Thus, we propose a learning-based calibration method that focuses on multi-label semantic segmentation. Specif-ically, we adopt a convolutional neural network to predict local temperature values for probability calibration. One advantage of our approach is that it does not change pre-diction accuracy, hence allowing for calibration as a post-processing step. Experiments on the COCO, CamVid, andLPBA40 datasets demonstrate improved calibration perfor-mance for a range of different metrics. We also demonstrate the good performance of our method for multi-atlas brain segmentation from magnetic resonance images.
