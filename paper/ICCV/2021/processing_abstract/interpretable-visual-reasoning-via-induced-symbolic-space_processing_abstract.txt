There is a big sphere behind the brown  cylinder; does it have the same color as  the small rubber sphere on the left side  of the small red rubber ball?We study the problem of concept induction in visual rea-soning, i.e., identifying concepts and their hierarchical re-lationships from question-answer pairs associated with im-ages; and achieve an interpretable model via working on the induced symbolic concept space. To this end, we ﬁrst de-sign a new framework named object-centric compositional attention model (OCCAM) to perform the visual reasoning task with object-level visual features. Then, we come up with a method to induce concepts of objects and relations using clues from the attention patterns between objects’ vi-sual features and question words. Finally, we achieve a higher level of interpretability by imposing OCCAM on the objects represented in the induced symbolic concept space.Experiments on the CLEVR and GQA datasets demonstrate: 1) our OCCAM achieves a new state of the art without human-annotated functional programs; 2) our induced con-cepts are both accurate and sufﬁcient as OCCAM achieves an on-par performance on objects represented either in vi-sual features or in the induced symbolic concept space.
