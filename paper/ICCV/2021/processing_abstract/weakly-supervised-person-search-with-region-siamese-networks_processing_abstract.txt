Supervised learning is dominant in person search, but it requires elaborate labeling of bounding boxes and iden-tities. Large-scale labeled training data is often difﬁcult to collect, especially for person identities. A natural ques-tion is whether a good person search model can be trained without the need of identity supervision.In this paper, we present a weakly supervised setting where only bound-ing box annotations are available. Based on this new set-ting, we provide an effective baseline model termed RegionSiamese Networks (R-SiamNets). Towards learning use-ful representations for recognition in the absence of iden-tity labels, we supervise the R-SiamNet with instance-level consistency loss and cluster-level contrastive loss. For instance-level consistency learning, the R-SiamNet is con-strained to extract consistent features from each person re-gion with or without out-of-region context. For cluster-level contrastive learning, we enforce the aggregation of clos-est instances and the separation of dissimilar ones in fea-ture space. Extensive experiments validate the utility of our weakly supervised method. Our model achieves the rank-1 of 87.1% and mAP of 86.0% on CUHK-SYSU benchmark, which surpasses several fully supervised methods, such asOIM [36] and MGTS [4], by a clear margin. More promis-ing performance can be reached by incorporating extra training data. We hope this work could encourage the fu-ture research in this ﬁeld.
