3D multi-object tracking in LiDAR point clouds is a key ingredient for self-driving vehicles. Existing methods are predominantly based on the tracking-by-detection pipeline and inevitably require a heuristic matching step for the de-tection association. In this paper, we present SimTrack to simplify the hand-crafted tracking paradigm by proposing an end-to-end trainable model for joint detection and track-ing from raw point clouds. Our key design is to predict theﬁrst-appear location of each object in a given snippet to get the tracking identity and then update the location based on motion estimation. In the inference, the heuristic matching step can be completely waived by a simple read-off oper-ation. SimTrack integrates the tracked object association, newborn object detection, and dead track killing in a sin-gle uniﬁed model. We conduct extensive evaluations on two large-scale datasets: nuScenes and Waymo Open Dataset.Experimental results reveal that our simple approach com-pares favorably with the state-of-the-art methods while rul-ing out the heuristic matching rules.
