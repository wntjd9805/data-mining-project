Deep learning technique has yielded significant improve-ments in point cloud completion with the aim of completing missing object shapes from partial inputs. However, most existing methods fail to recover realistic structures due to over-smoothing of fine-grained details.In this paper, we develop a voxel-based network for point cloud completion by leveraging edge generation (VE-PCN). We first embed point clouds into regular voxel grids, and then generate complete objects with the help of the hallucinated shape edges. This decoupled architecture together with a multi-scale grid feature learning is able to generate more re-alistic on-surface details. We evaluate our model on the publicly available completion datasets and show that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches quantita-tively and qualitatively.
