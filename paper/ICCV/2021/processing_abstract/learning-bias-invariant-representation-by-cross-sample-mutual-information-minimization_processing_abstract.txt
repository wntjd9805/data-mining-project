Deep learning algorithms mine knowledge from the training data and thus would likely inherit the dataset’s bias information. As a result, the obtained model would generalize poorly and even mislead the decision pro-cess in real-life applications. We propose to remove the bias information misused by the target task with a cross-sample adversarial debiasing (CSAD) method. CSAD explicitly extracts target and bias features disentangled from the latent representation generated by a feature ex-tractor and then learns to discover and remove the cor-relation between the target and bias features. The cor-relation measurement plays a critical role in adversar-ial debiasing and is conducted by a cross-sample neu-ral mutual information estimator. Moreover, we propose joint content and local structural representation learn-ing to boost mutual information estimation for better performance. We conduct thorough experiments on pub-licly available datasets to validate the advantages of the proposed method over state-of-the-art approaches.Figure 1. A brief illustration of CSAD for a color-biased binary classification task. Our objective is to obtain a color-invariant digit classifier. Given the i-th training sample xi as a red “0”, most existing methods eliminate the correlation between hi and red information from the i-th sample (solid line), where hi is the extracted features. By contrast, CSAD could reduce the correlation between hi and various red colors extracted from other samples. A cross-sample mutual information estimator measures the correlation with joint content and local structural representation.
