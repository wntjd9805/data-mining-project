Synthesizing images of a person in novel poses from a single image is a highly ambiguous task. Most existing ap-proaches require paired training images; i.e. images of the same person with the same clothing in different poses. How-ever, obtaining sufÔ¨Åciently large datasets with paired data is challenging and costly. Previous methods that forego paired supervision lack realism. We propose a self-supervised framework named SPICE (Self-supervised Person ImageCrEation) that closes the image quality gap with super-vised methods. The key insight enabling self-supervision is to exploit 3D information about the human body in sev-eral ways. First, the 3D body shape must remain unchanged when reposing. Second, representing body pose in 3D en-ables reasoning about self occlusions. Third, 3D body parts that are visible before and after reposing, should have simi-lar appearance features. Once trained, SPICE takes an im-age of a person and generates a new image of that person*This work was done during an internship at Amazon. in a new target pose. SPICE achieves state-of-the-art per-formance on the DeepFashion dataset, improving the FID score from 29.9 to 7.8 compared with previous unsupervised methods, and with performance similar to the state-of-the-art supervised method (6.4). SPICE also generates tempo-rally coherent videos given an input image and a sequence of poses, despite being trained on static images only.
