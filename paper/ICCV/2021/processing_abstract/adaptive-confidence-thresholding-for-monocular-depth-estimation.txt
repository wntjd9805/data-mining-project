Self-supervised monocular depth estimation has become an appealing solution to the lack of ground truth labels, but its reconstruction loss often produces over-smoothed results across object boundaries and is incapable of handling oc-clusion explicitly. In this paper, we propose a new approach to leverage pseudo ground truth depth maps of stereo im-ages generated from self-supervised stereo matching meth-ods. The conﬁdence map of the pseudo ground truth depth map is estimated to mitigate performance degeneration by inaccurate pseudo depth maps. To cope with the predic-tion error of the conﬁdence map itself, we also leverage the threshold network that learns the threshold dynami-cally conditioned on the pseudo depth maps. The pseudo depth labels ﬁltered out by the thresholded conﬁdence map are used to supervise the monocular depth network. Fur-thermore, we propose the probabilistic framework that re-ﬁnes the monocular depth map with the help of its uncer-tainty map through the pixel-adaptive convolution (PAC) layer. Experimental results demonstrate superior perfor-mance to state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation meth-ods. Lastly, we exhibit that the proposed threshold learn-ing can also be used to improve the performance of existing conﬁdence estimation approaches.
