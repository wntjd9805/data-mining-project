The fluctuation of the water surface causes refractive distortions that severely downgrade the image of an under-water scene. Here, we present the distortion-guided net-work (DG-Net) for restoring distortion-free underwater im-ages. The key idea is to use a distortion map to guide net-work training. The distortion map models the pixel dis-placement caused by water refraction. We first use a physi-cally constrained convolutional network to estimate the dis-tortion map from the refracted image. We then use a gen-erative adversarial network guided by the distortion map to restore the sharp distortion-free image. Since the distortion map indicates correspondences between the distorted image and the distortion-free one, it guides the network to make better predictions. We evaluate our network on several real and synthetic underwater image datasets and show that it out-performs the state-of-the-art algorithms, especially in presence of large distortions. We also show results of com-plex scenarios, including outdoor swimming pool images captured by drone and indoor aquarium images taken by cellphone camera.
