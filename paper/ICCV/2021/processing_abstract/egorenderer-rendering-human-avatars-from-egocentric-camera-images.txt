We present EgoRenderer, a system for rendering full-body neural avatars of a person captured by a wearable, egocentric ﬁsheye camera that is mounted on a cap or aVR headset. Our system renders photorealistic novel views of the actor and her motion from arbitrary virtual camera locations. Rendering full-body avatars from such egocen-tric images come with unique challenges due to the top-down view and large distortions. We tackle these challenges by decomposing the rendering process into several steps, including texture synthesis, pose construction, and neural image translation. For texture synthesis, we propose Ego-DPNet, a neural network that infers dense correspondences between the input ﬁsheye images and an underlying para-metric body model, and to extract textures from egocentric inputs. In addition, to encode dynamic appearances, our approach also learns an implicit texture stack that captures detailed appearance variation across poses and viewpoints.For correct pose generation, we ﬁrst estimate body pose from the egocentric view using a parametric model. We then synthesize an external free-viewpoint pose image by project-ing the parametric model to the user-speciﬁed target view-point. We next combine the target pose image and the tex-tures into a combined feature image, which is transformed into the output color image using a neural image translation network. Experimental evaluations show that EgoRenderer is capable of generating realistic free-viewpoint avatars of a person wearing an egocentric camera. Comparisons to sev-eral baselines demonstrate the advantages of our approach.
