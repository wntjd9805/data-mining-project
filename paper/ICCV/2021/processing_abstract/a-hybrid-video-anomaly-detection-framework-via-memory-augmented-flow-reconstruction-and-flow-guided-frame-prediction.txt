In this paper, we propose HF2-VAD, a Hybrid framework that integrates Flow reconstruction and Frame prediction seamlessly to handle Video Anomaly Detection. Firstly, we design the network of ML-MemAE-SC (Multi-Level Mem-ory modules in an Autoencoder with Skip Connections) to memorize normal patterns for optical flow reconstruction so that abnormal events can be sensitively identified with larger flow reconstruction errors. More importantly, condi-tioned on the reconstructed flows, we then employ a Con-ditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which captures the high correlation between video frame and optical flow, to predict the next frame given several previous frames. ByCVAE, the quality of flow reconstruction essentially influ-ences that of frame prediction. Therefore, poorly recon-structed optical flows of abnormal events further deterio-rate the quality of the final predicted future frame, mak-ing the anomalies more detectable. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is available at https://github.com/LiUzHiAn/hf2vad.
