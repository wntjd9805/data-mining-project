Classiﬁcation and regression are two pillars of object detectors. In most CNN-based detectors, these two pillars are optimized independently. Without direct interactions be-tween them, the classiﬁcation loss and the regression loss can not be optimized synchronously toward the optimal di-rection in the training phase. This clearly leads to lots of inconsistent predictions with high classiﬁcation score but low localization accuracy or low classiﬁcation score but high localization accuracy in the inference phase, especially for the objects of irregular shape and occlusion, which severely hurts the detection performance of existing detectors after N-MS. To reconcile prediction consistency for balanced object detection, we propose a Harmonic loss to harmonize the op-timization of classiﬁcation branch and localization branch.The Harmonic loss enables these two branches to supervise and promote each other during training, thereby producing consistent predictions with high co-occurrence of top classiﬁ-cation and localization in the inference phase. Furthermore, in order to prevent the localization loss from being dominat-ed by outliers during training phase, a Harmonic IoU loss is proposed to harmonize the weight of the localization loss of different IoU-level samples. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks PASCAL VOC and MS COCO demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our model for facilitating existing object detectors to state-of-the-art accuracy.
