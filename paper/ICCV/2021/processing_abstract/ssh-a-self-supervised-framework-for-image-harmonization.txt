Image harmonization aims to improve the quality of im-age compositing by matching the “appearance” (e.g., color tone, brightness and contrast) between foreground and background images. However, collecting large-scale anno-tated datasets for this task requires complex professional retouching.Instead, we propose a novel Self-SupervisedHarmonization framework (SSH) that can be trained us-ing just “free” natural images without being edited. We reformulate the image harmonization problem from a rep-resentation fusion perspective, which separately processes the foreground and background examples, to address the background occlusion issue. This framework design al-lows for a dual data augmentation method, where diverse[foreground, background, pseudo GT] triplets can be gen-erated by cropping an image with perturbations using 3D color lookup tables (LUTs). In addition, we build a real-world harmonization dataset as carefully created by expert users, for evaluation and benchmarking purposes. Our re-sults show that the proposed self-supervised method outper-forms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of refer-ence metrics, visual quality, and subject user study.
