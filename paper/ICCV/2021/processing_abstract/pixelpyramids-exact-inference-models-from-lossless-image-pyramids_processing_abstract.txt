Autoregressive models are a class of exact inference approaches with highly ﬂexible functional forms, yielding state-of-the-art density estimates for natural images. Yet, the sequential ordering on the dimensions makes these mod-els computationally expensive and limits their applicability to low-resolution imagery. In this work, we propose Pixel-Pyramids,1 a block-autoregressive approach employing a lossless pyramid decomposition with scale-speciﬁc repre-sentations to encode the joint distribution of image pixels.Crucially, it affords a sparser dependency structure com-pared to fully autoregressive approaches. Our PixelPyra-mids yield state-of-the-art results for density estimation on various image datasets, especially for high-resolution data. 1024, we observe that the densityFor CelebA-HQ 1024× estimates (in terms of bits/dim) are improved to 44 % of the baseline despite sampling speeds superior even to easily parallelizable ﬂow-based models.∼
