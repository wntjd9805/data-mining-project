We introduce dense prediction transformers, an archi-tecture that leverages vision transformers in place of con-volutional networks as a backbone for dense prediction tasks. We assemble tokens from various stages of the vi-sion transformer into image-like representations at vari-ous resolutions and progressively combine them into full-resolution predictions using a convolutional decoder. The transformer backbone processes representations at a con-stant and relatively high resolution and has a global re-ceptive ﬁeld at every stage. These properties allow the dense prediction transformer to provide ﬁner-grained and more globally coherent predictions when compared to fully-convolutional networks. Our experiments show that this architecture yields substantial improvements on dense pre-diction tasks, especially when a large amount of train-ing data is available. For monocular depth estimation, we observe an improvement of up to 28% in relative performance when compared to a state-of-the-art fully-convolutional network. When applied to semantic segmen-tation, dense prediction transformers set a new state of the art on ADE20K with 49.02% mIoU. We further show that the architecture can be ﬁne-tuned on smaller datasets such as NYUv2, KITTI, and Pascal Context where it also sets the new state of the art.
