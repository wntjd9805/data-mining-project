Document unwarping attempts to undo physical de-formations of the paper and recover a ’ﬂatbed’ scanned document-image for downstream tasks such as OCR. Cur-rent state-of-the-art relies on global unwarping of the doc-ument which is not robust to local deformation changes.Moreover, a global unwarping often produces spurious warping artifacts in less warped regions to compensate for severe warps present in other parts of the document. In this paper, we propose the ﬁrst end-to-end trainable piece-wise unwarping1 method that predicts local deformation ﬁelds and stitches them together with global information to ob-tain an improved unwarping. The proposed piece-wise for-mulation results in 4% improvement in terms of multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) and shows better perfor-mance in terms of OCR metrics, character error rate (CER) and word error rate (WER) compared to the state-of-the-art.
