The key challenge of image manipulation detection is how to learn generalizable features that are sensitive to ma-nipulations in novel data, whilst speciﬁc to prevent false alarms on authentic images. Current research emphasizes the sensitivity, with the speciﬁcity overlooked. In this pa-per we address both aspects by multi-view feature learn-ing and multi-scale supervision. By exploiting noise dis-tribution and boundary artifact surrounding tampered re-gions, the former aims to learn semantic-agnostic and thus more generalizable features. The latter allows us to learn from authentic images which are nontrivial to be taken into account by current semantic segmentation network based methods. Our thoughts are realized by a new network which we term MVSS-Net. Extensive experiments on ﬁve bench-mark sets justify the viability of MVSS-Net for both pixel-level and image-level manipulation detection.
