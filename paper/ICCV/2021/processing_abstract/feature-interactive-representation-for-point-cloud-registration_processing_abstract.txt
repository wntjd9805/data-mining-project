Point cloud registration is the process of using the com-mon structures in two point clouds to splice them together.To ﬁnd out these common structures and make these struc-tures match more accurately, interacting information of the source and target point clouds is essential. However, lim-ited attention has been paid to explicitly model such fea-ture interaction. To this end, we propose a Feature Inter-active Representation learning Network (FIRE-Net), which can explore feature interaction among the source and target point clouds from different levels. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst in-troduce a Combined Feature Encoder (CFE) based on fea-ture interaction intra point cloud. The CFE extracts inter-active features intra each point cloud and combines them to enhance the ability of the network to describe the local geometric structure. Then, we propose a feature interaction mechanism inter point clouds which includes a Local In-teraction Unit (LIU) and a Global Interaction Unit (GIU).The former is used to interact information between point pairs across two point clouds, thus the point features in one point cloud and its similar point features in another point cloud can be aware of each other. The latter is applied to change the per-point features depending on the global cross information of two point clouds, thus one point cloud has the global perception of another. Extensive experiments on partially overlapping point cloud registration show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
