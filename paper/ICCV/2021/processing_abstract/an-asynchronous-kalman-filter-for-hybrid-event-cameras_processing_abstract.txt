Event cameras are ideally suited to capture HDR vi-sual information without blur but perform poorly on static or slowly changing scenes. Conversely, conventional im-age sensors measure absolute intensity of slowly chang-ing scenes effectively but do poorly on high dynamic range or quickly changing scenes.In this paper, we present an event-based video reconstruction pipeline for High Dy-namic Range (HDR) scenarios. The proposed algorithm in-cludes a frame augmentation pre-processing step that de-blurs and temporally interpolates frame data using events.The augmented frame and event data are then fused using a novel asynchronous Kalman Ô¨Ålter under a unifying un-certainty model for both sensors. Our experimental results are evaluated on both publicly available datasets with chal-lenging lighting conditions and fast motions and our new dataset with HDR reference. The proposed algorithm out-performs state-of-the-art methods in both absolute intensity error (48% reduction) and image similarity indexes (aver-age 11% improvement).
