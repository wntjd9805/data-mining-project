Unsupervised Domain Adaptation solves knowledge transfer along with the coexistence of well-annotated source the domain and unlabeled target instances. However, source domain in many practical applications is not al-ways accessible due to data privacy or the insufficient mem-ory storage for small devices. This scenario defined asSource-free Domain Adaptation only allows accessing the well-trained source model for target learning. To address the challenge of source data unavailability, we develop anAdaptive Adversarial Network (A2Net) including three components. Specifically, the first one named Adaptive Ad-versarial Inference seeks a target-specific classifier to ad-vance the recognition of samples which the provided source-specific classifier difficultly identifies. Then, the ContrastiveCategory-wise Matching module exploits the positive rela-tion of every two target images to enforce the compactness of subspace for each category. Thirdly, Self-Supervised Ro-tation facilitates the model to learn additional semantics from target images by themselves. Extensive experiments on the popular cross-domain benchmarks verify the effec-tiveness of our proposed model on solving adaptation task without any source data.
