We present RePOSE, a fast iterative refinement method for 6D object pose estimation. Prior methods perform re-finement by feeding zoomed-in input and rendered RGB images into a CNN and directly regressing an update of a refined pose. Their runtime is slow due to the com-putational cost of CNN, which is especially prominent in multiple-object pose refinement. To overcome this problem,RePOSE leverages image rendering for fast feature extrac-tion using a 3D model with a learnable texture. We call this deep texture rendering, which uses a shallow multi-layer perceptron to directly regress a view-invariant image representation of an object. Furthermore, we utilize differ-entiable Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) optimization to refine a pose fast and accurately by minimizing the distance be-tween the input and rendered image representations with-out the need of zooming in. These image representations are trained such that differentiable LM optimization con-verges within few iterations. Consequently, RePOSE runs at 92 FPS and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 51.6% on the Occlusion LineMOD dataset - a 4.1% absolute im-provement over the prior art, and comparable result on theYCB-Video dataset with a much faster runtime.
