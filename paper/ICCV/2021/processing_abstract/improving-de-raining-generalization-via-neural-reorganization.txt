image classification, person identification, etc.Most existing image de-raining networks could only learn fixed mapping rules between paired rainy/clean im-ages on single synthetic dataset and then stay static for lifetime. However, since single synthetic dataset merely provides a partial view for the distribution of rain streaks, deep models well trained on an individual synthetic dataset tend to overfit on this biased distribution. This leads to the inability of these methods to well generalize to com-plex and changeable real-world rainy scenes, thus lim-iting their practical applications.In this paper, we try for the first time to accumulate the de-raining knowledge from multiple synthetic datasets on a single network pa-rameter set to improve the de-raining generalization of deep networks. To achieve this goal, we explore Neu-ral Reorganization (NR) to allow the de-raining network to keep a subtle stability-plasticity trade-off rather than naive stabilization after training phase. Specifically, we design our NR algorithm by borrowing the synaptic con-solidation mechanism in the biological brain and knowl-edge distillation. Equipped with our NR algorithm, the deep model can be trained on a list of synthetic rainy datasets by overcoming catastrophic forgetting, making it a general-version de-raining network. Extensive experi-mental validation shows that due to the successful accumu-lation of de-raining knowledge, our proposed method can not only process multiple synthetic datasets consistently, but also achieve state-of-the-art results when dealing with real-world rainy images.
