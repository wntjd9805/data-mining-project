We present a novel solution to the garment animation problem through deep learning. Our contribution allows animating any template outﬁt with arbitrary topology and geometric complexity. Recent works develop models for garment edition, resizing and animation at the same time by leveraging the support body model (encoding garments as body homotopies). This leads to complex engineering solu-tions that suffer from scalability, applicability and compati-bility. By limiting our scope to garment animation only, we are able to propose a simple model that can animate any outﬁt, independently of its topology, vertex order or con-nectivity. Our proposed architecture maps outﬁts to ani-mated 3D models into the standard format for 3D anima-tion (blend weights and blend shapes matrices), automati-cally providing of compatibility with any graphics engine.We also propose a methodology to complement supervised learning with an unsupervised physically based learning that implicitly solves collisions and enhances cloth quality.
