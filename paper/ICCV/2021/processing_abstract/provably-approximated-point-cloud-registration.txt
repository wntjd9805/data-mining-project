The goal of the alignment problem is to align a (given) point cloud 𝑃 = {𝑝1, · · · , 𝑝𝑛} to another (observed) point cloud 𝑄 = {𝑞1, · · · , 𝑞𝑛}. That is, to compute a rotation matrix 𝑅 ∈ R3×3 and a translation vector 𝑡 ∈ R3 that minimize the sum of paired distances between every trans-formed point 𝑅𝑝𝑖 − 𝑡, to its corresponding point 𝑞𝑖, over every 𝑖 ∈ {1, · · · , 𝑛}. A harder version is the registra-tion problem, where the correspondence is unknown, and the minimum is also over all possible correspondence func-tions from 𝑃 to 𝑄. Algorithms such as the Iterative ClosestPoint (ICP) and its variants were suggested for these prob-lems, but none yield a provable non-trivial approximation for the global optimum.We prove that there always exists a “witness” set of 3 pairs in 𝑃 × 𝑄 that, via novel alignment algorithm, deﬁnes a constant factor approximation (in the worst case) to this global optimum. We then provide algorithms that recover this witness set and yield the ﬁrst provable constant fac-tor approximation for the: (i) alignment problem in 𝑂(𝑛) expected time, and (ii) registration problem in polynomial time. Such small witness sets exist for many variants in-cluding points in 𝑑-dimensional space, outlier-resistant cost functions, and different correspondence types.Extensive experimental results on real and synthetic datasets show that, in practice, our approximation con-stants are close to 1 and our error is up to x10 times smaller than state-of-the-art algorithms.
