The conventional detectors tend to make imbalanced classiﬁcation and suffer performance drop, when the dis-tribution of the training data is severely skewed.In this paper, we propose to use the mean classiﬁcation score to indicate the classiﬁcation accuracy for each category dur-ing training. Based on this indicator, we balance the clas-siﬁcation via an Equilibrium Loss (EBL) and a Memory-augmented Feature Sampling (MFS) method. Speciﬁcally,EBL increases the intensity of the adjustment of the decision boundary for the weak classes by a designed score-guided loss margin between any two classes. On the other hand,MFS improves the frequency and accuracy of the adjust-ment of the decision boundary for the weak classes through over-sampling the instance features of those classes. There-fore, EBL and MFS work collaboratively for ﬁnding the classiﬁcation equilibrium in long-tailed detection, and dra-matically improve the performance of tail classes while maintaining or even improving the performance of head classes. We conduct experiments on LVIS using MaskR-CNN with various backbones including ResNet-50-FPN and ResNet-101-FPN to show the superiority of the pro-posed method. It improves the detection performance of tail classes by 15.6 AP, and outperforms the most recent long-tailed object detectors by more than 1 AP. Code is available at https://github.com/fcjian/LOCE.
