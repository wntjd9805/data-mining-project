Fast and accurate simulation of imaging through atmo-spheric turbulence is essential for developing turbulence mitigation algorithms. Recognizing the limitations of pre-vious approaches, we introduce a new concept known as the phase-to-space (P2S) transform to significantly speed up the simulation. P2S is built upon three ideas: (1) re-formulating the spatially varying convolution as a set of in-variant convolutions with basis functions, (2) learning the basis function via the known turbulence statistics models, (3) implementing the P2S transform via a light-weight net-work that directly converts the phase representation to spa-tial representation. The new simulator offers 300× – 1000× speed up compared to the mainstream split-step simulators while preserving the essential turbulence statistics.
