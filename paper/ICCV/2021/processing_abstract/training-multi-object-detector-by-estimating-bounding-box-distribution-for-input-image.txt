In multi-object detection using neural networks, the fundamental problem is, “How should the network learn a variable number of bounding boxes in different input images?”. Previous methods train a multi-object detec-tion network through a procedure that directly assigns the ground truth bounding boxes to the specific locations of the network’s output. However, this procedure makes the training of a multi-object detection network too heuristic and complicated. In this paper, we reformulate the multi-object detection task as a problem of density estimation of bounding boxes. Instead of assigning each ground truth to specific locations of network’s output, we train a network by estimating the probability density of bounding boxes in an input image using a mixture model. For this purpose, we propose a novel network for object detection calledMixture Density Object Detector (MDOD), and the cor-responding objective function for the density-estimation-based training. We applied MDOD to MS COCO dataset.Our proposed method not only deals with multi-object de-tection problems in a new approach, but also improves de-tection performances through MDOD.
