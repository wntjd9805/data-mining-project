With the thriving of deep learning, CNN-based object de-tectors have made great progress in the past decade. How-ever, the domain gap between training and testing data leads to a prominent performance degradation and thus hin-ders their application in the real world. To alleviate this problem, Knowledge Transfer Network (KTNet) is proposed as a new paradigm for domain adaption. Speciﬁcally, KT-Net is constructed on a base detector with intrinsic knowl-edge mining and relational knowledge constraints. First, we design a foreground/background classiﬁer shared by source domain and target domain to extract the common attribute knowledge of objects in different scenarios. Second, we model the relational knowledge graph and explicitly con-strain the consistency of category correlation under source domain, target domain, as well as cross-domain conditions.As a result, the detector is guided to learn object-related and domain-independent representation. Extensive experi-ments and visualizations conﬁrm that transferring object-speciﬁc knowledge can yield notable performance gains.The proposed KTNet achieves state-of-the-art results on three cross-domain detection benchmarks.
