Contrastive learning methods have signiﬁcantly nar-rowed the gap between supervised and unsupervised learn-ing on computer vision tasks. In this paper, we explore their application to geo-located datasets, e.g. remote sensing, where unlabeled data is often abundant but labeled data is scarce. We ﬁrst show that due to their different char-acteristics, a non-trivial gap persists between contrastive and supervised learning on standard benchmarks. To close the gap, we propose novel training methods that exploit the spatio-temporal structure of remote sensing data. We lever-age spatially aligned images over time to construct tempo-ral positive pairs in contrastive learning and geo-location to design pre-text tasks. Our experiments show that our proposed method closes the gap between contrastive and supervised learning on image classiﬁcation, object detec-tion and semantic segmentation for remote sensing. More-over, we demonstrate that the proposed method can also be applied to geo-tagged ImageNet images, improving down-stream performance on various tasks.
