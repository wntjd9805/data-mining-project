Contrastive learning allows us to ﬂexibly deﬁne power-ful losses by contrasting positive pairs from sets of negative samples. Recently, the principle has also been used to learn cross-modal embeddings for video and text, yet without ex-ploiting its full potential. In particular, previous losses do not take the intra-modality similarities into account, which leads to inefﬁcient embeddings, as the same content is mapped to multiple points in the embedding space. WithCrossCLR, we present a contrastive loss that ﬁxes this is-sue. Moreover, we deﬁne sets of highly related samples in terms of their input embeddings and exclude them from the negative samples to avoid issues with false negatives. We show that these principles consistently improve the quality of the learned embeddings. The joint embeddings learned with CrossCLR extend the state of the art in video-text retrieval on Youcook2 and LSMDC datasets and in video captioning on Youcook2 dataset by a large margin. We also demonstrate the generality of the concept by learning improved joint embeddings for other pairs of modalities.
