To reduce annotation labor associated with object de-tection, an increasing number of studies focus on transfer-ring the learned knowledge from a labeled source domain to another unlabeled target domain. However, existing meth-ods assume that the labeled data are sampled from a single source domain, which ignores a more generalized scenario, where labeled data are from multiple source domains. For the more challenging task, we propose a unified Faster R-CNN based framework, termed Divide-and-Merge SpindleNetwork (DMSN), which can simultaneously enhance do-main invariance and preserve discriminative power. Specif-ically, the framework contains multiple source subnets and a pseudo target subnet. First, we propose a hierarchi-cal feature alignment strategy to conduct strong and weak alignments for low- and high-level features, respectively, considering their different effects for object detection. Sec-ond, we develop a novel pseudo subnet learning algorithm to approximate optimal parameters of pseudo target subset by weighted combination of parameters in different source subnets. Finally, a consistency regularization for region proposal network is proposed to facilitate each subnet to learn more abstract invariances. Extensive experiments on different adaptation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.
