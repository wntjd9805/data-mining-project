Recently, a novel retina-inspired camera, namely spike camera, has shown great potential for recording high-speed dynamic scenes. Unlike conventional digital cameras that compact the visual information within an exposure inter-val into a single snapshot, the spike camera continuously outputs binary spike streams to record the dynamic scenes, yielding a very high temporal resolution. Most of the ex-isting reconstruction methods for spike camera focus on re-constructing images with the same resolution as spike cam-era. However, as a trade-off of high temporal resolution, the spatial resolution of spike camera is limited, resulting in in-ferior details of the reconstruction. To address this issue, we develop a spike camera super-resolution framework, aim-ing to super resolve high-resolution intensity images from the low-resolution binary spike streams. Due to the relative motion between the camera and the objects to capture, the spikes Ô¨Åred by the same sensor pixel no longer describes the same points in the external scene. In this paper, we ex-ploit the relative motion and derive the relationship between light intensity and each spike, so as to recover the external scene with both high temporal and high spatial resolution.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can reconstruct pleasant high-resolution images from low-resolution spike streams.
