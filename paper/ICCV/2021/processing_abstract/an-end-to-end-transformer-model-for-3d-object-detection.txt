Input Point CloudDecoder AttentionDetectionsWe propose 3DETR, an end-to-end Transformer based object detection model for 3D point clouds. Compared to existing detection methods that employ a number of 3D-speciﬁc inductive biases, 3DETR requires minimal mod-iﬁcations to the vanilla Transformer block. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that a standard Transformer with non-parametric queries and Fourier positional embeddings is competitive with specialized architectures that employ libraries of 3D-speciﬁc operators with hand-tuned hyperparameters. Nev-ertheless, 3DETR is conceptually simple and easy to im-plement, enabling further improvements by incorporating 3D domain knowledge. Through extensive experiments, we show 3DETR outperforms the well-established and highly optimized VoteNet baselines on the challenging ScanNetV2 dataset by 9.5%. Furthermore, we show 3DETR is applica-ble to 3D tasks beyond detection, and can serve as a build-ing block for future research.
