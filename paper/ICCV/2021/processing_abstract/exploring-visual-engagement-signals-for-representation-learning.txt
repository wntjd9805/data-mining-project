Visual engagement in social media platforms com-prises interactions with photo posts including comments, shares, and likes.In this paper, we leverage such VisualEngagement clues as supervisory signals for representa-tion learning. However, learning from engagement signals is non-trivial as it is not clear how to bridge the gap be-tween low-level visual information and high-level social in-teractions. We present VisE, a weakly supervised learning approach, which maps social images to pseudo labels de-rived by clustered engagement signals. We then study how models trained in this way beneﬁt subjective downstream computer vision tasks such as emotion recognition or polit-ical bias detection. Through extensive studies, we empiri-cally demonstrate the effectiveness of VisE across a diverse set of classiﬁcation tasks beyond the scope of conventional recognition 1.
