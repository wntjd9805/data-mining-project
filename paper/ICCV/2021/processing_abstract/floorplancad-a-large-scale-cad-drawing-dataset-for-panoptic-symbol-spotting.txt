Access to large and diverse computer-aided design (CAD) drawings is critical for developing symbol spot-ting algorithms.In this paper, we present FloorPlan-CAD, a large-scale real-world CAD drawing dataset con-taining over 10,000 floor plans, ranging from residential to commercial buildings. CAD drawings in the dataset are all represented as vector graphics, which enable us to provide line-grained annotations of 30 object cate-gories. Equipped by such annotations, we introduce the task of panoptic symbol spotting, which requires to spot not only instances of countable things, but also the se-mantic of uncountable stuff. Aiming to solve this task, we propose a novel method by combining Graph Convo-lutional Networks (GCNs) with Convolutional Neural Net-works (CNNs), which captures both non-Euclidean and Eu-clidean features and can be trained end-to-end. The pro-posed CNN-GCN method achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the task of semantic symbol spotting, and help us build a baseline network for the panoptic sym-bol spotting task. Our contributions are three-fold: 1) to the best of our knowledge, the presented CAD draw-ing dataset is the first of its kind; 2) the panoptic sym-bol spotting task considers the spotting of both thing in-stances and stuff semantic as one recognition problem; and 3) we presented a baseline solution to the panoptic symbol spotting task based on a novel CNN-GCN method, which achieved SOTA performance on semantic symbol spotting.We believe that these contributions will boost research in related areas.
