We present Retrieve in Style (RIS), an unsupervised framework for facial feature transfer and retrieval on real images. Recent work shows capabilities of transferring lo-cal facial features by capitalizing on the disentanglement property of the StyleGAN latent space. RIS improves ex-isting art on the following: 1) Introducing more effective feature disentanglement to allow for challenging transfers (i.e., hair, pose) that were not shown possible in SoTA methods. 2) Eliminating the need for per-image hyper-parameter tuning, and for computing a catalog over a large batch of images. 3) Enabling fine-grained face re-trieval using disentangled facial features (e.g., eyes). To our best knowledge, this is the first work to retrieve face images at this fine level. 4) Demonstrating robust, natu-ral editing on real images. Our qualitative and quanti-tative analyses show RIS achieves both high-fidelity fea-ture transfers and accurate fine-grained retrievals on real images. We also discuss the responsible applications ofRIS. Our code is available at https://github.com/ mchong6/RetrieveInStyle.
