Image completion has made tremendous progress with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), because of their powerful texture modeling capacity. However, due to some local inductive prior, spatial-inherent properties (e.g., invariant kernels), CNNs do not perform well in under-standing global structures or naturally support pluralis-tic completion. Recently, transformers demonstrate their power in modeling the long-term relationship and gener-ating diverse results, but their computation complexity is quadratic to input length, thus hampering the application in processing high-resolution images. This paper brings the best of both worlds to pluralistic image completion: ap-pearance prior reconstruction with transformer and texture replenishment with CNN. The former transformer recovers pluralistic coherent structures together with some coarse textures, while the latter CNN enhances the local texture de-tails of coarse priors guided by the high-resolution masked images. The proposed method vastly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of three aspects: 1) large per-formance boost on image ﬁdelity even compared to deter-ministic completion methods; 2) better diversity and higherﬁdelity for pluralistic completion; 3) exceptional general-*Corresponding author. ization ability on large masks and generic dataset, like Im-ageNet.
