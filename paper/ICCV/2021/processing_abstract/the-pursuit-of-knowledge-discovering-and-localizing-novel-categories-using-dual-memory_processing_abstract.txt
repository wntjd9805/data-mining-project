Detection Training Set (VOC)Standard Detection Output on:VOCCOCOCOCOWe tackle object category discovery, which is the prob-lem of discovering and localizing novel objects in a large unlabeled dataset. While existing methods show results on datasets with less cluttered scenes and fewer object in-stances per image, we present our results on the challeng-ing COCO dataset. Moreover, we argue that, rather than discovering new categories from scratch, discovery algo-rithms can beneÔ¨Åt from identifying what is already known and focusing their attention on the unknown. We propose a method that exploits prior knowledge about certain object types to discover new categories by leveraging two mem-ory modules, namely Working and Semantic memory. We show the performance of our detector on the COCO mini-val dataset to demonstrate its in-the-wild capabilities.
