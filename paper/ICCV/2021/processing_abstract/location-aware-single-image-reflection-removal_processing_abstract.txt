This paper proposes a novel location-aware deep-learning-based single image reﬂection removal method.Our network has a reﬂection detection module to regress a probabilistic reﬂection conﬁdence map, taking multi-scale Laplacian features as inputs. This probabilistic map tells if a region is reﬂection-dominated or transmission-dominated, and it is used as a cue for the network to control the feature ﬂow when predicting the reﬂection and trans-mission layers. We design our network as a recurrent net-work to progressively reﬁne reﬂection removal results at each iteration. The novelty is that we leverage Laplacian kernel parameters to emphasize the boundaries of strong reﬂections.It is beneﬁcial to strong reﬂection detection and substantially improves the quality of reﬂection removal results. Extensive experiments verify the superior perfor-mance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art ap-proaches.
