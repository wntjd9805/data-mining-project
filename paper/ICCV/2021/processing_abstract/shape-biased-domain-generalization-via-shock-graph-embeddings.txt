There is an emerging sense that the vulnerability of Im-age Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), i.e., sensitiv-ity to image corruptions, perturbations, and adversarial at-tacks, is connected with Texture Bias. This relative lack ofShape Bias is also responsible for poor performance in Do-main Generalization (DG). The inclusion of a role of shape alleviates these vulnerabilities and some approaches have achieved this by training on negative images, images en-dowed with edge maps, or images with conﬂicting shape and texture information. This paper advocates an explicit and complete representation of shape using a classical com-puter vision approach, namely, representing the shape con-tent of an image with the shock graph of its contour map.The resulting graph and its descriptor is a complete repre-sentation of contour content and is classiﬁed using recentGraph Neural Network (GNN) methods. The experimen-tal results on three domain shift datasets, Colored MNIST,PACS, and VLCS demonstrate that even without using ap-pearance the shape-based approach exceeds classical Im-age CNN based methods in domain generalization.
