The task of reﬂection symmetry detection remains chal-lenging due to signiﬁcant variations and ambiguities of symmetry patterns in the wild. Furthermore, since the lo-cal regions are required to match in reﬂection for detecting a symmetry pattern, it is hard for standard convolutional networks, which are not equivariant to rotation and reﬂec-tion, to learn the task. To address the issue, we introduce a new convolutional technique, dubbed the polar matching convolution, which leverages a polar feature pooling, a self-similarity encoding, and a systematic kernel design for axes of different angles. The proposed high-dimensional kernel convolution network effectively learns to discover symme-try patterns from real-world images, overcoming the limita-tions of standard convolution. In addition, we present a new dataset and introduce a self-supervised learning strategy by augmenting the dataset with synthesizing images. Exper-iments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.
