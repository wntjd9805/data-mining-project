We propose a novel approach for few-shot talking-head synthesis. While recent works in neural talking heads have produced promising results, they can still produce images that do not preserve the identity of the subject in source images. We posit this is a result of the entangled represen-tation of each subject in a single latent code that models 3D shape information, identity cues, colors, lighting and even background details. In contrast, we propose to factor-ize the representation of a subject into its spatial and style components. Our method generates a target frame in two steps. First, it predicts a discrete and dense spatial layout for the target image. Second, an image generator utilizes the predicted layout for spatial denormalization and synthesizes the target frame. We experimentally show that this disentan-gled representation leads to a signiﬁcant improvement over previous methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively.
