This paper introduces a new method of data-driven mi-croscope design for virtual fluorescence microscopy. We use a deep neural network (DNN) to effectively design op-tical patterns for specimen illumination that substantially improve upon the ability to infer fluorescence image infor-mation from unstained microscope images. To achieve this design, we include an illumination model within the DNNâ€™s first layers that is jointly optimized during network train-ing. We validated our method on two different experimen-tal setups, with different magnifications and sample types, to show a consistent improvement in performance as com-pared to conventional microscope imaging methods. Ad-ditionally, to understand the importance of learned illumi-nation on the inference task, we varied the number of illu-mination patterns being optimized (and thus the number of unique images captured) and analyzed how the structure of the patterns changed as their number increased. This work demonstrates the power of programmable optical elements at enabling better machine learning algorithm performance and at providing physical insight into next generation of machine-controlled imaging systems.
