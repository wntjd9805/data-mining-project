Fine-grained 3D segmentation is an important task in 3D object understanding, especially in applications such as intelligent manufacturing or parts analysis for 3D ob-jects. However, many challenges involved in such prob-lem are yet to be solved, such as i) interpreting the com-plex structures located in different regions for 3D objects; ii) capturing fine-grained structures with sufficient topol-ogy correctness. Current deep learning and graph ma-chine learning methods fail to tackle such challenges and thus provide inferior performance in fine-grained 3D anal-In this work, methods in topological data analysis ysis. are incorporated with geometric deep learning model for the task of fine-grained segmentation for 3D objects. We propose a novel neural network model called PersistentHomology based Graph Convolution Network (PHGCN), which i) integrates persistent homology into graph convolu-tion network to capture multi-scale structural information that can accurately represent complex structures for 3D ob-jects; ii) applies a novel Persistence Diagram Loss (LP D) that provides sufficient topology correctness for segmenta-tion over the fine-grained structures. Extensive experiments on fine-grained 3D segmentation validate the effectiveness of the proposed PHGCN model and show significant im-provements over current state-of-the-art methods.
