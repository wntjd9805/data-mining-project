Personalized video highlight detection aims to shorten a long video to interesting moments according to a user’s preference, which has recently raised the community’s at-tention. Current methods regard the user’s history as holis-tic information to predict the user’s preference but negat-ing the inherent diversity of the user’s interests, resulting in vague preference representation. In this paper, we pro-pose a simple yet efficient preference reasoning framework (PR-Net) to explicitly take the diverse interests into account for frame-level highlight prediction. Specifically, distinct user-specific preferences for each input query frame are produced, presented as the similarity weighted sum of his-tory highlights to the corresponding query frame. Next, distinct comprehensive preferences are formed by the user-specific preferences and a learnable generic preference for more overall highlight measurement. Lastly, the degree of highlight and non-highlight for each query frame is calcu-lated as semantic similarity to its comprehensive and non-highlight preferences, respectively. Besides, to alleviate the ambiguity due to the incomplete annotation, a new bi-directional contrastive loss is proposed to ensure a compact and differentiable metric space. In this way, our method sig-nificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a rela-tive improvement of 12% in mean accuracy precision.
