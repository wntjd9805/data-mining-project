Image-based virtual try-on involves synthesising percep-tually convincing images of a model wearing a particular garment and has garnered significant research interest due to its immense practical applicability. Recent methods in-volve a two stage process: i) warping of the garment to align with the model ii) texture fusion of the warped gar-ment and target model to generate the try-on output.Is-sues arise due to the non-rigid nature of garments and the lack of geometric information about the model or the gar-ment. It often results in improper rendering of granular de-tails. We propose ZFlow, an end-to-end framework, which seeks to alleviate these concerns regarding geometric and textural integrity (such as pose, depth-ordering, skin and neckline reproduction) through a combination of gated ag-gregation of hierarchical flow estimates termed Gated Ap-pearance Flow, and dense structural priors at various stage of the network. ZFlow achieves state-of-the-art results as observed qualitatively, and on quantitative benchmarks of image quality (PSNR, SSIM, and FID). The paper presents extensive comparisons with other existing solutions includ-ing a detailed user study and ablation studies to gauge the effect of each of our contributions on multiple datasets.
