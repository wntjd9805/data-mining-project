In this paper, we propose a progressive segmentation in-ference (PSI) framework to tackle with scribble-supervised semantic segmentation. In virtue of latent contextual depen-dency, we encapsulate two crucial cues, contextual pattern propagation and semantic label diffusion, to enhance and refine pixel-level segmentation results from partially known seeds. In contextual pattern propagation, different-granular contextual patterns are correlated and leveraged to prop-erly diffuse pattern information based on graphical model, so as to increase the inference confidence of pixel label pre-diction. Further, depending on high-confidence scores of estimated pixels, the initial annotated seeds are progres-sively spread over the image through dynamically learn-ing an adaptive decision strategy. The two cues are finally modularized to form a close-looping update process during pixel-wise label inference. Extensive experiments demon-strate that our proposed progressive segmentation inference can benefit from the combination of spatial and semantic context cues, and meantime achieve the state-of-the-art per-formance on two public scribble segmentation datasets.
