Volumetric design is the ﬁrst and critical step for pro-fessional building design, where architects not only depict the rough 3D geometry of the building but also specify the programs to form a 2D layout on each ﬂoor. Though 2D layout generation for a single story has been widely studied, there is no developed method for multi-story buildings. This paper focuses on volumetric design generation conditioned on an input program graph. Instead of outputting dense 3D voxels, we propose a new 3D representation named voxel graph that is both compact and expressive for building ge-ometries. Our generator is a cross-modal graph neural network that uses a pointer mechanism to connect the in-put program graph and the output voxel graph, and the whole pipeline is trained using the adversarial framework.The generated designs are evaluated qualitatively by a user study and quantitatively using three metrics: quality, diver-sity, and connectivity accuracy. We show that our model generates realistic 3D volumetric designs and outperforms previous methods and baselines.
