We study the problem of understanding hand-object in-teractions from 2D images in the wild. This requires recon-structing both the hand and the object in 3D, which is chal-lenging because of the mutual occlusion between the hand and the object. In this paper we make two main contribu-tions: (1) a novel reconstruction technique, RHO (Recon-structing Hands and Objects), which reconstructs 3D mod-els of both the hand and the object leveraging the 2D image cues and 3D contact priors; (2) a dataset MOW (Manipu-lating Objects in the Wild) of 500 examples of hand-object interaction images that have been ”3Dﬁed” with the help of the RHO technique. Overall our dataset contains 121 distinct object categories, with a much greater diversity of manipulation actions, than in previous datasets.
