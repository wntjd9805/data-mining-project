This paper introduces a powerful channel augmented joint learning strategy for the visible-infrared recognition problem. For data augmentation, most existing methods di-rectly adopt the standard operations designed for single-modality visible images, and thus do not fully consider the imagery properties in visible to infrared matching. Our ba-sic idea is to homogenously generate color-irrelevant im-It can ages by randomly exchanging the color channels. be seamlessly integrated into existing augmentation oper-ations without modifying the network, consistently improv-ing the robustness against color variations. Incorporated with a random erasing strategy, it further greatly enriches the diversity by simulating random occlusions. For cross-modality metric learning, we design an enhanced channel-mixed learning strategy to simultaneously handle the intra-and cross-modality variations with squared difference for stronger discriminability. Besides, a channel-augmented joint learning strategy is further developed to explicitly op-timize the outputs of augmented images. Extensive experi-ments with insightful analysis on two visible-infrared recog-nition tasks show that the proposed strategies consistently improve the accuracy.
