The lack of clean images undermines the practicability of supervised image prior learning methods, of which the training schemes require a large number of clean images.To free image prior learning from the image collection bur-den, a novel Self-Supervised learning method for GaussianMixture Model (SS-GMM) is proposed in this paper. It can simultaneously achieve the noise level estimation and the image prior learning directly from only a single noisy im-age. This work is derived from our study on eigenvalues of the GMMâ€™s covariance matrix. Through statistical experi-ments and theoretical analysis, we conclude that (1) covari-ance eigenvalues for clean images hold the sparsity; and that (2) those for noisy images contain sufficient informa-tion for noise estimation. The first conclusion inspires us to impose a sparsity constraint on covariance eigenvalues dur-ing the learning process to suppress the influence of noise.The second conclusion leads to a self-contained noise esti-mation module of high accuracy in our proposed method.This module serves to estimate the noise level and auto-matically determine the specific level of the sparsity con-straint. Our final derived method requires only minor mod-ifications to the standard expectation-maximization algo-rithm. This makes it easy to implement. Very interestingly, the GMM learned via our proposed self-supervised learn-ing method can even achieve better image denoising per-formance than its supervised counterpart, i.e., the EPLL.Also, it is on par with the state-of-the-art self-supervised deep learning method, i.e., the Self2Self.
