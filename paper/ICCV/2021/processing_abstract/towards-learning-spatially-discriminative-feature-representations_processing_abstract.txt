The backbone of traditional CNN classifier is generally considered as a feature extractor, followed by a linear layer which performs the classification. We propose a novel loss function, termed as CAM-loss, to constrain the embedded feature maps with the class activation maps (CAMs) which indicate the spatially discriminative regions of an image for particular categories. CAM-loss drives the backbone to ex-press the features of target category and suppress the fea-tures of non-target categories or background, so as to ob-tain more discriminative feature representations. It can be simply applied in any CNN architecture with neglectable additional parameters and calculations. Experimental re-sults show that CAM-loss is applicable to a variety of net-work structures and can be combined with mainstream reg-ularization methods to improve the performance of image classification. The strong generalization ability of CAM-loss is validated in the transfer learning and few shot learn-ing tasks. Based on CAM-loss, we also propose a novelCAAM-CAM matching knowledge distillation method. This method directly uses the CAM generated by the teacher net-work to supervise the CAAM generated by the student net-work, which effectively improves the accuracy and conver-gence rate of the student network.
