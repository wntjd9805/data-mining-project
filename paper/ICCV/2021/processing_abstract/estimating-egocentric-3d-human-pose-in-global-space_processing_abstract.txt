Egocentric 3D human pose estimation using a single fisheye camera has become popular recently as it allows capturing a wide range of daily activities in unconstrained environments, which is difficult for traditional outside-in motion capture with external cameras. However, existing methods have several limitations. A prominent problem is that the estimated poses lie in the local coordinate sys-tem of the fisheye camera, rather than in the world coor-dinate system, which is restrictive for many applications.Furthermore, these methods suffer from limited accuracy and temporal instability due to ambiguities caused by the monocular setup and the severe occlusion in a strongly distorted egocentric perspective. To tackle these limita-tions, we present a new method for egocentric global 3D body pose estimation using a single head-mounted fish-eye camera. To achieve accurate and temporally stable global poses, a spatio-temporal optimization is performed over a sequence of frames by minimizing heatmap repro-jection errors and enforcing local and global body motion priors learned from a mocap dataset. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art meth-ods both quantitatively and qualitatively.
