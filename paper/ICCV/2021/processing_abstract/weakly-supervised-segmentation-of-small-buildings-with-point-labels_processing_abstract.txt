Most supervised image segmentation methods require delicate and time-consuming pixel-level labeling of build-ing or objects, especially for small objects. In this paper, we present a weakly supervised segmentation network for aerial/satellite images, separately considering small and large objects. First, we propose a simple point labeling method for small objects, while large objects are fully la-beled. Then, we present a segmentation network trained with a small object mask to separate small and large objects in the loss function. During training, we employ a memory bank to cope with the limited number of point labels. Ex-periments results with three public datasets demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.
