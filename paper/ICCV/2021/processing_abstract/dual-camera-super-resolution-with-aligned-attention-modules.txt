We present a novel approach to reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) with the focus on dual-camera super-resolution (DCSR), which utilizes reference images for high-quality and high-Ô¨Ådelity results. Our proposed method generalizes the standard patch-based feature matching with spatial alignment operations. We further explore the dual-camera super-resolution that is one promising applica-tion of RefSR, and build a dataset that consists of 146 image pairs from the main and telephoto cameras in a smartphone. To bridge the domain gaps between real-world images and the training images, we propose a self-supervised domain adaptation strategy for real-world im-ages. Extensive experiments on our dataset and a pub-lic benchmark demonstrate clear improvement achieved by our method over state of the art in both quantitative eval-uation and visual comparisons.
