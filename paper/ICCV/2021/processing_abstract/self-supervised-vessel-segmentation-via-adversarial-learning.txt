Vessel segmentation is critically essential for diagnosing a series of diseases, e.g., coronary artery disease and reti-nal disease. However, annotating vessel segmentation maps of medical images is notoriously challenging due to the tiny and complex vessel structures, leading to insufﬁcient avail-able annotated datasets for existing supervised methods and domain adaptation methods. The subtle structures and con-fusing background of medical images further suppress the efﬁcacy of unsupervised methods. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised vessel segmentation method via adversar-ial learning. Our method learns vessel representations by training an attention-guided generator and a segmentation generator to simultaneously synthesize fake vessels and seg-ment vessels out of coronary angiograms. To support the research, we also build the ﬁrst X-ray angiography coro-nary vessel segmentation dataset, named XCAD. We evalu-ate our method extensively on multiple vessel segmentation datasets, including the XCAD dataset, the DRIVE dataset, and the STARE dataset. The experimental results show our method suppresses unsupervised methods signiﬁcantly and achieves competitive performance compared with su-pervised methods and traditional methods.
