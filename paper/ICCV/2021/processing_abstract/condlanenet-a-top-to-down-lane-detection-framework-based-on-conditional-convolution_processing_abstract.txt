Modern deep-learning-based lane detection methods are successful in most scenarios but struggling for lane lines with complex topologies. In this work, we propose Cond-LaneNet, a novel top-to-down lane detection framework that detects the lane instances ﬁrst and then dynamically predicts the line shape for each instance. Aiming to re-solve lane instance-level discrimination problem, we intro-duce a conditional lane detection strategy based on condi-tional convolution and row-wise formulation. Further, we design the Recurrent Instance Module(RIM) to overcome the problem of detecting lane lines with complex topolo-gies such as dense lines and fork lines. Beneﬁt from the end-to-end pipeline which requires little post-process, our method has real-time efﬁciency. We extensively evaluate our method on three benchmarks of lane detection. Re-sults show that our method achieves state-of-the-art per-formance on all three benchmark datasets. Moreover, our method has the coexistence of accuracy and efﬁciency, e.g. a 78.14 F1 score and 220 FPS on CULane. Our code is available at https://github.com/aliyun/ conditional-lane-detection.
