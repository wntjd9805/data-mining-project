Pixel-to-mesh has wide applications, especially in virtual or augmented reality, animation and game industry. How-ever, existing mesh reconstruction models perform unsat-isfactorily in local geometry details due to ignoring mesh topology information during learning. Besides, most meth-ods are constrained by the initial template, which can-not reconstruct meshes of various genus.In this work, we propose a geometric granularity-aware pixel-to-mesh framework with a ﬁdelity-selection-and-guarantee strategy, which explicitly addresses both challenges. First, a geome-try structure extractor is proposed for detecting local high structured parts and capturing local spatial feature. Sec-ond, we apply it to facilitate pixel-to-mesh mapping and re-solve coarse details problem caused by the neglect of struc-tural information in previous practices. Finally, a mesh edit module is proposed to encourage non-zero genus topology to emergence by ﬁne-grained topology modiﬁcation and a patching algorithm is introduced to repair the non-closed boundaries. Extensive experimental results, both quantita-tively and visually have demonstrated the high reconstruc-tion ﬁdelity achieved by the proposed framework.

Rel-atively, our method can better deal with the topology in de-tails and reconstruct holes of the object without non-closed boundaries.
