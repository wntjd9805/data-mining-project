Matching local features across images is a fundamen-tal problem in computer vision. Targeting towards high ac-curacy and efficiency, we propose Seeded Graph MatchingNetwork, a graph neural network with sparse structure to reduce redundant connectivity and learn compact represen-tation. The network consists of 1) Seeding Module, which initializes the matching by generating a small set of reli-able matches as seeds. 2) Seeded Graph Neural Network, which utilizes seed matches to pass messages within/across images and predicts assignment costs. Three novel opera-tions are proposed as basic elements for message passing: 1) Attentional Pooling, which aggregates keypoint features within the image to seed matches. 2) Seed Filtering, which enhances seed features and exchanges messages across im-ages. 3) Attentional Unpooling, which propagates seed fea-tures back to original keypoints. Experiments show that our method reduces computational and memory complexity sig-nificantly compared with typical attention-based networks while competitive or higher performance is achieved.
