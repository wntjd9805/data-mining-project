We present QueryInst, a new perspective for instance segmentation. QueryInst is a multi-stage end-to-end sys-tem that treats instances of interest as learnable queries, enabling query based object detectors, e.g., Sparse R-CNN, to have strong instance segmentation performance.The attributes of instances such as categories, bounding boxes, instance masks, and instance association embed-dings are represented by queries in a unified manner.InQueryInst, a query is shared by both detection and segmen-tation via dynamic convolutions and driven by parallelly-supervised multi-stage learning. We conduct extensive ex-periments on three challenging benchmarks, i.e., COCO,CityScapes, and YouTube-VIS to evaluate the effectiveness of QueryInst in object detection, instance segmentation, and video instance segmentation tasks. For the first time, we demonstrate that a simple end-to-end query based frame-work can achieve the state-of-the-art performance in vari-ous instance-level recognition tasks.
