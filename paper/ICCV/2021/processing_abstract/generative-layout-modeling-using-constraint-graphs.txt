We propose a new generative model for layout generation.We generate layouts in three steps. First, we generate the layout elements as nodes in a layout graph. Second, we compute constraints between layout elements as edges in the layout graph. Third, we solve for the ﬁnal layout using constrained optimization. For the ﬁrst two steps, we build on recent transformer architectures. The layout optimiza-tion implements the constraints efﬁciently. We show three practical contributions compared to the state of the art: our work requires no user input, produces higher quality layouts, and enables many novel capabilities for conditional layout generation.
