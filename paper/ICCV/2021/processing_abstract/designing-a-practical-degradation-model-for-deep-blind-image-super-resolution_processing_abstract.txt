It is widely acknowledged that single image super-resolution (SISR) methods would not perform well if the assumed degradation model deviates from those in real im-ages. Although several degradation models take additional factors into consideration, such as blur, they are still not ef-fective enough to cover the diverse degradations of real im-ages. To address this issue, this paper proposes to design a more complex but practical degradation model that consists of randomly shuffled blur, downsampling and noise degra-dations. Specifically, the blur is approximated by two con-volutions with isotropic and anisotropic Gaussian kernels; the downsampling is randomly chosen from nearest, bilin-ear and bicubic interpolations; the noise is synthesized by adding Gaussian noise with different noise levels, adoptingJPEG compression with different quality factors, and gen-erating processed camera sensor noise via reverse-forward camera image signal processing (ISP) pipeline model andRAW image noise model. To verify the effectiveness of the new degradation model, we have trained a deep blind ES-RGAN super-resolver and then applied it to super-resolve both synthetic and real images with diverse degradations.The experimental results demonstrate that the new degra-dation model can help to significantly improve the practi-cability of deep super-resolvers, thus providing a powerful alternative solution for real SISR applications.
