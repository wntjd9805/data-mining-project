Recent progress in multi-object tracking (MOT) has shown great significance of a robust scoring mechanism for potential tracks. However, the lack of available data in MOT makes it difficult to learn a general scoring mech-anism. Multiple cues including appearance, motion and etc., are limitedly utilized in current manual scoring func-tions. In this paper, we propose a Multiple Nodes Track-ing ( MNT) framework that adapts to most trackers. Based on this framework, a Recurrent Tracking Unit (RTU) is de-signed to score potential tracks through long-term informa-tion. In addition, we present a method of generating simu-lated tracking data without real data to overcome the defect of limited available data in MOT. The experiments demon-strate that our simulated tracking data is effective for train-ing RTU and achieves state-of-the-art performance on bothMOT17 and MOT16 benchmarks. Meanwhile, RTU can be flexibly plugged into classic trackers such as DeepSORT and MHT, and makes remarkable improvements as well.
