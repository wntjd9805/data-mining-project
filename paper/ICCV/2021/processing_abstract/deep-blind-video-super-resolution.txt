Existing video super-resolution (SR) algorithms usually assume that the blur kernels in the degradation process are known and do not model the blur kernels in the restora-tion. However, this assumption does not hold for blind video SR and usually leads to over-smoothed super-resolved frames. In this paper, we propose an effective blind videoSR algorithm based on deep convolutional neural network-s (CNNs). Our algorithm ﬁrst estimates blur kernels from low-resolution (LR) input videos. Then, with the estimated blur kernels, we develop an effective image deconvolution method based on the image formation model of blind videoSR to generate intermediate latent frames so that sharp im-age contents can be restored well. To effectively explore the information from adjacent frames, we estimate the motionﬁelds from LR input videos, extract features from LR videos by a feature extraction network, and warp the extracted fea-tures from LR inputs based on the motion ﬁelds. Moreover, we develop an effective sharp feature exploration method which ﬁrst extracts sharp features from restored intermedi-ate latent frames and then uses a transformation operation based on the extracted sharp features and warped features from LR inputs to generate better features for HR video restoration. We formulate the proposed algorithm into an∗Corresponding author. end-to-end trainable framework and show that it performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.
