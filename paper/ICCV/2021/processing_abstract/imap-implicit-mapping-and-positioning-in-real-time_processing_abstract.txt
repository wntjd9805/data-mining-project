We show for the ﬁrst time that a multilayer perceptron (MLP) can serve as the only scene representation in a real-time SLAM system for a handheld RGB-D camera. Our net-work is trained in live operation without prior data, build-ing a dense, scene-speciﬁc implicit 3D model of occupancy and colour which is also immediately used for tracking.Achieving real-time SLAM via continual training of a neural network against a live image stream requires sig-niﬁcant innovation. Our iMAP algorithm uses a keyframe structure and multi-processing computation ﬂow, with dy-namic information-guided pixel sampling for speed, with tracking at 10 Hz and global map updating at 2 Hz. The advantages of an implicit MLP over standard dense SLAM techniques include efﬁcient geometry representation with automatic detail control and smooth, plausible ﬁlling-in of unobserved regions such as the back surfaces of objects.
