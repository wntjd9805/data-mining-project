Manually annotating object segmentation masks is very time-consuming. While interactive segmentation methods offer a more efficient alternative, they become unafford-able at a large scale because the cost grows linearly with the number of annotated masks.In this paper, we pro-pose a highly efficient annotation scheme for building large datasets with object segmentation masks. At a large scale, images contain many object instances with similar appear-ance. We exploit these similarities by using hierarchi-cal clustering on mask predictions made by a segmenta-tion model. We propose a scheme that efficiently searches through the hierarchy of clusters and selects which clusters to annotate. Humans manually verify only a few masks per cluster, and the labels are propagated to the whole clus-ter. Through a large-scale experiment to populate 1M unla-beled images with object segmentation masks for 80 object classes, we show that (1) we obtain 1M object segmenta-tion masks with an total annotation time of only 290 hours; (2) we reduce annotation time by 76Ã— compared to man-ual annotation; (3) the segmentation quality of our masks is on par with those from manually annotated datasets. Code, data, and models are available online1.
