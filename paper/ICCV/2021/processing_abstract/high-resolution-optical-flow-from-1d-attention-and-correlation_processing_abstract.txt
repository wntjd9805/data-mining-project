Optical flow is inherently a 2D search problem, and thus the computational complexity grows quadratically with re-spect to the search window, making large displacements matching infeasible for high-resolution images. In this pa-per, we take inspiration from Transformers and propose a new method for high-resolution optical flow estimation with significantly less computation. Specifically, a 1D attention operation is first applied in the vertical direction of the tar-get image, and then a simple 1D correlation in the hori-zontal direction of the attended image is able to achieve 2D correspondence modeling effect. The directions of atten-tion and correlation can also be exchanged, resulting in two 3D cost volumes that are concatenated for optical flow es-timation. The novel 1D formulation empowers our method to scale to very high-resolution input images while main-taining competitive performance. Extensive experiments onSintel, KITTI and real-world 4K (2160 Ã— 3840) resolution images demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.
