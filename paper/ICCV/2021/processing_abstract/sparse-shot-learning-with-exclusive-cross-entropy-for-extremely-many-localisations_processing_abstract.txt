Object localisation, in the context of regular images, of-ten depicts objects like people or cars.In these images, there is typically a relatively small number of objects per class, which usually is manageable to annotate. However, outside the setting of regular images, we are often con-fronted with a different situation. In computational pathol-ogy, digitised tissue sections are extremely large images, whose dimensions quickly exceed 250’000 × 250’000 pix-els, where relevant objects, such as tumour cells or lympho-cytes can quickly number in the millions. Annotating them all is practically impossible and annotating sparsely a few, out of many more, is the only possibility. Unfortunately, learning from sparse annotations, or sparse-shot learning, clashes with standard supervised learning because what is not annotated is treated as a negative. However, assigning negative labels to what are true positives leads to confu-sion in the gradients and biased learning. To this end, we present exclusive cross-entropy, which slows down the bi-ased learning by examining the second-order loss deriva-tives in order to drop the loss terms corresponding to likely biased terms. Experiments on nine datasets and two differ-ent localisation tasks, detection with YOLLO and segmenta-tion with Unet, show that we obtain considerable improve-ments compared to cross-entropy or focal loss, while often reaching the best possible performance for the model with only 10-40% of annotations.
