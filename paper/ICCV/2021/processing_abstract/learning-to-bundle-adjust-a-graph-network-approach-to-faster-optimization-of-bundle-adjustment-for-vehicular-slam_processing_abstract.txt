Bundle adjustment (BA) occupies a large portion of the execution time of SfM and visual SLAM. Local BA over the latest several keyframes plays a crucial role in visualSLAM. Its execution time should be sufficiently short for ro-bust tracking; this is especially critical for embedded sys-tems with a limited computational resource. This study pro-poses a learning-based bundle adjuster using a graph net-work. It works faster and can be used instead of conven-tional optimization-based BA. The graph network operates on a graph consisting of the nodes of keyframes and land-marks and the edges representing the landmarks’ visibility.The graph network receives the parameters’ initial values as inputs and predicts their updates to the optimal values.It internally uses an intermediate representation of inputs which we design inspired by the normal equation of theLevenberg-Marquardt method. It is trained using the sum of reprojection errors as a loss function. The experiments show that the proposed method outputs parameter estimates with slightly inferior accuracy in 1/60–1/10 of time com-pared with the conventional BA.
