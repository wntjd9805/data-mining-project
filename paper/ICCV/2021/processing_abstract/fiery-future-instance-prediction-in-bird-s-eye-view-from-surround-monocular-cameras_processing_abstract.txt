Driving requires interacting with road agents and pre-dicting their future behaviour in order to navigate safely.We present FIERY: a probabilistic future prediction model in bird’s-eye view from monocular cameras. Our model pre-dicts future instance segmentation and motion of dynamic agents that can be transformed into non-parametric future trajectories. Our approach combines the perception, sen-sor fusion and prediction components of a traditional au-tonomous driving stack by estimating bird’s-eye-view pre-diction directly from surround RGB monocular camera in-puts. FIERY learns to model the inherent stochastic nature of the future solely from camera driving data in an end-to-end manner, without relying on HD maps, and predicts mul-timodal future trajectories. We show that our model outper-forms previous prediction baselines on the NuScenes andLyft datasets. The code and trained models are available at https://github.com/wayveai/fiery.
