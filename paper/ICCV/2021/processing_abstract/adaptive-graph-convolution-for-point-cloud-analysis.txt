Convolution on 3D point clouds that generalized from 2D grid-like domains is widely researched yet far from per-fect. The standard convolution characterises feature cor-respondences indistinguishably among 3D points, present-ing an intrinsic limitation of poor distinctive feature learn-ing. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Graph Convolution (AdaptConv) which generates adaptive kernels for points according to their dynamically learned features. Compared with using a ﬁxed/isotropic kernel, AdaptConv improves theﬂexibility of point cloud convolutions, effectively and pre-cisely capturing the diverse relations between points from different semantic parts. Unlike popular attentional weight schemes, the proposed AdaptConv implements the adaptive-ness inside the convolution operation instead of simply as-signing different weights to the neighboring points. Exten-sive qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art point cloud classiﬁca-tion and segmentation approaches on several benchmark datasets.
