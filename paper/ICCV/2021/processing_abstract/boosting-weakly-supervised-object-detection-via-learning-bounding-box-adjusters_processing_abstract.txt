object (WSOD) detectionWeakly-supervised has emerged as an inspiring recent topic to avoid expensive instance-level object annotations. However, the bounding boxes of most existing WSOD methods are mainly deter-mined by precomputed proposals, thereby being limited in precise object localization.In this paper, we defend the problem setting for improving localization performance by leveraging the bounding box regression knowledge from a well-annotated auxiliary dataset. First, we use the well-annotated auxiliary dataset to explore a series of learnable bounding box adjusters (LBBAs) in a multi-stage training manner, which is class-agnostic. Then, only LB-BAs and a weakly-annotated dataset with non-overlapped classes are used for training LBBA-boosted WSOD. As such, our LBBAs are practically more convenient and economical to implement while avoiding the leakage of the auxiliary well-annotated dataset.In particular, we formulate learning bounding box adjusters as a bi-level optimization problem and suggest an EM-like multi-stage training algorithm. Then, a multi-stage scheme is further presented for LBBA-boosted WSOD. Additionally, a mask-ing strategy is adopted to improve proposal classification.Experimental results verify the effectiveness of our method.Our method performs favorably against state-of-the-artWSOD methods and knowledge transfer model with similar problem setting.
