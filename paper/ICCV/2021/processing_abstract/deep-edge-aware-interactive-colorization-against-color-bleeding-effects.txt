Deep neural networks for automatic image colorization often suffer from the color-bleeding artifact, a problematic color spreading near the boundaries between adjacent ob-jects. Such color-bleeding artifacts debase the reality of generated outputs, limiting the applicability of colorization models in practice. Although previous approaches have at-tempted to address this problem in an automatic manner, they tend to work only in limited cases where a high con-trast of gray-scale values are given in an input image. Al-ternatively, leveraging user interactions would be a promis-ing approach for solving this color-breeding artifacts. In this paper, we propose a novel edge-enhancing network for* indicates equal contribution the regions of interest via simple user scribbles indicating where to enhance. In addition, our method requires a min-imal amount of effort from users for their satisfactory en-hancement. Experimental results demonstrate that our in-teractive edge-enhancing approach effectively improves the color-bleeding artifacts compared to the existing baselines across various datasets.
