In digital pathology, both detection and classification of cells are important for automatic diagnostic and prognos-tic tasks. Classifying cells into subtypes, such as tumor cells, lymphocytes or stromal cells is particularly challeng-ing. Existing methods focus on morphological appearance of individual cells, whereas in practice pathologists often infer cell classes through their spatial context. In this pa-per, we propose a novel method for both detection and clas-sification that explicitly incorporates spatial contextual in-formation. We use the spatial statistical function to describe local density in both a multi-class and a multi-scale manner.Through representation learning and deep clustering tech-niques, we learn advanced cell representation with both ap-pearance and spatial context. On various benchmarks, our method achieves better performance than state-of-the-arts, especially on the classification task.
