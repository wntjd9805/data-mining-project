We proposes a ï¬‚exible person generation framework called Dressing in Order (DiOr), which supports 2D pose transfer, virtual try-on, and several fashion editing tasks.The key to DiOr is a novel recurrent generation pipeline to sequentially put garments on a person, so that trying on the same garments in different orders will result in different looks. Our system can produce dressing effects not achiev-able by existing work, including different interactions of garments (e.g., wearing a top tucked into the bottom or over it), as well as layering of multiple garments of the same type (e.g., jacket over shirt over t-shirt). DiOr explicitly encodes the shape and texture of each garment, enabling these ele-ments to be edited separately. Joint training on pose trans-fer and inpainting helps with detail preservation and coher-ence of generated garments. Extensive evaluations show that DiOr outperforms other recent methods like ADGAN[28] in terms of output quality, and handles a wide range of editing functions for which there is no direct supervision.
