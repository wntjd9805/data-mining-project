Compared with the progress made on human activity classification, much less success has been achieved on hu-man interaction understanding (HIU). Apart from the latter task is much more challenging, the main cause is that re-cent approaches learn human interactive relations via shal-low graphical models, which is inadequate to model com-plicated human interactions. In this paper, we propose a consistency-aware graph network, which combines the rep-resentative ability of graph network and the consistency-aware reasoning to facilitate HIU. Our network consists of three components, a backbone CNN to extract image fea-tures, a factor graph network to learn third-order interac-tive relations among participants, and a consistency-aware reasoning module to enforce labeling and grouping consis-tencies. Our key observation is that the consistency-aware-reasoning bias for HIU can be embedded into an energy, minimizing which delivers consistent predictions. An effi-cient mean-field inference algorithm is proposed, such that all modules of our network could be trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Experimental results show that our ap-proach achieves leading performance on three benchmarks.Code is available at https://git.io/CAGNet.
