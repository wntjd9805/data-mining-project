Accuracy predictor is a key component in Neural Ar-chitecture Search (NAS) for ranking architectures. Build-ing a high-quality accuracy predictor usually costs enor-mous computation. To address this issue, instead of us-ing an accuracy predictor, we propose a novel zero-shot index dubbed Zen-Score to rank the architectures. The Zen-Score represents the network expressivity and positively correlates with the model accuracy. The calculation ofZen-Score only takes a few forward inferences through a randomly initialized network, without training network pa-rameters. Built upon the Zen-Score, we further propose a new NAS algorithm, termed as Zen-NAS, by maximiz-ing the Zen-Score of the target network under given infer-ence budgets. Within less than half GPU day, Zen-NAS is able to directly search high performance architectures in a data-free style. Comparing with previous NAS methods, the proposed Zen-NAS is magnitude times faster on multi-ple server-side and mobile-side GPU platforms with state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet. Searching and train-ing code as well as pre-trained models are available from https://github.com/idstcv/ZenNAS.
