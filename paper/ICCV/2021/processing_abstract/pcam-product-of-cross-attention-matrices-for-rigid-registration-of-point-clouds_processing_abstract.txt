Rigid registration of point clouds with partial overlaps is a longstanding problem usually solved in two steps: (a)ﬁnding correspondences between the point clouds; (b) ﬁl-tering these correspondences to keep only the most reliable ones to estimate the transformation. Recently, several deep nets have been proposed to solve these steps jointly. We built upon these works and propose PCAM: a neural net-work whose key element is a pointwise product of cross-attention matrices that permits to mix both low-level geo-metric and high-level contextual information to ﬁnd point correspondences. These cross-attention matrices also per-mits the exchange of context information between the point clouds, at each layer, allowing the network construct bet-ter matching features within the overlapping regions. The experiments show that PCAM achieves state-of-the-art re-sults among methods which, like us, solve steps (a) and (b) jointly via deepnets.
