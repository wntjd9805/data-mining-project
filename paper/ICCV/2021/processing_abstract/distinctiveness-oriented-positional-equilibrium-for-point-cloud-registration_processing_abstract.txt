Recent state-of-the-art learning-based approaches to point cloud registration have largely been based on graph neural networks (GNN). However, these prominent GNN backbones suffer from the indistinguishable features prob-lem associated with oversmoothing and structural ambigu-ity of the high-level features, a crucial bottleneck to point cloud registration that has evaded scrutiny in the recent relevant literature. To address this issue, we propose theDistinctiveness oriented Positional Equilibrium (DoPE) module, a novel positional embedding scheme that signiﬁ-cantly improves the distinctiveness of the high-level features within both the source and target point clouds, resulting in superior point matching and hence registration accuracy.Speciﬁcally, we use the DoPE module in an iterative regis-tration framework, whereby the two point clouds are gradu-ally registered via rigid transformations that are computed from DoPE’s position-aware features. With every successive iteration, the DoPE module feeds increasingly consistent positional information to would-be corresponding pairs, which in turn enhances the resulting point-to-point corre-spondence predictions used to estimate the rigid transfor-mation. Within only a few iterations, the network converges to a desired equilibrium, where the positional embeddings given to matching pairs become essentially identical. We validate the effectiveness of DoPE through comprehensive experiments on various registration benchmarks, registra-tion task settings, and prominent backbones, yielding un-precedented performance improvement across all combina-tions.
