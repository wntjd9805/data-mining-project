In this paper, we decouple unsupervised human mesh re-covery into the well-studied problems of unsupervised 3D pose estimation, and human mesh recovery from estimated 3D skeletons, focusing on the latter task. The challenges of the latter task are two folds: (1) pose failure (i.e., pose mismatching – different skeleton deﬁnitions in dataset andSMPL , and pose ambiguity – endpoints have arbitrary joint angle conﬁgurations for the same 3D joint coordinates). (2) shape ambiguity (i.e., the lack of shape constraints on body conﬁguration). To address these issues, we propose Skele-ton2Mesh, a novel lightweight framework that recovers hu-man mesh from a single image. Our Skeleton2Mesh con-tains three modules, i.e., Differentiable Inverse Kinematics (DIK), Pose Reﬁnement (PR) and Shape Reﬁnement (SR) modules. DIK is designed to transfer 3D rotation from estimated 3D skeletons, which relies on a minimal set of kinematics prior knowledge. Then PR and SR modules are utilized to tackle the pose ambiguity and shape ambiguity respectively. All three modules can be incorporated intoSkeleton2Mesh seamlessly via an end-to-end manner. Fur-thermore, we utilize an adaptive joint regressor to allevi-ate the effects of skeletal topology from different datasets.Results on the Human3.6M dataset for human mesh recov-ery demonstrate that our method improves upon the previ-ous unsupervised methods by 32.6% under the same setting.Qualitative results on in-the-wild datasets exhibit that the recovered 3D meshes are natural, realistic.
