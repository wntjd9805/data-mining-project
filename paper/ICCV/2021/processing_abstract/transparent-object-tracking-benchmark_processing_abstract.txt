Visual tracking has achieved considerable progress in re-cent years. However, current research in the ﬁeld mainly fo-cuses on tracking of opaque objects, while little attention is paid to transparent object tracking. In this paper, we make the ﬁrst attempt in exploring this problem by proposing aTransparent Object Tracking Benchmark (TOTB). Speciﬁ-cally, TOTB consists of 225 videos (86K frames) from 15 di-verse transparent object categories. Each sequence is man-ually labeled with axis-aligned bounding boxes. To the best of our knowledge, TOTB is the ﬁrst benchmark dedicated to transparent object tracking. In order to understand how ex-isting trackers perform and to provide comparison for future research on TOTB, we extensively evaluate 25 state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. The evaluation results exhibit that more efforts are needed to improve transparent object track-ing. Besides, we observe some nontrivial ﬁndings from the evaluation that are discrepant with some common beliefs in opaque object tracking. For example, we ﬁnd that deeper features are not always good for improvements. Moreover, to encourage future research, we introduce a novel tracker, named TransATOM, which leverages transparency features for tracking and surpasses all 25 evaluated approaches by a large margin. By releasing TOTB, we expect to facilitate fu-ture research and application of transparent object tracking in both the academia and industry. The TOTB and evalua-tion results as well as TransATOM are available at https://hengfan2010.github.io/projects/TOTB/.
