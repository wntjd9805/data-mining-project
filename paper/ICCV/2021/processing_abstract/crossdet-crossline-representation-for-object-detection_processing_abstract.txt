Object detection aims to accurately locate and classify objects in an image, which requires precise object represen-tations. Existing methods usually use rectangular anchor boxes or a set of points to represent objects. However, these methods either introduce background noise or miss the con-tinuous appearance information inside the object, and thus cause incorrect detection results. In this paper, we propose a novel anchor-free object detection network, called Cross-Det, which uses a set of growing cross lines along horizon-tal and vertical axes as object representations. An object can be flexibly represented as cross lines in different com-binations. It not only can effectively reduce the interference of noise, but also take into account the continuous object information, which is useful to enhance the discriminabil-ity of object features and find the object boundaries. Based on the learned cross lines, we propose a crossline extrac-tion module to adaptively capture features of cross lines.Furthermore, we design a decoupled regression mechanism to regress the localization along the horizontal and verti-cal directions respectively, which helps to decrease the op-timization difficulty because the optimization space is lim-ited to a specific direction. Our method achieves consis-tently improvement on the PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets. The experiment results demonstrate the effective-ness of our proposed method.
