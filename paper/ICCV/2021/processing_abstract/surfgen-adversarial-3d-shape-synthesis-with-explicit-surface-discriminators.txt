Recent advances in deep generative models have led to immense progress in 3D shape synthesis. While existing models are able to synthesize shapes represented as voxels, point-clouds, or implicit functions, these methods only indi-rectly enforce the plausibility of the ﬁnal 3D shape surface.Here we present a 3D shape synthesis framework (SurfGen) that directly applies adversarial training to the object sur-face. Our approach uses a differentiable spherical projec-tion layer to capture and represent the explicit zero isosur-face of an implicit 3D generator as functions deﬁned on the unit sphere. By processing the spherical representation of 3D object surfaces with a spherical CNN in an adversarial setting, our generator can better learn the statistics of nat-ural shape surfaces. We evaluate our model on large-scale shape datasets, and demonstrate that the end-to-end trained model is capable of generating high ﬁdelity 3D shapes with diverse topology.
