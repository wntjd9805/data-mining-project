Image-level weakly supervised semantic segmentation is a challenging task. As classiﬁcation networks tend to cap-ture notable object features and are insensitive to over-activation, class activation map (CAM) is too sparse and rough to guide segmentation network training. Inspired by the fact that erasing distinguishing features force networks to collect new ones from non-discriminative object regions, we using relationships between CAMs to propose a novel weakly supervised method. In this work, we apply these fea-tures, learned from erased images, as segmentation super-vision, driving network to study robust representation. In speciﬁcally, object regions obtained by CAM techniques are erased on images ﬁrstly. To provide other regions with seg-mentation supervision, Erased CAM Supervision Net (ECS-Net) generates pixel-level labels by predicting segmentation results of those processed images. We also design the rule of suppressing noise to select reliable labels. Our exper-iments on PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset show that without data annotations except for ground truth image-level la-bels, our ECS-Net achieves 67.6% mIoU on test set and 66.6% mIoU on val set, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods.
