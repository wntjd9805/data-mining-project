Ultra-high resolution image segmentation has raised in-creasing interests in recent years due to its realistic appli-cations. In this paper, we innovate the widely used high-resolution image segmentation pipeline, in which an ultra-high resolution image is partitioned into regular patches for local segmentation and then the local results are merged into a high-resolution semantic mask. In particular, we in-troduce a novel locality-aware contextual correlation based segmentation model to process local patches, where the relevance between local patch and its various contexts are jointly and complementarily utilized to handle the se-mantic regions with large variations. Additionally, we present a contextual semantics reﬁnement network that as-sociates the local segmentation result with its contextual semantics, and thus is endowed with the ability of reduc-ing boundary artifacts and reﬁning mask contours dur-ing the generation of ﬁnal high-resolution mask. Further-more, in comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in public benchmarks.
