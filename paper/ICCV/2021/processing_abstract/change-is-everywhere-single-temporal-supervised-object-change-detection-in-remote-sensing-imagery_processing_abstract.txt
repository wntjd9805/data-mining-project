For high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing im-ages, bitemporal supervised learning always dominates change detection using many pairwise labeled bitemporal images. However, it is very expensive and time-consuming to pairwise label large-scale bitemporal HSR remote sens-ing images. In this paper, we propose single-temporal su-pervised learning (STAR) for change detection from a new perspective of exploiting object changes in unpaired im-ages as supervisory signals.STAR enables us to train a high-accuracy change detector only using unpaired la-beled images and generalize to real-world bitemporal im-ages. To evaluate the effectiveness of STAR, we design a simple yet effective change detector called ChangeStar, which can reuse any deep semantic segmentation architec-ture by the ChangeMixin module. The comprehensive ex-perimental results show that ChangeStar outperforms the baseline with a large margin under single-temporal super-vision and achieves superior performance under bitempo-ral supervision.
