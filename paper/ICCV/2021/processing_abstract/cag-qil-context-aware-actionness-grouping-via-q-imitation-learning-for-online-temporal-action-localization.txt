Temporal action localization has been one of the most popular tasks in video understanding, due to the importance of detecting action instances in videos. However, not much progress has been made on extending it to work in an on-line fashion, although many video related tasks can benefit by going online with the growing video streaming services.To this end, we introduce a new task called Online TemporalAction Localization (On-TAL), in which the goal is to imme-diately detect action instances from an untrimmed stream-ing video. The online setting makes the new task very chal-lenging as the actionness decision for every frame has to be made without access to future frames and also because post-processing methods cannot be used to modify past action proposals. We propose a novel framework, Context-AwareActionness Grouping (CAG) as a solution for On-TAL and train it with the imitation learning algorithm, which allows us to avoid sophisticated reward engineering. Evaluation of our work on THUMOS14 and Activitynet1.3 shows sig-nificant improvement over non-naive baselines, demonstrat-ing the effectiveness of our approach. As a by-product, our method can also be used for the Online Detection of Ac-tion Start (ODAS), in which our method also outperforms previous state-of-the-art models.
