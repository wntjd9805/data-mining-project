Existing calibration methods occasionally fail for large ﬁeld-of-view cameras due to the non-linearity of the underlying problem and the lack of good initial values for all parameters of the used camera model. This might occur because a simpler projection model is assumed in an initial step, or a poor initial guess for the internal parameters is pre-deﬁned. A lot of the difﬁculties of general camera calibration lie in the use of a forward projection model.We side-step these challenges by ﬁrst proposing a solver to calibrate the parameters in terms of a back-projection model and then regress the parameters for a target for-ward model. These steps are incorporated in a robust estimation framework to cope with outlying detections.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is very reliable and returns the most accurate calibration parameters as measured on the downstream task of abso-lute pose estimation on test sets.
