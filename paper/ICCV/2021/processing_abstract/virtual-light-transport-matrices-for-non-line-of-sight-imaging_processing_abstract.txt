The light transport matrix (LTM) is an instrumental tool in line-of-sight (LOS) imaging, describing how light interacts with the scene and enabling applications such as relighting or separation of illumination components.We introduce a framework to estimate the LTM of non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, coupling recent virtual for-ward light propagation models for NLOS imaging with theLOS light transport equation. We design computational projector-camera setups, and use these virtual imaging sys-tems to estimate the transport matrix of hidden scenes. We introduce the speciﬁc illumination functions to compute the different elements of the matrix, overcoming the challeng-ing wide-aperture conditions of NLOS setups. Our NLOS light transport matrix allows us to (re)illuminate speciﬁc locations of a hidden scene, and separate direct, ﬁrst-order indirect, and higher-order indirect illumination of complex cluttered hidden scenes, similar to existing LOS techniques.
