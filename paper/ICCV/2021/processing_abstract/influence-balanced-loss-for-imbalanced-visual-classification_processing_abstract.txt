In this paper, we propose a balancing training method to address problems in imbalanced data learning. To this end, we derive a new loss used in the balancing training phase that alleviates the influence of samples that cause an overfitted decision boundary. The proposed loss efficiently improves the performance of any type of imbalance learn-ing methods. In experiments on multiple benchmark data sets, we demonstrate the validity of our method and re-veal that the proposed loss outperforms the state-of-the-art cost-sensitive loss methods. Furthermore, since our loss is not restricted to a specific task, model, or training method, it can be easily used in combination with other recent re-sampling, meta-learning, and cost-sensitive learning meth-ods for class-imbalance problems. Our code is made avail-able at https://github.com/pseulki/IB-Loss.
