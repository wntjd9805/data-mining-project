In this paper, we address the issue of inefficiency in contemporary convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for video processing tasks. While most CNNs are trained on images and process video frame-by-frame, they do not take advantage of the temporal and spatial redundancies present in videos. This lack of exploitation of redundancies leads to the same operations being applied on every pixel and every frame, without considering the potential for computational savings.To address this problem, we propose a method that combines temporal feature propagation with sparse convolutions. Our approach involves a lightweight policy network that selects important image regions, while a task network performs sparse convolutions on these selected regions only. Features from non-important regions are simply copied from the previous execution, resulting in significant computational savings during inference.The policy network is trained using reinforcement learning in an online fashion. The output of the large task network serves as a supervisory signal to train the online policy, eliminating the need for labeled data and allowing fine-tuning of the policy to the specific task and dataset at deployment time. Additionally, models with different computational costs can be obtained by adjusting the policy's computational target parameter.Our main contributions include the proposed BlockCopy framework, which implements block-sparse convolutions and temporal feature propagation for efficient video processing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on pedestrian detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation tasks, showing significant acceleration without major compromises in accuracy. We also compare our method with existing techniques and baselines, showcasing improvements in the accuracy-speed trade-off.The code for our method is available online. Overall, our work contributes to improving the efficiency and inference speed of CNNs for dense prediction tasks in video processing, by leveraging temporal information and exploiting redundancies in the data.
