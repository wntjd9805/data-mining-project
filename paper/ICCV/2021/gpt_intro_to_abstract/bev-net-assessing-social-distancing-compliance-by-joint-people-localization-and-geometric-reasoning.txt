Social distancing has been proven effective in limiting the spread of contagious pathogens, but manual monitoring of compliance is impractical and non-scalable. This has led to the interest in automatic methods for detecting and counting social distancing violations. Computer vision provides a promising solution, as it can leverage existing surveillance cameras and ensure privacy by anonymizing visual data. In this paper, we propose a novel benchmark dataset for social distancing compliance assessment (SDCA) and introduce a multi-branch convolutional network called BEV-Net that combines heatmap prediction and geometric reasoning. We also demonstrate several potential applications of the SDCA framework in the public health domain. Our contributions include the introduction of computer vision for SDCA, the CityUHK-X-BEV dataset with bird's eye view annotations, the BEV-Net architecture, and promising results in various applications.
