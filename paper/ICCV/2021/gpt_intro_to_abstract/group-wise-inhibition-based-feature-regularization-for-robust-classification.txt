Recent advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have greatly improved computer vision tasks. However, CNNs are still vulnerable to image variations such as corruptions and adversarial samples. Researchers are investigating different approaches to enhance the network's robustness against these variations.Adversarial training is a common technique to improve CNN robustness, where adversarial samples are included in the training data. However, adversarial training may negatively impact generalization performance, creating a trade-off between classification accuracy and adversarial robustness.To address this trade-off and improve robustness and generalization simultaneously, data augmentation and regularization methods are employed. These methods aim to augment the training data and promote diversity in learned features. For example, Random Erasing, Augmix, and Cutout are commonly used.In this paper, we propose a group-wise inhibition based regularization method to explore auxiliary features and enhance feature diversity. We process feature maps with different activation distribution separately to learn richer discriminative features hierarchically. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the error rate of adversarial training and outperforms existing regularization methods in terms of classification accuracy.In summary, our proposed method explores auxiliary features, promotes feature diversity, and achieves competitive performances in terms of adversarial robustness and generalization when compared to related variants and the state of the art.
