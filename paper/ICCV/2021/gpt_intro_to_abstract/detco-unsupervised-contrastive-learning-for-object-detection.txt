Self-supervised learning of visual representation is a critical problem in computer vision, as it enables models to be pre-trained on unlabeled data and subsequently used for various downstream tasks. Contrastive learning, which aims to minimize the distance between views from the same image and maximize the distance between views from different images, has emerged as a promising approach in this field. While previous methods have made significant progress in image classification, they often struggle to achieve satisfactory results in object detection. In this paper, we propose a contrastive learning framework called DetCo, which specifically addresses the challenge of reconciling instance-level detection and image classification. DetCo incorporates multi-level supervision and contrastive learning between global images and local patches to optimize features from different stages of the backbone network. This approach ensures that the features are discriminative at each level of the feature pyramid and consistent between global and local representations. Our experiments demonstrate that DetCo outperforms existing self-supervised methods in both object detection and image classification tasks. Moreover, DetCo achieves state-of-the-art performance in various 2D and 3D instance-level detection tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, and DensePose. Overall, the contributions of this work include the introduction of DetCo as an effective pretext task for instance-level detection, the improvement of transferability in object detection without sacrificing image classification, and the superior performance of DetCo compared to previous state-of-the-art methods in various detection tasks.
