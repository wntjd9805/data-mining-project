Predicting the future trajectories of human or robotic agents is crucial for various intelligent systems. Specifically, forecasting pedestrian motion in crowded scenes has gained significant attention due to its relevance in self-driving vehicles, service robots, and surveillance systems. Previous research on modeling pedestrian walking trajectories has advanced from simple physical motion models to more sophisticated approaches that consider social compliance, environmental awareness, and end-goal policies. Recent efforts have shown improved performance by incorporating goal positions along with historically observed trajectories, especially for long-term predictions. However, existing methods either require pre-defined goal positions or rely on trainable models to infer goals from input data, which introduces additional complexity and potential inaccuracies. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that automatically explores potential goal positions from a repository of expert trajectories using a goal-retrieval algorithm. We then develop a trajectory predictor that leverages the observed trajectory history and the retrieved goals to generate diverse and accurate future trajectories. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous methods on benchmark datasets without involving any additional learning components for goal inference.
