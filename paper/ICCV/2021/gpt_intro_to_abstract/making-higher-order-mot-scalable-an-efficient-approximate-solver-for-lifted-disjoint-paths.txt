This paper introduces the problem of multiple object tracking (MOT) in computer vision and highlights its importance in various applications, such as video surveillance and autonomous driving. The paper discusses the challenges faced in MOT, particularly in long and crowded video sequences. The dominant approach for MOT, tracking-by-detection, is explained, along with the limitations of data association in this paradigm. The paper then proposes a solution using the lifted disjoint paths (LDP) model, which incorporates global context and improves the performance of data association. However, the integration of global context makes the problem NP-hard, leading to computational challenges. To address this, the paper presents the first approximate solver for LDP, which scales well for large instances and provides certificates of the solution quality. The solver is based on Lagrangean decomposition and uses minimum cost flow problems with edge costs from both base and lifted edges. The performance of the solver is validated on standard MOT benchmarks, and it achieves comparable or better results compared to existing trackers. The paper also emphasizes the scalability of the proposed MOT system, which uses lightweight features and a fast solver to handle challenging sequences. The contributions of this work include the development of an approximate solver for LDP and the creation of a scalable MOT system that incorporates higher order consistencies. The LDP solver and MOT pipeline are made available by the authors.
