Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks. However, these models often suffer from overfitting and experience a drop in performance when applied to data from different sources due to domain gaps. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been a popular approach to address this issue by leveraging unlabeled target data. Most existing UDA methods involve supervised losses on source data and unsupervised losses on target data. However, these methods often face severe overfitting as the supervised losses in UDA introduce an additional domain gap and the unsupervised losses are noisy due to the lack of annotations.In this paper, we propose a robust domain adaptation technique that introduces a novel method called Fourier adversarial attacking (FAA) to mitigate overfitting in unsupervised domain adaptation. FAA generates adversarial samples by perturbing only the frequency components that capture little semantic information. This allows for large perturbations in the generated samples without significantly modifying the image semantics, which is critical for unsupervised domain adaptation with clear domain gaps. By incorporating FAA-generated adversarial samples in training, the networks can avoid overfitting and achieve more robust domain adaptation.The contributions of this work are threefold. First, we identify the overfitting issue in unsupervised domain adaptation and propose adversarial attacking as a solution to prevent over-minimization of training objectives. Second, we introduce FAA, a novel Fourier Adversarial Attacking technique, to generate adversarial samples that mitigate overfitting in domain adaptation. FAA is generic and effective for both supervised source loss and unsupervised target losses. Third, we conduct extensive experiments on multiple computer vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection, and image classification, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating overfitting and improving domain adaptation consistently.
