Architecture is a significant application area of 3D vision, with research focused on autonomous perception of buildings and digital map development. Computer-aided building analysis is also essential for advancements in AR/VR. However, the structural and stylistic complexity of buildings poses challenges for standard shape analysis pipelines. Additionally, there is a lack of large-scale, consistently-annotated, public datasets of 3D building models. To address this, we present BuildingNet, the first publicly available dataset of annotated 3D building models, including benchmarking for mesh and point cloud labeling. We also introduce a graph neural network (GNN) that utilizes spatial and structural relations to label building meshes, outperforming prior methods. Our contributions include the dataset, the GNN, and an annotation interface and crowdsourcing pipeline for collecting labeled parts of 3D meshes.
