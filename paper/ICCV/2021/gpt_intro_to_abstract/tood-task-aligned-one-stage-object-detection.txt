Object detection is a critical task in computer vision that involves localizing and recognizing objects of interest in images. It is typically approached as a multi-task learning problem, where object classification and localization are jointly optimized. The classification task focuses on learning discriminative features that highlight key parts of an object, while the localization task aims to precisely locate the entire object within its boundaries.Existing one-stage object detectors have made significant progress by predicting consistent outputs for both classification and localization tasks. These methods often rely on heuristics that prioritize the center of an object as the focal point for accurate predictions. However, these approaches have limitations regarding the independence of classification and localization and may suffer from an inconsistent prediction when performing the tasks independently.To address these limitations, we propose Task-aligned One-stage Object Detection (TOOD), which aims to align the two tasks more accurately. We introduce a new head structure called Task-aligned head (T-head) that enhances the interaction between classification and localization. T-head computes task-interactive features and makes predictions using a novel Task-Aligned Predictor (TAP). Additionally, we propose Task Alignment Learning (TAL) to explicitly align the optimal anchors for the two tasks. TAL includes a sample assignment scheme and a task-aligned loss that gradually unifies the best anchors for predicting both classification and localization during training.Our proposed T-head and TAL approach improve the quality of predictions in both classification and localization tasks by enhancing their interaction and alignment. We conducted extensive experiments on the MSCOCO dataset, where our TOOD achieved superior performance compared to recent one-stage detectors. Qualitative results further validate the effectiveness of our task-alignment approaches.Overall, our contributions include the design of a new T-head structure for enhancing interaction and alignment between classification and localization tasks, the introduction of TAL to explicitly align the tasks at identified task-aligned anchors, and the achievement of improved performance in object detection tasks through TOOD.
