The restoration of corrupted real-world images is a challenging problem in computer vision, as the types and severity of degradation are often unknown. Previous works in blind image super-resolution and blind deblurring have attempted to address this problem by learning to predict the unknown degradation kernel and use it to restore clean images. However, a more recent approach called controllable image restoration (CIR) has gained attention as an alternative approach. CIR allows users to control the output restoration and generate multiple images, choosing the one that best fits their preferences. Early works on CIR mainly focused on a single type of degradation and modulating restoration levels. However, a more recent framework called CResMD proposed a method that learns multiple types of degradation jointly, allowing users to adjust not only the level but also the type of degradation. While this increased flexibility improved control, it also introduced new challenges such as high computational costs and difficulty in determining the true types and levels of degradation. To address these limitations, we present TASNet, a deep-learning-based CIR model optimized for improved visual quality and reduced computational complexity. TASNet consists of two parts: task-agnostic layers and task-specific layers, where the former is shared across all restoration tasks to improve efficiency. We propose a novel supernetwork-based neural architecture search (NAS) algorithm that automatically searches for the optimal architecture, balancing efficiency and performance. Our algorithm allows for channel-level selection and layer-wise decision-making, resulting in a diverse set of architectures. We also formulate a differentiable learning objective for efficient end-to-end training and propose a new data sampling strategy to reduce visual artifacts. Experimental results show that TASNet outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of computational costs and visual quality. Overall, our contributions include the introduction of TASNet as an efficient and high-quality CIR model, the development of a supernetwork-based NAS algorithm, the introduction of a new data sampling strategy, and the improvement of visual quality and computation costs in CIR.
