The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the significance of image cropping in various computer vision applications such as feature invariance, data augmentation, computational photography, and predictive models. It also highlights the impact of image cropping on photographs, including altering the message of the image and its role in media disinformation. The paper aims to understand the traces left behind by image cropping and determine when and how a photo has been cropped. The authors discuss the traces left by physical aberrations in camera optics and sensors, as well as compositional principles violated during cropping. They propose training a convolutional neural network to predict the spatial location of a patch within an image to detect traces of cropping and recover the original crop position. The paper suggests that analyzing the fundamental traces of image cropping can question assumptions about translational invariance and data augmentation, while also potentially impacting practical applications such as soft tampering detection and mitigating shortcut learning.
