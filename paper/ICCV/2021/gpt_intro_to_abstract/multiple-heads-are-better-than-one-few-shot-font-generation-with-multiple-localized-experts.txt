Few-shot font generation (FFG) is a task that aims to generate a new font library using only a few reference glyphs, without additional model fine-tuning. This task is especially desirable when designing font libraries for glyph-rich scripts such as Chinese, Korean, and Thai. The traditional font design process is labor-intensive and time-consuming due to the complex characteristics of the font domain. FFG can also be used to extend an existing font design to different language systems. A high-quality font design should maintain the detailed structure of the target character and have diverse local styles. Existing methods formulate FFG by disentangling the content information and the style information from the given glyphs. However, these methods are insufficient in capturing diverse local styles and preserving the global structures of unseen language systems. In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot font generation method called MX-Font, which captures multiple local styles without being limited to a specific language system. MX-Font utilizes multiple localized experts, each specialized for different local sub-concepts from the given complex glyph image. Unlike component-conditioned methods, our experts are not explicitly mapped to specific components, but they implicitly learn different local concepts through weak supervision. We also employ optimization objectives such as the independence loss and the content-style adversarial loss to enforce content-style disentanglement by each localized expert. MX-Font outperforms state-of-the-art FFG methods in both in-domain transfer and zero-shot cross-lingual transfer scenarios. The proposed modules and optimization objectives in MX-Font are crucial in capturing multiple diverse local concepts.
