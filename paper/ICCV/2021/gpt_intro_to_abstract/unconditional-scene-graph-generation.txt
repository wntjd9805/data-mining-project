This paper explores the task of unconditional semantic scene graph generation using a specialized model called SceneGraphGen. The model adopts a graph auto-regressive structure to process the scene graph structure, generating categorical nodes and edges. The quality of the generated scene graphs is evaluated using a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metric, adapted with random-walk graph and node kernels. The model is applied to image generation, anomaly detection, and scene graph completion tasks. Evaluation on Visual Genome dataset shows that the model can generate semantically plausible scene graphs, which can be translated to images using graph-to-image models. The model is also capable of detecting unusual scene graphs and completing incomplete ones.
