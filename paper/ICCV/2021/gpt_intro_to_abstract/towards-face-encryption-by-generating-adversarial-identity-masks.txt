The development of social media and network platforms has led to the widespread sharing of personal data, including photos. While deep neural networks have improved the capabilities of face recognition systems, they also increase the risk of privacy leakage. Unauthorized third parties can easily identify shared photos on social media without permission, potentially leading to privacy breaches. It is crucial to provide users with effective tools to protect their private information without compromising their user experience. Previous techniques for face encryption, such as blurring or pixelation, have limitations in terms of visual quality and effectiveness. Adversarial examples, which involve overlaying perturbations on original images, have shown promise in evading face recognition systems. However, existing methods still sacrifice visual quality and are not practical for real-world scenarios. This paper presents a targeted identity-protection iterative method (TIP-IM) for face encryption against black-box face recognition systems. TIP-IM generates imperceptible and transferable adversarial identity masks to deceive face recognition systems, while ensuring the protected images remain visually natural. Experimental results show that TIP-IM achieves high protection success rates against white-box face systems and outperforms previous methods. The proposed method also demonstrates effectiveness in real-world experiments using a commercial API service. The contributions of this paper include valuable considerations for privacy protection, the development of TIP-IM, and its effectiveness in various scenarios.
