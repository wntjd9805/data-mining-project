In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown promising results in practical scenarios such as image classification, segmentation, and detection. However, these DNN models often suffer from performance degradation when tested on data that is different from the training data, a phenomenon known as domain shift. To address this challenge, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has gained attention and achieved encouraging results using deep learning techniques.Conventional UDA assumes that cross-domain data is available during model training, allowing for effective measurement and elimination of domain discrepancy. There are two main paradigms in UDA: one focuses on transforming the source and target data to achieve alignment in the high-level feature space, while the other utilizes adversarial frameworks to deceive domain discriminators. However, these methods heavily rely on the co-existence of source and target data, which may not always be feasible due to privacy concerns and memory constraints.To overcome these limitations, a new research direction called Source-free Domain Adaptation has emerged, where only a well-trained source model is provided instead of annotated source data. Several methods have explored this scenario, adjusting target features to adapt the source classifier. However, these methods with frozen classifiers struggle when the data in the source domain is imbalanced or insufficient.In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Adversarial Network (A2Net) to address Source-Free Domain Adaptation. A2Net introduces a flexible target classifier and employs dual-classifier design to achieve adversarial domain-level alignment and contrastive category-wise matching. By gradually eliminating differences across source-similar and source-dissimilar sets, A2Net updates the target classifier to mitigate the limitations of the frozen source classifier. Additionally, A2Net learns discriminative features through self-supervised learning, considering the association of paired target samples and enforcing category-wise alignment.The main contributions of our work are three-fold: the integration of a flexible classifier, the learning of robust and discriminative features through self-supervised learning, and the enhancement of the model using self-supervised rotation. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of A2Net in source-free scenarios.
