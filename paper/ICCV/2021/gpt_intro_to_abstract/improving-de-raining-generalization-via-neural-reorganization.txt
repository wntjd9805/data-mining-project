In recent years, deep learning models have made significant advancements in the field of single image de-raining, which aims to remove rain from images. These models have shown promising results on synthetic rainy datasets, but they often fail when applied to real-world scenes with different types of rain streaks. This limitation has led to the need for a general version image de-raining network (GID) that can handle various types of rain with a single set of parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Neural Reorganization (NR) to address the generalization issue in image de-raining. Inspired by the brain's synaptic consolidation mechanism and knowledge distillation, NR enables the deep network to be trained on multiple synthetic rainy datasets while overcoming catastrophic forgetting. By accumulating de-raining knowledge from correlated data, the final trained network achieves improved generalization ability on both synthetic and real-world rainy scenes. Our contributions include the introduction of a brain-inspired mechanism to enhance image de-raining generalization, the development of the Neural Reorganization algorithm, which facilitates knowledge accumulation without forgetting, and the demonstration of state-of-the-art results on real-world rainy scenes using a single network trained with our proposed scheme. We believe that our approach can provide a new perspective for improving generalization ability in other low-level vision tasks as well.
