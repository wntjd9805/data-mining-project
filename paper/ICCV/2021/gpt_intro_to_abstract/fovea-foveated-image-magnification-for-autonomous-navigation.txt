This paper addresses the challenge of handling high-resolution sensory data in safety-critical robotic agents such as self-driving cars. While current approaches rely on subsampling to meet latency constraints, this leads to information loss. To overcome this, the authors propose FOVEAted image magnification (FOVEA), inspired by the human visual system's foveal vision. FOVEA retains high resolution for objects of interest while maintaining a smaller canvas size by resampling and warping the input images. The authors introduce differentiable backward maps to handle bounding box outputs in the warped space and use dataset-wide priors and object locations to identify regions for magnification. They also address the cropping issue with an anti-cropping modification to the warping formulation. Experimental results on self-driving datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach in improving object detection accuracy, especially for small objects. Additionally, the authors evaluate their algorithm under a streaming perception framework and achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of streaming average precision.
