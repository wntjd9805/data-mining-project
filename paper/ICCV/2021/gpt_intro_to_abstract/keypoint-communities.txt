The introduction highlights the challenge posed by recent large-scale datasets that include fine-grained annotations of complex poses. Traditional pose estimation methods are limited to detecting coarse person bounding boxes and a small set of keypoints, but these new datasets include over 100 extra fine-grained keypoints in areas such as the face, hands, and feet. Resolving these fine details is essential for building robust representations of humans for tasks such as action recognition and intent prediction. However, training current pose estimation algorithms on poses with mixed coarse and fine keypoints is challenging because these algorithms assume a uniform importance of all keypoints in a pose. To address this challenge, the authors propose a principled keypoint weighting method that takes into account the difference in importance between coarse and fine-grained keypoints. The proposed method aims to achieve state-of-the-art results for both whole body human pose estimation and complex car poses, running at high frame rates. The authors compare their method with existing approaches, such as the Zoom-Net method proposed by Jin et al., and demonstrate its generalizability to different pose types. The authors also discuss the importance of considering the connectivity between keypoints in order to avoid biasing the neural network optimization towards specific regions. In this paper, the authors present their contributions, which include a method to weigh the importance of keypoints and their connections in complex poses, an efficient implementation for fine-grained human poses, and the generalization of their approach to fine-grained car poses. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method by achieving state-of-the-art results on challenging datasets such as COCO WholeBody and ApolloCar3D. The software implementation of their method is open source and publicly available.
