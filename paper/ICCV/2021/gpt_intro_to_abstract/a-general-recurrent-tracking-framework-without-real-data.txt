Multi-object tracking (MOT) plays a crucial role in applications such as surveillance, cell analysis, and autonomous driving. The tracking-by-detection paradigm, which involves detecting object locations and linking detections across time, has become the preferred approach. However, the current scoring mechanisms used in data association for MOT only consider appearance features, leading to limited tracking accuracy. This is due to frequent occlusions, pose variations, and the lack of temporal information. Existing neural network-based scoring methods suffer from the lack of available data and the need for retraining for new datasets or features.To address these issues, this paper presents a general tracking framework that introduces three types of basic nodes for data association. Additionally, a Recurrent Tracking Unit (RTU) is proposed to score tracks by utilizing multiple long-term cues. RTU is designed to be easily integrated into other trackers, improving their performance. Furthermore, the paper explores the use of simulated tracking data, generated based on the analysis of real data distributions, to train RTU and overcome the lack of real data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on MOT benchmarks and that the RTU trained on simulated data significantly improves other trackers.The contributions of this paper include the construction of a general Multiple Nodes Tracking framework that can be adapted to various scenarios and extended to most trackers. The RTU addresses the scoring problem of tracks by integrating multiple cues in a simple yet efficient manner, and it can be seamlessly integrated into other trackers for performance enhancement. Additionally, a method for generating simulated tracking data is presented, which allows for the fusion of various cues in the training process, replacing the need for real data.
