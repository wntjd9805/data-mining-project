Feature correspondence plays a crucial role in various computer vision tasks. Traditionally, feature correspondence involved matching features between two sets by considering pairwise relations. Recent advancements have highlighted the importance of incorporating higher-order structural information. This can be achieved by building hypergraphs, where hyperedges capture relationships among multiple nodes. Hypergraph matching aims to find the node correspondence between two given hypergraphs by considering the affinities of their corresponding nodes and hyperedges. However, existing hypergraph matching algorithms suffer from limitations such as hand-crafted affinities and task-agnostic combinatorial solvers. In this paper, we present the first unified hypergraph neural network (HNN) solution for hypergraph matching. Our proposed HNN-HM approach builds an association hypergraph and converts the matching problem into a node selection problem on this hypergraph. It utilizes a novel hypergraph neural network comprised of multiple blocks to solve the node selection/classification problem by updating the attributes of hyperedges and nodes. The proposed method is end-to-end trainable and outperforms seven state-of-the-art hypergraph matching algorithms on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its superiority. Our contributions include the introduction of HNN for hypergraph matching, addressing the node classification problem, and achieving state-of-the-art results. The source code for our work is made publicly available.
