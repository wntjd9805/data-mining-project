Object re-identification (ReID) is an important task in computer vision, particularly in the domains of person ReID and vehicle ReID. In order to accurately associate objects across different scenes and camera views, extracting robust and discriminative features is crucial. However, traditional CNN-based methods for feature extraction in ReID have limitations in addressing two important issues. Firstly, they mainly focus on small discriminative regions and struggle to capture global structural patterns. Secondly, the downsampling operators used in CNNs reduce spatial resolution, leading to a loss of fine-grained details in the feature maps. Recent advancements in pure transformer models, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) and Data-efficient image Transformers (DeiT), have shown promising results in image recognition tasks. These transformer-based models leverage multi-head self-attention and remove downsampling operators, allowing them to capture long-range dependencies and preserve detailed information. Building upon these advantages, the authors propose a new object ReID framework called TransReID. TransReID adaptively incorporates pure transformers into object ReID, addressing the unique challenges posed by variations in images. To enhance feature robustness and capture global context, the authors introduce a jigsaw patches module (JPM) that rearranges and groups patch embeddings. Additionally, a side information embedding (SIE) mechanism is introduced to incorporate non-visual clues, such as camera and viewpoint information, in a unified framework. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for both person and vehicle ReID, including MSMT17, Market-1501, DukeMTMC-reID, Occluded-Duke, VeRi-776, and VehicleID. The contributions of this work include the establishment of a strong baseline using pure transformers, the introduction of the JPM for perturbation-invariant and robust feature representation, and the use of SIE to mitigate feature bias caused by non-visual factors. This research is the first of its kind to investigate the application of pure transformers in object ReID.
