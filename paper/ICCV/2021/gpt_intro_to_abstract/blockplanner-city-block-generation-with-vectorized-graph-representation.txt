The demand for city modeling has increased in various fields such as urban planning, autonomous driving simulation, and game design. City blocks are the fundamental component of urban areas and provide the structure and order to a city. However, existing procedural modeling methods for city blocks often fail to capture realistic and dynamic structures. This paper proposes a framework called BlockPlanner that aims to learn city block generation from urban planning data. The paper discusses the limitations of existing solutions for indoor floorplan generation in adapting to city block generation. The paper also introduces the concept of representing city blocks in a vectorized manner using a unified ring topology and two-tier graphs. The proposed model, based on a variational autoencoder (VAE) scheme, provides a lightweight approach to generating diverse city blocks with valid structural details. The paper presents the NYC-Block Dataset, a new dataset collected from public government resources to facilitate city block generation research. Experimental results demonstrate BlockPlanner's capability to generate realistic city blocks with reasonable land use compositions, and its potential applications in city footprint generation and indoor scene layout generation. The contributions of this work include the BlockPlanner system, the vectorized two-tier graph representation, the lightweight graph VAE model, and the set of losses for geometric reasoning. The paper also highlights the efficiency and generalizability of the proposed approach, which lays a foundation for large-scale city modeling with high fidelity in geometry and functional semantics.
