In recent years, 3D object detection has become crucial in autonomous driving. While LiDAR/stereo-based methods have been effective, monocular 3D object detection remains challenging due to the lack of depth cues. Existing methods often use a perspective projection model to estimate depth by first estimating 2D and 3D bounding box heights. However, errors in height estimation can greatly affect depth inference, leading to unreliable outputs. To address this issue, we propose a Geometry Uncertainty Projection Network that includes a Geometry Uncertainty Projection (GUP) module and a Hierarchical Task Learning (HTL) strategy. The GUP module infers depth based on a distribution form, taking into account the statistical characteristics of the estimated 3D height distribution. This improves the reliability of depth inference by providing a well-learned uncertainty to indicate the depth estimation quality. The HTL strategy ensures stability in model training by training each task only when all pre-tasks are trained well. Evaluation on the KITTI dataset demonstrates that our proposed GUP Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in car and pedestrian 3D detection. Overall, our contributions significantly reduce the error amplification effect and improve training efficiency in monocular 3D object detection.
