In this paper, we address the problem of simultaneously detecting four types of edges in computer vision tasks: reï¬‚ectance edge (RE), illumination edge (IE), normal edge (NE), and depth edge (DE). These edge types have different physical bases and play crucial roles in various applications such as pavement crack detection, shadow removal, and depth estimation. Despite their importance, fine-grained edge detection is relatively unexplored compared to generic edge detection. To fill this gap, we propose RINDNet, a CNN-based solution that integrates the detection of these four types of edges. RINDNet works in three stages, extracting features and spatial cues, decoding specific edge types, and generating the final predictions using attention modules. We also create a new dataset, BSDS-RIND, to evaluate edge detectors for all four types of edges. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RINDNet over existing edge detectors. Our contributions include the development of RINDNet, the creation of BSDS-RIND dataset, and the advancement of research in edge detection for various computer vision applications.
