The popularity of stereoscopic 3D visual content has increased with recent hardware developments, allowing for viewing in various environments. However, the depth dimension of stereo images often leads to unsatisfactory viewing experiences. Stereo images with a large disparity range can exceed the comfort zone of the human visual system, while those with a small disparity range result in poor 3D viewing experience. Therefore, it is important to develop disparity remapping tools that can adjust the disparity to meet various viewing conditions and viewer preferences. This paper proposes a novel warping-based method for disparity remapping that adjusts disparity while preserving the 2D shape and 3D structure of important objects. By explicitly considering the 3D structure information, the method formulates disparity remapping as a constrained optimization problem. Additionally, a two-stage warping approach is employed to meet multiple requirements of disparity remapping simultaneously. The proposed method outperforms existing methods by preserving the 3D structure and generating better warping results. The contributions of this work include a new energy function to preserve 3D structures, a decomposition of disparity remapping into a two-stage optimization problem, the use of vertex-based warping to refine results, and the ability to incorporate additional requirements for future stereo visual editing tasks.
