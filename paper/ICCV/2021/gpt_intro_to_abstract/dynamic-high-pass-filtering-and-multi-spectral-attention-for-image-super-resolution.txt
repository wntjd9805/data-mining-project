Image super-resolution (SR) is a challenging task in computer vision that aims to estimate a high-resolution (HR) image from its low-resolution (LR) counterpart. Deep learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) methods have shown promising results in various research domains. However, these methods still suffer from a major flaw, as they exhibit a bias towards low-frequency signals, resulting in overly smooth reconstructions. This is due to aspects of training, such as the loss function, architecture type, and optimization method. Additionally, higher frequencies struggle to propagate through the network, limiting the learning of additional information. To address these issues, recent works propose the use of attention mechanisms to re-weight channels. However, existing channel attention mechanisms have limitations, such as discarding all frequencies except the lowest one. This paper aims to overcome these limitations by proposing a new CNN-based SR method that effectively preserves high-frequency details while maintaining computational efficiency.
