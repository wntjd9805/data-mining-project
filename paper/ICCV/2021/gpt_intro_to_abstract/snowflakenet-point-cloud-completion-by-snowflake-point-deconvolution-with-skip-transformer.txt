Sparse and incomplete point clouds captured by 3D scanners and depth cameras are common in computer vision applications. Point cloud completion, which aims to predict a complete shape from partial observations, is crucial for various downstream tasks. Deep learning based methods have gained attention for point cloud completion, but they often struggle with preserving a well-arranged structure for points in local patches and capturing local geometric details and structural characteristics. In this paper, we propose SnowflakeNet, a novel network that focuses on the decoding process to complete partial point clouds. SnowflakeNet utilizes Snowflake Point Deconvolution (SPD) layers to model the generation of complete point clouds, simulating the growth process of snowflakes in 3D space. Each SPD layer splits parent points into child points, inheriting shape characteristics from the parent. We introduce a skip-transformer in SPD to learn point splitting patterns that fit local regions best, improving the spatial relationship modeling across different levels of decoding. The skip-transformer leverages an attention mechanism to summarize splitting patterns used in previous SPD layers, refining the location and structure of points. Experimental results demonstrate that SnowflakeNet achieves state-of-the-art completion accuracy on benchmark datasets. Our contributions include proposing SnowflakeNet for explicit and locally structured complete point cloud generation, introducing SPD for progressive point generation, and introducing the skip-transformer for spatial relationship modeling and structure refinement.
