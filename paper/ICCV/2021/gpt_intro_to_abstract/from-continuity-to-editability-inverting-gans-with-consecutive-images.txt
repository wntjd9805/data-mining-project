Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown great potential in image editing by discovering interpretable directions that can manipulate image attributes. However, existing methods for inverting an image to its latent code often struggle to balance faithful reconstruction and editability. In this paper, we propose a solution that utilizes consecutive images to guide the inversion process. By optimizing multiple latent codes and enforcing semantic accessibility between them, we ensure editability. Additionally, we exploit sequential continuity to improve reconstruction fidelity by enforcing consistency across consecutive images. We evaluate our method on real and synthesized datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of editability, reconstruction fidelity, and various applications such as video-based GAN inversion and unsupervised semantic transfer. Our contributions include an alternative GAN inversion method for consecutive images, novel constraints for editability and reconstruction fidelity, and optimal performance in various applications.
