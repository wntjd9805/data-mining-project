Hyperspectral imaging is a powerful technique that can provide detailed spectral information for various applications. However, the acquisition process of hyperspectral images often introduces various noises, which negatively affect both the visual appearance and the performance of downstream applications. Model-based denoising methods have been widely used to remove imaging noise, but they are time-consuming and rely on hand-crafted priors that may not accurately represent real-world data. Learning-based methods, on the other hand, automatically learn the mapping from noisy hyperspectral images to clean ones using convolutional neural networks. However, existing learning-based methods lack realistic hyperspectral data for training and evaluation. This paper focuses on capturing realistic data for learning hyperspectral image denoising networks. Two approaches are explored: capturing paired real data or generating realistic synthetic data. A real dataset of noisy and clean hyperspectral images is collected, and an accurate noise model is proposed to synthesize realistic noisy hyperspectral data. The generated synthetic dataset is then used to train a convolutional neural network for hyperspectral image denoising. Experimental results demonstrate that the network trained with synthetic data performs as well as that trained with real data. The contributions of this paper include the collection of the first publicly released real dataset, the formulation of a noise model for synthesizing realistic noisy hyperspectral data, and a noise parameter estimation approach for calibrating the noise parameter of hyperspectral cameras.
