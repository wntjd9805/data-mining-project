Shadow removal from a single image is a challenging problem in computer vision with various applications. Existing physics-based methods based on entropy minimization struggle to handle achromatic surfaces and soft shadow images. Deep learning methods have shown more robustness, but they often require paired shadow and non-shadow images for training, which can be costly to collect. Recently proposed unsupervised methods, such as Mask-ShadowGAN, rely on adversarial training but suffer from incorrect outputs due to the absence of ground truth and the use of binary masks for shadow representation. In this paper, we propose DC-ShadowNet, an unsupervised network guided by a shadow/shadow-free domain classifier, to remove both hard and soft shadows from a single image. We introduce novel unsupervised losses based on physics-based shadow-free chromaticity, shadow-robust perceptual features, and boundary smoothness to improve shadow removal results. Our method outperforms existing methods and is the first unsupervised approach to handle both hard and soft shadows robustly. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can be further improved through test-time training. Overall, the contributions of this paper include the introduction of DC-ShadowNet, novel unsupervised losses, and robust shadow removal for both hard and soft shadows in a single image.
