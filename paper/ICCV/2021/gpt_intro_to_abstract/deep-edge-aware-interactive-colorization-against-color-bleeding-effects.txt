In recent years, deep image colorization methods have made significant advancements in generating realistic colorized images. However, existing approaches often struggle to reliably enhance edges in desired regions without significant user input. In this paper, we propose an interactive framework that guarantees reliable edge enhancement through user interactions. Our approach minimizes user effort by utilizing a simple add-on edge-enhancing network that takes both scribbles and an intermediate activation map of the colorization network as inputs. This network encodes an edge-corrective representation for the activation map, particularly in regions annotated by the scribbles, enhancing the original activation map through residual connections. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, such as ImageNet, COCO-Stuff, and Place205, demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to baselines. We introduce a new evaluation metric to measure the colorization method's adherence to color boundaries and confirm our approach's reasonable time and effort requirements through a user study. Additionally, we explore the applicability of our approach in sketch colorization tasks, validating our method on Yumi's Cells and Dan-booru datasets. Our framework has the potential for practical applications in the field of computer vision.
