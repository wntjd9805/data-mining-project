In this paper, we investigate the impact of spectral leakage in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and explore its effect on image classification performance. Spectral leakage is a well-known artifact in filtering operations, where a filter allows unwanted frequency components to pass through its intended pass-band due to windowing artifacts. We observe that CNNs, due to the use of small kernel sizes, are susceptible to spectral leakage. We propose the use of larger kernels with a standard Hamming window function, which tapers off at the kernel boundaries to alleviate spectral leakage. By employing this principle of good filter design, we demonstrate improvements in classification accuracy on benchmark datasets including Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Additionally, windowed CNNs display increased robustness against certain types of adversarial attacks. Our contributions include exploring the impact of spectral leakage in CNNs, proposing the use of larger kernels with a tapered window function, demonstrating improved classification accuracy, and showing increased robustness against adversarial attacks.
