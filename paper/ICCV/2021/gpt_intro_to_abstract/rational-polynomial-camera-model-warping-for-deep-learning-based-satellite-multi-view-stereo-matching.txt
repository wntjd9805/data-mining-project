Three-dimensional scene reconstruction from multi-view optical images is a popular research topic in the computer vision and remote sensing domains. Currently, there are two commonly used camera models: the perspective camera model and the cubic rational polynomial camera (RPC) model. However, deep learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods have primarily been developed for images captured from pin-hole cameras, ignoring RPC-based images such as satellite images.The study of MVS for satellite images is crucial, as these images are the primary data source for large-scale 3D Earth surface reconstruction. Existing deep learning-based MVS methods have utilized homography warping to align images from different viewpoints to a reference view through fronto-parallel depth planes of the reference camera. In this work, we propose a rigorous RPC warping module, which enables the extension of deep learning-based MVS methods to satellite images. Our proposed SatMVS framework utilizes RPC warping to align multi-view satellite images through hypothetical height planes in the world coordinate system. Additionally, it employs a multi-stage coarse-to-fine matching strategy on a feature pyramid to account for the significant topographic relief of the Earth's surface and the high-capacity of satellite images. The SatMVS framework can also be used with most modern deep learning-based MVS methods by replacing the perspective model with the RPC model and introducing the multi-stage strategy.Moreover, we introduce the TLC SatMVS dataset, an open-source satellite MVS dataset built from images collected by the push-broom three-line camera (TLC) mounted on the Ziyuan-3 satellite. This dataset complements existing single linear-array WorldView-3 datasets and provides three simultaneous images of the same scene rather than capturing stereo pictures from different orbit positions at different times like traditional single-scanline cameras.In summary, this paper aims to address two gaps: the lack of an RPC warping module that hinders the application of state-of-the-art MVS methods to satellite images and the absence of large open-source TLC satellite MVS datasets, which impede the development of satellite MVS and large-scale Earth surface reconstruction.
