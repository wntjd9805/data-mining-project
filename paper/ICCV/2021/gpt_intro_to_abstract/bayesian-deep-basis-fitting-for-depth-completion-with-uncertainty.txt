In safety-critical applications like autonomous driving, it is crucial to have reliable uncertainty estimation alongside accurate predictions. Depth completion, a task relevant to machine perception, can benefit from well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are commonly used for depth prediction due to their expressive power, but they only provide point estimates without understanding the confidence in their outputs. Various probabilistic deep learning methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they often lack calibrated uncertainty or are susceptible to distributional shift. Additionally, these methods can require extensive computational resources. In this paper, we propose a method for depth completion with uncertainty estimation that overcomes these limitations. Our approach builds on the concept of Deep Basis Fitting (DBF), which replaces the last layer of a depth completion network with data-dependent weights computed through differentiable least squares fitting. This effectively models scene structure on a low-dimensional manifold and greatly improves depth completion performance without changes to the rest of the network or training scheme. We extend DBF by incorporating a Bayesian evidence framework, which involves placing a prior distribution on the DBF weights and performing marginalization during inference. This Bayesian treatment allows for depth completion with highly sparse data and offers tractable inference. Our approach, named Bayesian Deep Basis Fitting (BDBF), provides several advantages: 1) It can be easily integrated into existing depth completion networks as a drop-in replacement for the final layer, providing uncertainty estimates in the form of per-pixel variance. 2) Compared to other uncertainty estimation techniques, BDBF produces higher quality uncertainty with only one training session, one saved model, and one forward pass, without requiring additional parameters or modifications to the loss function. 3) It can handle any level of sparsity, gracefully degrading performance as the number of depth measurements decreases.Overall, our proposed method, BDBF, combines deep learning for depth completion with reliable uncertainty estimation, offering a more robust approach for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving.
