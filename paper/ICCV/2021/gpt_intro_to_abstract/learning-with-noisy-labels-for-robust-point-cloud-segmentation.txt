Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown great success in 3D point cloud segmentation. However, the high learning capacity of DNNs can also lead to performance degradation if there are incorrect annotations. Obtaining clean 3D data labels is more challenging than 2D image annotations due to the massive number of points to annotate and the complexity of the annotating process. Previous research on learning with noisy labels has mainly focused on image classification, and no study exists for point cloud segmentation. Existing methods designed for image recognition cannot be directly applied to point cloud segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel point noise-adaptive learning (PNAL) framework that addresses annotation noise in point cloud segmentation. PNAL utilizes a point-level confidence selection mechanism to obtain reliable labels without requiring a known noise rate. It also incorporates a label correction process at the cluster level to fully utilize the local correlation among labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PNAL through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world noisy label datasets. Our contributions include being the first to investigate noisy labels on point cloud data, proposing a noise-rate blind PNAL framework, showing clear improvements in segmentation performance, and providing a re-labeled validation set for ScanNetV2 to facilitate research in point cloud segmentation and noise label learning.
