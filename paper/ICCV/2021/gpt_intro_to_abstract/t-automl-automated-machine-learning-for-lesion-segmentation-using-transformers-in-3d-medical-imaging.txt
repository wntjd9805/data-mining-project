In this paper, we address the challenge of automated lesion segmentation in medical images, which plays a crucial role in disease understanding, clinical diagnosis, and treatment planning. We highlight the limitations of current machine/deep learning models in providing comprehensive solutions for this task. We introduce the use of deep convolutional neural networks, specifically the U-Net architecture, which has proven to be highly effective in medical image segmentation. Furthermore, we explore the concept of automated machine learning (AutoML) and neural architecture search (NAS) in optimizing the design of neural network architectures for medical image analysis. We discuss the shortcomings of existing AutoML methods and propose a new method that automatically estimates all components of a deep learning solution for lesion segmentation in 3D medical images. This includes a new search space for segmentation networks, encoding deep learning configurations into abstract representations, training a binary relation predictor, and generating search configurations based on predicted performance. Our proposed method offers several contributions, including a more flexible search space for lesion segmentation, state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets, computational efficiency, and the application of comprehensive AutoML to medical image segmentation leveraging transformer modules.
