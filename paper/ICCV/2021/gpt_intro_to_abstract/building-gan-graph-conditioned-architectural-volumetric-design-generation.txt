Volumetric design, the initial step in architectural building design, involves creating a 3D representation of the building within a valid design space. This space is typically irregular in shape and constrained by local building codes. The volumetric design not only includes the building's shape, but also generates 2D layouts for each floor. Developing a high-quality volumetric design can be time-consuming and challenging. Therefore, an efficient pipeline for generating such designs can have a significant impact on the architecture and construction industry. In recent years, generating realistic 2D room layouts has been a popular research topic. Existing methods include optimization-based and learning-based approaches. More recently, researchers have explored the integration of program graphs, also known as bubble diagrams, into layout generation tasks using graph neural networks (GNNs). This paper focuses on the graph-conditioned layout generation task and proposes a model that utilizes a graph-conditioned generative adversarial network (GAN) with GNN and a pointer-based cross-modal module. To evaluate the proposed model, a synthetic dataset containing 120,000 volumetric designs based on realistic building requirements is created in collaboration with professional architects. The model is evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively, outperforming existing methods in terms of quality, diversity, and connectivity accuracy. The main contributions of this paper include the introduction of a new 3D representation called voxel graph, the development of a graph-conditioned GAN using GNN and a pointer-based cross-modal module, an automated pipeline for generating valid volumetric designs, and the creation of a synthetic dataset containing 120,000 volumetric designs and their corresponding program graphs. The code, model, and dataset will be made available to the public.
