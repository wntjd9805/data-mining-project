This paper discusses the detection of persuasive atypicality in visually creative images, such as advertisements and public service announcements. Atypicality in images involves metaphorical object transformations or intentionally surprising composed objects, making it challenging for intelligent systems to detect. The authors propose a model that utilizes implicit knowledge of contextual compatibility to detect persuasive atypicality. They also highlight the importance of object interactions and spatial relative positions in detecting atypicality and propose a method to compute attention weights between key-query regions. Additionally, the authors investigate the use of semantic knowledge and fine-tuning BERT on detected class labels to improve detection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of their approaches and provide insights on different types of persuasive atypicality. They also compare their unsupervised approach with supervised models and explore different representations of image context.
