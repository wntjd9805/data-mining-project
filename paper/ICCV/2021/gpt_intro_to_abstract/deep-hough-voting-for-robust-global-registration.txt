Point cloud registration is a critical task in 3D computer vision and has various applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. The objective is to align two partially overlapping point cloud fragments by estimating the rotation and translation parameters. Previous research has focused on geometric feature descriptors, pose optimization algorithms, and learning-based pipelines. However, these approaches have limitations such as the requirement of high overlap ratios, lack of scalability for large-scale point clouds, and reliance on iterative post-processing. In this paper, we propose a robust registration pipeline for large-scale point cloud fragment pairs that addresses these challenges. Our approach views registration as finding a consensus among candidate correspondences in a discretized 6D parameter space using Hough voting. We also introduce a learnable refinement module to improve the representability of our parameter space. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on real-world datasets and demonstrates generalizability in a multi-way registration pipeline. Additionally, our approach is faster compared to other learning-based registration pipelines.
