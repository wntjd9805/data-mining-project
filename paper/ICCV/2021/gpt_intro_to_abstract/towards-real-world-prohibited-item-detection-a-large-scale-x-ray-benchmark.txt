Security inspection is crucial for ensuring safety in various scenarios, such as public transportation and sensitive departments. Inspectors typically rely on manually monitoring X-ray images to detect prohibited items. However, accurately and efficiently locating these items hidden in messy objects is challenging. Recent advancements in deep learning and computer vision have made automatic security inspection possible, enabling the identification of prohibited item locations and categories using computer vision technology. However, most existing object detection algorithms are designed for natural images and are not optimal for X-ray images. Additionally, X-rays have unique characteristics, such as different color absorption by materials and the mixing of object contours and occluders, posing new challenges for appearance modeling in X-ray detection. Previous attempts to construct security inspection benchmarks have failed to meet real-world application requirements, including limited prohibited item categories, insufficient annotations for accurate predictions, and the lack of comprehensive datasets for detecting prohibited items hidden in messy objects. In response to these limitations, we introduce the PIDray dataset, the largest dataset for prohibited item detection in X-ray images to date. This dataset includes a wide range of prohibited items with corresponding annotations, and it specifically focuses on cases where items are deliberately hidden in messy objects. We also propose the selective dense attention network (SDANet) as a strong baseline, which incorporates both spatial and channel-wise attention mechanisms and exploits dependencies among multi-scale features. Experimental results on the PIDray dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods. The contributions of this work include the creation of the PIDray benchmark dataset, the introduction of the SDANet model, and extensive experimental validation of our method's performance.
