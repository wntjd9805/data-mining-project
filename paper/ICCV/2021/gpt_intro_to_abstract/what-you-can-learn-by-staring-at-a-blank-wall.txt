This paper introduces a non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging technique that can infer information about a hidden scene in an unknown room by analyzing a video of a blank wall. The method can classify a person's activity or identify the number of people in the hidden region of the scene without prior calibration or knowledge of the environment. The real-time application of this technique can be valuable for search and rescue operations, law enforcement, emergency response, fall detection for the elderly, and detection of hidden pedestrians for intelligent vehicles. Previous NLOS imaging methods have used both active and passive approaches, but they either required probing devices or relied on known occluders. In contrast, this method leverages the temporal variation of indirect illumination between a person, the room, and potentially a second person. The paper demonstrates automatic classification of the number and activity of moving people using a learning-based approach and a 2D representation of the video. The accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated using convolutional neural networks trained on 20 different scenes, achieving high accuracy in classifying the number of people and recognizing activity. The technique works in real time with minimal latency and does not require scene-specific calibration. The impact of scene properties and human motion on this task is also investigated using a theoretical framework and a synthetic model of the setup.
