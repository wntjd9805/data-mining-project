Single image super-resolution (SISR) has gained considerable attention for reconstructing high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) ones. This paper focuses on the use of deep neural networks (DNNs) for fast and effective SISR. Two common degradation models, bicubic degradation and traditional degradation, are used to map HR images to LR ones. However, existing methods often struggle to produce satisfactory results for real images due to the simplicity of the degradation models. This paper addresses this issue by proposing a more practical degradation model that considers blur, downsampling, and noise. The new model involves adjustable parameters and covers the degradation space of real images. Furthermore, a blind SISR model is trained using synthetic training data generated from the new degradation model. The contributions of this paper include the design of a practical SISR degradation model, the development of a blind SISR model that performs well on real images, and highlighting the importance of accurate degradation modeling for DNNs-based SISR methods. This work is the first to adopt a new hand-designed degradation model for blind image super-resolution.
