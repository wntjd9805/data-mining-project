Deep learning has recently emerged as a dominant approach in computer vision, achieving impressive results in visual recognition tasks. However, most of these approaches are limited to closed set scenarios, where all samples belong to known categories. This poses a problem in dynamic and ever-changing scenarios where samples from unknown categories are encountered. To address this limitation, open set recognition has been introduced, aiming to classify known categories while detecting unknown samples. Previous work has proposed thresholding strategies for rejecting unknowns, but deep neural networks still suffer from accuracy degradation in open set settings. To overcome this, the Extreme Value Theory and deep generative models, such as Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs), have been employed. However, VAEs may not be effective in identifying known categories with only one distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called CVAECapOSR, which combines Capsule Networks (CapsNets) and Conditional VAEs (CVAEs) for open set recognition. CapsNets offer a more efficient encoding of objects through distributed representations, while CVAEs utilize multiple prior distributions for modeling known classes. Our experiments on standard datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CVAECapOSR, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods in several cases.
