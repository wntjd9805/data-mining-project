The marine waste problem, particularly the influx of plastics into the ocean, has become a major concern for researchers and the public due to its severe impact on marine life and ecosystem pollution. While efforts have been made to clean floating wastes in the ocean, it is important to prevent waste from entering the ocean in the first place. Land-based sources are identified as the primary contributors to ocean waste. Thus, cleaning floating waste in inland water areas, such as canals, rivers, lakes, and bays, is crucial in reducing marine waste and water pollution. Traditional methods of manually cleaning floating waste in inland waters are inefficient, costly, and pose potential risks. Therefore, there is a pressing need for efficient autonomous cleaning methods. Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) have gained attention for their potential in environmental applications, particularly in floating waste cleaning. To achieve efficient and reliable autonomous cleaning, a real-time and accurate floating waste detection system is essential. Visual-based detection using computer vision and deep learning techniques is a cost-effective solution. However, detecting small objects, such as bottles and drink cans, in inland waters presents challenges due to their limited appearance information and the complex real-world scenes, including reflections and lighting conditions. Complementing visual-based detection with radar sensors can enhance the adaptability of the autonomous cleaning system. The 77 GHz millimeter wave radar provides robust detection capabilities under various weather and lighting conditions. To support research on floating waste detection, we introduce FloW, the first dataset for floating waste detection from the view of USVs in inland waters. The dataset includes annotated images of floating wastes, video sequences for waste tracking, and synchronized image and radar data for fusion-based detection algorithms. FloW aims to draw attention to the floating waste problem in inland waters and promote the development and comparability of detection algorithms. Our work contributes to the understanding of the challenges in vision-based detection and the potential of radar-based detection for floating waste cleaning.
