Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize samples from unseen classes given very few labeled examples per class. The use of embedding methods has become popular in addressing the FSL problem. However, most existing methods assume a Euclidean structure for all FSL tasks, which may not hold true in real-world scenarios where data often has non-Euclidean structures. In this paper, we propose a curvature generation embedding method that learns a task-aware curved embedding space using hyperbolic geometry. Hyperbolic geometry is known for its ability to represent hierarchies in data and has been shown to outperform Euclidean geometry in some problems. We observe that different FSL tasks may exhibit different geometrical structures, motivating us to learn to identify suitable curvatures for each task. To achieve this, we address two challenges: generating suitable curvatures using few samples and carrying out discriminative classification in the task-aware curved embedding space. We leverage the higher-order statistics of samples to identify curvatures for each class, allowing for a more flexible representation of complex structures in data. We then use the intra-class and inter-class context information in the curved embedding space to produce discriminative class prototypes. Our model is trained in a meta-learning framework and demonstrates effectiveness in both inductive and transductive settings of FSL. Our contributions include proposing a method to realize a task-aware curved embedding space and generating task-specific curvatures to adapt the model to different geometrical structures of data. Additionally, we generate curvatures for each class and use context information to generate class prototypes, leading to discriminative classification even with few samples.
