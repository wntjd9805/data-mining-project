This paper introduces a novel bottom-up framework called HAIS for instance segmentation on 3D point clouds. The framework utilizes hierarchical aggregation to address the challenges of clustering a point cloud into multiple instances, such as over-segmentation and weak point features. An intra-instance prediction network is also designed to generate more accurate instance predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that HAIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet v2 and S3DIS datasets, while maintaining the highest efficiency among existing methods. With its concise single-forward inference pipeline and low latency, HAIS provides a promising solution for real-life applications in robotics, augmented/virtual reality, and autonomous driving.
