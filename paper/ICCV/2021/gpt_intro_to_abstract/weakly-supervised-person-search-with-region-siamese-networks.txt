This paper addresses the problem of person search, which involves localizing and recognizing a specific person from a collection of scene images. While significant progress has been made in recent works, the training process for person search requires strong supervision in terms of bounding boxes and identity labels, which can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain. In this paper, the authors propose a weakly supervised setting for person search, where only bounding box annotations are required. They introduce a baseline model called Region Siamese Networks (R-SiamNets), which learns meaningful feature representations by minimizing the discrepancy between encoded features from the same pedestrian region. They also introduce a cluster-level contrastive learning method to balance separation and clustering. Experimental results show that the proposed R-SiamNet outperforms several supervised methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in large-scale person search. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of a weakly-supervised setting for person search, the development of the R-SiamNet baseline model, and the achievement of high performance on benchmark datasets.
