This abstract introduces the concept of using generative models in computer-aided design (CAD) to create 3D shapes. The paper highlights the limitations of existing 3D generative models and proposes a deep generative network that outputs a sequence of operations used in CAD tools to construct a 3D shape. The proposed method aims to reconcile the irregularities in CAD models and achieve a representation that encodes their command types, parameters, and sequential orders. An autoencoder based on the Transformer network is proposed to embed CAD models into a latent space and decode them into CAD command sequences. The authors introduce a new dataset of CAD command sequences and evaluate the quality of the generated CAD designs. The abstract concludes with an outlook on potential applications enabled by the proposed CAD autoencoder.
