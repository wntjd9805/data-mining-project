This paper proposes a Hierarchical Action Segmentation Refiner (HASR) that aims to improve the action segmentation results from backbone models by considering the overall context of the entire video in a hierarchical manner. The proposed approach extracts segment-level representations based on frame-level features and a video-level representation based on the segment-level representations. HASR is trained in a supervised way using segmentation results from pretrained backbone models and ground truth segment information. The authors demonstrate that HASR can be plugged into various backbone models and can also improve the segmentation results of unseen backbone models. Experimental results show that HASR successfully boosts the performance of existing state-of-the-art action segmentation models on the 50Salads dataset.
