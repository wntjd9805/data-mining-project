Backdoor attacks have become a significant concern in security-critical deep learning services. Adversaries manipulate training data or model parameters to make the model recognize a backdoor trigger as the desired label. These triggers can perform malicious tasks, such as converting the label of a stop sign or misidentifying faces. State-of-the-art backdoor triggers are designed to be inconspicuous to humans, using patterns of commonplace objects or injecting imperceptible perturbations. Previous research on backdoor data detection focuses on identifying outliers or analyzing network activations. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the frequency spectrum of existing triggers and datasets. We find that existing triggers exhibit severe high-frequency artifacts, and these artifacts stem from the trigger pattern or insertion methodology. Based on these insights, we propose a frequency domain-based detection pipeline that achieves a detection rate of 98.5% without prior knowledge of the attack types. We also explore the design of smooth triggers without high-frequency artifacts and show their effectiveness in attacks and defense. We emphasize the importance of frequency analysis in the design of backdoor attacks and defenses and provide our experiment codes as open-source for further development. Our contributions include the frequency-domain analysis of triggers, analysis of artifact causes, demonstrating the effectiveness of frequency representations in detection, proposing practical smooth triggers, and insights into their detectability.
