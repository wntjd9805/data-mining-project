This paper introduces a new approach to Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) using image-level labels. Most WSSS methods rely on Class Activation Maps (CAM) to generate initial seeds, but they often exhibit incomplete foreground areas. To address this issue, the paper proposes the use of a Complementary Patch (CP) representation, where the CAMs of a pair of images with CP regions are added together to incorporate more information. A Complementary Patch Network (CPN) is then developed to minimize the discrepancy between the improved CAM and the original image. The CPN includes a Triplet CP (TCP) loss and a CP Cross Regularization (CPCR) loss, along with a Pixel-Region Correlation Module (PRCM) to capture the relationship between pixels and regions. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed CPN, achieving state-of-the-art performance in WSSS.
