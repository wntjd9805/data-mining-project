Many tasks in Computer Vision involve estimating unknown group elements from noisy relative measurements. This can be formulated as the synchronization of group-labelled graphs, where nodes are labelled with unknown elements and edges represent measurements. This paper focuses on the case of multi-graph synchronization, where multiple measurements are available for the same node pair. This allows for natural handling of multiple measurements, which is common in applications like SLAM and large-scale problems. The naive solution of averaging measurements suffers from shortcomings and sub-optimal statistical properties. In this work, we propose a solution called MULTISYNC, which expands the multi-graph and enforces identity constraints between replicated nodes. We derive a closed-form spectral solution for this constrained optimization problem, applicable to graphs labelled with any linear group. Our experiments demonstrate that MULTISYNC outperforms edge averaging in accuracy and precision, and achieves a good trade-off between accuracy and complexity in partitioned synchronization tasks. This paper provides a formal definition of multi-graph synchronization and presents a practical algorithm for solving this problem.
