In this paper, we address the challenge of virtual dressed human animation, which has applications in entertainment, videogames, and virtual and augmented reality. We compare two main computer graphics approaches: Physically Based Simulation (PBS) and Linear Blend Skinning (LBS) and Pose Space Deformation (PSD) models. PBS provides highly realistic cloth dynamics but requires significant computational resources, while LBS and PSD models are suitable for real-time performance but compromise realism. To overcome the limitations of existing approaches, we propose a novel deep learning-based methodology for outﬁt animation that can handle multiple layers of cloth, arbitrary topology, and complex geometric details without requiring retraining. We leverage deep learning techniques that have been successful in other complex 3D tasks and the availability of 3D datasets on garments. However, existing methods lack generalization capabilities and are limited to specific garment types. To address this, we propose encoding garment types as a subset of body vertices, allowing us to generalize to more garments. Additionally, we identify edition/resizing and animation as separate tasks and focus on the latter. Our method works with whole outﬁts, multiple layers of cloth, and resolutions, while allowing for complex geometric details. We achieve this with a simple and small-sized neural network. Our contributions include the ability to animate completely unseen outﬁts without additional training, increasing the applicability of our approach in scenarios that require a growing number of outﬁts. We ensure compatibility with all graphics engines by predicting blend weights and blend shapes matrices instead of garment vertex locations. Our approach also maintains physical consistency by combining Pose Space Deformations with object pose consistently. Overall, our methodology offers a promising solution for virtual dressed human animation using deep learning techniques, improving both realism and computational performance for various applications.
