Trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in the field of autonomous driving and robot navigation. The challenge lies in accurately predicting all possible future trajectories with high probabilities due to the uncertainty of human behaviors and the multimodal nature of the future. Previous research has focused on regression, generation, and classification frameworks, but each has its limitations. Regression frameworks lack probability correspondence and determinacy, while generation frameworks struggle to accurately model the multimodal nature. Classification frameworks, although providing determinacy, suffer from weak representation capture and limited fine-grained motion exploration. In this paper, we propose a new trajectory prediction framework called PCCSNet, which combines modality clustering, classification, and synthesis to address these limitations. Through deep clustering and classification networks, we score and distinguish different modalities, which are then synthesized into deterministic predictions. Our modular framework achieves high accuracy and robustness in multiple trajectory prediction benchmarks.
