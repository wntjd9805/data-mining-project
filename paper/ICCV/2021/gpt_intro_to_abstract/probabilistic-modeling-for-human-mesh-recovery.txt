This research paper introduces the problem of reconstructing 3D human pose from 2D observations and argues for the importance of capturing a distribution of 3D poses instead of relying on a single deterministic estimate. The authors propose a novel approach using Normalizing Flows to regress a distribution of plausible poses conditioned on the provided 2D input. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach and highlight the value of probabilistic modeling for various downstream applications, such as human body model fitting and cross-view consistency. The proposed probabilistic model achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods in conventional evaluations and offers an elegant and effective way to consolidate information from multiple sources. The authors conduct extensive experiments and provide evidence of their model's superiority in various aspects. Overall, this paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of human pose reconstruction and probabilistic modeling.
