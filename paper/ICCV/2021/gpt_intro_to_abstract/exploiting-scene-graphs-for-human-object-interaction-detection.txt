Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a challenging problem in computer vision, with numerous practical applications such as action recognition and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Previous works solely based on visual features have struggled to learn discriminative patterns for HOIs due to the complexity of scenes containing multiple humans and objects. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Scene Graph to Human-Object Interaction (SG2HOI) detection, which leverages external knowledge in the form of scene graphs to improve the performance of HOI models. Unlike general-purpose knowledge graphs, scene graphs provide more informative cues specific to the HOI task. We introduce two components: scene graph embedding and relation-aware message passing, to extract scene-specific cues and transfer knowledge encoded in the scene graph to the HOI graph. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating scene graphs in HOI detection.
