This paper presents an end-to-end pseudo-label based semi-supervised object detection framework that addresses the issue of limited performance in multi-stage training approaches. The proposed framework simultaneously performs pseudo-labeling for unlabeled images and trains a detector using these pseudo labels along with a few labeled ones. Two models, a student and a teacher, are applied to the images, with the teacher providing direct assessment of the box candidates generated by the student. This framework allows for greater leverage of the teacher model and enables a "flywheel effect" where the pseudo labeling and detection training processes reinforce each other. The paper also introduces a "soft teacher" approach that uses a reliability measure to weight the loss of each background box candidate, resulting in improved performance compared to previous methods. Experimental evaluations on the MS-COCO benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, surpassing previous methods in terms of mean average precision (mAP) for both labeled and unlabeled datasets. The approach also achieves improved accuracy when incorporated into state-of-the-art object detectors.
