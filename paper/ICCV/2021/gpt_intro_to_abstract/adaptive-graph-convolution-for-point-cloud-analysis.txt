This paper introduces a new graph convolution operator called adaptive graph convolution (AdaptConv) to address the limitations of current methods in processing point cloud data. Point clouds are unstructured and unordered sets of 3D points, and traditional convolution operations are difficult to apply directly to them. Previous approaches either convert point clouds into regular volumetric representations, leading to excessive memory cost and loss of fine-grained geometric details, or apply standard graph convolutions with fixed convolution kernels, neglecting the different feature correspondences between points. The proposed AdaptConv generates adaptive kernels for each pair of points based on their learned features, allowing for a more diverse and specific relationship between them. This adaptiveness is achieved by incorporating the adaptive kernels inside the graph convolution, instead of relying on predefined weights. The paper explores different design choices for the feature convolving process to provide more flexibility in the implementation of the adaptive convolution. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaptConv, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both classification and segmentation tasks.
