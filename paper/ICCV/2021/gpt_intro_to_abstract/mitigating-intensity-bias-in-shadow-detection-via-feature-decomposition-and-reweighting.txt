Shadows play an important role in scene understanding but can negatively impact the performance of computer vision tasks. While previous methods for shadow detection using hand-crafted features have been unreliable, recent deep learning-based methods have shown superior performance. However, existing deep shadow detectors heavily rely on the intensity cue, leading to misrecognition of brighter shadow regions as non-shadows and dark non-shadow regions as shadows. This bias towards intensity cues limits the exploration of other cues that could contribute to shadow detection. To address this bias, we propose a novel self-supervised approach for shadow detection that guides the decomposition of deep features, allowing the attention to be reallocated between intensity-variant and intensity-invariant features. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art shadow detection methods, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on three public datasets.
