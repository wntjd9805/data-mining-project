Abstract:In recent years, deep learning-based image segmentation methods have achieved outstanding performance. However, these methods often require a large number of pixel-level labels, which can be costly and time-consuming to obtain. Additionally, labeling small objects accurately poses a greater challenge than labeling larger objects. This paper focuses on the segmentation of objects or buildings, particularly small objects, using weak labels that do not require precise labeling. One popular method for labeling objects is through manual contour following or drawing a polygon around the object. However, accurately labeling small objects using this method is difficult and time-consuming, resulting in a higher proportion of mislabeled pixels compared to larger objects. Despite the challenges, detecting small objects is important for certain tasks, such as locating the position of satellite/aerial images without available position information. The spatial relationship between detected small and large buildings can provide useful clues for determining the position of the image. To address these issues, this paper proposes a new point labeling scheme for small objects and a segmentation network that can be trained using both point labels for small objects and traditional contour labels for large objects. Unlike accurately labeling the contour of a small object, this approach labels it using two points inside and outside the object. Although the point labels are less informative than full labels, the point labeling process requires less delicacy and reduces the annotation time. Furthermore, this paper introduces a small object mask to properly process different types of labels. The mask differentiates between large objects with full labels and small objects with point labels. Additionally, the paper discusses the potential bias in favor of large objects during training and the need to consider the size of small objects in the loss function. The proposed segmentation network is a weakly supervised approach that utilizes a memory bank to compensate for the limited number of point labels. The network samples uncertain points and false positive small object points, and separately considers small and large objects in the loss function. Furthermore, the network matches the image gradient to the prediction gradient to learn the contours of small objects.The contributions of this paper include an easier labeling method for small objects, the consideration of small and large objects separately in the loss function, and the use of a memory bank to remember and update feature vectors of small object points during training. Experimental results demonstrate improved small object detection performance without significant degradation in large object detection performance.
