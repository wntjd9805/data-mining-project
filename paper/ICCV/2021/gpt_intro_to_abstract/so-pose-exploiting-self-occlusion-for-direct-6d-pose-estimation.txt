Estimating the 6D pose, or the position and orientation of an object in 3D space, is crucial for many computer vision applications. Current methods based on deep learning have achieved impressive accuracy and efficiency in estimating 6D pose in cluttered environments. However, most of these methods rely on a two-stage strategy that involves establishing 2D-3D correspondences and then computing the pose using algorithms like PnP. While these methods perform well, they are not end-to-end trainable and require additional computation for pose optimization. Some recent approaches have attempted to directly learn the 6D pose from dense correspondence-based representations but have not achieved the same level of accuracy as the two-stage methods. One limitation of the end-to-end methods is the matching ambiguity of textureless object surfaces, which results in mis-matching errors caused by noise. To address this, we propose a self-occlusion based approach that leverages information about the invisible parts of objects due to occlusion. Inspired by multi-layer models used in 3D reconstruction, we develop a two-layer representation that incorporates self-occlusion information. The first layer preserves the correspondence field of visible points on the object, while the second layer includes information about self-occlusion.To align self-occlusion, correspondence field, and 6D pose, we introduce two cross-layer consistency losses. Our proposed method, called SO-Pose, directly regresses the 6D pose from the two-layer representation of each object. Experimental results show that SO-Pose outperforms other end-to-end methods on various challenging datasets and achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art two-stage methods while being much faster. In summary, our contributions include the development of an end-to-end trainable method for 6D pose estimation that leverages self-occlusion information and establishes a two-layer representation of each object. Our proposed method surpasses other end-to-end approaches and achieves competitive accuracy and efficiency compared to two-stage methods.
