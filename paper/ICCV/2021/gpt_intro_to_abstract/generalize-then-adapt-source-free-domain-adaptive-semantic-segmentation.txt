This paper introduces the concept of Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) in the context of semantic segmentation of urban road scenes. SFDA aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain without sharing the source data. The paper proposes a cooperative framework where the vendor and the client employ specialized learning strategies to achieve the desired adaptation. On the vendor side, the paper presents strategies for acquiring a diverse dataset and simulating multiple novel domains using carefully crafted augmentations. The paper also proposes an effective training strategy that considers both domain-generic and domain-specific learning. Theoretical insights are provided to analyze different ways to aggregate domain-specific hypotheses, and a Source-only Multi-Augmentation Network (SoMAN) is introduced.On the client side, the paper draws inspiration from pseudo-label based self-training approaches. The target samples are passed through the source-model to generate pseudo-labels, which are then used to fine-tune the network. The paper addresses regularization and pseudo-label selection criteria to ensure effective self-training in the absence of source data.The paper also introduces a conditional Prior-enforcing Auto-Encoder (cPAE) model, which models general context-dependent priors to improve the quality of dense predictions in the segmentation task.The proposed source-free framework achieves state-of-the-art results in adaptation benchmarks.
