Surface reconstruction from calibrated multi-view images is a crucial problem in 3D computer vision. Traditionally, this process involves two substeps: 1) reconstructing depth maps and point clouds from images using multi-view stereo algorithms, and 2) extracting a surface, typically represented as a triangular mesh, from dense points by maximizing conformity to points. To enhance reconstruction quality, surface refinement steps can also be applied. However, this pipeline can result in suboptimal geometry due to accumulated representation conversions. Recent works have explored learning-based methods for each substep independently, but an optimal end-to-end surface reconstruction from images is still desirable. Alternatively, neural representations have shown promise in directly constructing mesh surfaces from images through implicit functions and differentiable rendering. This approach represents surface geometry and color information as implicit functions modeled by multi-layer perceptrons, allowing for joint optimization through differentiable rendering. The triangle mesh can be extracted from the implicit field using the Marching Cubes algorithm. While these methods achieve end-to-end reconstruction and image synthesis, they suffer from ambiguities in geometry and appearance. To address this, we propose MVSDF, a novel neural surface reconstruction framework that combines implicit neural surface estimation with advanced MVS networks. Our method represents the surface as a zero level set of a signed distance field (SDF) and the appearance as a surface light field, jointly optimizing them through render loss. Deep image features and depth maps from learning-based MVS are used to assist the implicit SDF estimation, which is supervised by inferred depth values and refined through multi-view feature consistency. Our evaluations on multiple datasets demonstrate that MVSDF can recover complex geometries without relying on object masks as input and achieves superior reconstruction and view synthesis quality compared to classical meshing pipelines and differentiable rendering based networks.
