This paper introduces MDETR, an end-to-end text-modulated detection system based on the DETR detector. Unlike traditional detection methods, MDETR is capable of detecting nuanced concepts from free-form text and generalizes to unseen combinations of categories and attributes. The method relies solely on text and aligned boxes as supervision for concepts in an image, enabling truly end-to-end multi-modal reasoning. The paper showcases the effectiveness of MDETR on tasks such as phrase grounding, referring expression comprehension, visual question answering, referring expression segmentation, and few-shot long-tailed object detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the modulated detection approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on these tasks, surpassing previous methods on datasets with both synthetic and real images.
