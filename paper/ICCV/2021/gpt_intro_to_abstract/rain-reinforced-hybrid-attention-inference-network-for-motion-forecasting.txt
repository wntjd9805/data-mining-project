This paper introduces a general motion forecasting framework called RAIN, which incorporates a hybrid attention mechanism for dynamic key information selection and ranking. The framework consists of a reinforcement learning-based hard attention mechanism and a soft attention mechanism. The hard attention mechanism enables the discrimination of key information from complete observations, while the soft attention mechanism further determines the relative significance of the selected information. The framework can adapt to evolving situations by iteratively applying a sliding window with dynamic selection of key information. The paper provides real-world examples highlighting the natural selection of key information based on spatial relations or temporal dependencies. The efficacy of hard attention in motion forecasting tasks is explored for the first time, addressing the issue of a varying number of key elements. The proposed framework is validated using a graph-based model for multi-agent trajectory forecasting and a human skeleton motion forecasting model. The paper contributes a double-stage training pipeline and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both domains.
