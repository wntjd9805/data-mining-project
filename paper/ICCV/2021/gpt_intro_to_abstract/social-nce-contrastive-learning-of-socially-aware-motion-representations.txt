Humans have a natural ability to anticipate the movements of others in crowded spaces, allowing them to maintain a comfortable distance and avoid potential dangers. However, building predictive models with this ability is challenging. Several neural network-based models have been proposed to learn socially-aware motion representations for multi-agent problems, but these methods still produce unacceptable solutions at times, raising safety concerns. One key difficulty is the shortage of critical data, as training data is typically collected from safe scenarios, making it difficult to learn social norms and leading to prediction errors. Previous methods attempt to address this issue through interactive data collection, but these methods are costly and impractical for forecasting problems. This paper proposes a social contrastive learning method with negative data augmentation to promote robust motion representations. The method uses prior knowledge and self-supervision to learn from both positive and negative examples, explicitly informing the model about unfavorable states. The paper introduces a social sampling strategy to construct positive and negative events and evaluates the method on three tasks, showing that it consistently reduces collision rates and achieves state-of-the-art results. The proposed method is model-agnostic and can be used as a generic component to enhance the robustness of neural motion models.
