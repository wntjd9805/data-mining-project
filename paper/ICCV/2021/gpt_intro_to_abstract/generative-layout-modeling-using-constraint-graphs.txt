Abstract:This paper addresses the problem of topologically and spatially consistent layout generation, particularly focusing on floorplans and furniture layouts. The assessment of layouts involves considering their global topological structure and spatial detail. While recent techniques such as generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders have made progress in generating realistic content, satisfying both topological and spatial properties remains a challenge. This paper introduces a method that does not require input guidance and produces higher-quality layouts compared to previous methods in the floor plan setting. The authors explore two ideas to improve layout generation: using an auto-regressive model with attention and self-attention layers, and generative modeling with constraint generation. Evaluation results show that the proposed method produces layouts that match real-world data statistics better than existing approaches.
