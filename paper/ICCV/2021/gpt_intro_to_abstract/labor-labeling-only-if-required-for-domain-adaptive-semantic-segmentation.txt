This paper introduces a new framework called Labling Only if Required (LabOR) for domain adaptation in semantic segmentation. LabOR utilizes a small portion of pixel-level labels in an adaptive human-in-the-loop manner to improve performance and reduce human labeling costs. The framework includes two labeling strategies: Segment based Pixel-Labeling (SPL) and Point based Pixel-Labeling (PPL). Experimental results show that LabOR outperforms previous unsupervised domain adaptation models and achieves near-supervised performance with very few pixel-level labels. The contributions of this work are the design of the LabOR framework, the proposal of SPL and PPL labeling options, and extensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach.
