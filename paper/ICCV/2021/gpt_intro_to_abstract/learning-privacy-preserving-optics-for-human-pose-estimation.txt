Cameras are widely used in our daily lives, collecting vast amounts of data that enable various computer vision-based applications. However, the challenge of developing privacy-preserving computer vision systems arises as cameras become more ubiquitous. The current approach of using traditional cameras and software-level processing to preserve privacy has limitations, as it still exposes privacy-sensitive data. This paper proposes an alternative approach of designing a privacy-preserving computational camera through end-to-end optimization. The goal is to capture useful information while hiding privacy-sensitive data, particularly focusing on human pose estimation (HPE) systems. The contributions of this work include introducing a privacy-preserving end-to-end optimization framework, optimizing the camera lens and HPE network, and validating the proposed approach through simulations and hardware experiments. The main objective is to demonstrate the benefits of a deep-optics-inspired approach to developing robust privacy-preserving vision algorithms. The experiments reveal a trade-off between scene degradation and HPE precision.
