We propose a self-supervised deep learning model, the Sparsity Constrained Network (SC-Net), for the restoration of cryo-ET 3D volumetric images. Our model combines structure information from raw noisy volumes and local smoothness information from smoothed representations to suppress high-frequency noise and preserve ultrastructure details. SC-Net utilizes a blind-spot replacement on the noisy volume for training and extracts sparsity constraints from the smoothed volume to guide the training process. Experimental results on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that SC-Net outperforms Noise2Void trained on single noisy inputs and is competitive with Noise2Noise (3D) trained on hundreds of tomograms. Our contributions include the proposal of a self-supervised volumetric image restoration architecture, the introduction of an up-sampling block for preserving structure details, the use of a combined loss function incorporating sparsity information for enforcing local smoothness, and a general procedure for simulating electron tomographic photography and imaging.
