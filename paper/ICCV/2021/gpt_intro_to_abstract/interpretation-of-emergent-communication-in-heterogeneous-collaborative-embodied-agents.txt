Recent research in embodied AI agents that operate in 3D environments and collaborate with multiple agents has focused on studying communication mechanisms to improve collaborative performance. This paper aims to analyze and interpret emergent communication patterns in realistic 3D environments. The authors propose a collaborative multi-object navigation task (CoMON) where an oracle agent with global map knowledge communicates with a navigator agent that perceives and navigates the environment to find goal objects. The paper compares and interprets two families of communication mechanisms: unstructured and structured communication. The findings show that structured communication leads to higher navigation performance and the emergence of interpretable messages. Both communication mechanisms also result in the emergence of egocentrically-grounded messages. By focusing on an egocentric and spatially grounded analysis, this paper provides novel insights into emergent communication in 3D environments.
