Reconstructing 3D surfaces from 2D images is a challenging problem in computer vision, due to the complex surface reflectance properties of real-world objects. Existing methods are limited to certain types of surface reflectance and often assume photo-consistency or Lambertian reflectance. Helmholtz Stereopsis (HS) is a technique that can recover surfaces with arbitrary reflectance by exploiting the symmetry of surface reflectance. This paper presents a novel method called polarimetric Helmholtz Stereopsis (polar-HS), which extends HS by considering the polarization state of light. The method derives a transpositional reciprocity relationship based on the Stokes-Mueller formalism and formulates a reciprocity constraint for depth and normal estimation. The method also exploits polarimetric cues under different types of reflections. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The key contributions include the derivation of the transpositional reciprocity relationship for unrestricted polarization states and a new image decomposition formulation that separates diffuse and specular reflections. Polar-HS reduces the number of required image pairs and does not require prior knowledge of surface geometry and material properties.
