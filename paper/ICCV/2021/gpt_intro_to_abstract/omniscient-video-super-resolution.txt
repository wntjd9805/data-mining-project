Super-Resolution (SR) is the process of reconstructing high-resolution images from low-resolution images. Single image super-resolution (SISR) has been extensively studied, with the use of various convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, video super-resolution (VSR) lacks a dominant unified framework. In this paper, we compare different frameworks for VSR, including iterative, recurrent, hybrid, local omniscient, and global omniscient methods. We propose the omniscient framework, which incorporates both LR frames and estimated hidden states from the past, present, and future. This framework surpasses existing methods in performance and complexity. We hope that our omniscient framework will become a standard in VSR, allowing researchers to design more effective generator networks and explore its potential further.
