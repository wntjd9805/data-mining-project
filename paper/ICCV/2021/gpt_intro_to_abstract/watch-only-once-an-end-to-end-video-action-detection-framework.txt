Video action detection, which involves actor bounding box localization and action type classification, is crucial in various applications including robotics and security. Existing methods that separate the tasks of actor localization and action classification face scalability and practicality challenges. This is due to the dilemma of using a single key frame, which is positive for actor localization but negative for action classification. Previous workarounds involve using off-the-shelf person detection or training separate models for actor detection and action classification, both of which introduce computational and memory costs. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end framework called Watch Once Only (WOO) that directly predicts actor bounding box coordinates and action probabilities from a video clip. WOO consists of a unified backbone, a spatial-temporal action embedding, and a spatial-temporal knowledge fusion mechanism. Our approach simplifies the pipeline, reduces computational costs, and achieves competitive performance compared to existing methods. Experimental results on AVA and JHMDB datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of WOO in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The proposed framework provides a unified solution for simultaneous actor localization and action classification in video action detection.
