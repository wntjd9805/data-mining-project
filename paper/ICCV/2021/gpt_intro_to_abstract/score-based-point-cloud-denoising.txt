Point clouds, which consist of 3D points irregularly sampled from continuous surfaces, are widely used in various applications. However, point clouds are often affected by noise, which poses challenges for downstream tasks. Point cloud denoising is crucial for improving the quality of 3D vision applications. Previous denoising methods have limitations in balancing detail preservation and denoising effectiveness. Recently, deep-learning-based approaches have shown promising results but still suffer from artifacts. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for point cloud denoising based on the distributional properties of noisy point clouds. We model noise-free point clouds as samples from a 3D distribution and propose a gradient ascent-based denoising method. To implement this approach, we develop a neural network architecture to estimate the score of the distribution underlying a noisy point cloud and formulate objective functions for training the network. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art methods, and its potential for other tasks such as point cloud upsampling. Our contributions include the novel denoising paradigm, the neural network architecture, and extensive experimental validation.
