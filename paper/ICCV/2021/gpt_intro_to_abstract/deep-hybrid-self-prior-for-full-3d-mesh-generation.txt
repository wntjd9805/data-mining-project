This paper introduces a method for reconstructing a full 3D model with a textured triangular mesh from a sparse colored point cloud. Previous methods were limited in their ability to generate both the mesh and the texture map, and often relied on strong assumptions or pre-training on large datasets. The proposed method leverages a hybrid 2D-3D self-prior in a deep learning pipeline to improve reconstruction accuracy and quality. The 3D prior is encoded in a MeshCNN, while the 2D prior is learned using a 2D CNN. The two networks iteratively refine the mesh and texture map, resulting in high-resolution models with delicate details. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of both the 2D and 3D self-priors in full mesh reconstruction.
