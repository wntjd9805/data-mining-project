This paper introduces a method called Counterfactual Attention Learning (CAL) to enhance attention learning in computer vision systems. The authors address the problem of effectively learning visual attention, which is crucial for fine-grained visual recognition tasks. They argue that existing weakly-supervised learning methods for attention overlook important factors such as causality and biases in the training data. To address this, the authors propose a tool to measure the quality of attentions and optimize them using counterfactual causality. The proposed CAL method is model-agnostic and computationally efficient. The authors evaluate their method on various fine-grained visual recognition tasks and demonstrate that it significantly improves the performance of attention models and achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets.
