The resolution of television (TV) content has evolved from standard definition (SD) to high definition (HD) and now to ultra-high definition (UHD). One of the key features of the latest TV generation is high dynamic range (HDR), which allows for images and videos that closely resemble real life. However, most accessible resources are still in SD format, necessitating algorithms to convert SD content to HDR. This task, known as SD-to-HDR conversion, has received relatively less attention in the research community due to the lack of well-defined HDR standards and large-scale datasets. This paper aims to address this problem by proposing a solution pipeline that includes adaptive global color mapping, local enhancement, and highlight generation. The authors also introduce a new large-scale dataset named HDRTV1K and evaluate the performance of their method using five metrics. The contributions of this work include a detailed analysis of the SD-to-HDR task, the proposed solution pipeline and method, a novel global color mapping network, and the HDRTV dataset with evaluation metrics.
