Identifying boundaries in computer vision is crucial for understanding objects and scenes. However, extracting boundaries that consist of smooth curves, corners, and junctions has remained challenging. Despite advancements in deep learning models, accurately localizing boundaries has proven difficult. In this paper, we propose a bottom-up model that can precisely detect complete boundary structures, including contours, corners, and junctions simultaneously. Our model fits a non-linear representation to small image patches and encourages consistency between overlapping patches using a novel form of spatial regularization. Through experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that our model provides exceptional resilience to noise, outperforming existing approaches. We formulate the analysis as a non-convex optimization problem and present a greedy algorithm for initializing the junction parameters. Moreover, we showcase the versatility of our model in tasks such as contour detection and boundary-aware smoothing. The paper provides detailed explanations of the model, optimization techniques, and experimental results.
