Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a challenging task that requires machines to answer questions about videos using natural language. Relational reasoning, which involves understanding complex relations within video content, is crucial for solving the VideoQA problem. Existing approaches for VideoQA suffer from limitations in terms of integrating object-level and frame-level relational reasoning and neglecting semantic reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical VisuAl-Semantic RelatIonal Reasoning (HAIR) framework that combines visual and semantic relational reasoning in a hierarchical structure. Our framework utilizes a graph memory mechanism, inspired by graph neural networks and memory networks, to perform efficient relational reasoning. We develop visual graph memory and semantic graph memory to leverage visual and semantic information, respectively. These two graph memory mechanisms interact with each other via visual-to-semantic and semantic-to-visual node mapping. The proposed HAIR framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on various VideoQA datasets and demonstrates superior performance on other video+language tasks. Our approach overcomes the limitations of existing approaches and provides a more comprehensive solution for VideoQA.
