This paper introduces the challenges of labelling point cloud datasets for object detection and segmentation. It highlights the difficulty of identifying points in sparse and occluded point clouds, as well as the time-consuming and error-prone nature of labelling individual points or drawing 3D bounding boxes. To address these challenges, the paper explores the use of unsupervised pre-training methods utilizing large unlabelled repositories of point cloud data. It discusses the use of latent generative models and self-supervised objectives in previous work, and proposes a new unsupervised pre-training method called Occlusion Completion (OcCo). OcCo involves generating masked point clouds through view-point occlusions and completing the occluded point cloud. The paper demonstrates that pre-training with OcCo on a single object-level dataset improves the performance of downstream tasks, such as few-shot learning, object classification, and semantic segmentation. It highlights the advantages of OcCo over other pre-training methods, including improved sample efficiency, generalization, and the discovery of wider local minima. Furthermore, OcCo exhibits better clustering quality under various transformations. Overall, this paper suggests that unsupervised pre-training methods like OcCo can enhance the deployment of point cloud models in real-world settings with limited labelled data.
