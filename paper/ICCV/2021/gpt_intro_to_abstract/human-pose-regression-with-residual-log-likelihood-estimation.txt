This paper explores the problem of human pose estimation in computer vision and compares the existing methods in the field. The two main categories of methods are heatmap-based and regression-based, with heatmap-based methods being dominant but suffering from high computation and storage demands. Regression-based methods, while more efficient, have inferior performance in challenging cases. To address this, the authors propose a novel regression paradigm called Residual Log-likelihood Estimation (RLE) that leverages maximum likelihood estimation and normalizing flows to estimate the underlying distribution. They also present a reparameterization strategy for the flow model to make the regression framework feasible. The proposed method is applicable to various human pose estimation algorithms and tasks. Experimental results on three pose estimation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach, outperforming heatmap-based methods. The contributions of the paper include the proposed regression paradigm, the reparameterization design, and the demonstrated improvements in various pose estimation methods. Overall, the paper aims to inspire the field to reconsider the potential of regression-based methods in human pose estimation.
