3D skeleton-based action recognition has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications. However, the focus on two-person interaction recognition using 3D skeletons (3DTPIR) is relatively limited compared to general-purpose methods. The lack of effective mechanisms for capturing joint relationships in human interactions has been identified as a challenge in current state-of-the-art action recognition methods.Existing works for 3DTPIR primarily encode correlations between joints based on distances, neglecting the highly correlated arm and leg movements in two-person interactions. To address this, we propose the use of high-order statistics, specifically covariance matrices, to capture these interactions more effectively. Covariance matrices lie on Sym+ n , a type of Riemannian manifold, and classifying SPD-valued data has been a subject of extensive research. SPD neural networks have shown promising results, but the efficient modeling of probability distributions on Sym+ n remains an open issue.While previous works have focused on generalizing Gaussian distributions on Rn to Sym+ n , our approach aims to embed Riemannian Gaussians in matrix groups. By doing so, we can classify Riemannian Gaussians without relying on exact expressions of their probability density functions. Our contributions include proposing an embedding method for Gaussians by mapping them to Riemannian symmetric spaces, representing 3D skeleton sequences as sets of SPD matrices, and introducing a neural network for learning geometric representations from these sequences.To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on three benchmarks for 3D human activity understanding. The results demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach with state-of-the-art methods.
