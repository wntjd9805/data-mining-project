Deep learning has shown remarkable effectiveness in various tasks, including semantic segmentation. However, semantic segmentation requires dense pixel-level annotated labels, which are time-consuming and costly to acquire. Therefore, weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods that utilize only image-level classification labels have been extensively studied. These methods typically use Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to localize object regions based on the image-level labels. However, existing WSSS research has pointed out that CAMs tend to highlight only the most discriminative regions rather than the entire object regions. To address this issue, Adversarial Erasing (AE) methods have been proposed to identify the less highlighted regions for training a new classifier. In this paper, we investigate the potential of the ordinary classifier in identifying the less discriminative regions without additional training. Through a simple experiment, we find that the ordinary classifier already possesses this capability. Therefore, we propose a class-specific AE-based framework that aggregates regions from the most discriminative to the less discriminative, using the ordinary classifier for guidance. Our framework consists of a CAMs Generating Network (CGNet) and the ordinary classifier. We train the CGNet to lower the score of the erased target class, while keeping the scores of other classes high. This class-specific erasing method allows the CGNet to generate more precise CAMs by reducing confusion at object boundaries between different classes. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves better localization ability and significantly improves performance in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). The contributions of our work are four-fold: (1) verification that an ordinary classifier can segment the whole object region, (2) proposal of an adversarial erasing-based framework to exploit the potential of the ordinary classifier, (3) design of a class-specific erasing method that utilizes multi-class images for more accurate CAM boundaries, and (4) achievement of state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS-COCO datasets in the WSSS task using only image-level classification labels.
