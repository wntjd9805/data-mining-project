Dense multi-view stereo (MVS) is a challenging problem in computer vision that aims to estimate dense geometry from multiple posed images. Existing techniques compare the similarity of image patches at different depth hypotheses, but accurately estimating dense geometry remains difficult. This is particularly problematic in real-world scenarios, such as indoor environments, where texture-less areas introduce ambiguities to the matching step. Various methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, including global optimization and learning-based approaches. However, these methods have limitations in terms of computational complexity and the quality of handcrafted features. In this paper, we propose a novel deep multi-view stereo system that decouples locally planar priors from the cost volume based depth/normal prediction networks. Our system utilizes a differentiable confidence-based solver that iteratively solves for depth and normal maps using an energy potential that favors locally planar surfaces. By training the system end-to-end, we can guide the depth/normal network to focus on confident predictions on textured regions and leave poorly textured regions to be resolved with the solver. Our experiments on ScanNet and RGB-D Scenes V2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed system achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy on depth and surface normals. The iterative solver consistently improves the depth quality over both conventional and deep MVS pipelines.
