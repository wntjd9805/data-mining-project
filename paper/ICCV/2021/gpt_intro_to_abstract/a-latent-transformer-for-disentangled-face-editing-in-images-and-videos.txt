Facial attribute editing is an important task in the field of photo retouching and film post-production. It is often necessary to retouch the appearances of actors for beautification or special makeup effects. To achieve this, it is crucial for artists to have the ability to manipulate facial attributes without affecting other aspects of the image. Thus, a face editing method should be based on disentangled attributes and enable identity-preserving manipulations.Previous works in deep learning have focused on encoder-decoder based architectures. Although these approaches have shown improvements in the quality of results, they are limited in resolution and tend to generate noticeable artifacts on high resolution images. As a result, they are not suitable for high-quality video editing. Furthermore, these methods are difficult to control as modifying one facial attribute often leads to unintended modifications of other attributes.
