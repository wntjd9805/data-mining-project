This paper addresses the problem of single image defocus deblurring, where the blur size and shape vary spatially. Previous two-step approaches assume a specific blur shape, but real-world defocused images often have more complex kernel shapes. The DPDNet was introduced as an end-to-end network for defocus deblurring, but it has limitations in handling spatially varying blur. In this paper, a novel deep learning approach based on inverse kernels is proposed. The approach exploits the property that the shape of the inverse kernel remains the same when only the size of the blur changes. A kernel-sharing parallel atrous convolutional (KPAC) block is designed, which consists of multiple atrous convolution layers with different dilation rates and additional layers for scale and shape attentions. The KPAC block can effectively handle spatially varying defocus blur. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy and is lighter-weighted.
