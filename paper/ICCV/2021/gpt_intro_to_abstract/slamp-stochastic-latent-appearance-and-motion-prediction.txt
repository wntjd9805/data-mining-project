This paper introduces a method for predicting future frames in videos by explicitly modeling the change in motion, or the motion history. The authors propose a stochastic model with separate appearance and motion decoders, and a probabilistic mask to combine them for more accurate predictions. They compare their method to previous deterministic and stochastic approaches, showing superior performance on real-world driving datasets. The model incorporates motion information successfully into the stochastic framework and does not require keypoints or optical flow.
