The introduction of the paper discusses the limitations of the recently proposed DETR object detection algorithm, which has a slow convergence speed compared to other detectors. The authors propose a novel module called Spatially Modulated Co-attention (SMCA) to replace the co-attention mechanism in DETR and improve its convergence and performance. SMCA dynamically predicts the initial center and scale of each object query's bounding box and generates a spatial weight map to effectively aggregate query-related information. The authors further enhance SMCA with multi-scale visual feature encoding and multi-head attention in the encoder and decoder, respectively. Experimental results show that SMCA can significantly speed up the training of DETR and achieve improved performance. The authors also validate the effectiveness of SMCA through extensive ablation studies. Overall, the proposed SMCA module provides a plug-and-play solution to enhance the DETR object detection algorithm.
