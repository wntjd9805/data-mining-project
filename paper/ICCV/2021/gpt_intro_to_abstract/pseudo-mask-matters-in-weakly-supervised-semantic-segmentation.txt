Semantic segmentation is a computer vision problem that requires manual annotations, which can be time-consuming. To address this, weakly-supervised semantic segmentation approaches have been proposed using different types of annotations, such as scribble annotations, bounding boxes, points, or image-level labels. This paper focuses on weakly-supervised semantic segmentation with image-level labels due to their ease of availability.Most existing weakly-supervised semantic segmentation algorithms require pseudo-masks derived from Class Activation Maps (CAMs) to train the Fully-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (FSSS) model. However, there are some issues with the usage of pseudo-masks, including the projection of multi-label CAMs to single-label pseudo-masks, the focus on discriminative parts resulting in partial activations, the presence of noise in pseudo-masks, and the higher accuracy of FSSS predictions compared to pseudo-masks.To address these issues, this paper proposes strategies to improve the efficiency of pseudo-masks in terms of both generation and utilization. In the generation step, Coefficient of Variation (cv) is computed for each channel of the CAMs, and the CAMs are refined using exponential functions with cv as the control coefficient. Additionally, instead of directly projecting the three-dimensional CAMs to two-dimensional pseudo-masks, each pixel is equipped with a scalar representing its importance in generating the final pseudo-masks.In the FSSS training step, a Pretended Underfitting Strategy is proposed to suppress the losses of the noise labels in the pseudo-masks. The model is also evaluated on a validation dataset, and the masks are updated cyclically if the model's prediction is better than the pseudo-masks generated in the first step.Applying these methods to a baseline algorithm called SEAM, the paper achieves new state-of-the-art results on two weakly-supervised semantic segmentation benchmarks. The contributions of the paper are three-fold: the generation of high-quality pseudo-masks using Coefficient of Variation smoothing and Proportional Pseudo-mask Generation, the effective utilization of pseudo-masks through the Pretended Underfitting Strategy and Cyclic Pseudo-masks, and extensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
