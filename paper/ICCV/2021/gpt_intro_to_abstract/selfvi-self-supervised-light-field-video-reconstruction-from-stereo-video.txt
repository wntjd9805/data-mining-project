Photography and videography have become prevalent in our daily lives thanks to the accessibility of imaging hardware. However, there is a demand for intuitive and simple post-capture processing to enhance the quality of images. Light field (LF) imaging has emerged as a promising technique to address the limitations of traditional photography, such as post-capture focus control and depth-of-field control. LF video capture could potentially enable post-capture focus control for videos acquired on consumer devices. However, acquiring LF video data at useful frame rates remains challenging. Commercial LF cameras currently have a low frame rate due to the trade-off between angular, spatial, and temporal resolution. Computational photography aims to solve these challenges, but a practical solution is yet to be found. This paper proposes a self-supervised algorithm for LF video reconstruction from a sequence of stereo frames. The algorithm leverages geometric and temporal information from the stereo video to generate LF frames. It enforces epipolar and temporal consistency through disparity-based geometric constraints and optical flow-based constraints. The algorithm is self-supervised, eliminating the need for ground-truth data during training. It allows for variable angular view interpolation and extrapolation and can be fine-tuned on specific video sequences without ground truth data. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods in LF reconstruction.
