3D shape completion is a fundamental problem in computer vision and robotic perception. The completion of 3D object topologies from sparse and incomplete observations is essential for downstream tasks such as object classification, segmentation, and detection. Although previous methods have achieved impressive results, they are limited to low-fidelity outputs. In this work, we focus on generating high-quality 3D objects from occluded inputs. We propose a voxel-based shape completion network that leverages generated object edges to recover fine-grained details. We use a voxel representation and generate points for every grid cell, allowing for arbitrary resolutions and efficient memory usage. We introduce a multi-scale grid transformation module to capture critical object shapes in different resolutions. Additionally, we incorporate an edge generator to enhance the generation of thin structures. We evaluate our model on synthetic and real-world datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performances in point cloud completion. Our contributions include a multi-scale voxel-based network for fine-grained detail generation, the incorporation of object structure information through edge generation, and improved performances on different datasets.
