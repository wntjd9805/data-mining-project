Dense 3D reconstruction from multi-view stereo (MVS) is a long-standing problem in computer vision, where correspondences among multiple images are computed to determine the dense geometry. Traditional approaches establish correspondences by searching for optimal matching patches in target images, but this is computationally expensive and often results in unsatisfactory reconstruction quality. Deep learning-based solutions have shown promise in addressing these issues but still suffer from high memory and computation requirements. In this paper, we propose EPP-MVSNet, a deep neural network that aims to fully utilize the information of high-resolution images. We introduce an epipolar-assembling module that constructs a compact cost volume by assembling densely interpolated features and reducing the volume size through adaptive pooling. We also introduce an entropy-based refining strategy to reduce redundancy and information loss. Furthermore, we replace 3D convolutions with Pseudo-3D convolutions and develop a lightweight structure for cost volume regularization to improve learning and inference efficiency. Experimental results on Tanks & Temples, ETH3D, and DTU datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed network. Our contributions include the introduction of the epipolar-assembling module, the entropy-based process for adjusting depth range, the lightweight 3D regularization network, and extensive experiments comparing EPP-MVSNet to state-of-the-art methods.
