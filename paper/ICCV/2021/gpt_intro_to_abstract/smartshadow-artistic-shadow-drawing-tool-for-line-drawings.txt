Shadows in artworks differ from those in photography or photorealistic computer vision as they are drawn by artists and can deviate from physical laws. Artists manipulate various aspects of shadows for artistic purposes. This paper presents an application called SmartShadow that assists artists in drawing shadows on line drawings. The application includes three tools: the shadow brush for coarse shadow indications, the shadow boundary brush for precise boundary control, and the global shadow generator for automatic estimation and propagation of shadows. The tools are designed using hierarchical neural networks trained on a large dataset of real and synthesized data. Experiments demonstrate that SmartShadow accelerates the shadow drawing process, and user studies show that it produces satisfactory results preferred by artists. The paper also provides qualitative evaluations and a dataset of line drawing and shadow pairs. Overall, this work presents a valuable tool for artists and contributes to the field of shadow drawing in computer graphics.
