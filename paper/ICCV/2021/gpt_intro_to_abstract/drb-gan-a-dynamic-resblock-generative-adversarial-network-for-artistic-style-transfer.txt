Artistic style transfer aims to synthesize an image that combines the structure of the content image with the artistic style of a specific artist. This style refers to the genre of paintings created by the artist, and each painting has its own unique characteristics. Existing approaches for style transfer either rely on a single arbitrary style image or consider each style image in a collection as a separate domain. However, these methods lack the flexibility to explore the manifold of artistic styles and may not produce consistent style genre across diverse artworks. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic ResBlock Generative Adversarial Network (DRB-GAN) for artistic style transfer. Our approach incorporates a style encoding network, a style transfer network, and a style collection discriminative network. We model the "style code" as shared parameters for Dynamic Convolutions and Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) in dynamic Residual Blocks (DRBs), allowing for attentive adjustment of style and content features. We also introduce a style class-aware attention mechanism to recalibrate the style code and design a Spatial Window-Layer Instance Normalization (SW-LIN) decoder to generate high-resolution stylized images. Additionally, our discriminative network leverages style images from the target collection as references to enforce consistency in the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed DRB-GAN, showing superior performance in both arbitrary style transfer and collection style transfer tasks. Our approach bridges the gap between these two tasks and achieves consistent and high-quality artistic style transfer.
