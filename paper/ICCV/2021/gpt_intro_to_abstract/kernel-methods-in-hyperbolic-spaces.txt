This paper introduces a family of positive definite (pd) kernels for mapping representations in hyperbolic spaces into Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHSs). The use of these kernels allows for the analysis of hyperbolic spaces using kernel machines. While Euclidean spaces have been widely used for feature embeddings in machine learning, they can cause distortions in the encoding of structured data, leading to the loss of complex geometric information. Recent studies in computer vision have suggested that embedding images and videos using hyperbolic geometry can be beneficial for tasks such as textual entailment, image classification and retrieval, and graph classification. Hyperbolic spaces have the ability to encode hierarchical data due to their constant negative sectional curvature and do not satisfy Euclid's parallel postulate. However, working with such non-linear spaces poses challenges. This paper aims to develop pd kernels to enable the seamless use of kernel machines for analyzing hyperbolic data. The paper proposes four pd kernels for hyperbolic spaces, including the hyperbolic tangent kernel, hyperbolic RBF kernel, hyperbolic Laplace kernel, and hyperbolic binomial kernel, along with their theoretical analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these kernels in various vision tasks, showcasing the superiority of kernelization for representation learning in hyperbolic spaces.
