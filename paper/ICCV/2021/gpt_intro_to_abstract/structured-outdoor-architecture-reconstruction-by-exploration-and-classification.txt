This paper introduces a novel explore-and-classify approach for structured reconstruction in computer science. The goal is to reconstruct the face of a person using a trial and error method, where the learning is focused on verifying the correctness of the geometry rather than one-shot regression. The proposed approach uses simple geometry-editing actions to explore a set of offspring graphs and learns to classify the correctness of them at different levels of local geometries. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on the task of outdoor architecture reconstruction from aerial images, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to baselines and existing algorithms. The contributions of this paper include the explore-and-classify framework with local geometry classifiers for structured reconstruction and improved performance on the outdoor architecture reconstruction problem. The ideas presented in this paper have the potential to be applied to other structured reconstruction tasks and enhance the performance of existing approaches. The code and pre-trained models are available at the provided GitHub repository, and the data is publicly available through a prior project.
