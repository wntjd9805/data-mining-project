With the rise of smartphones as the primary source of photographs, there is an increasing demand for better imaging results. Mobile cameras often employ high-order aspherical lenses or free-form surfaces to compress the volume of wide-angle lenses, resulting in image quality mutation. While traditional image signal processing (ISP) systems have attempted to correct these degradations, errors accumulate and magnify in subsequent processing steps. This paper explores two approaches to address this issue. The first approach is to use iterative optimization to estimate the camera intrinsic degradation kernel, but it struggles with spatial variations. The second approach involves reconstructing the degraded image using deep learning, but it requires accurate data pairs specific to each camera. This paper proposes a degradation framework and network architecture that can generate training data tailored to each camera, resulting in significantly improved image quality. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is demonstrated through experiments, showcasing its potential to replace traditional ISP systems in practical scenarios.
