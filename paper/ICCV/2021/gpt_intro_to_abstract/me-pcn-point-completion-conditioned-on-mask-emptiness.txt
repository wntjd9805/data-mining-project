This paper introduces ME-PCN, a novel point completion network informed with mask emptiness, to address the challenge of incomplete 3D data from 3D scanners. Unlike existing methods that only learn from visible points, ME-PCN incorporates the learning of emptiness to represent consistent shape topology and improve surface details. To encode the emptiness clues, 3D rays are radiated from the viewpoint towards the empty regions of the mask, and separate networks are used to encode visible and empty points. A refining stage is performed to enhance the surface details by learning local features from neighboring points. Experimental results demonstrate that ME-PCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of completion performance. This encoding modality for point completion provides valuable insights into shape occupancy and topology, leading to improved results in 3D shape completion tasks.
