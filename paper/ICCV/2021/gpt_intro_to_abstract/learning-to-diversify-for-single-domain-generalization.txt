The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the problem of domain shift in machine learning algorithms and the techniques of domain adaptation and domain generalization that have been developed to address this issue. The focus of the paper is on single domain generalization, where only one source domain is available during training. The authors propose a novel approach called Learning-to-diversify (L2D) that aims to improve model generalization by generating diverse samples and learning style-invariant representations. They introduce a style-complement module that synthesizes samples with unseen styles and diversifies them in the latent feature space. The authors also describe a min-max mutual information optimization strategy to gradually increase the distribution shift between the generated and source images while bringing samples from the same semantic category closer in the latent space. The proposed method is evaluated on benchmark datasets and compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization and single domain generalization methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving model performance.
