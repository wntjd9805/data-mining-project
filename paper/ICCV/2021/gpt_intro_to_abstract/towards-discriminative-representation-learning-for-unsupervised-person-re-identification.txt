Person re-identification (re-ID) is a crucial task in intelligent surveillance, aiming to identify individuals across different camera views. Recent advancements in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have led to impressive performance in person re-ID, largely due to supervised learning using labeled data. However, manual annotations are time-consuming and limit the scalability of re-ID models. Furthermore, applying a pre-trained model to new domains often results in significant performance drops due to data distribution shifts. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has emerged as a solution to adapt models from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains.Previous unsupervised re-ID methods rely on clustering algorithms to generate pseudo labels for iterative training on the target domain. However, these approaches suffer from two main limitations: (1) label noise can mislead network training with unlabeled target data and (2) transferring knowledge from the source domain to the target domain through simple fine-tuning is insufficient.To address these problems, we propose a unified framework that focuses on three key aspects: (1) reducing label noise on unlabeled target data, (2) improving knowledge transfer from source to target, and (3) incorporating extra training constraints. Specifically, we introduce a cluster-wise contrastive learning algorithm inspired by recent visual representation learning methods. This algorithm reduces noise by incorporating cluster-wise supervision generated by clustering, which is more suitable for the re-ID task.Instead of traditional two-stage training, we adopt a collaborative learning mechanism that gradually transfers model abilities from the source to the target domain. By adjusting training weights, we ensure a better transfer of the ability to distinguish person identities. Additionally, we propose incorporating extra constraints in the Fourier space to enhance class separability in re-ID models. These constraints leverage the frequency spectrum features to augment training and improve performance.Our method makes several contributions: (1) introducing a cluster-wise contrastive learning algorithm that reduces label noise on unlabeled target data; (2) proposing a progressive domain adaptation strategy for transferring knowledge from the source to the target domain; (3) imposing Fourier constraints to maximize class separability; and (4) achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, outperforming prior methods by a significant margin.Overall, our approach facilitates the learning of discriminative feature representations and improves unsupervised re-ID performance in intelligent surveillance systems.
