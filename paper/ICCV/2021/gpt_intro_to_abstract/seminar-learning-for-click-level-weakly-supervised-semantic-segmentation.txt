Semantic segmentation is an important task in computer vision that involves labeling each pixel of an image into predefined classes. While deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved success in semantic segmentation tasks, they require large amounts of pixel-level annotations for training. Weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods have gained popularity as they only require coarse annotations. Among these methods, click-level supervision, which annotates only one pixel per object in an image, is particularly attractive due to its low cost. However, achieving satisfactory performance with limited supervision information is challenging. To compensate for this, prior information can be incorporated into the training process. This paper proposes a novel learning paradigm called seminar learning for click-level weakly supervised semantic segmentation. The seminar learning framework includes a teacher-student module and a student-student module, aiming to leverage the predictions of other networks to complement the deficiency of individual networks. The paper introduces several major contributions, including the novel concept of heterogeneous pseudo-labels as bridges between student networks, and conducts extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed seminar learning approach.
