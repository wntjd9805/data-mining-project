Smartphones with facial authentication features have made biometric systems increasingly common, resulting in the need for robust presentation attack detection (PAD) algorithms. While various biometric modalities are vulnerable to presentation attacks, the face modality poses unique challenges due to the easy availability of high-resolution face images and the relative ease of creating face presentation attacks (PA). This paper focuses exclusively on face PAD and explores the use of deep learning techniques for improved detection accuracy. However, the standard deep learning pipeline is limited by its inability to identify novel attack types not present in the training dataset. This paper proposes a novel approach that enables biometric recognition systems to detect and classify novel PAs on-the-fly during deployment. By continually screening input data representations and utilizing experience replay, the proposed algorithm can identify these novel attack types and update the model accordingly. The paper also introduces a new face anti-spoofing dataset to evaluate the algorithm in continual learning (CL) settings. The main contributions of this work include a new formulation of face PAD as a continual learning problem, an algorithm for identifying novel attack types, and a new dataset for evaluation.
