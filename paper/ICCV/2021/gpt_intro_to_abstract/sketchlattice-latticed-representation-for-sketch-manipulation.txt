In recent years, there has been a growing interest in research on freehand human sketches. Sketches are a natural medium for human-computer interaction and have a wide range of applications such as sketch recognition, sketch-based image retrieval, sketch-3D reconstruction, and sketch synthesis. However, designing an effective representation for sketches is challenging due to their abstract and iconic nature.Prior works have predominantly used pixelative formats to encode sketches, lacking the intuitive exploitation of structural information. RNN-based approaches have emerged to explore the sequential nature of sketches, but they rely on vector data and assume sequential stroke data, limiting their applicability to sketches drawn on paper. This paper proposes an alternative sketch representation called SketchLattice, inspired by lattice structures. SketchLattice is a set of points sampled from the original 2D sketch image using a lattice graph.The proposed latticed representation provides benefits for sketch abstraction modeling and downstream sketch generation tasks. It can be encoded using a graph convolutional network (GCN) with considerably fewer model parameters compared to existing techniques. Each point in SketchLattice is regarded as a graph node, and the geometric proximity between nodes guides the construction of the adjacency matrix.The proposed SketchLattice representation is effective for sketch generation, allowing the recovery of corrupted sketches using the Lattice-GCN-LSTM network. The abstraction level in the generated sketches is controllable by varying the density of points sampled by the lattice graph. The method is also applicable to image-to-sketch synthesis by dropping key points along the edge of a target object.The contributions of this paper are as follows: (1) proposing SketchLattice, a novel latticed representation for sketches using a lattice graph; (2) demonstrating the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed representation through a simple GCN-based feature extractor; (3) showing the controllability of the abstraction level in generated sketches; (4) applying the proposed latticed representation to image-to-sketch synthesis.This paper addresses the limitations of existing sketch representations and introduces a practical and effective alternative. The proposed SketchLattice representation allows for the modeling of structural cues in sketches and provides promising results in various sketch-related tasks.
