Humans have the ability to perceive and distinguish novel objects, even if they have never encountered them before. This open-world prediction ability is crucial for various real-world applications such as object search, human-object interaction modeling, and human activity understanding. However, current state-of-the-art methods in object detection and segmentation are designed for closed-world settings and struggle to accurately segment novel objects. Existing approaches, both supervised top-down and unsupervised bottom-up methods, are not effective in addressing the challenges of open-world object segmentation. Furthermore, current video understanding approaches are limited in their scalability and complexity of prediction tasks. To address these issues, this paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called Unidentified Video Objects (UVO) and presents a method for constructing open-world object segmentation datasets. The UVO benchmark aims to serve as a testbed for open-world object segmentation and inspire new research directions in more complex video understanding tasks. The paper provides a comprehensive set of baselines to evaluate and understand the proposed benchmark. Overall, this work highlights the importance of open-world object segmentation and presents a step forward in addressing this challenging problem.
