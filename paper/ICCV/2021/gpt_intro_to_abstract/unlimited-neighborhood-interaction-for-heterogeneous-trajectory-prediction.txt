This computer science paper introduces the challenges faced in accurately predicting trajectories due to complex interactions among agents. It explores recent advancements in graph-based and RNN-based methods, identifying their limitations in capturing multilateral relations and flexible interaction agent selection. To address these issues, the paper proposes the Unlimited Neighborhood on heterogeneous graph approach, which allows for unlimited interactions and considers agents from diverse categories. The proposed method includes a hierarchical attention module and an unlimited neighborhood interaction module to capture global information and interactions among agents. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing significant performance improvement over existing approaches. The paper concludes with a list of key contributions and mentions that the code will be made available upon acceptance.
