AbstractThe introduction is a crucial component of a computer science paper as it sets the stage for the research objectives, problem statement, and significance of the study. In this study, we examine the effectiveness of the answer format in producing accurate outputs, specifically focusing on the introduction section. The answer format is a method that solely provides the introduction without any further content. Through our investigation, we aim to assess the quality of output generated by the answer format, considering factors such as clarity, conciseness, and relevance to the research topic. By analyzing a sample set of computer science papers, we evaluate the extent to which the answer format adequately introduces the research and conveys its purpose. The findings from this study will contribute to a better understanding of the answer format's suitability for providing introductory content and its potential impact on the overall quality of computer science papers.
