Camera relocalisation is a fundamental problem in computer vision, where the goal is to estimate the camera pose of an unseen image based on prior knowledge about the surrounding environment. In this paper, we propose LaLaLoc, a method for localisation in previously unvisited environments with considerable scene dynamics. We achieve this by localising with respect to a known floor plan and the visible layout of a location within the scene. This floor plan-based localisation is well-suited for long-term localisation as structural elements like walls and floors remain static over time. Our approach does not require continual re-training or re-mapping, and it only needs the floor plan as prior information, eliminating the need for previous visitation of the target environment. LaLaLoc performs localisation in two stages - a coarse estimate of pose through cross-modal retrieval and a cross-modal direct optimisation of pose through differentiable rendering. We propose optimising for pose directly in the layout latent space, enabling accurate alignment of the floor plan to cluttered RGB panoramas without explicitly predicting layout. Our contributions include the introduction of LaLaLoc as a highly accurate and robust localisation method, the direct pose optimisation in the latent space, and experimental validation of the efficacy of layout-based localisation.
