Person re-identification (ReID) is a computer vision task that aims to identify a specific individual across different cameras by comparing appearance similarities. Supervised ReID methods use annotated labels to create robust appearance representations, while unsupervised methods train models on unlabeled data for better scalability. Most previous unsupervised ReID methods rely on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), which adjusts a model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. However, UDA methods heavily rely on the availability and quality of a large-scale labeled dataset. Fully unsupervised methods offer more flexibility as they do not require identity annotations and learn directly from unlabeled data in the target domain. Contrastive learning has emerged as an effective approach for unsupervised representation learning. However, existing contrastive methods treat each image instance as a separate class, which limits their performance in fine-grained ReID tasks where different images of the same person should be considered as the same class. Self-paced Contrastive Learning (SpCL) addresses this issue by matching instances to the centroid of their positive instances. While SpCL achieves impressive results, it overlooks inter-instance affinities, which can reduce intra-class variance and make clusters more compact. In supervised ReID, hard triplet loss is often used to focus on hard samples within a class, ensuring their proximity to normal samples. In this paper, we introduce Inter-instance Contrastive Encoding (ICE), which matches an instance with its hardest positive in a mini-batch to enhance cluster compactness and improve pseudo label quality. ICE combines class-level labeling, instance pairwise hard labeling, and instance pairwise soft labeling into a fully unsupervised person ReID framework. We address the limitations of using hard pseudo labels and propose the use of soft pseudo labels based on inter-instance pairwise similarity to enhance consistency before and after data augmentation. Our proposed ICE outperforms state-of-the-art UDA and fully unsupervised methods on popular person ReID datasets without any identity annotation. We contribute to the field by (1) proposing a pairwise similarity ranking approach to mine hardest samples as hard pseudo labels, reducing intra-class variance, (2) using pairwise similarity scores as soft pseudo labels to improve consistency between augmented and original instances, and (3) highlighting the importance of inter-instance pairwise similarity in contrastive learning. Our method significantly advances unsupervised ReID and enables its practical deployment in real-world scenarios.
