Person re-identification (re-ID) aims to identify individuals across non-overlapping camera networks. While fully supervised re-ID methods have made significant progress, they require extensive labeling efforts and are not easily applicable in practical scenarios. Unsupervised domain adaptive (UDA) re-ID, which focuses on transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, has emerged as an alternative approach. However, existing UDA re-ID methods have not explicitly considered the bridging between the two extreme domains, i.e., how information about the similarity/dissimilarity of the domains can be utilized to tackle UDA re-ID. In this paper, we propose a deep model that learns intermediate domains to bridge the source and target domains, making UDA re-ID more manageable. We argue that an appropriate "path" between the two domains exists, along which the source domain's knowledge can be smoothly transferred to guide learning in the target domain. Our novel approach involves using the intermediate domains to gradually adapt between the extreme domains. To model the characteristics of these intermediate domains, we introduce a plug-and-play intermediate domain module (IDM) which generates intermediate domain representations on-the-fly. The IDM module identifies appropriate intermediate domains based on their proximity to the source and target domains, as well as their diversity to maintain a balance and avoid overfitting. We enforce bridge losses on both the feature and prediction spaces of the intermediate domains, along with a diversity loss to maximize the standard deviation of the generated domain factors. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art UDA re-ID methods by a large margin on common datasets. In summary, our contributions include explicitly considering the utilization of intermediate domains as a bridge, proposing the IDM module, defining characteristics and properties of appropriate intermediate domains, and achieving superior performance in UDA re-ID tasks.
