The paper introduces the task of Online Temporal Action Localization (On-TAL) in the context of video understanding. While previous methods have focused on offline action localization, the growing demand for real-time and online video processing calls for the development of online approaches. The paper proposes the Context-Aware Actionness Grouping (CAG) framework, which incorporates context information and the model's decision history to improve online action localization. The framework is formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and trained using reinforcement learning. The paper also explores the use of imitation learning to determine the best reward scheme for the MDP. The proposed CAG model is evaluated on popular video datasets and outperforms other models in terms of online action localization and action start detection. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of the On-TAL task and the development of the CAG framework, which enables real-time and instance-level action localization in streaming videos for various practical applications.
