The paper introduces the RePOSE framework, a feature-based non-linear optimization method for 6D object pose refinement. The framework leverages a simple graphics renderer to directly render deep features and align them with the input image. By decoupling the shape and texture of the object, RePOSE achieves both robust alignment and fast computation. The deep feature representation is learned to enable efficient nonlinear optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that RePOSE outperforms CNN-based regression methods in terms of speed, data efficiency, and compatibility with challenging objects. Evaluation on multiple datasets shows state-of-the-art performance with significantly faster runtime. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in the RePOSE framework.
