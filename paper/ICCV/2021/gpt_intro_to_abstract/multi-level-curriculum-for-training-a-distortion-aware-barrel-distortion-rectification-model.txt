Rectifying distorted images is a crucial step in computer vision tasks, as geometric distortion alters the original scene distribution. Previous methods have used direct learning approaches that feed distorted images into networks and only supervise the final outputs. However, learning the complex nonlinear mapping function between different domains (from distortion to alignment) is challenging, and pixel-level supervision is insufficient for guiding the rectification of geometry distribution. Additionally, previous methods do not reason different construction levels of a distorted image, limiting their ability to learn distortion features. In this paper, we propose a progressive and meaningful approach to barrel distortion rectification inspired by curriculum learning. We construct a multi-level curriculum, similar to the human painting process, that progresses from structure to semantics to texture. We also introduce a distortion-aware pre-training strategy to facilitate the initial learning of the rectification model. Finally, we design a hierarchical rectification framework consisting of structure recovery, semantics embedding, and texture rendering modules to achieve progressive rectification. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our contributions include the proposal of a curriculum for training the rectification model, a distortion-aware pre-training strategy, and an effective hierarchical rectification framework.
