Recognizing rare categories presents a challenge in building models due to the difficulty in acquiring sufficient training examples. In this paper, we propose a strategy that combines active and semi-supervised learning techniques to interactively mine large amounts of unlabeled data. Unlike prior approaches, our goal is to build models for rare categories with only a few labeled positives and a majority of unlabeled data as background. We show that it is feasible to improve deep features with a limited amount of labeled data by leveraging active and semi-supervised learning. Our approach addresses challenges in training image classification models for rare categories and incorporates techniques such as pseudo-labeling, background splitting, and iterative feature learning. We demonstrate that our human-in-loop system provides significant improvements in accuracy per unit labeling effort, particularly on a tight labeling budget.
