Learning-based methods have made significant progress in raw image denoising. However, collecting a large-scale real raw image dataset is time-consuming and requires significant manpower. Therefore, most learning-based methods rely on synthetic datasets for training, where synthetic noise is applied to clean images to create noisy inputs. This reliance on synthetic data leads to a dependence on the accuracy of the synthetic noise in real-world scenarios.Existing methods for synthesizing raw image noise can be categorized into physics-based statistical methods and deep neural network (DNN)-based methods. DNN-based methods utilize deep generative networks to model noise distribution from real datasets. While these methods have powerful representation capabilities, they struggle with generating accurate pixel values for dense-prediction tasks, such as image generation.Physics-based statistical methods, on the other hand, follow the physical process of the camera sensor and model noise sources according to the process from photos to digital numbers. However, these methods also have limitations, such as the inability to accurately model all noise sources in the camera and the reliance on inaccurate distributions for noise sources.In this paper, we propose a new approach for synthesizing realistic image noise by sampling directly from the real noise distribution. We decompose the raw image noise into signal-dependent and signal-independent components. Signal-dependent noise, such as photon shot noise, is synthesized by sampling from a real Poisson distribution. Signal-independent noise is synthesized by directly sampling pixel values from a dark-frame database.To address limitations in the naive implementation of sampling pixel values from dark frames, we propose two techniques: pattern-aligned patch sampling to preserve spatial-correlated and pattern-correlated noise, and reconstruction of accurate continuous distributions to restore signal-independent noise to higher bits.We compare our method with DNN-based and statistical methods on SIDD and SID datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness and generalization. Our method outperforms existing methods on various camera sensors and lighting conditions.Furthermore, we find that the noise profiles of popular raw image datasets are inaccurate, leading to a misrepresentation of the performance of DNN-based methods. After calibrating the noise profile, we observe that statistical methods actually outperform DNN-based methods.In summary, our contributions include proposing an efficient and generic perspective for synthesizing noise in raw image denoising, introducing pattern-aligned patch sampling and high-bit reconstruction for realistic noise synthesis, conducting a systematic study of statistical and DNN-based methods for noise modeling, and demonstrating the superior performance and generalization of our method on raw image datasets.
