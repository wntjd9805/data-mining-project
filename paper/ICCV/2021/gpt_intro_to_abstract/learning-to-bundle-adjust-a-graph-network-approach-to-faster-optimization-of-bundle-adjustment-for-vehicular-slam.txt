The paper discusses the importance of improving the accuracy and robustness of 3D reconstruction in computer vision applications such as robotics, augmented reality, and related areas. The researchers focus on feature-point-based methods, which are currently the most widely used approach. However, these methods still have a high computational cost, with bundle adjustment (BA) being the most time-consuming step. BA optimizes the unknown parameters in 3D reconstruction and is a bottleneck in terms of the speed of visual SLAM and SfM systems. The speed of local BA also determines the robustness of SLAM systems, as it affects the ability to track landmarks and create new keyframes. To address this issue, the paper proposes a learning-based method that uses graph networks to perform BA more quickly. The method is trained on a set of input-output pairs and aims to compute optimal parameter values in a shorter time. The researchers conducted experiments using monocular SLAM on the KITTI dataset and achieved slightly lower accuracy with significantly reduced computational time compared to the original BA method.
