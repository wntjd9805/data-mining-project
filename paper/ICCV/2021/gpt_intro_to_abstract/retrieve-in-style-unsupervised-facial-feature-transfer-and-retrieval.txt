Recent advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown promising results in generating realistic high-resolution images, particularly for faces. However, controlling and interpreting the outputs of GANs under unconditional settings can be challenging. Conditional GANs offer more control over the output images but require detailed annotations, which are often difficult to obtain, especially for fine-grained face editing.Existing methods for face editing typically rely on additional information such as manual labels, segmentation masks, attribute classifiers, and rendering models. However, these approaches require extra computation and may not always be available in practical scenarios. Furthermore, describing fine-grained facial features as labels or features is challenging.Unsupervised discovery of latent directions in a pretrained GAN provides an alternative approach to finding meaningful latent representations. However, these unsupervised approaches are less effective for fine-grained editing compared to supervised methods.In this paper, we propose Retrieve in Style (RIS), an unsupervised framework that addresses both fine-grained facial feature transfer and retrieval. RIS improves upon the Editing in Style (EIS) method by discovering the "submembership" property in the style space, allowing for more precise face editing of both spatially coherent (e.g., eyes, nose, mouth) and challenging facial features (e.g., hair, pose). We also show that RIS eliminates the need for per-image semantic catalogs and hyperparameter tuning, achieving better scalability.Additionally, RIS enables fine-grained facial feature retrieval by obtaining feature-specific representations, including eyes, nose, mouth, and hair, without the need for supervision. This is the first work to address the fine-grained retrieval problem without supervision.Furthermore, RIS can be combined with GAN inversion methods to enable editing and retrieval on real images, a capability not demonstrated in earlier studies. We validate the effectiveness of RIS on the CelebA-HQ dataset, showcasing its high-quality retrieval performance on large, real-world datasets.In summary, this paper introduces the RIS framework for fine-grained facial feature transfer and retrieval. The proposed method provides better controllability over facial features, enables retrieval based on fine-grained features, and extends to real image manipulation when combined with GAN inversion methods.
