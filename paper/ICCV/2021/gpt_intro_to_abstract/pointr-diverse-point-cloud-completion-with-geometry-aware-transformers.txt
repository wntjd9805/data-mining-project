Recent advancements in 3D sensors have led to increased research in 3D computer vision. Point clouds, a commonly used 3D data format, offer a memory-efficient way to store detailed 3D shape information. However, point cloud data from existing sensors often suffer from incompleteness due to various factors such as self-occlusion and limited sensor resolution. Recovering complete point clouds from partial and sparse raw data has become a crucial task with growing importance.Previous approaches to point cloud completion have utilized techniques from 2D completion tasks, such as voxelization and 3D convolutions. However, these methods encounter heavy computational costs as the spatial resolution increases. Point cloud completion tasks have also been tackled using encoder-decoder based architectures, but these suffer from the loss of fine-grained information during the max-pooling operation.In this paper, we propose a novel approach called PoinTr that leverages Transformers, a successful architecture in Natural Language Processing, to learn structural information and long-range correlations for point cloud completion. PoinTr consists of an encoder-decoder architecture that converts the completion task into a set-to-set translation problem. Transformers model pairwise interactions and global correlations to reason about missing elements in the point cloud. We also introduce a geometry-aware block and dynamic queries generated by a query generation module to enhance the model's ability to capture 3D geometric structures and represent initial sketches of missing points. Additionally, we devise a multi-scale point cloud generation module for coarse-to-fine recovery of missing information.Furthermore, we argue that existing benchmarks for point cloud completion are not representative enough of real-world scenarios. Therefore, we propose two more challenging benchmarks with diverse tasks, object categories, viewpoints, and levels of incompleteness. We evaluate our method on these new benchmarks, as well as the widely used PCN dataset and KITTI benchmark, and demonstrate that PoinTr outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.Overall, this paper presents PoinTr as an effective approach for point cloud completion, utilizing Transformers to learn structural information and improving upon existing benchmarks to better reflect real-world scenarios.
