Person search has become an important task in computer vision due to the increasing demand for person re-identification in real world images. While conventional methods focus on matching cropped person images to a query person, person search methods aim to find target persons directly from scene images where multiple persons may appear. This has potential applications in visual surveillance systems and augmented reality. Person search is an integrated task of person detection and re-identification, and existing methods can be classified into end-to-end and two-step frameworks. End-to-end methods train networks to minimize both detection and re-identification losses simultaneously, while two-step methods train detection and re-identification networks independently. However, coordinating these two objectives is a challenge in person search. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end person search network and an adaptive training algorithm to address the task-consistency between detection and re-identification. We introduce an adaptive gradient weighting function (AGWF) that controls the flow of gradients through the re-identification network based on the quality of detection results. Additionally, we employ a part classification network to refine features of local regions in person proposals. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art person search methods on benchmark datasets.
