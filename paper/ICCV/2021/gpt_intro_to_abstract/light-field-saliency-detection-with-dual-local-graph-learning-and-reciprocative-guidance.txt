Salient object detection (SOD) methods have been categorized into RGB, RGB-D, and light field based methods. While RGB SOD methods have achieved good performance on benchmark datasets, they struggle with complex and challenging scenes. RGB-D SOD methods incorporate depth information to provide supplementary cues, but obtaining high-quality depth maps can be difficult. Light field SOD methods show potential in addressing these challenges, as they include focal stack images that provide context information. However, effectively fusing multiple focal stack features and incorporating them with the all-focus information remains a challenge. Existing fusion methods are limited in their ability to explore complex relationships and fail to fully leverage the supplementary information. To address these issues, we propose a dual local graph (DLG) network, which efficiently aggregates context within focal stack features using graph neural networks (GNNs), while avoiding high computational costs. We build local graphs within focal slices and introduce multiscale local neighbors to incorporate larger context information. Additionally, we construct a focal-all graph to fuse focal features with all-focus features, resulting in the DLG network.To address the second key point in light field SOD, we propose a reciprocative guidance architecture that facilitates multi-step guidance between the all-focus and focal stack features. This reciprocal process allows for mutual guidance, improving the features' discriminability and enhancing the final SOD decision.Our contributions include the introduction of the DLG network for effective context propagation in focal stack features under the guidance of all-focus features, while also reducing computational costs. We also propose a reciprocative guidance scheme to improve saliency detection performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, outperforming other light field methods and achieving competitive or better performance with less training data compared to RGB-D or RGB based SOD models.
