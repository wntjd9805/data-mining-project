The paper introduces the problem of reflection symmetry detection in images and highlights the challenges associated with this task. It discusses the potential of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for learning symmetry detection but points out the limitations of conventional CNNs in handling reflection symmetry due to the need for recognizing matching pairs of local regions. The paper proposes a new convolutional technique called polar matching convolution (PMC) which leverages polar feature pooling, self-similarity encoding, and a systematic kernel design to effectively compare corresponding features in reflection. The PMCNet, trained on a newly introduced symmetry detection dataset, outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness, as demonstrated through experimental evaluation. The paper showcases the potential of learning-based approaches for reflection symmetry detection and presents a novel methodology for tackling this challenging problem.
