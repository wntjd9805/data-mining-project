Image super-resolution (SR) is a challenging task in computer vision, aiming to generate a high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) input image. This problem is ill-posed due to the lack of information in LR images compared to HR images. Traditional super-resolution approaches and deep learning-based methods often suffer from visual artifacts when dealing with large up-scaling factors. To address this limitation, reference image super-resolution (RefSR) has been introduced as a sub-problem in recent research.RefSR utilizes a single HR reference image to estimate a SR image, which has been shown to improve performance and reduce visual artifacts compared to general SR methods. In this paper, we extend RefSR to use multiple HR reference images, allowing for a pool of image features. We propose an attention-based sampling approach to learn the perceptual similarity between these reference features and the LR input. Our proposed method, called attention-based multiple-reference super-resolution network (AMRSR), incorporates a hierarchical attention-based mapping of LR input feature subvectors into HR reference feature vectors. This allows for training with multiple HR reference images without a significant increase in memory usage.We qualitatively demonstrate the superiority of AMRSR compared to state-of-the-art single-image super-resolution (CSNLN, RSR-GAN) and RefSR (SRNTT) approaches. AMRSR produces perceptually plausible SR images with a similar level of detail to the ground truth HR images. The key contributions of our approach include the generalization of single reference super-resolution to multiple reference images with improved memory efficiency, hierarchical attention-based adaptive sampling for perceptual similarity learning, and improved quantitative and perceptual performance compared to existing RefSR methods.We apply AMRSR to both image and 3D model texture map super-resolution, where multiple HR reference images are available. Our method is evaluated on benchmark datasets and demonstrates significant performance improvements. Additionally, we introduce three new multiple reference SR datasets for benchmarking future SR approaches. The AMRSR approach presented in this paper has broad implications for various image super-resolution tasks and provides a promising direction for future research in the field.
