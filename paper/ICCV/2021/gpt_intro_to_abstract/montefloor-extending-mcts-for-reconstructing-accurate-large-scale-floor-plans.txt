Scene understanding from images is a crucial topic in computer vision, with applications in robotics and augmented reality. In this paper, we focus on creating a structured floor plan representation of indoor environments. We specifically address the challenge of estimating a floor plan from unstructured 3D point clouds generated by RGB-D cameras. Previous approaches have used density maps and graph-based solutions, but they still struggle with representing rooms as vector drawings with minimal edges. We propose a method called MonteFloor, which utilizes the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to select the correct room proposals for the floor plan. Unlike previous approaches, we jointly select and adjust the room proposals based on a learned scoring function. Our method relies on an objective function that combines a deep network's metric score with regularization terms to ensure the proposals are in contact without overlapping. We introduce a refinement step to optimize the shapes of the selected room proposals using a novel differentiable method for 2D polygons.Our approach is not limited to floor plan estimation and can be applied to other scene understanding problems. We evaluate the performance of our method on the Structured3D dataset and compare it with the state-of-the-art method, Floor-SP. We demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy and time complexity, even without imposing hard constraints or assumptions on the floor plan configurations. Our method shows promise for addressing the challenges in scene understanding and can inspire future research in adapting to different target objects.
