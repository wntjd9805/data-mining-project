Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in capturing complex data distributions. However, they suffer from issues such as mode collapse, unstructured latent space, and the inability to compute likelihoods. In this paper, we propose a new approach called the Mixture of Infinite Conditional GANs (MIC-GANs) to address these limitations. MIC-GANs leverage the mode collapse property of GANs to capture multiple modes in the data distribution by using multiple GANs. We also introduce a latent space that is structured according to the data space, allowing each GAN to map one latent mode to one data mode. To model the distribution of GANs, we employ a Bayesian treatment with non-parametric priors on GAN parameters. We propose a hybrid inference scheme, the Adversarial Chinese Restaurant Process, to train MIC-GANs. Our approach is unsupervised and non-parametric, automatically learning the latent modes and enabling controlled image generation and exploration of the latent space. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of MIC-GANs in data clustering and generation.
