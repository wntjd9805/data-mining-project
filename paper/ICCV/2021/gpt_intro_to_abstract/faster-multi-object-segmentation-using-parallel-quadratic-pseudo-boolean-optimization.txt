Computational parallelism is crucial for the performance of image segmentation algorithms, including deep learning. While matrix operations in deep learning can be efficiently parallelized, not all computer vision algorithms rely on this parallelization. Graph cut algorithms, known for their speed and optimality, are widely used in binary optimization problems in image analysis. However, not all graph cut algorithms have been parallelized, limiting their ability to leverage modern hardware. One such algorithm is the Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) algorithm, which is particularly useful for instance segmentation. In this paper, we propose the first parallel QPBO (P-QPBO) algorithm, designed to efficiently utilize modern multi-core processors. Our algorithm provides significantly faster results compared to previous serial methods, enabling the segmentation of large volumetric datasets within minutes. While our work focuses on image segmentation, P-QPBO can be applied to any QPBO problem. The formulation of energy functions for specific computer vision tasks is not covered in this paper.
