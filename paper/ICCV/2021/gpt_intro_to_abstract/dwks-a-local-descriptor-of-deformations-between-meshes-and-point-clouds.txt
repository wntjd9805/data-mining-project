Shape matching is a crucial task in 3D computer vision, with applications in texture and deformation transfer. While various methods have been developed to compute correspondences between surfaces, challenges still remain when dealing with symmetries and non-isometric shapes. Existing methods require precise shape descriptors, manual selection of symmetric and non-symmetric maps, and large datasets for neural network training. The problem of non-rigid shape matching, especially in partial scenarios, has also been addressed through different approaches. However, very few methods have leveraged the commonality of deformations within collections to facilitate matching across them. In this work, we propose a local descriptor of surface and point cloud differences inspired by spectral point-based descriptors extracted from the Laplace-Beltrami operator. Our method, called DWKS, combines local descriptors with shape difference operators, allowing for accurate and efficient matching across shapes represented as meshes and point clouds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DWKS in difficult matching scenarios with partiality and symmetry ambiguity, without relying on landmarks or neural network training. Our contributions include the introduction of a novel pointwise descriptor that reflects deformation within a collection, the extension of spectral methods beyond the Laplacian to shape difference operators, and the demonstration of the benefits of our descriptor in challenging matching scenarios.
