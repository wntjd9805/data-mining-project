Deep convolutional networks have been successful in semantic segmentation tasks. However, most perception systems based on these networks are close-set and static, which can lead to inaccuracies and limited applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an open world semantic segmentation system that is both open-set and dynamic. This system consists of two modules: an open-set semantic segmentation module to detect out-of-distribution objects and assign correct labels, and an incremental few-shot learning module to progressively incorporate unknown objects into the knowledge base. Both open-set semantic segmentation and incremental few-shot learning pose unique challenges that have not been fully addressed. In this paper, we propose the use of DMLNet, a contrastive clustering-based network, to solve the open world semantic segmentation problem. We develop criteria for unknown identification in the open-set module and methods for incremental few-shot learning. Our experiments show that both modules are effective and lightweight. Our contributions include introducing the open world semantic segmentation system, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the open-set semantic segmentation module, alleviating the catastrophic forgetting problem in the few-shot learning module, and fulfilling an open world semantic segmentation system by combining both modules.
