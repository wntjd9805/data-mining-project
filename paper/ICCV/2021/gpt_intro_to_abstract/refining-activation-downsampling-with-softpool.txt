Pooling layers play a crucial role in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by reducing the size of activation maps and enhancing spatial invariance. While maximum and average pooling are commonly used, they have limitations in retaining important information. In this paper, we propose SoftPool, a kernel-based pooling method that employs softmax weighted sum of activations. SoftPool effectively preserves descriptive features while being computationally and memory-efficient. Experimental results demonstrate that SoftPool outperforms other pooling methods in terms of feature preservation and leads to improved classification performance in image and video tasks. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of SoftPool as a novel pooling method, showcasing its superiority over other pooling methods, and demonstrating its effectiveness through extensive evaluation in classification tasks. The subsequent sections detail related work, describe SoftPool, and present experimental results.
