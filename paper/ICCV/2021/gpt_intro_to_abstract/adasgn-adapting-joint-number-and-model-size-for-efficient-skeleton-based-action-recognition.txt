Action recognition is an important research area in computer science with various applications in human-computer interaction and video surveillance. While conventional approaches use RGB sequences for input, there has been increasing attention on exploiting skeleton data for action recognition. Skeleton data consists of the 2D/3D positions of the human key joints and can provide higher-level semantic information and stronger robustness in complex environments compared to RGB data. Early approaches for skeleton-based action recognition focused on designing hand-crafted features, but with the success of deep learning, various deep networks have been proposed for this task. However, the computational complexity of these deep networks is often too heavy, affecting their practical application in terms of speed. Some recent works have proposed light-weight models to speed up skeleton modeling, but they often overlook the amount of data involved in calculations. Additionally, they do not consider the fact that not all joints in a skeleton sequence are informative for recognizing a specific action. Furthermore, the difficulty of action recognition varies across different actions, suggesting that using a fixed-sized model for all samples is inefficient. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel approach called adaptive SGN (AdaSGN) for efficient skeleton-based action recognition. AdaSGN significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high performance by adapting the optimal joint number and model size based on a learned policy network. The policy network is lightweight and outputs policies for each skeleton sample on-the-fly. The proposed method is fully differentiable and can be trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on popular datasets demonstrate the superiority of AdaSGN over state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The contributions of this paper include the proposal of an adaptive approach for efficient skeleton modeling, the design of a lightweight policy network trained with the ST Gumbel Estimator, and extensive experiments demonstrating the superiority of the proposed approach.
