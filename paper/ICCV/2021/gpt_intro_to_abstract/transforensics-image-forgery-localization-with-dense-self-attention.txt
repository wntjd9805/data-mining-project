Image tampering has become a widespread issue, with tampered images being used for various fraudulent activities. Detecting tampered regions in digital images is a challenge, especially when dealing with multiple types of forgery. Previous methods have relied on hand-crafted features or deep learning approaches, but they often have limitations in terms of accuracy and flexibility. In this paper, we propose a novel method called TransForensics, which models pairwise relations between patches in an image using a self-attention mechanism, while preserving the spatial structure. We also introduce a dense correction architecture to improve the performance of our network. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work, Section 3 presents the proposed method in detail, Section 4 discusses the experimental datasets and results, and finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.
