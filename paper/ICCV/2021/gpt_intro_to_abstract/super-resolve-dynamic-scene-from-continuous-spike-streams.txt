In this paper, we address the limitations of conventional digital cameras in capturing dynamic scenes with high-speed motion. We introduce a novel neuromorphic camera called the spike camera, which records dynamic scenes by continuously monitoring incoming light and firing continuous spike streams at high temporal resolution. Unlike conventional cameras that capture a visual scene in a snapshot, the spike camera abandons the concept of exposure window and provides more explicit information for recovering the absolute intensity. However, recovering high-quality images from binary spike streams remains a challenging issue. Previous methods focus on suppressing noise and blurry artifacts but ignore the issue of low resolution. To address this, we propose a novel image reconstruction framework that combines spike camera reconstruction methods with image super-resolution algorithms to generate high-quality intensity images from continuous spike streams. We carefully analyze the working mechanism of the spike camera and formulate the relationship between image intensity and each spike to derive super-resolved intensity from the spike streams. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can reconstruct pleasant high-resolution intensity images with fine details that cannot be achieved using state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our work presents a novel approach to super-resolving low-resolution spike streams to high-resolution intensity images, contributing to the development of real-time computer vision applications.
