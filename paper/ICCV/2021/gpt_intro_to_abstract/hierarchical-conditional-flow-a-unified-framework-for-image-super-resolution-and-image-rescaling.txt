In this paper, the authors introduce hierarchical conditional flow (HCFlow), a unified framework for both image super-resolution (SR) and image rescaling. They compare their approach with two existing models, SRFlow and IRN, highlighting the limitations of each. HCFlow is an invertible flow-based model that learns the high-frequency component of an image in a hierarchical manner, conditioned on the low-frequency component. The authors propose the use of additional losses, including pixel, perceptual, and GAN losses, to improve the visual quality of the generated high-resolution (HR) images. HCFlow is trained using negative log-likelihood loss and achieves state-of-the-art results in both quantitative metrics and visual quality on general image SR, face image SR, and image rescaling tasks.
