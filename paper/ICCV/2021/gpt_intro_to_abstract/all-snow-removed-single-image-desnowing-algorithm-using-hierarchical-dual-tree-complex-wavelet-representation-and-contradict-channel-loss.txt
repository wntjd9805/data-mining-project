This paper introduces a novel snow removal architecture for computer vision applications. The proposed architecture utilizes the hierarchical dual-tree complex wavelet transform to decompose and recover snow images at different scales. This approach allows for the removal of snow particles of varying shapes and sizes, including snow streaks. The authors also introduce a new feature called the contradict channel, which is used to improve the performance of snow removal. Additionally, the paper presents a new large-scale snow dataset called the Comprehensive Snow Dataset (CSD) to address limitations in existing datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques in snow removal.
