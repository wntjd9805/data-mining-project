Optical flow estimation is a crucial task in computer vision with various applications. Traditional methods rely on minimizing predefined energy functions, while deep learning-based methods use convolutional neural networks. However, these methods may struggle with poor texture or inconsistent illumination conditions. In contrast, gyroscopes provide reliable background camera motion independent of image contents. In this paper, we propose GyroFlow, a gyroscope-guided unsupervised optical flow estimation method. We combine image-based optical flow with gyroscopes to improve performance in challenging scenes. We convert gyroscope readings into motion fields and use an unsupervised learning framework with a proposed Self-Guided Fusion module to incorporate the gyro fields during image-based flow calculation. We validate our method with a dataset that includes scenes under different conditions. Our contributions include proposing the first DNN-based framework that fuses gyroscope data into optical flow learning, a self-guided fusion module, and an evaluation dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to existing ones.
