Abstract:Multi-label image recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision that involves assigning multiple labels to multiple objects within an image. This task has various applications, including weakly supervised localization and segmentation, attribute recognition, scene understanding, and recommendation systems. While deep learning techniques have made significant progress in distinguishing multiple objects, accurately parsing multi-label images still faces challenges, such as object scale variations, inconsistent visual appearances, and confused inter-class relationships. This paper proposes a novel Transformer-based Dual Relation learning framework for multi-label image recognition. The framework incorporates both structural and semantic information using Transformer architectures. Specifically, a transformer-based structural relation graph is constructed to capture long-term contextual information and spatial relationships, while a semantic relation graph is constructed with explicit class-specific constraints and structure-aware embedding to model dynamic class-wise dependencies. Experimental results on popular benchmarks, MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in multi-label image recognition tasks.
