This paper introduces a novel approach for panoptic segmentation of agricultural parcels from time series of satellite images. The precision of Earth observations has greatly improved due to advancements in space-based remote sensing, such as the launch of the Planet and Sentinel constellations. Crop mapping, which relies on exploiting temporal patterns, is of great importance for fair distribution of agricultural subsidies and ensuring best crop rotation practices are followed. The task of monitoring agricultural parcels can be framed as panoptic segmentation, assigning each pixel a class and a unique instance label. However, panoptic segmentation for satellite image time series is fundamentally different from natural image or video sequences. This paper presents U-TAE, a spatio-temporal encoder combining multi-scale spatial convolutions and temporal self-attention, and Parcels-as-Points (PaPs), an end-to-end deep learning method for panoptic segmentation. The authors also introduce the Panoptic Agricultural Satellite Time-Series (PASTIS) dataset, the first open-access dataset for training and evaluating panoptic segmentation models on satellite image time series. The proposed approach outperforms existing methods for semantic segmentation and establishes the state-of-the-art in panoptic segmentation of satellite image time series.
