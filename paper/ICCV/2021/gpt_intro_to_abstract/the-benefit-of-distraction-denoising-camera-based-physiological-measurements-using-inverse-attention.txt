Attention mechanisms have been successfully used in various machine learning and computer vision applications, such as object detection, activity recognition, language tasks, machine translation, and camera-based physiological measurement. Attention networks are effective because they can identify pixels that are likely to contain significant signals of interest, helping to handle diverse variations in a video. However, the temporal changes of hair and skin pixel intensities in a video are often correlated, which can corrupt physiological signals recorded from the skin. In this paper, we investigate whether there is important information in the regions ignored by attention models and if we can exploit this information to improve the quality of estimation for the foreground signals of interest. We focus on camera-based physiological measurement as an application to illustrate the denoising capability of our method. Our motivation stems from the need for advanced healthcare technologies, such as camera-based vital signs measurement, which could replace contact devices or enhance telemedicine capabilities. We utilize the inverse attention mask to select the background regions and learn an estimate of the corruptions present in a video. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in denoising physiological signals and show superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our method generalizes well to different imaging modalities and produces cleaner and more accurate waveforms, opening up possibilities for important health metric determination. Our approach has potential for various vision tasks involving attention networks and temporal predictions. The contributions of this paper include proposing the use of inverse attention masks for estimating corruptions in signals of interest, presenting a novel method for denoising camera-based physiological measurements, and providing comprehensive evaluation on multiple datasets.
