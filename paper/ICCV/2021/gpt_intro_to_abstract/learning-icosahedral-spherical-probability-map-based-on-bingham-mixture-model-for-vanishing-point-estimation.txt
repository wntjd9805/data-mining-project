Vanishing point (VP) estimation in computer vision has various applications such as scene understanding, camera orientation estimation, and 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches for VP estimation have limitations in terms of sensitivity to the number and quality of pre-extracted image lines, as well as reliance on prior knowledge of the number of VPs. In this paper, we propose a novel VP estimation method that is independent of image lines and can automatically determine the number of VPs. Our method formulates VP estimation as dominant direction (DD) computation, where the connection between a VP and camera center is aligned to a unit DD on a unit sphere. We present a network that predicts a spherical probability map of DD based on a perspective image, allowing us to detect all the DDs regardless of the actual number. Our method achieves reliability through the use of an icosahedral spherical representation for the probability map, a loss function that enforces antipodal symmetry and sparsity, and the fitting of a Bingham mixture model for DD detection. The main contributions of this work are the independence of image lines in VP estimation, the utilization of the icosahedral spherical representation, the designed loss function for regularization, the strategy for generating the ground truth probability map, and the threshold-free DD detection with confidence level estimation.
