This paper introduces LSD-Figure 1, a method for generative modeling of hierarchically structured 3D objects in Computer-Aided Design (CAD). Existing models only model hierarchies holistically, making them unsuitable for CAD tasks that involve making decisions at multiple levels of detail. LSD-Figure 1 addresses this issue by modeling each structural level of detail with its own generative process. This allows for the generation of variants on any sub-tree of the output hierarchy without modifying the remainder of the hierarchy. The proposed method, LSD-StructureNet, learns one latent space for each depth of the output hierarchy and generates elements by sampling from the corresponding latent space and decoding conditionally on the element's parent. This enables the regeneration of multiple varying sub-hierarchies without affecting the rest of the structure. The paper demonstrates that LSD-StructureNet produces realistic and diverse outputs, overcoming the challenge of limited datasets for hierarchically structured objects. Additionally, LSD-StructureNet can generate variations on its outputs that differ beyond a certain level of structural detail, and these outputs are superior to the closest approximations from existing models and can be obtained more quickly.
