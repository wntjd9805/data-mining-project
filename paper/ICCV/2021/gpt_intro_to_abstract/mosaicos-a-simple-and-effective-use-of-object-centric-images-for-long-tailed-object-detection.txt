Detecting objects in complex daily scenes has made significant progress in recent years with the advancement of deep neural networks and large-scale datasets. However, detecting rare objects remains challenging due to the inherent limitation of training data. In this paper, we propose a framework called MOSAICOS that leverages object-centric images to improve long-tailed object detection. MOSAICOS constructs pseudo scene-centric images from object-centric images using mosaic and imputes bounding box annotations using image class labels. Our framework addresses the domain gap between object-centric and scene-centric images and handles missing detection annotations. Experimental results on the LVIS dataset show that our approach significantly improves object detection and instance segmentation accuracy for both rare and common objects without sacrificing accuracy on frequent classes. Our contributions include the integration of object-centric images into long-tailed object detection, algorithms for mosaicking and pseudo-labeling, a multi-stage training framework, and an extensive evaluation on the LVIS benchmark.
