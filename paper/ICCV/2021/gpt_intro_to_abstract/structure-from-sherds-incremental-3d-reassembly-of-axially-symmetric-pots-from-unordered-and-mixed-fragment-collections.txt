Ceramic pots, as fundamental cultural relics, often need to be reassembled from broken pieces (sherds) to recover historical records. The current manual reassembly process is time-consuming and prone to errors, motivating the need for an efficient framework. Previous studies proposed global approaches using features, matching, and optimization, but they are sensitive to false positive matches. In this paper, we propose an incremental method called structure-from-sherds (SfS) for reassembling axially symmetric pots. We draw inspiration from structure-from-motion (SfM) and utilize an incremental registration scheme. Our method addresses challenges such as mitigating incorrect sherd registration and enabling reassembly of multiple pot models. We make several technical contributions, including a new pot reassembly pipeline, a new geometric descriptor, algorithms for reducing false matches, and a challenging dataset for evaluation. Although our implementation has some limitations, we believe this work can serve as a basis for further improvements.
