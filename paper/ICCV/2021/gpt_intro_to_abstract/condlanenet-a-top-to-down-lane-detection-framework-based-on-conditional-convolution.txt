Artificial intelligence technology is being increasingly utilized in the driving field, particularly in autonomous driving and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). Lane detection is a fundamental problem in autonomous driving and plays a crucial role in tasks such as real-time vehicle positioning, driving route planning, lane-keeping assist, and adaptive cruise control. Traditional lane detection methods rely on hand-crafted feature extraction and post-processing techniques, but they often fail to maintain robustness in real-life scenarios due to the inability to handle the diversity of lane lines in different situations. Recent studies have focused on deep learning-based approaches for lane detection, but there are still challenges to be addressed.One common challenge is instance-level discrimination, where different points need to be assigned to different lane instances. Many existing methods predict lane points first and then aggregate them into lines, but assigning points to different instances remains a challenge. Some methods label the lane lines into a fixed number of classes, limiting the ability to detect an arbitrary number of lanes. Post-clustering and anchor-based methods have been explored to overcome this limitation, but they struggle with cases like dense or fork lines. Another challenge is the detection of lane lines with complex topologies, such as fork lines and dense lines, which are common in driving scenarios but have received limited attention in real-time driving scenarios.To address these challenges, we propose CondLaneNet, a novel lane detection framework. Inspired by conditional instance segmentation strategies, we introduce a conditional lane detection strategy that focuses on specifying the lane line shape. Additionally, we design the Recurrent Instance Module (RIM) to handle the detection of lane lines with complex topologies. Our framework achieves real-time efficiency and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, the small version of our CondLaneNet maintains high accuracy while ensuring high efficiency. Overall, our work significantly improves lane instance-level discrimination, addresses the detection of lane lines with complex topologies, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in lane detection.
