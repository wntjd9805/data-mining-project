Crowd counting is an essential task in crowd analysis, but simply providing a single number does not meet the demands of higher-level crowd analysis tasks. Existing methods for crowd counting face challenges in accurately locating individuals due to limitations in head detection, inaccurate pseudo bounding box generation, and difficulty in suppressing or splitting over-close instance candidates. To address these issues, this paper proposes a point-based framework for joint counting and localization of individuals in crowds. The framework uses point annotations as learning targets and outputs points to represent the locations of individuals. A new evaluation metric called density Normalized Average Precision (nAP) is introduced to comprehensively evaluate both localization and counting errors. Additionally, a Point-to-Point Network (P2PNet) is developed to predict point proposals with the coordinates of heads and their confidences. The paper demonstrates that performing one-to-one matching using the Hungarian algorithm improves the nAP metric and achieves state-of-the-art counting accuracy and promising localization performance. The contributions of this work include the proposed point-based framework, the nAP evaluation metric, and the P2PNet method.
