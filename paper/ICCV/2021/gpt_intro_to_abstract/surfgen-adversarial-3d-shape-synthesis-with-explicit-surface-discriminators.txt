Shape generation is a fundamental aspect of computer graphics and computer vision, with applications in various fields such as architecture, visual effects, and robotics. While there has been progress in building generative models of 3D shapes using large scale datasets, most existing methods rely on representations that are easily processed by neural networks, such as voxel grids or point clouds. However, these representations do not capture the fine-grained details and surface characteristics of shapes, limiting their realism.In this paper, we address the challenge of training neural networks on the surfaces of 3D objects, which are inherently irregular and discrete. We propose a novel approach that transforms object surfaces into spherical maps, which are discrete representations defined on the surface of a sphere. By utilizing a differentiable function, we can compute the distances and surface occupancy along rays from the spherical map. This representation captures the geometric properties of the shape and allows for efficient processing using spherical convolution layers.To train our model, we introduce SurfGen, an end-to-end differentiable 3D shape synthesis framework. SurfGen utilizes an adversarial objective on the zero isosurface of an implicit shape function, ensuring that the generated shapes are highly realistic. We demonstrate that our model can synthesize shapes with diverse topology and resolution, resulting in high-quality and visually appealing outputs.Our contributions in this paper are three-fold. Firstly, we introduce a differentiable spherical projection operator that can transform explicit triangle meshes into spherical maps. Secondly, we propose SurfGen as an end-to-end generative model for 3D shape synthesis, which applies adversarial training on the zero isosurface. Lastly, we showcase the effectiveness of our model by generating realistic and diverse shapes.Overall, our approach offers a new perspective on shape generation by focusing on the surface geometry using spherical maps. The ability to generate high-quality shapes with arbitrary topology and resolution opens up new possibilities in virtual environments, computer graphics, and robotics.
