Document images captured on mobile devices often have artifacts due to various factors such as the physical shape of the paper, camera pose, and complex lighting conditions. These artifacts make mobile captured documents unsuitable for digitization compared to images captured with high fidelity using flatbed scanners. To enhance the image quality for OCR and other downstream tasks, document unwarping techniques are used to reduce the visible distortion between a captured document image and its flatbed-scanned version. However, unwarping document images in real-world, challenging conditions is a long-standing research problem in the field of document analysis. Most existing solutions estimate the deformed 3D shape of the document and then unwarp the image to make it planar. While there is a significant body of work on 3D shape-based unwarping, they often rely on specific hardware or lack accuracy and robustness.In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable piece-wise unwarping approach for document images. Our approach leverages both local and global information to improve document unwarping. We argue that learning local and global deformations separately and learning appropriate patch stitching can better utilize local shape deformations. Our approach consists of three trainable modules: a shape network (SNet) to estimate the 3D shape of the paper, a piece-wise unwarping network (PUNet) to regress local unwarping maps, and a global stitching network (GSNet) to produce a global unwarping map for the entire image. These networks are trained end-to-end with losses on local and global unwarping map regression and final unwarped image reconstruction.The main contributions of our paper are: 1. A novel end-to-end trainable framework that estimates document unwarping in a piece-wise manner, focusing on unwarping local deformations.2. A fully differentiable stitching network that generates artifact-free unwarped images by taking per-patch unwarping maps as input and producing a global unwarping map.3. Significant improvement in local unwarping quality with our proposed piece-wise approach, surpassing the prior state-of-the-art in terms of image similarity metric (MS-SSIM) and demonstrating more stable performance in OCR error metrics.Overall, our approach addresses the challenges of document unwarping in-the-wild and achieves superior results compared to existing methods, especially in terms of local unwarping quality and artifact-free image reconstruction.
