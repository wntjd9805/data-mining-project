Rotation averaging, also known as group synchronization, is a challenging estimation problem in computer vision that involves finding a set of rotations that optimally explains a set of noisy pairwise measurements of relative orientations. This problem is particularly relevant in various 3D reconstruction tasks. However, the high-dimensionality and non-convexity of the problem make it difficult to solve. In this paper, we address the rotation averaging problem under the hypothesis of the Langevin noise model. We propose a primal-dual method inspired by optimization algorithms with orthogonality constraints, which empirically converges to the global optimum. Additionally, we present the first optimal closed-form solution for rotation averaging problems with a cycle graph topology, which enables retrieval of machine-precision global optima significantly faster than the state-of-the-art methods.
