Abstract:Face recognition based on deep learning has made significant progress in recent years, thanks to advancements in large-scale training data, deep neural network architectures, and loss function designs. However, most prior works still rely on the absolute similarity metric during inference, which is inconsistent with the training process that optimizes the relative margin between intra-class and inter-class similarities. This inconsistency leads to misjudgment of positive pairs as false negatives, especially in open-set face recognition scenarios. To address this gap, we propose a new metric called Discrepancy Alignment Metric (DAM) that normalizes the absolute similarity score and is more consistent with existing loss functions. DAM incorporates the Local Inter-class Discrepancy (LID) of each feature and can be integrated seamlessly into existing face recognition methods. We introduce two types of Local Inter-class Discrepancy Estimation (LIDE) methods, namely reference-based and learning-based approaches, to estimate the LID for each face image. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed DAM significantly improves the performance of face recognition.
