The increasing use of GANs and concerns about their malicious use in social media content have raised concerns about public security and privacy. While many works focus on real/fake detection, it is also important to address the problem of attribution, identifying the source of these images. Attribution can help deter malicious organizations and hold them accountable. This paper introduces the problem of "GAN discovery and attribution," which involves attributing images to known sources and discovering unknown sources, in an open-world setup where the number of sources is unknown and keeps increasing. The authors propose a novel iterative pipeline that utilizes labeled images to perform GAN attribution and discovery on unlabeled images. The approach also generalizes to include images from unseen sources and can continuously discover images from new GANs in an online manner. The authors utilize deep network features and the Winner Take All hash for out-of-distribution detection and perform clustering and refinement steps to improve grouping of unknown GANs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the approach in an open-world setup and its ability to generalize to a wide range of dataset setups. The paper also provides insights into the various stages of the pipeline and analyzes its performance in real/fake image detection. The contributions of the paper include introducing the problem of GAN discovery and attribution, proposing a novel iterative pipeline, and analyzing the capability of the approach on various dataset setups.
