The ability to align two views of the same scene and identify corresponding points between them is crucial in computer vision. The relationship between correspondence estimation and point cloud registration is well-established and forms the basis for many approaches in both areas. This paper explores the possibility of jointly learning correspondence estimation and point cloud registration from scratch by leveraging the cycle between the two tasks. A key component of this cycle is the generation of good feature descriptors for points in the scene. Existing approaches rely on preregistered scenes to sample ground-truth correspondences and train a feature encoder. However, this limits the approach to data that can be successfully registered using automated methods. To overcome this limitation, the authors propose a self-supervised end-to-end approach called Bootstrap Your Own Correspondences (BYOC). BYOC learns point cloud registration by extracting pseudo-correspondences using a randomly initialized feature encoder. These pseudo-correspondences are then used to register the point clouds and train the feature encoders. This allows for feature learning from RGB-D scans without relying on pose or correspondence supervision. While BYOC works well for registering RGB-D frames, it is less effective for raw point clouds. To address this, the authors propose bootstrapping the geometric feature learning using visual correspondences. They adapt the SimSiam approach for 3D representation learning, which allows training the geometric encoder using only positive pairs without requiring negative sampling or momentum encoders. The proposed approach draws inspiration from the iterative closest point algorithm (ICP) and self-supervised learning with pseudo-labels. Both approaches utilize the concept of pseudo-labels in a well-structured space to provide a valuable learning signal. CNNs, even when randomly initialized, are effective feature extractors, and this knowledge is leveraged in the proposed approach.The authors evaluate their approach on two indoor scene datasets and demonstrate its efficacy in point cloud registration and correspondence estimation tasks. The results show that the proposed self-supervised approach outperforms hand-crafted features and several supervised baselines, while remaining competitive with state-of-the-art supervised approaches. In summary, the paper presents a self-supervised approach (BYOC) that learns point-wise features for point cloud registration and demonstrates the effectiveness of using visual correspondences to improve geometric feature learning.
