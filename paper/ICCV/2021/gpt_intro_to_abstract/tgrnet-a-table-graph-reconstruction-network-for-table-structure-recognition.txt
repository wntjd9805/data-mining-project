In this paper, we address the challenge of automatically recognizing the structure of tables presented in unstructured formats. We propose a table recognition system, called Table Graph, that utilizes a graph-based representation of tables to capture the spatial and logical relationships between table cells. To reconstruct the table graph, our proposed method combines a segmentation-based module for detecting the spatial location of cells and an ordinal node classification approach for predicting the logical location of cells. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on four datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing methods. Additionally, we contribute a new benchmark dataset, TableGraph-350K, which includes 350,000 table graph annotations. Overall, our work contributes to advancements in table structure recognition and provides a valuable resource for future research in this field.
