Point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in 3D computer vision, with applications in robotics and autonomous driving. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) method is commonly used for point cloud registration, but it relies heavily on initial guesses and can get stuck in local minima. Deep learning has shown success in 3D computer vision tasks, including point cloud registration, but existing methods are mainly designed for object-level or indoor point clouds and are unreliable or time-consuming for outdoor LiDAR point clouds. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical keypoint-based point cloud registration network called HRegNet for accurate and efficient registration of large-scale outdoor LiDAR point clouds. The network hierarchically downsamples the point clouds to multiple small sets of keypoints and descriptors, performing coarse registration in the bottom layer and refining the transformation in upper layers. The network also includes a learning-based correspondence network to generate reliable correspondences between keypoints, using concepts of bilateral consensus and neighborhood consensus. The proposed method is evaluated on two large-scale outdoor LiDAR point cloud datasets and outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The contributions of this work include the proposed HRegNet network, the hierarchical paradigm for registration, and the novel similarity features that improve registration performance by incorporating bilateral and neighborhood consensus.
