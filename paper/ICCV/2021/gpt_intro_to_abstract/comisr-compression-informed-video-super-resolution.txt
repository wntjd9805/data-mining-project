Super-resolution is an important problem in computer vision, aiming to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs. Single-image super-resolution (SISR) and video super-resolution (VSR) are two commonly studied approaches. However, existing methods for SISR and VSR do not perform well on compressed images or videos, which are common on the web and mobile devices. This paper proposes a compression-informed super-resolution model (COMISR) that can handle compressed videos effectively. The proposed model includes three modules: a bi-directional recurrent module to reduce warping errors, a detail-aware flow estimation module to recover high-resolution flow, and a Laplacian enhancement module to add high-frequency information. The effectiveness of these modules is demonstrated through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, and the robustness of the COMISR model is validated on YouTube videos. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of a compression-informed model for super-resolving compressed videos, the incorporation of three novel modules for VSR, and the evaluation of VSR models on compressed benchmark datasets and real-world YouTube videos.
