This paper introduces a novel self-supervised tomographic reconstruction framework called IntraTomo that combines the benefits of learning-based and model-based approaches. The proposed framework successfully tackles various challenging ill-posed tomography problems, including limited angle tomography, sparse view tomography, and super-resolution tomography. State-of-the-art results are achieved by comparing with multiple baseline methods using quantitative and qualitative metrics on both simulated and real CT data. The framework is also demonstrated to effectively solve inverse problems in the projections space, such as sinogram extrapolation, inpainting, super-resolution, and denoising. The code and data associated with the framework are publicly available.
