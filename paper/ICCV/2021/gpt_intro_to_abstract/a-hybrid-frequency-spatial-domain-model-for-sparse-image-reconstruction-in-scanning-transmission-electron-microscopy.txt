Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) is a valuable technique for imaging beam-stable materials, but high spatial resolution requires high electron beam doses that can damage the materials. To address this issue, low electron dose imaging is crucial for beam-sensitive materials. However, low electron dose configurations result in sparse sampling signals and low signal-to-noise ratio. This paper explores the problem of image restoration in extremely sparse sampling cases, specifically for atomic-scale STEM imaging with a sampling rate below 5%. Traditional methods, such as filter-based approaches and compressed sensing, have limitations in accurately determining material boundaries and restoring missing signals. Convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods have been proposed to address this problem, but their performance is not satisfactory for real-world data with Poisson noise. To overcome these limitations, the Frequency-Spatial Hybrid Network (FSHNet) is introduced, which combines frequency domain information and spatial domain information to achieve complete structure restoration in STEM images. The FSHNet architecture incorporates a structure prior from the frequency domain and utilizes convolution operators to capture local structure details. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate a significant performance enhancement of approximately 50%. The contributions of this work include a novel architecture that combines global structure features and local pixel information, a structure prior from the frequency domain, an adaptive non-local patches matching module, and a general procedure for the simulation of STEM sampling and imaging.
