This research paper introduces a novel approach for deep object detection using active learning. The performance of deep detection networks relies on the size of labeled data, thus researchers have explored active learning strategies to select informative samples for labeling. In this paper, the authors propose a single-model, single-pass active learning method for object detection that leverages both localization and classification-based aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The approach utilizes mixture density networks to learn a Gaussian mixture model for each output, enabling the computation of uncertainties. The authors also propose a loss function to train the object detection network and demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach on two different datasets. The results show that their method consistently outperforms single-model based methods while significantly reducing computational costs. The contributions of this paper are a novel active learning method that considers both localization and classification uncertainties, a new loss function for training the object detection network, and empirical evidence of the approach's effectiveness on different models and datasets.
