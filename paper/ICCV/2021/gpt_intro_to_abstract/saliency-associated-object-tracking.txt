Visual object tracking is a crucial area of research in Computer Vision with applications in video surveillance, robotics, and motion analysis. While deep trackers have shown great progress in recent years, tracking targets with real-time appearance variations remains a challenging task. Traditional deep tracking approaches perform tracking holistically, using deep feature representations for the entire target object. However, these methods struggle in scenarios where the target varies substantially. Another approach is the part-based strategy, which tracks local parts of the target and infers the global target state based on the tracking results. However, not all partitioned patches are equally informative for tracking. In this paper, we propose the Saliency-Associated Object Tracker (SAOT) that focuses on tracking the local saliencies of the target that are discriminative for tracking. We design a saliency mining mechanism to capture these saliencies and associate them together to learn global correlations between the target exemplar and the search image. Our SAOT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in tracking targets with appearance variations.
