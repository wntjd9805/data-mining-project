Visual object tracking is a fundamental computer vision task with numerous applications. Recent progress in deep learning has improved tracking algorithms, but they require a large amount of annotated data for training. To overcome this limitation, researchers have started to explore unsupervised learning using unlabeled videos. However, there is still a performance gap between unsupervised and supervised trackers. In this paper, we identify three critical challenges in unsupervised tracking: moving object discovery, rich temporal variation exploration, and online update. To address these challenges, we propose a robust unsupervised tracker. Our approach includes a sequential box sampling algorithm to discover moving objects, a naive Siamese tracker trained from scratch, and a cycle memory learning scheme for online update. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed tracker outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised trackers and achieves comparable performance to supervised trackers. The contributions of this work include the discovery of moving objects in unlabeled videos, the training of a naive Siamese tracker, and the development of a cycle memory learning scheme for online updates.
