Image anomaly detection (AD) is crucial in industrial inspection to classify abnormal versions of target objects and localize anomalous regions. Previous methods use anomaly-free data to indirectly identify anomalies, resulting in an out-of-distribution detection task. Two main trends in AD are embedding-based and reconstruction-based methods. We focus on the reconstruction-based perspective and address two key issues: reconstruction gap and model adaptation. Our proposed Metaformer, a transformer-based instance-aware autoencoder, learns model parameters using unsupervised meta-learning to enable efficient model adaptation. We introduce instance-aware attention to regulate the reconstruction gap and precisely localize pixel-level abnormal regions. Our method is the first to employ this adaptive instance-aware reconstruction method for image AD. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, achieving state-of-the-art performance in anomaly classification and localization.
