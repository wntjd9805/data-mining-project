Instance recognition is the task of visually recognizing a specific object instance, as opposed to class-level recognition. It is important in e-commerce and place identification, where finding a specific product or landmark is desired. This task is typically approached as image retrieval and involves metric learning and local feature-based reranking. Previous methods have used hand-crafted descriptors and matching algorithms, while more recent approaches incorporate global and local descriptors extracted from deep learning models. However, there is a lack of similarity metrics based on local features. In this paper, we propose Reranking Transformers (RRTs) as a lightweight and effective model for instance recognition. RRTs leverage the transformer architecture and learn to predict the similarity of an image pair directly. Our experiments demonstrate that RRTs outperform existing reranking methods on standard benchmarks. The proposed method requires fewer local descriptors, can be easily parallelized, and achieves superior performance, especially for challenging cases. We also show the benefit of jointly optimizing the feature extractor and our model. This work contributes a novel approach to instance recognition using RRTs and demonstrates their effectiveness in improving retrieval performance.
