This paper introduces a new person ReID task called bird-view person ReID, which involves searching for a person in a gallery of horizontal-view images using query images taken from an elevated bird's-eye view. The task is important in video surveillance scenarios, but presents unique challenges due to limited person appearance information and a large discrepancy between the two views. The paper proposes a large-scale dataset for bird-view ReID, called BV-Person, and analyzes the major challenges in this task. A novel multi-scale cross attention-based model is also proposed to address these challenges. The paper evaluates the model on BV-Person and compares it to existing state-of-the-art ReID models, showing superior performance. The model also performs well on general ReID benchmarks, indicating its applicability in real-world settings.
