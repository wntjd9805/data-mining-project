Abstract: Spectral reflectance is an essential property of materials that provides valuable information for various computer vision tasks. However, accurately capturing spectral reflectance requires additional calibration due to different illumination conditions. This paper proposes a practical solution to estimate illumination spectra from multispectral images and separate reflectance and illumination for further analysis. The proposed method utilizes a multispectral image dataset synthesized using real spectral reflectance images and illumination spectra. The problem is formulated as a constrained matrix factorization, and an optimization-inspired unrolling multi-stage network is used to solve it. The network incorporates non-local prior, low-rank, and total-variation regularization to improve estimation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and generalization ability of the proposed method, outperforming existing approaches. Additionally, the paper presents the first work handling both single-global and multiple illumination estimation for multispectral images. Furthermore, a large dataset of 400 high-quality multispectral images is built, serving as a benchmark for training and evaluating illumination estimation models.
