The perception of 2D computer-aided design (CAD) drawings is crucial for creating 3D prototypes in architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industries. This paper introduces the concept of "digital twins" and highlights the importance of accurate geometric and semantic information in CAD drawings. Automatic perception of CAD drawings can lead to more efficient 3D modeling approaches, saving significant amounts of labor work. Traditional symbol spotting approaches for CAD drawings are limited in their ability to detect variations in symbols and cannot handle the semantic detection of uncountable objects. This paper introduces the concept of panoptic symbol spotting, which combines instance spotting and semantic labeling. To facilitate research in this area, the authors have created a large-scale dataset of over 10,000 floor plans with line-grained annotations. The property of vector graphics enables the use of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to extract non-Euclidean features. The authors propose a novel network combining GCNs and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic symbol spotting. The goal of this research is to provide a comprehensive dataset and a baseline algorithm for the development of perception in CAD drawings. The contributions of this paper include the large-scale dataset, the introduction of the panoptic symbol spotting task, and the CNN-GCN method for semantic symbol spotting.
