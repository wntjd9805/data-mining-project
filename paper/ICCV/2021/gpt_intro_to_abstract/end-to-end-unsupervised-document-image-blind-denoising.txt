This paper addresses the problem of noise degradation in electronic documents and its adverse effects on optical character recognition (OCR) and subsequent digitization and analysis. While most literature focuses on noise removal from pictures, this study aims to improve the quality of text documents using image processing techniques. The current state-of-the-art solutions for image restoration are based on discriminative models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), auto-encoders, and their variants. However, these approaches require clean target images, which are difficult to obtain in real-world documents. To address this limitation, the paper introduces an end-to-end unsupervised image blind denoising algorithm that removes various noise types without the need for paired noisy/clean pages. The main contributions of this study include the proposal of a unified architecture integrating deep mixture of experts with a cycle-consistent GAN as the base network, the formulation of a novel loss function, and the demonstration of the model's excellent performance on real documents with various artifacts.
