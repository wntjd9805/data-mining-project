Single image deblurring is a task that aims to recover a sharp image from a blurry input image. Despite advancements in camera technology, blur artifacts still exist due to camera or object movements. Blurry images not only visually degrade the quality but also impact the performance of vision systems such as surveillance and autonomous driving. To address this problem, convolutional neural network (CNN)-based image deblurring methods have been extensively studied and have shown promising results.Traditional CNN-based methods typically employ a two-stage framework, consisting of a CNN-based blur kernel estimator and a kernel-based deconvolution stage. On the other hand, recent CNN-based methods aim to directly learn the complex relationship between blurry and sharp image pairs in an end-to-end manner. These methods have achieved significant performance improvements but suffer from high computational complexity and memory usage, making them unsuitable for cost and time-sensitive environments.In this paper, we propose a novel deblurring network called multi-input multi-output UNet (MIMO-UNet) that can handle multi-scale blur with low computational complexity. MIMO-UNet features a single encoder-decoder architecture with three distinct characteristics. First, the decoder of MIMO-UNet, called multi-output single decoder (MOSD), generates multiple deblurred images, mimicking the gradual recovery process of stacked sub-networks. Second, the encoder, called multi-input single encoder (MISE), takes multi-scale input images to capture different levels of details. Lastly, an asymmetric feature fusion (AFF) mechanism is introduced to efficiently merge multi-scale features, improving the deblurring performance.Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIMO-UNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) while maintaining low computational complexity. The proposed network offers a more efficient and effective solution for single image deblurring, making it more suitable for real-time applications in mobile devices, vehicles, and robots.
