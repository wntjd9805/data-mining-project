Abstract:Semantic segmentation is a popular computer vision topic that assigns each pixel in an image to a predefined class. In autonomous driving, a segmentation model is needed to recognize roads, sidewalks, pedestrians, or vehicles in various urban conditions. Annotating images for segmentation is costly, so a cost-effective approach is to use synthetic datasets generated by game engines. However, models trained on synthetic datasets often fail on real images due to the appearance gap. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) trains a model on a source dataset and ensures its performance on a new target dataset. UDA has been applied to various computer vision tasks, including semantic segmentation. Recent UDA methods aim to reduce the cross-domain discrepancy using maximum mean discrepancies or adversarial training. However, the label predicted by the discriminator is weak for segmentation. Self-training and semi-supervised learning are other UDA approaches, but they rely on easy predictions and neglect structural information. This work proposes a new UDA approach for semantic segmentation. It introduces Unaligned Domain Score (UDS) to measure model efficiency in an unsupervised manner and extends UDS as the Bijective Maximum Likelihood (BiMaL) loss function for unsupervised deep neural networks. BiMaL loss models the global structure of a segmentation input and maps it to a deep latent space using a bijective function. Experimental results on three benchmark databases show that the proposed BiMaL approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. This work is one of the first to introduce a novel bijective maximum likelihood approach with a flow-based metric in UDA for semantic segmentation.
