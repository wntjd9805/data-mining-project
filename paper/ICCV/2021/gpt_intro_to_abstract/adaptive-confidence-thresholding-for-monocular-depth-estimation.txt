Monocular depth estimation is crucial for scene understanding and autonomous driving in various fields of computer science. Early approaches rely on supervised learning with a large amount of training data that contains ground truth depth labels. However, collecting such data is expensive and labor-intensive. Recent approaches have shifted towards self-supervised learning, using stereo images or monocular video sequences to train the network. These approaches use a reconstruction loss based on pixel-wise intensity similarities to encode the geometric structure of the scene. While this loss function is an appealing alternative to the lack of ground truth labels, it often leads to blurry results and does not consider occluded pixels.To address these limitations, Cho et al. proposed a method that trains the monocular depth estimation network using pseudo depth labels generated from pre-trained stereo matching network. They also use stereo confidence maps to indicate the reliability of the pseudo depth labels. However, using a fixed threshold for all training data can result in inaccurate pseudo depth values being used in the network training. Previous attempts to learn the threshold with an additional regularization term have shown limited performance improvement due to hard thresholding and implicit constraints.To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel architecture that adaptively learns the threshold for pseudo depth maps. Our approach dynamically infers the stereo confidence map and its associated threshold in an end-to-end manner, using a differential soft-thresholding operator. This threshold learning method allows for more effective handling of prediction errors in the confidence map. The thresholded confidence map, along with the pseudo depth labels, is then used to train the monocular depth estimation network. Additionally, we introduce a probabilistic inference framework to enhance the monocular depth map. Unreliable parts of the map are identified using an uncertainty map and refined through pixel-adaptive convolution.Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed threshold learning and probabilistic depth refinement modules significantly improve the accuracy of monocular depth estimation. Furthermore, we find that the threshold learning approach can also enhance the performance of existing stereo confidence estimation methods. By refining the confidence map obtained from these methods with the soft-thresholding function controlled by the learned threshold, we observe improved prediction accuracy.In summary, our contributions include a novel framework for monocular depth estimation using pseudo depth labels and the introduction of a threshold network that adaptively learns the threshold of the confidence map. We also propose a probabilistic depth refinement module based on the PAC layer. Additionally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the threshold network in enhancing the prediction accuracy of existing confidence estimation approaches.
