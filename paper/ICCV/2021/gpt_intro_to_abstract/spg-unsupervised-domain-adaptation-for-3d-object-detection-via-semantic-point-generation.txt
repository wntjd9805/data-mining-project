Autonomous driving systems rely on the accurate detection of objects using LiDAR technology. However, most existing 3D detection methods focus on a single domain and do not consider the variations in environmental conditions. This paper addresses the challenge of generalizing a 3D detector to different domains with varying geographic locations and weather conditions. Specifically, the study analyzes the domain gap between the Waymo Open Dataset (OD) and the Waymo Kirkland Dataset (Kirk), which were collected in different locations and under different weather conditions. The statistics show that the Kirk dataset has significantly lower quality point clouds due to rainy weather, leading to a drop in the performance of the 3D detector. To bridge this domain gap, the paper proposes a novel approach called Semantic Point Generation (SPG). SPG aims to learn the semantic information of the point cloud and generate additional points to recover the foreground regions affected by missing points. The generated semantic points enhance the performance of 3D detectors in both the target and source domains. The paper presents an in-depth analysis of unsupervised domain adaptation for LiDAR 3D detectors and demonstrates the effectiveness of SPG in improving detection performance. SPG is a lightweight and efficient approach that can be easily integrated with existing LiDAR-based detectors.
