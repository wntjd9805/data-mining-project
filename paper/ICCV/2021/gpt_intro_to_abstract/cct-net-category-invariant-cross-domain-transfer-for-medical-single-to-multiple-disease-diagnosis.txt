Automatic disease diagnosis systems have made significant advancements in medical imaging tasks. However, most existing systems focus on a single disease, limiting their transferability to related diseases. In this paper, we propose a category-invariant cross-domain transfer method to improve the diagnosis of multiple related diseases without fine-grained annotations. We introduce a domain-specific task learning module and a CWP global pooling method to obtain better class activation maps. We also propose CIFR blocks to localize discriminative regions of corresponding diseases. Experimental evaluations on ocular diseases and brain tumors demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
