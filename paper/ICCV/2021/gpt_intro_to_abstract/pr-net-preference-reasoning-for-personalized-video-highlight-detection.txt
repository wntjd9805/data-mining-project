The paper introduces a novel preference reasoning framework called PR-Net for personalized video highlight detection. The authors address the limitations of existing methods by considering the user's diverse interests and the presence of unlabeled positive samples. They propose a method that attends to query frames and history frames to obtain attention weights, and then combines user-specific and generic preference embeddings to generate a comprehensive preference embedding. Additionally, a non-highlight preference is used to consider the degree of non-highlight for each query frame. To ensure a compact and differentiable metric space, a new contrastive loss function is used to constrain the similarities of all video frames. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a relative improvement of 12% in mean accuracy precision. Overall, this paper contributes a novel framework for personalized video highlight detection and introduces a new loss function for frame-level content understanding in the field of computer science.
