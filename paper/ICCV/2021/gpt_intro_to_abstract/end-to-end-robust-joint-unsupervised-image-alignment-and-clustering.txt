Image alignment is a crucial task in computer vision, with applications in various fields such as face recognition, medical diagnosis, remote sensing, and structural biology. Recently, end-to-end deep learning methods have achieved superior performance in image alignment tasks. However, existing approaches only focus on alignment and cannot predict the categorical class of input images. This limitation hinders the ability to align images from diverse semantic categories. Therefore, there is a need for a model that can simultaneously cluster and align images. In this paper, we propose Jim-Net, an end-to-end model that performs joint image alignment and clustering. We design unsupervised loss functions and a pair-matching alignment algorithm to train Jim-Net without annotated data. We also incorporate techniques to improve robustness to large transformations and noise. Experimental results demonstrate that Jim-Net achieves comparable alignment accuracy with state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods on benchmark datasets and significantly improves performance compared to baseline methods on cryo-electron tomography datasets. This work has important implications for substructuring heterogeneous macromolecular structures and aligning their poses.
