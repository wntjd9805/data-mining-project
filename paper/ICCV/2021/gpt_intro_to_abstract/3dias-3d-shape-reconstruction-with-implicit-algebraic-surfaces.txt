Single image 3D reconstruction is a widely used technique in computer vision, computer graphics, computer animation, and augmented reality. Recent advancements in deep neural networks (DNNs) have significantly improved the accuracy of 3D shape reconstruction. These methods can be categorized into explicit-based and implicit-based approaches. Voxel-grid is a commonly used explicit representation, but it suffers from memory usage and quantization artifacts. Polygon mesh-based methods have been proposed as an alternative representation, but they cannot handle arbitrary topologies. Implicit representations, on the other hand, approximate the surfaces of 3D shapes as zero-sets of continuous functions. Isosurface-based methods generate surfaces using neural networks, but they require post-processing and are not suitable for graphics applications. Primitive-based methods approximate shapes using simple geometric primitives, but they have limited resolutions. In this paper, we propose a novel primitive-based 3D shape representation called 3DIAS, based on learnable implicit algebraic surfaces. We apply various constraints to these primitives to facilitate learning and achieve detailed appearances. Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can semantically learn the components of 3D shapes without supervision. We also demonstrate the ability of 3DIAS to adjust the number of primitives based on the shape being reconstructed. Our contributions include the development of a novel primitive-based representation, the introduction of constraints to produce solvable and closed primitives, and experimental validation of the superiority and flexibility of 3DIAS compared to existing methods.
