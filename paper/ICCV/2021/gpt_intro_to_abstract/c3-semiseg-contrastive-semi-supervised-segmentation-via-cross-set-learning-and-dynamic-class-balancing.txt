The paper introduces a novel framework called C3-SemiSeg for improving consistency-based semi-supervised learning in semantic segmentation. The framework exploits better feature alignment under perturbations and enhances the discriminative abilities of inter-class features across labeled and unlabeled data sets. The authors propose an asymmetric data augmentation strategy and a pixel-wise contrastive loss function to achieve these goals. They also introduce the Dynamic Confident Region Selection (DCRS) to reduce the negative effects of noisy predictions. Experimental results on Cityscapes and BDD100K datasets demonstrate that C3-SemiSeg outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in various labeled data ratios.
