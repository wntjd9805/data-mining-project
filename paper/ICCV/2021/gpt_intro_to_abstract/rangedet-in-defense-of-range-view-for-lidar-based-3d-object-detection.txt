LiDAR-based 3D object detection is an important technology in autonomous driving, but detecting objects in sparse point clouds presents challenges. Current representations like Bird's Eye View (BEV) introduce quantization errors and are not efficient for distant objects. Point view representation can extract features effectively, but scaling is difficult. Range view is compact and informative, forming a 2.5D scene, but is rarely used in object detection. Existing range-view-based detectors have inferior results compared to other representations, indicating overlooked challenges. This paper proposes RangeDet, a pure range-view-based framework, to address these challenges. It introduces Range Conditioned Pyramid, weighted Non-Maximum Suppression, and Meta-Kernel to handle scale variation, improve performance, and capture 3D geometric information. It also explores data augmentation techniques for the range view. RangeDet achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art works and outperforms previous range-view-based detectors in vehicle detection by a margin of 20 3D AP. Interestingly, RangeDet is more advantageous for distant or small objects compared to BEV representation.
