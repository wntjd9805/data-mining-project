Accurate medical image segmentation is crucial for various clinical applications. However, existing methods for segmentation tasks in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require a large number of pixel-wise annotated samples and fully supervised training. In the medical field, obtaining sufficient labeled data is challenging due to the high cost and time-consuming nature of manual annotation. To address this issue, semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been introduced, which utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data for training.Previous SSL methods have focused on incorporating unlabeled data into training through self-training, co-training, GAN-based methods, and self-ensembling. However, these methods often overlook the importance of geometric information and the inherent correspondences between semantics and boundaries, leading to unsatisfactory boundary accuracy and non-smooth segmentation results. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph-based boundary-aware semi-supervised segmentation network (Graph-BAS3Net) to overcome these limitations.The Graph-BAS3Net consists of two components: a Boundary-Aware Semi-Supervised Segmentation Network (BAS3Net) and a Bilateral Graph Convolution Module (BGCM). The BAS3Net mitigates the blurry boundary problem by incorporating a boundary detection task into the GAN-based segmentation network. It also uses a shared encoder to extract common features for different tasks and introduce a discriminator for semi-supervised learning. The BGCM models the duality constraints between semantics and boundaries through graph convolution. It captures long-range dependencies and enables information propagation between tasks. By incorporating these components, the Graph-BAS3Net can effectively utilize the rich features encoded in the object boundaries and improve the overall performance of semi-supervised segmentation.The main contributions of this work are four-fold: First, we propose the Graph-BAS3Net to enforce semantic and geometric constraints in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Second, we devise the BAS3Net, which jointly predicts semantic segmentation and object boundaries to improve the generator's performance. Third, we introduce the BGCM to enforce duality constraints between semantics and boundaries through bilateral graph convolution. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on liver and COVID-19 datasets, demonstrating that the Graph-BAS3Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
