This paper introduces the concept of four-dimensional (4D) spatiotemporal computed tomography (CT) for recovering the inner structure of three-dimensional (3D) volumetric heterogeneous objects. While traditional CT approaches assume static objects during multi-view acquisition, it is common for objects to change over time. As a result, efforts have been made to generalize CT to 4D spatiotemporal CT, particularly in the computer vision and graphics communities. This paper focuses on scattering CT, which is important for understanding cloud physics and reducing errors in climate predictions. The paper addresses the challenges of high-resolution multi-view imaging from space, where platforms move above the clouds and capture a sequence of images to sample a wide angular breadth. The authors discuss the conditions for performing 4D scattering CT, including temporal sampling and angular breadth, and present an optimization-based method for spatiotemporal recovery using data taken by moving cameras. The method is evaluated through simulations and real data.
