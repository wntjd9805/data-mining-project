The rise of computer vision in recent years has been driven by the availability of large-scale annotated image datasets. However, the manual annotation process for instance segmentation is time-consuming and expensive. Interactive segmentation methods offer faster annotation but become unaffordable at large scales. In this paper, we propose a method for crowd-sourcing object segmentation masks that significantly reduces annotation time by clustering mask predictions made by an instance segmentation model. Human annotators verify a few masks per cluster, and the verification labels are propagated to the whole cluster. Our goal is to maximize the number of high-quality annotations obtained with a limited annotation budget. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments, showing a significant reduction in annotation time and comparable mask quality to manually annotated datasets.
