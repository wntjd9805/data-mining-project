The success of deep learning in computer vision has been largely driven by large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet, COCO, and Kinetics. However, in expert domains like biology and medical imaging, data annotation requires specialized knowledge, making it difficult to create large annotated datasets. This limitation hampers the application of deep learning in these domains. To address this challenge, we propose the MEMORABLE framework for scalable recognition in fine-grained expert domains. The framework leverages small expert-labeled datasets and large amounts of unlabeled data. We explore the importance of labeling accuracy for deep learning performance, and introduce the CMaxGrad machine teaching algorithm, which uses counterfactual explanations. Experimental results show that the MEMORABLE framework outperforms other scalable recognition strategies and can effectively leverage noisy label training. Our contributions include a study on labeling accuracy, the MEMORABLE framework, the CMaxGrad algorithm with counterfactual explanations, and new benchmarks for evaluating scalable recognition.
