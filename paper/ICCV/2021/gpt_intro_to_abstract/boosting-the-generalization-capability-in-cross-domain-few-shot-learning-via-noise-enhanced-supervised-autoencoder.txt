This paper introduces the problem of cross-domain few-shot learning (CDFSL) in visual classification tasks. While deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in visual classification, their performance heavily relies on large-scale labeled datasets. However, practical applications often target categories that are difficult to collect data for, limiting the generalization of current vision systems. CDFSL is proposed as a solution to recognize instances of novel categories in the target domain with few labeled samples. Previous few-shot learning (FSL) methods fail to generalize well under CDFSL setting, highlighting the need to improve generalization capability and address the domain shift issue. This paper proposes a noise-enhanced supervised autoencoder (NSAE) approach, which combines discriminative and generative learning to boost generalization performance. The NSAE structure jointly predicts labels and reconstructs inputs, taking advantage of the addition of noise to enhance generalization. The paper also introduces a two-step fine-tuning procedure and provides theoretical analysis supporting the proposed approach. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework in cross-domain few-shot learning settings.
