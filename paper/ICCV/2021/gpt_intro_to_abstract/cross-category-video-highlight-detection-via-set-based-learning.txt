This paper addresses the problem of Cross-category Video Highlight Detection, where the target video category lacks supervision while another video category possesses annotation. Existing methods for video highlight detection have mainly focused on training a highlight detector for a specific video category, but the transferability of a highlight detection model across different video categories has been less explored. The paper proposes a Dual-Learner-based Video Highlight Detection (DL-VHD) framework that utilizes a Set-based Learning module (SL-module) to improve the conventional pair-based learning manner for highlight detection. The SL-module learns to regress the highlight score distribution over a set of segments from the same video, capturing the interrelationship among various video segments using a Transformer encoder. The DL-VHD framework further introduces two different learners to capture coarse-grained and fine-grained knowledge about highlight moments. These two types of knowledge are integrated by distilling each of them into the other learner, forming more complete concepts about highlight moments in the target video category. Experimental results show that the DL-VHD model performs substantially better than existing Unsupervised Domain Adaptation algorithms and comparably to a supervised model trained on the target video category. This work is the first attempt at cross-category video highlight detection using a dual-learner-based scheme.
