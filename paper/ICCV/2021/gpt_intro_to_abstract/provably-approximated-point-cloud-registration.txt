This paper addresses the problem of computing the position and orientation of a car relative to its starting point using a set of known 3D landmarks mounted on the car and the corresponding landmarks observed via an external 3D camera. The goal is to align the two sets of landmarks by recovering the rigid transformation (rotation and translation) that minimizes the distance between each point in the set mounted on the car and its corresponding point observed by the camera. This problem, known as the registration problem, is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in robotics and autonomous driving. While there are approximation algorithms for the special case where the distance metric is squared Euclidean distance, there is no provable approximation for the general case. The paper proposes a provable approximation algorithm for the general case, as well as handling various types of cost functions, such as squared distances, distances with noisy data using M-estimators, and distances to the power of r with outliers. The proposed algorithm provides an alternative to the commonly used Iterative Closest Point (ICP) heuristic, approximating the global optimum of the alignment and registration problems. Overall, this paper presents a general framework for approximating the global minimum of the alignment and registration problems in computer vision.
