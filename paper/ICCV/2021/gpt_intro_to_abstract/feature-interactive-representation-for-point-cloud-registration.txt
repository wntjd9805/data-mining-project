Abstract:Geometric registration is a crucial task in analyzing 3D data, as it involves aligning one point cloud to another by estimating the transformation between them. The Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm is commonly used for registration, but it is often limited by local minima and is not suitable for large transformations. Recent advancements in deep learning have led to the development of learning-based methods for point cloud registration, which have shown promising results in handling large rotations and achieving faster speeds compared to traditional algorithms. However, these methods often neglect the importance of feature extraction in the registration process.In this paper, we propose a novel feature interaction model called FIRE-Net to address this issue. FIRE-Net leverages interaction between the source and target point clouds to extract more discriminative and task-relevant features. We introduce a Combined Feature Encoder (CFE) that utilizes graph neural networks to obtain interactive features within each point cloud. Additionally, we incorporate a Local Interaction Unit (LIU) and a Global Interaction Unit (GIU) to facilitate feature interaction between the source and target point clouds at both a local and global level.Our experimental results demonstrate that FIRE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ModelNet40 benchmark in various settings. By leveraging comprehensive information interaction from different levels, our proposed method improves the discriminative power of the similarity matrix, leading to more accurate registration results. Overall, this paper presents a novel feature interaction model that enhances the registration process and demonstrates its effectiveness and generalization ability.
