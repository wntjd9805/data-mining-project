The problem of image retrieval has been extensively studied in various applications such as product search and face recognition. The traditional approach is to find the most similar images to a query image in a gallery. However, this approach may not always produce desired results when a perfect query image is not available. In this paper, we propose a new formulation for face image retrieval that allows users to adjust and prioritize the attributes of the retrieved images. We introduce an adjustment vector to modify the presence of attributes and a preference vector to assign importance to attributes. This customization of the similarity criteria is achieved using generative adversarial networks (GANs), specifically StyleGAN. The disentangled attribute vectors obtained from the latent space of StyleGAN are used to adjust attributes and assign preference. We enforce orthogonality and sparsity constraints on the attribute vectors to further decouple entangled attributes. Our proposed method shows better performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for image retrieval using compositional learning or GANs.
