Human-motion segmentation (HMS) is a crucial step in early processing of untrimmed videos for human action recognition. Despite extensive research, current HMS techniques still lack the required accuracy for real-world applications. Traditional approaches have addressed this problem through unsupervised learning techniques, such as clustering algorithms and subspace clustering. However, these approaches often ignore temporal continuity and are sensitive to noise. Recent subspace clustering and temporal clustering methods have attempted to overcome these limitations but still struggle with the lack of prior knowledge. Transfer subspace techniques have shown promise in leveraging prior information from source data to improve clustering accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised approach for HMS that utilizes the local geometric structure present in the original high-dimensional space. Our model assumes that data samples are drawn from an unknown underlying similarity graph, where nodes correspond to individual frames and communities correspond to different motions. We jointly learn subspaces and a compatible representation for the similarity graph by leveraging the Temporal Subspace Clustering (TSC) framework, which has demonstrated effectiveness in subspace clustering for temporal data. To handle noisy or corrupted data, we allow the auxiliary data representation to vary, making the coding matrix more robust. We introduce a graph regularization term that maintains the local geometrical structure of the original data while accounting for data nuisances. Our optimization formulation is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a novel approach for HMS that jointly learns an auxiliary data matrix, a non-negative dictionary, and a coding matrix under various constraints, 2) an original graph regularization term that preserves the geometrical structure of the original data, 3) a comprehensive analysis of our model, including an ablation study and sensitivity analysis, and 4) significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods on four public benchmarks for HMS.
