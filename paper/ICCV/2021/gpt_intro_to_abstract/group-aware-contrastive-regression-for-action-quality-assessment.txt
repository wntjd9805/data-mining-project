Action quality assessment (AQA) has gained increasing attention in recent years due to its significance in various domains such as sports, healthcare, and others. Unlike conventional action recognition tasks, AQA focuses on evaluating how well a specific action is performed. However, AQA poses several challenges, including subjective score annotation, subtle differences between videos, and limited evaluation metrics. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive Regression (CoRe) framework for AQA that utilizes the differences among videos to predict fine-grained action quality scores. Inspired by contrastive learning, our framework aims to learn a representation space where the differences in action quality can be measured by relative scores. We also introduce a group-aware regression tree (GART) and a relative L2-distance (R-(cid:96)2) metric for more accurate score prediction and evaluation. Experimental results on three AQA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in outperforming the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both Spearman's Rank Correlation and the proposed R-(cid:96)2 metric.
