Abstract:The emergence of deep neural networks and large scale image datasets has revolutionized machine visual recognition. However, the commonly used image resizing techniques are outdated and not optimized for machine perception. In this paper, we propose a novel image resizer that is jointly trained with classification models to improve classification performance. Our proposed resizer outperforms traditional resizers and adapts well to different classification models. It is not constrained by pixel or perceptual loss, allowing for machine adaptive visual effects. Additionally, our resizer can downscale images at arbitrary scaling factors, making it versatile and optimal for different tasks. We also demonstrate the applicability of our resizer in image quality assessment. Our proposed method distinguishes itself as the first pre-processing model specifically designed for vision tasks and aims to replace off-the-shelf resizers. Moreover, it can be used in remote machine learning inference to effectively reduce latency without compromising recognition performance. The proposed resizer sets a new standard for pre-processing in machine visual recognition and shows promising results in improving accuracy and preserving perceptual quality.
