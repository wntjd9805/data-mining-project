This article discusses the problem of choosing a suitable similarity metric for 3D point cloud deep learning. The authors propose the sliced Wasserstein distance (SWD) and its variants as effective metrics for supervising 3D point cloud autoencoders. They compare SWD to the popular Chamfer divergence and show that SWD is more suitable for point cloud reconstruction while remaining computationally efficient. The authors also discuss the relationship between Chamfer divergence, Earth Mover's distance (EMD), and SWD, and show that EMD and SWD are equivalent. They highlight the computational and statistical advantages of SWD over Chamfer divergence and EMD. Additionally, the authors introduce the adaptive sliced Wasserstein algorithm to evaluate SWD. They conduct a case study and comprehensive evaluation of different metrics for point cloud learning tasks, including reconstruction, transfer learning, registration, and generation. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding and improvement of 3D point cloud deep learning methods.
