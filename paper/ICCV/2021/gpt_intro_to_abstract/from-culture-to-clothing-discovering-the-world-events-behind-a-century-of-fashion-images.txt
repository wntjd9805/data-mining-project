Fashion is not just about high-end designer clothing seen on runways or popularized by social media influencers. It is a form of expression that reflects an individual's identity, taste, interests, and mood. Moreover, fashion also mirrors the cultural influences and societal changes of a particular period. Anthropologists find studying clothing trends over time to be a valuable source of information, revealing how external factors such as economic, political, and social events can impact people's fashion choices. These effects can be traced back to significant moments or influential individuals, as well as to longer collective experiences. However, the manual process of identifying and analyzing these connections is time-consuming and expensive, limiting the frequency of updates and leading to a focus on major styles while ignoring more subtle or localized ones.To address these challenges, this paper proposes an automated approach to uncover the events and cultural factors that shape fashion evolution. The authors suggest associating changing fashion trends observed in photos with relevant world events. To achieve this, the authors investigate the temporal relationships and statistical influences between latent topics derived from a large collection of news articles and fashion styles extracted from vintage and social media photos. The objective is to understand why certain clothing elements become popular or fade away over time.Through this research, the authors demonstrate the significance of identifying influential events in fashion by performing style forecasting and photo timestamping tasks. By modeling the link between culture and clothing, they show that their approach enables more accurate predictions of future style popularity and dating of unseen clothing photos. The novelty of this work lies in the formalization and automation of the process of connecting cultural factors to fashion. The authors develop technical components including a robust visual style discovery pipeline and a multi-modal Granger causality module.This study is the first to quantify the connections between cultural and fashion trends using image data and showcases the benefits of forecasting and timestamping. The authors not only improve upon existing methods in the literature but also provide examples of both dominant and subtle cultural influences on fashion. Ultimately, their approach paves the way for a scalable and computationally-driven understanding of how external factors shape the clothes we wear, offering a refreshing and accessible perspective on the complex relationship between fashion and culture.
