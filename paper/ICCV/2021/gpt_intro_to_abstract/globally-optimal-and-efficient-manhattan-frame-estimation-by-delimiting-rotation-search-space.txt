This paper introduces the concept of Manhattan Frame (MF) estimation and addresses the challenge of achieving both stability and efficiency in the estimation process. Previous methods have used exhaustive search techniques to find a globally optimal solution, but these methods are computationally inefficient for time-critical applications. The authors propose a solution by delimiting a special sub-space, called the "MFR space," which contains all MF rotations. The paper proves the redundancy of searching the whole rotation space and demonstrates that the MFR space is only 1/24 of the volume of the whole rotation space. The authors also show that a cube with a half side length of Ï€/4 can tightly enclose a MFR space, enabling efficient search within the delimited space. Experimental results show that searching within the delimited MFR space improves the efficiency of MF estimation by about 25 times while still maintaining stability. The paper concludes by highlighting the potential impact of this research on other rotation estimation problems in computer vision.
