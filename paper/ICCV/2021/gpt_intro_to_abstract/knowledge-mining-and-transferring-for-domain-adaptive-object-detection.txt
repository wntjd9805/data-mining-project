Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision, with applications in various fields such as multi-object tracking, behavior analysis, and visual question answering. Deep learning techniques have replaced traditional methods in object detection, but they suffer from performance degradation when faced with variations in object appearance, weather, and illumination. This paper addresses the problem of domain shift and proposes a domain adaptive detector without adversarial training. The proposed method incorporates two knowledge transfer modules to capture the intrinsic properties of objects and the relationship between object categories, which results in improved detection performance. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in domain adaptation. The contributions of this paper include the development of a domain-invariant classifier to extract common attribute knowledge of target objects, the introduction of a domain-independent category relation constraint, and the validation of the proposed method through comprehensive experiments and visualizations.
