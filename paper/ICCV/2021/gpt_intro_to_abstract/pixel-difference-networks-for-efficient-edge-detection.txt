Edge detection is a critical problem in computer vision, with applications in various higher-level tasks such as object recognition, image editing, and image segmentation. Traditional edge detection methods utilize gradient or derivative information, while more recent approaches leverage deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn rich representations. However, the integration of traditional edge detectors with CNNs has been minimally explored. In this paper, we propose a new type of convolutional operation called pixel difference convolution (PDC) that can effectively capture gradient information and improve the quality of edge detection output. We introduce a novel end-to-end architecture called Pixel Difference Network (PiDiNet) that incorporates PDC, addressing issues of memory consumption, computational cost, and inefficiency in leading CNN-based edge detectors. PiDiNet achieves robust and accurate edge detection with high efficiency, providing a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in edge detection tasks.
