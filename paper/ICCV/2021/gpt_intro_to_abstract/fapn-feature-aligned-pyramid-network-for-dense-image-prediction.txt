Dense prediction is a computer vision task that involves labeling every pixel in an image with a pre-defined class. This task is crucial for scene understanding and has applications in various fields such as autonomous driving, medical imaging, and augmented reality. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely used for dense prediction tasks, and recent advancements in CNN architectures have led to promising results in tasks like object detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation.One of the challenges in dense prediction is generating a hierarchy of features at different scales, which is necessary for both object location and classification. Two common approaches to address this challenge are using atrous convolutions to capture semantic context without reducing spatial resolution, and building a top-down feature pyramid based on a ConvNet's bottom-up pathway. However, the non-learnable nature of upsampling operations and the repeated applications of downsampling and upsampling result in feature misalignment, especially around object boundaries, leading to mis-classifications in the final predictions.To overcome this issue, the authors propose a feature alignment module that learns to align upsampled feature maps to a set of reference feature maps, and a feature selection module that emphasizes bottom-up feature maps with rich spatial details. These modules are integrated into a top-down pyramid architecture, resulting in the Feature-aligned Pyramid Network (FaPN).FaPN can be easily incorporated into existing ConvNet backbones and generates a pyramid of features at multiple scales. The authors implement FaPN in various dense prediction frameworks and evaluate its performance on object detection, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks. Extensive evaluations on challenging datasets demonstrate that FaPN significantly improves dense prediction performance, particularly for small objects and object boundaries. It can also be paired with lightweight backbones for real-time semantic segmentation.Key contributions of this work include the development of a feature alignment module and a feature selection module, the introduction of FaPN as an enhanced replacement for FPN, and a thorough experimental evaluation demonstrating the efficacy of FaPN across multiple dense prediction tasks on benchmark datasets. Empirically, FaPN outperforms the original FPN and achieves state-of-the-art performance in certain tasks.
