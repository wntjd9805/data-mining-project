Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search is a popular topic in image retrieval research due to its efficiency in terms of storage and search speed. Two main approaches in ANN research are hashing and vector quantization (VQ). Hashing methods measure the distance between binary codes using the Hamming distance, which has limitations in representing complex distances. VQ-based methods, such as Product Quantization (PQ), utilize quantized real-valued vectors for distance measurement, resulting in richer distance representations. Supervised deep hashing methods show promising results but require expensive training data annotations, while unsupervised hashing methods investigate image similarity without annotations. However, limited studies have applied quantization for deep unsupervised retrieval. In this paper, we propose Self-supervised Product Quantization (SPQ), the first unsupervised end-to-end deep quantization-based image retrieval method. SPQ learns the feature extractor and codewords jointly using self-supervised contrastive learning and cross quantized contrastive learning. Our experiments demonstrate that SPQ achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised settings on fast image retrieval datasets. The contributions of our work include the development of SPQ as the first deep unsupervised quantization-based image retrieval scheme, the introduction of cross quantized contrastive learning for discriminative representations, and the verification of SPQ's superior retrieval performance even in truly unsupervised settings.
