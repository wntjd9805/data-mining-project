This paper introduces a new conditional generative adversarial network called Dual Projection GAN (P2GAN). The P2GAN combines the flexibility of projection and performs explicit label matching. By utilizing auxiliary classification losses, the discriminator is able to exploit useful information for the generator. The paper also proposes adaptive approaches to weighing data matching and label matching, and presents two variants for explicit data matching and label matching. Extensive experiments are conducted on various datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models.
