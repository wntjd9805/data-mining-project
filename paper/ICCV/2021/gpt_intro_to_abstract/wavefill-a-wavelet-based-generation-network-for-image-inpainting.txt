This paper introduces Wave-Fill, an innovative image inpainting framework that addresses the challenges of generating realistic and high-fidelity image inpainting results. Traditional image inpainting methods often face a trade-off between perceptual quality and reconstruction, resulting in inter-frequency conflicts. The proposed Wave-Fill framework leverages wavelet transform to complete corrupted image regions at multiple frequency bands separately, allowing for explicit and separate optimization of high-frequency and low-frequency objectives. Additionally, a novel frequency region attentive normalization (FRAN) scheme is introduced to align and fuse multi-frequency features, ensuring consistency and effectively suppressing artifacts. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of Wave-Fill compared to state-of-the-art methods. This work contributes to the field of image inpainting by providing an effective and innovative solution for generating realistic and visually plausible image inpainting results.
