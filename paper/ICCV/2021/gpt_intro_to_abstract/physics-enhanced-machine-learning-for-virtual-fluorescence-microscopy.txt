The optical microscope is widely used across various disciplines, but advancements in computer software have led to a decrease in direct human viewing of microscope images. Many images are now processed by computers before being analyzed. This includes the creation of fluorescence images from bright-field data, known as "virtual fluorescence." However, microscope hardware has not evolved significantly, leading to limitations in resolution, field-of-view, image contrast, and depth-of-field. These limitations may impact the accuracy of automated analysis. This study aims to optimize the hardware of a new microscope design to improve the performance of a deep learning-based image labeling task. A modified neural network, including a physical model of the microscope, is presented, and the physical model is optimized jointly with the deep neural network during training. The proposed system models the microscope illumination pattern as a set of linear weights integrated into the DNN, allowing for end-to-end optimization. The optimized "physical" weights represent the LED brightnesses and colors used in the experimental setup. The study also investigates the impact of illumination pattern design on virtual fluorescence image generation and explores the relationship between the number of designed illumination patterns and task performance. The findings show that optimized patterns yield higher performance and provide physical intuition that can improve future data collection strategies. The method presented in this study offers a cheaper, customizable, and easily deployable alternative to existing virtual fluorescence approaches.
