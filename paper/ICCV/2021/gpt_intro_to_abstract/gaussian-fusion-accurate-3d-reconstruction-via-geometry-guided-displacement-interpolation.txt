This paper introduces a unique fusion framework called Gaussian Fusion for 3D reconstruction using RGB-D sensors. Unlike existing depth map back-projection approaches, the proposed method is based on geometry-guided displacement interpolation. The paper assumes that local surfaces follow a Gaussian distribution and that the metrics between distributions can be characterized by Wasserstein distance. It also assumes the existence of independent transference plans between local surfaces. The paper pairs measurements with optimal transference plans using the mass transport problem (Monge-Kantorovich problem) and employs geodesic curves and a novel advection strategy to address uncertainties. The contributions of the paper include the introduction of displacement interpolation in 3D reconstruction, a flexible interpolation scheme based on geodesic curves, and a novel advection strategy guided by local geometric properties. Experimental results on real data validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
