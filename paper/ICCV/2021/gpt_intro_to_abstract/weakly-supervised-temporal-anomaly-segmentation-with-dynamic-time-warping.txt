Anomaly detection, or the identification of unusual patterns in data, has been extensively researched in various domains. The detection of anomalies in temporal data, such as multivariate time-series and videos, has gained significant attention due to its applications in real-world scenarios. Traditional methods classify input instances as normal or anomalous, whereas recent studies focus on localizing and segmenting anomalies within an instance. This paper aims to precisely localize anomalies in temporal data by detecting anomalous temporal segments. The main challenge is distinguishing anomalous time points from normal time points without using point-level anomaly labels for model training. The dominant approach to localizing temporal anomalies is point-level anomaly detection based on the reconstruction of input instances. However, unsupervised learning methods show limited performance due to the absence of information about the target anomalies. To overcome this limitation, the paper proposes a deep learning framework called WETAS (WEak supervision for Temporal Anomaly Segmentation). WETAS leverages instance-level labels to detect anomalous segments within an instance, which is more realistic than point-level detection. WETAS utilizes weak labels for training and infers sequential anomaly labels, which act as rough segmentation masks. The model optimizes the classification of input instances based on their instance-level labels and aligns them with their sequential pseudo-labels using dynamic time warping alignment. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that WETAS successfully learns normal and anomalous patterns with weak supervision, outperforming other baselines in detecting anomalous points. Additionally, qualitative comparisons show that WETAS provides smoothed detection results that specify the starting and end points of each anomalous event.
