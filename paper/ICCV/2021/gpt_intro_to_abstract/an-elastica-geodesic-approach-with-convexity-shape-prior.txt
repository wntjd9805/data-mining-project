Image segmentation is a challenging problem in the fields of image analysis and computer vision. Many segmentation approaches have been developed, with energy minimization-based models incorporating priors on target regions showing promising results. In particular, geometric priors, such as assuming short target boundaries in terms of Euclidean curve length, have been widely used. However, using geometric regularity as a single prior can be insufficient for complex images. Therefore, shape-driven priors, based on statistical models of target regions or contours, have been proposed. Shape priors can improve segmentation accuracy, even without reliable image appearance features. Convexity and star convexity shape priors have recently gained attention, with approaches categorized into discrete or continuous types. Discrete approaches use these shape priors as regularization terms in energy functionals, while continuous approaches incorporate them into active contours based on the level set formulation. Some approaches also consider curvature regularization. Geodesic models, which minimize curve length, have been used for edge-based segmentation. However, they often require careful initialization and are sensitive to noise. Existing geodesic approaches have only utilized geometric priors. In this paper, we propose a new elastica geodesic model that integrates image features and convexity shape priors. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a new elastica geodesic approach with convexity shape prior, (2) solutions for computing simple closed and convex geodesic paths using the Hamiltonian fast marching method, and (3) integration of region- and edge-based features in the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
