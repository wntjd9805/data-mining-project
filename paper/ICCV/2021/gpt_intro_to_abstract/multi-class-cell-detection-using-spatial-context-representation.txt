In this paper, we present a novel approach for joint cell detection and classification that incorporates spatial context information. The identification of different cell types in whole-slide histology images is crucial for automated diagnosis and prognosis in digital pathology. The spatial arrangement of cells can provide valuable insights into the interaction between tumor and immune cells and can be correlated with clinical outcomes. Our method focuses on the detection and classification of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumor budding, both of which are important prognostic biomarkers. Existing cell detection methods either use object detection algorithms or segment nuclei individually. While segmentation methods provide detailed morphology information, they require time-consuming nuclei mask annotation. To address this limitation, we propose using weakly-supervised methods that only require point annotations at the centers of nuclei. However, cell classification remains a challenging task. Cells of different types can have similar appearances, while cells of the same type can exhibit large variations in morphology and texture. Pathologists often rely on contextual information and tissue architecture to classify cells accurately. For example, the spatial relationships and architectural patterns of cells can help distinguish between different cell types. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-task learning approach that explicitly learns a spatial-context-aware representation of cells. We introduce spatial statistical functions, specifically the K-function, as descriptors of cells' spatial context. We also introduce a spatial context prediction module and a deep clustering module to facilitate the learning of the representation. Our method, called MCSpatNet, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on three benchmark datasets for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer. In summary, our contributions include a novel method for joint cell detection and classification that incorporates spatial context, the use of spatial statistical functions as descriptors of cells' spatial context, and the introduction of spatial context prediction and deep clustering modules. Our code is publicly available for further research.
