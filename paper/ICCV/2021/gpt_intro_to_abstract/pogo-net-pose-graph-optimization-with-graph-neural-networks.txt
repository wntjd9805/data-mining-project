Visual localization, or camera pose regression, is essential for computer vision and robotics tasks such as robot navigation, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. Pose-graph optimization (PGO), an important component of camera pose estimation pipelines, involves iterative estimations of camera poses and the optimization of the global view-graph. However, traditional PGO methods suffer from high computational costs, inaccurate measurements, and overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel PGO scheme called PoGO-Net, which leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to address these challenges. PoGO-Net encodes edge messages with geometric constraints and local consistency information, updates node features based on connected edges and neighboring nodes, and removes outlier edges using topological parameterized network layers. Additionally, our network is capable of processing large-scale datasets in real-time and can be integrated with both conventional and learning-based Structure-from-Motion (SfM) systems. Experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of our proposed network.
