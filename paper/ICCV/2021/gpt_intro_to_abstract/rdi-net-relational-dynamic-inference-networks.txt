Recent years have seen an increasing interest in dynamic inference networks, which have been applied in various fields such as image classification, action recognition, and object detection. These networks aim to reduce computational redundancy by adapting the execution path for a given sample during inference. Existing methods typically use routers to make decisions on whether a convolutional block should be executed based on the output of the previous block. However, these routers only consider short-range dependencies and neglect the features of preceding routers. In this paper, we propose a novel relational router that explicitly models the relation between routers, enabling them to make decisions in a long-range manner. The relational router aggregates the features of preceding routers using a router-wise directed relation graph. We also introduce a Sample Relation Module (SRM) to incorporate the correlation between samples and their executing paths. Our proposed method, called Relational Dynamic Inference Network (RDI-Net), achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of performance and computational cost reduction.
