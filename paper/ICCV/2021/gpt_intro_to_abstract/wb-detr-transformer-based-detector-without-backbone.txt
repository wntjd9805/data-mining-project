CNN-based approaches have been dominant in object detection tasks for years, with the backbone network playing a crucial role in these methods. However, to move away from the CNN-based design paradigm, Carion et al. proposed a transformer-based detector called DETR that eliminates many hand-crafted operations. Although DETR shows promise, it lacks the ability to model local information effectively. To address this limitation, we present WB-DETR, a DETR-based detector that does not rely on a backbone network. Instead, WB-DETR serializes the image and encodes local features into individual tokens. Additionally, we introduce the LIE-T2T module to enhance the modeling of local information in tokens. Compared to the DETR baseline, WB-DETR without a backbone offers a more unified and streamlined approach to object detection. This work challenges the traditional modules combination design paradigm of backbone-neck-head and encourages researchers to reconsider the design of object detection systems.
