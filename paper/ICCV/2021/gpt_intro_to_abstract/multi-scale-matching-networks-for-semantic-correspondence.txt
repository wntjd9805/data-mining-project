Finding pixel-wise correspondences between semantically similar images is a challenging problem in computer vision. It has practical applications in various tasks such as optical flow, geometric matching, object recognition, and semantic segmentation. While deep features have improved matching accuracy, the multi-scale and hierarchical structures of deep convolutional neural networks have not been thoroughly explored for semantic correspondence. This paper proposes a multi-scale matching network that leverages the hierarchical structure of deep convolutional neural networks to find semantic correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner. The network consists of an encoder and a decoder, with the encoder capturing semantic information at different levels and the decoder enhancing spatial resolution and matching details. The proposed network achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular benchmarks.
