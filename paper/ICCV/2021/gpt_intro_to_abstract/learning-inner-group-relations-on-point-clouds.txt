Point cloud processing is widely used in various applications, but learning from point clouds can be challenging due to their irregularity. Previous approaches convert point clouds into multi-view images or regular volumes before processing, but these transformations result in loss of geometric information and require complex preprocessing. PointNet and PointNet++ have addressed some of these issues but still lack shape awareness. RS-CNN computes point features based on low-level geometric relations but lacks semantic relation learning. Self-attention has shown potential in natural language processing but can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose the Group Relation Aggregator (GRA), which combines low-level and high-level relations for efficient learning. We introduce the bottleneck concept to improve efficiency. We evaluate our method on classification and segmentation benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art results. Our contributions include a scalable local aggregator for point clouds and an expandable and efficient RPNet hierarchy.
