Multi-view Stereo (MVS) is a crucial problem in computer vision that aims to reconstruct dense 3D geometry from multiple images. While recent MVS studies have made significant progress by incorporating traditional approaches with learning-based methods, collecting accurate and complete ground truth 3D structures remains challenging. The collection process is time-consuming and requires labor-intensive post-processing. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised MVS problem called Sparse Ground truth-based MVS (SGT-MVS), where only sparse ground truth 3D structures are available for training. We investigate the fundamental characteristics of SGT-MVS and identify key aspects for addressing this problem. By leveraging the systematic depth reasoning principle of MVS, we can estimate depth values reasonably on the non-occluded region using a few ground truth 3D points. However, predicting accurate depths in occluded pixels and edges remains difficult. To overcome this, we focus on improving the discriminability of accurately predicted non-occluded regions while propagating accurate depth values to edges, occlusions, and erroneous regions. By using a probability map to detect erroneous regions, we separate accurately predicted regions and apply a 3D Point Consistency Loss to enhance reconstruction performance. To propagate these improved predictions, we introduce a Coarse-to-fine Reliable Depth Propagation module. We evaluate our method on sparse ground truth generated from original dense 3D structures and demonstrate that our SGT-MVSNet framework can successfully solve the SGT-MVS problem, achieving comparable performance to supervised MVS methods. Our contributions include introducing the SGT-MVS problem, proposing the SGT-MVSNet framework, and validating its effectiveness through extensive experiments.
