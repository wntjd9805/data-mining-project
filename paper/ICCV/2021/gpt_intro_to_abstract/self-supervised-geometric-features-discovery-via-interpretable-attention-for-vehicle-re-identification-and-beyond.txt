Vehicle ReID, or vehicle re-identification, is a challenging problem in video surveillance due to the subtle differences among vehicles of the same make and the variations in viewpoints of the same vehicle. Recent works have shown that incorporating explicit mechanisms to discover and focus on informative vehicle parts, such as wheels and manufacturer logos, can improve the discriminative feature extraction for vehicle ReID. However, these approaches often require labor-intensive fine-grained annotations or manual editing of the original data, which limits their applicability. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that learns discriminative geometric features for vehicle ReID without the need for fine-grained annotations. We leverage self-supervised learning to optimize an encoder network and generate ground truths for supervision. We introduce an interpretable attention mechanism, which is easy to explain and focuses on physically important locations, to highlight regions of interest in the vehicle. By weighting the attention map on low-level vehicle representations, we obtain emphasized features for vehicle ReID.Our contributions include: 1. Successfully learning informative geometric features for vehicle ReID without fine-grained annotations.2. Introducing an interpretable attention module that highlights automatic regions-of-interest.3. Achieving state-of-the-art performance on widely used vehicle ReID benchmarks, compared to existing works that involve more manual annotations.4. Visualizing the reliable and consistent geometric features learned by our framework.5. Demonstrating the scalability of our approach through experiments on person ReID and MTMC vehicle tracking.Overall, our framework offers a promising solution to the challenging problem of vehicle ReID, with the ability to learn discriminative features and locate informative regions without the need for extensive manual annotations.
