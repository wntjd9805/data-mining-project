Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, and the choice of object representation plays a crucial role in its success. The most popular object detection methods rely on anchor-based or point-based representations. Anchor-based methods utilize predefined anchor boxes, but they require manual design of hyperparameters for different scenarios, and can be confused by overlapping objects. Point-based methods replace anchors with a set of points, but lose adjacent information and struggle with object detection in coarse features.To address these limitations, this paper introduces CrossDet, a novel anchor-free object detection network that uses learned cross lines as object representations. Cross lines adaptively grow along the horizontal and vertical directions of the object's bounding box, focusing on important information and avoiding overlapping features. The proposed crossline extraction module encodes long-range context and selectively samples line features to improve object representation. Additionally, a decoupled regression mechanism is designed to handle horizontal and vertical lines separately and refine the detection results. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CrossDet in accurately detecting objects.The contributions of this paper include the introduction of an anchor-free object detection network that employs automatically growing cross lines as object representations, a crossline extraction module that adaptively aggregates line features, and the validation of the proposed method on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets, showcasing its benefits in object detection accuracy.
