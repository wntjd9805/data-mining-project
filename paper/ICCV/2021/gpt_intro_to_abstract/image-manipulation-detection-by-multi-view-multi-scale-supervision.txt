This paper focuses on the auto-detection of image manipulation, specifically copy-move, splicing, and inpainting. The state-of-the-art methods for manipulation detection are deep learning based, with a focus on pixel-level detection. However, existing semantic segmentation networks are not optimal for this task, as they are dataset-dependent and do not generalize well. This paper proposes a new deep neural network, called MVSS-Net, which learns semantic-agnostic features for manipulation detection. The network incorporates an edge-supervised branch and a noise-sensitive branch to suppress image content and strike a balance between sensitivity and specificity. The proposed MVSS-Net is trained with multi-scale supervision, allowing it to learn from authentic images and improve model specificity. Experimental results demonstrate that MVSS-Net outperforms existing methods in image manipulation detection.
