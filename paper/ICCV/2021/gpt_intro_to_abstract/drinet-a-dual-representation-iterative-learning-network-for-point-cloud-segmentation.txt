This paper introduces a new framework for high-quality and real-time point cloud semantic segmentation. Point cloud data is crucial in various applications like autonomous driving and augmented reality, and accurate segmentation methods are needed for these tasks. The authors address the challenges of processing point cloud data with deep learning, which is difficult due to its sparsity and irregularity. They propose a novel network architecture called DRINet that can convert between pointwise and voxelwise representations, allowing for iterative feature learning. The authors also introduce a multi-scale pooling layer and an attentive gathering layer to improve feature extraction and reduce computation cost. Extensive experiments are conducted on indoor and outdoor datasets, and the proposed DRINet outperforms existing methods in terms of both accuracy and runtime efficiency. The paper concludes that DRINet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset while running in real-time on an Nvidia GPU.
