Imaging through turbulent refractive mediums presents challenges in computer vision due to non-linear light transport causing distortions in perceived images. The removal of these non-rigid image distortions is crucial for optimal performance in various vision applications. Air turbulence distortion occurs due to changing refractive index fields, while water turbulence distortion is induced by light refraction at the water-air interface. Different physical mechanisms cause these distortions, necessitating distinct enhancement methods. This paper introduces an unsupervised network capable of estimating and removing non-rigid distortions from both air and water turbulent images. The network models distortions as deformable grids and utilizes a grid-based rendering network inspired by the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) framework to generate distortion-free images. The network is optimized through a two-step process and does not require labeled datasets for training. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-captured images demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method in correcting geometric distortions for both air and water turbulence. The contributions of this paper include the joint estimation of non-rigid distortions and recovery of the distortion-free image, leveraging the position encoding operator for high-quality image generation, the introduction of a two-step optimization framework, and achieving state-of-the-art performance in atmospheric turbulence removal and imaging through water distortions.
