Domain adaptation is a prominent research area in computer science, focusing on mitigating the performance drop when deploying a model on a new domain with a different distribution from the one it was trained on. Existing research primarily focuses on unsupervised domain adaptation, where models are trained using unlabeled target data and labeled source data. In this paper, we diverge from the mainstream research direction and investigate the potential benefits of incorporating a few labeled target samples, referred to as "landmarks," into the adaptation process. This problem, known as semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA), is practical and requires minimal labeling effort but has been under-investigated.Previous works in the deep learning era have used landmarks to measure the data distribution mismatch between source and target domains, but their contributions have been diluted when optimizing the cross-entropy loss with a larger amount of labeled source samples. In this paper, we propose Enhanced Categorical Alignment and Consistency Learning (ECACL), a SSDA framework that combines multiple techniques to align domains from different perspectives. By explicitly aligning samples of the same category from the source and target domains, we aim to overcome the bias towards the source domain.To tackle the issue of overfitting due to the limited number of landmarks, we utilize RandAugment, a recently proposed data augmentation technique that applies various transformations to images. By applying RandAugment to both labeled source samples and landmarks, we enhance categorical alignment and improve model generalizability. Additionally, we introduce consistency learning, a successful solution to label scarce problems, to address the SSDA challenge. By enforcing the consistency constraint through data augmentation and pseudo labeling, we enhance the model's robustness to changes in the image space and facilitate label propagation from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain.We integrate these techniques into the ECACL framework, which aligns domains from different perspectives using different combinations of inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that ECACL significantly improves the state-of-the-art performance on common evaluation benchmarks for SSDA. Overall, the contributions of this paper include the proposal of ECACL, a holistic SSDA framework that combines multiple domain alignment techniques, a comprehensive ablation study and analysis of ECACL, and significant advancements in the state-of-the-art performance for SSDA.
