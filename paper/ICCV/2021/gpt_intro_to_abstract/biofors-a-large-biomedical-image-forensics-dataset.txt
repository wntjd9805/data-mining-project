Abstract:Multimedia forensic research has become increasingly important in addressing various forms of misinformation and manipulation, including digital forgeries, copy-move and splicing manipulations, and semantic forgeries in social media content. Biomedical image forensics, a distinct research domain, focuses on detecting research misconduct in biomedical publications, such as plagiarism, fabrication, and falsification. This type of misconduct has serious consequences beyond ethics, leading to retractions and financial losses. In this paper, we specifically focus on the detection of manipulation or inappropriate duplication of scientific images in biomedical literature.Manipulation and duplication of biomedical images have become a nuisance in the biomedical sciences community. Duplication involves reusing parts of images from one experiment to misrepresent results for unrelated experiments, while tampering involves forgery at the pixel or patch level to hide unfavorable aspects or produce favorable results. Detecting these forgeries is more challenging than detecting social media manipulations due to complex patterns and lack of contextual cues. In addition, manipulations may involve images across different published documents, making detection even more difficult.To address these challenges, we present BioFors, the first publicly available biomedical image forensics dataset, along with benchmarking tasks. Our objective is to advance biomedical forensic research by enabling the identification of suspicious images with high confidence. We hope that BioFors will contribute to the development of algorithms and software that can assist reviewers in identifying manipulated images in research documents.We acknowledge that the final determination of malicious intent behind a suspicious image should be left to the forensic analyst, considering cases where duplication or tampering might be justified or result from mistaken or naive actions. The BioFors dataset consists of manually cropped images belonging to four major categories and covers popular biomedical image manipulations. The dataset and forgery detection tasks are detailed in Section 3.The contributions of our work include the creation of a large-scale biomedical image forensics dataset, the development of a taxonomy for forgery detection tasks that can be benchmarked and evaluated with standard computer vision tasks, and an extensive analysis of the challenges in biomedical forensics and the limitations of standard computer vision models when applied to biomedical images.
