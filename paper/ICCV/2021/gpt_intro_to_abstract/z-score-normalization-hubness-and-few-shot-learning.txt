In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made significant advancements in various areas of computer vision, including object recognition, semantic segmentation, and image generation. However, training effective CNN models for visual recognition requires a large number of manually labeled training samples, which can be expensive and infeasible for rare object categories. Few-shot learning (FSL) has emerged as a solution to the data-hungry nature of deep recognition models. FSL aims to recognize novel object classes with only a few labeled samples by leveraging a set of base classes with ample training samples.To achieve few-shot learning, recent FSL methods have adopted the meta-learning framework and episodic training. These methods train models on meta-tasks or episodes sampled from base class images to simulate few-shot classification tasks for novel classes. Most of these methods focus on meta-learning the embedding network of the recognition model. During inference, class prototypes are constructed using support set samples in the embedding space, and query samples are classified using nearest neighbor search.However, using nearest neighbor search in a high-dimensional embedding space can lead to a hubness problem. The hubness problem arises from the existence of hubs, which are the class prototypes that are nearest neighbors to many test samples, irrespective of their actual classes. Hubs significantly affect recognition performance. This problem has been largely ignored in the current literature.In this paper, we address the hubness problem in FSL by proposing alternative normalization strategies during pre-training or episodic training. We discover that z-score normalization (ZN), a simple transformation operation at the feature level, effectively alleviates the hubness problem. ZN subtracts the mean of all feature components and divides each component by the standard deviation. Our experiments demonstrate that applying ZN during pre-training and episodic training improves the performance of various embedding/metric-based FSL methods.The main contributions of this paper are three-fold: 1) We identify and bring attention to the hubness problem in FSL. 2) We propose the use of z-score feature normalization to alleviate the negative effects of the hubness problem and provide theoretical analysis on its effectiveness. 3) We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of the simple ZN operation in boosting the performance of state-of-the-art embedding/metric-based FSL methods.
