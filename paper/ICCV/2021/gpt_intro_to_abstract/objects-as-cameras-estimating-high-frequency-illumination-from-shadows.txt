This paper explores the reconstruction of incident illumination patterns based on the known geometry and material properties of a scene. By representing the illumination as a hemispherical photograph, the object in the scene can effectively be turned into a camera. The paper focuses on using cast shadows to estimate the incident illumination, as shadows are easier to interpret when the object is illuminated from a single direction. Previous methods have been limited to controlled setups and require precise surface normal information. In contrast, this paper proposes a method that only requires the shape of the object and the shape and albedo of the shadowed surface. The paper also discusses the requirement for partial reconstruction of the scene and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in estimating the incident illumination from a single photograph. The contributions of this paper include the recovery of high-frequency environment maps, a practical technique for approximating light transport in natural settings, solving the inverse problem for scenes with unknown surface materials, and examining the structure of the ray transport matrix for reconstruction and object-camera performance assessment.
