In this paper, we address the task of 3D building reconstruction from monocular oblique remote sensing images. Existing methods for building reconstruction have limitations such as reliance on expensive LiDAR data or the requirement of multiple homologous images. The limited information in a monocular image, along with challenges such as partial visibility, shadows, and varying building heights, make 3D reconstruction challenging. While building footprint extraction has been extensively explored, these methods often produce poor results for high-rise buildings in oblique images. Similarly, existing methods for building height estimation focus on near-nadir images and produce raster outputs. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method that includes a 3D building reconstruction network and a 3D model optimization method. The network addresses the ill-posed problem by learning the visible parts of buildings and their relations through semantic-related and offset-related tasks. The optimization method improves height estimation and polygonization based on prior knowledge of building structures. Our method significantly improves height estimation performance and segmentation F1-score compared to state-of-the-art methods.Our main contributions are as follows: 1. We design MTBR-Net, a multi-task building reconstruction network that accurately learns the geometric properties of oblique images and produces 3D models for buildings with various heights and complex shapes.2. We propose a 3D model optimization method that integrates the network outputs based on prior knowledge of building structures, resulting in improved height estimation accuracy and valid shapes in vector 3D models.3. We release a new dataset for monocular 3D building reconstruction, consisting of oblique images from multiple views and over 200,000 annotated buildings with a wide range of heights.
