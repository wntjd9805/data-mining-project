This paper introduces a new Large Scale Multi-Illuminant dataset (LSMI) for multi-illumination white balancing in cameras. While previous works have focused on single illumination scenes, this dataset contains realistic scenes with multiple illuminants. The dataset provides pixel-level ground truth illumination maps, chromaticity of illuminants, and mixture ratios. This dataset can serve as a catalyst for research on multi-illumination white balancing. The paper formulates the multi-illumination WB problem as an image-to-image problem using a deep CNN, and demonstrates its effectiveness through experiments and a user study.
