This paper addresses the issue of parsing errors in scene parsing, which is the task of segmenting an image into different regions with specific class labels. Previous methods have struggled with diverse appearances and complicated topology structures among objects, leading to errors such as "spot" predictions, ambiguous results, and unrealistic predictions. While previous works focused more on recognition rather than region clustering, this paper proposes an approach that constructs affinity dependency among semantic regions to reason global affinities among objects and alleviate segmentation errors. The approach involves splitting feature maps into regions and exploring region-level correlations to cluster features from the same region, thereby removing "spot" pieces in predictions. A coarse segmentation mask is generated to define the split regions, and a graph-based region affinity reasoning module is used to impose region-level constraints. The paper also introduces a semantic region loss that treats pixels in the same region as a whole to explicitly boost inner correlations. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several scene parsing benchmark datasets. Overall, the contributions of this paper are the bi-directional graph based on class-correlations, the computed affinity-aware features, the semantic region loss, and the improved performance on scene parsing benchmarks.
