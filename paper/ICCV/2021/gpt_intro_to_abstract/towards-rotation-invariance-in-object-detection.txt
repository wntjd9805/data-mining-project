Object detectors that are rotation invariant are desirable in order to accurately detect objects in rotated scenes. However, traditional methods like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are not rotation invariant. To address this issue, rotation augmentation can be employed by expanding the training dataset with data at new rotation angles. In object detection, determining the axis-aligned rotated bounding box label is crucial. While rotating the object shape and re-computing the bounding box is simple when the shape is known, this is not the case in object detection where the shape is unknown. The prevailing approach is to select a label large enough to completely overlap the rotated box, but this can lead to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose an advanced solution that achieves better performance on multiple object detection datasets. Our solution involves deriving an optimal elliptical shape prior to determine the rotated box label and introducing a novel Rotation Uncertainty (RU) Loss function to adapt the labels at higher rotations using priors from lower rotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on datasets where rotation is important, such as Pascal VOC and Transparent Object Bin Picking, as well as on novel test time rotations on MS COCO. The proposed modifications can be implemented with just a few lines of code, making the current Largest Box method unnecessary. However, it should be noted that this paper focuses solely on performing rotation augmentation on axis-aligned bounding boxes and not on finding the best overall way to use rotation data augmentation.
