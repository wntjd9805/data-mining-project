This paper focuses on the problem of visual relationship detection (VRD) and human object interaction (HOI), where a two-level hierarchical structure composed of parts needs to be detected and localized in an image. Existing approaches for VRD and HOI have typically used two-stage processes or single-stage approaches with end-to-end learning. However, two-stage methods generally perform better, while single-stage methods are easier to train. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new approach called part-and-sum Transformers (PST) for composite set detection in VRD and HOI. PST differs from existing detection transformers by representing each object as a vector-based query in a two-level set. The importance of explicitly representing the triplet as a whole is emphasized, and PST uses composite queries and attention mechanisms to model the interactions between the sum and parts. The efficacy of the proposed PST algorithm is demonstrated through systematic experiments, which analyze the roles of the sum and part queries, as well as intra- and inter-token attention in Transformers. The effectiveness of PST is validated in the VRD and HOI tasks. Overall, this paper presents a novel approach to composite set detection and contributes to the field of computer vision and object detection.
