Remote sensing plays a crucial role in various applications such as land use monitoring, precision agriculture, disaster prevention, wildfire detection, vector-borne disease surveillance, and climate change. With recent advancements in deep learning and computer vision, there is enormous potential for automated analysis of remote sensing data. However, the lack of annotated data and the highly curated nature of existing datasets pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose Seasonal Contrast (SeCo), a methodology for pre-training rich, transferable representations for remote sensing applications. SeCo leverages the temporal information provided by satellite revisit, capturing seasonal changes in remote sensing images. We employ a self-supervised learning model that encourages the representation to be invariant to seasonal changes, while also allowing for variations in certain downstream tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SeCo pre-training on land-cover classification and change detection tasks, outperforming ImageNet and MoCo pre-training. Our contributions include a method for constructing uncurated and unlabeled remote sensing datasets, integrating contrastive self-supervised learning with temporal information, and achieving state-of-the-art results on various remote sensing tasks.
