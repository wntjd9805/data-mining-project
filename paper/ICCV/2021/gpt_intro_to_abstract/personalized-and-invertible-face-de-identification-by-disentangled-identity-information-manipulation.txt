The widespread use of handheld devices and social media platforms has increased image production and dissemination, resulting in serious threats to image privacy and security. While early privacy-obfuscation techniques have been proven ineffective, recent methods based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown promising results in improving the quality and utility of de-identification. However, most existing de-identification methods focus only on the protection phase and do not consider the need to restore the original image in certain scenarios. This paper proposes a personalized and invertible face de-identification method that aims to retain visual similarities with the original image while protecting sensitive identity information. The proposed method consists of three stages: disentangled attribute extraction, identity modification based on a user-defined password and privacy level, and image reconstruction. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach offers flexibility in defining passwords and reduces complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves better privacy and utility performance, as well as higher-quality recovery results.
