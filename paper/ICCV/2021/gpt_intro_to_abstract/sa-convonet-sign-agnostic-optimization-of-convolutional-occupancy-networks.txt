Surface reconstruction from point clouds is a critical task for intelligent systems to perceive and understand 3D worlds. It has practical applications in computer-aided design, 3D printing, and robotics grasping. Traditional methods approach this problem through mathematical optimization based on pre-defined geometric priors, while learning-based methods learn geometric priors from large-scale 3D datasets. Implicit field representation of 3D surfaces has gained popularity due to its ability to enable surface reconstruction with infinite resolution and arbitrary topology. However, existing methods still lack scalability, generality, and applicability. In this paper, we propose a sign-agnostic optimization approach to learn implicit surface reconstructions using convolutional occupancy networks. This approach simultaneously achieves scalability, generality, and applicability by optimizing pre-trained occupancy prediction networks. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach for surface reconstruction from un-oriented point clouds.
