Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common and leading cause of death worldwide. X-ray angiography is considered the gold standard for CAD diagnosis, but the low-power X-ray used in this procedure often results in noisy and low-contrast images, making it difficult to accurately segment vessels from the background artifacts. Existing vessel segmentation methods face challenges such as the need for manual tuning, lack of annotated data, and the complex nature of medical images. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised vessel segmentation method specifically designed for coronary angiograms. We utilize a fractal synthetic module and an attention-guided generator to generate synthetic vessels and guide the segmentation process. We also introduce cycle consistency and segmentation loss to improve segmentation accuracy. To support our research, we create a new dataset called XCAD containing annotated coronary angiograms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on coronary vessel segmentation, as well as competitive performance on retinal vessel segmentation tasks. This paper presents the first self-supervised method for vessel segmentation and contributes to the field of computer-aided diagnosis in cardiology.
