This paper addresses the problem of identifying and rejecting bad seeds in computer vision tasks. Many computer vision tasks require additional information, known as seeds, to be provided along with the primary input. However, the evaluation of these tasks typically ignores the noisy processes by which seeds are generated. Existing research has explored the performance of computer vision models with poor primary inputs, but there has been no focus on the identification and rejection of bad seeds. This paper proposes a novel training method called Dual-loss Additional Error Regression (DAER) to address this challenge. DAER considers the challenges of seed rejection separately during training and combines them during inference to predict the effect of a candidate seed on the downstream task. The performance of DAER is evaluated on two tasks: keypoint-conditioned viewpoint estimation and hierarchical scene classification. A task-agnostic benchmark evaluation method is introduced to assess the performance of seed rejection methods. The contributions of this paper include a formalization of the seed rejection problem, the DAER method, and an evaluation that demonstrates the effectiveness of DAER in reducing the number of seeds that need to be reviewed for a given target performance.
