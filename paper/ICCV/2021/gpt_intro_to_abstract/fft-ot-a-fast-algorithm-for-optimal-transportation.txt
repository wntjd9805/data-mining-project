The recent development of optimal transportation (OT) has resulted in its widespread use in various fields such as vision, deep learning, and medical imaging. OT maps are used to measure the differences among probability distributions and to register images or 3D shapes. However, improving the computational efficiency of OT maps is a major challenge due to their highly non-linear nature. Existing methods, such as the Sinkhorn algorithm and convex geometric variational algorithms, have limitations in terms of speed or accuracy when solving large-scale OT problems. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called FFT-OT, which utilizes Fast Fourier Transformation to compute large-scale OT maps efficiently and accurately. Our algorithm is based on three key ideas: (1) using fixed point iterations to find the Brenier potential, (2) formulating the obliqueness boundary condition to simplify the problem, and (3) utilizing FFT to solve the Poisson equation during the fixed point iterations. Our FFT-OT algorithm offers significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. It can be implemented on GPUs or FPGAs and can be generalized to higher dimensional situations. The algorithm has great potential to handle large-scale real-time OT problems. The main disadvantage is that it requires the probability distributions' supports to be rectangular, although it can be generalized to general convex domains. Additionally, the algorithm is currently focused on 2-dimensional cases but can be extended to higher dimensions.
