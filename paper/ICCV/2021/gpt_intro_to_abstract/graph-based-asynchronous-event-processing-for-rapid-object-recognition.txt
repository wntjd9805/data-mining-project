Rapid object recognition is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving and flying drones. Event cameras, which have high temporal resolution and low latency, have gained attention due to their ability to discard redundant information and capture brightness changes as individual events. However, existing methods for processing event cameras are limited and often involve transforming the event data into regular frames or voxel grids, which obscures the data's natural invariance. This paper proposes a novel graph-based recursive algorithm with a sliding window strategy to efficiently process event-by-event data while maintaining accuracy. The algorithm reduces computational complexity by exploiting local spatial connectivity and reusing previous calculations. Additionally, a novel event-specific radius search algorithm is introduced to make graph construction faster. The proposed algorithm achieves comparable performance to batch-wise methods on recognition tasks and enables early object recognition. Experimental results support the effectiveness of the algorithm.
