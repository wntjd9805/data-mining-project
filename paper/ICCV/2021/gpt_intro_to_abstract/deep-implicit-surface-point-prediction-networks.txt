In recent years, there has been significant interest in using deep learning-based methods for 3D reconstruction of objects in the vision, graphics, and animation industry. However, explicit 3D shape representations have posed challenges in reconstructing surfaces with arbitrary topology and capturing fine details. To address these limitations, several implicit shape representations using deep neural networks have been proposed. One such representation is the Signed Distance Function (SDF) used in DeepSDF, but it is limited to modeling closed surfaces and requires watertight ground truth data. Another approach, SAL, assumes closed surfaces represented by point clouds, leading to representations that only describe closed shapes. NDF overcomes these limitations by using an unsigned distance function (UDF), but it suffers from noisy and low-fidelity estimation of local differential geometric properties. Additionally, existing methods require a backward pass for estimating these properties, leading to increased memory footprint and time complexity. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel implicit shape representation called the Closest Surface-Point (CSP) function, which models both open and closed shapes of arbitrary topology and enables efficient computation of differential geometric properties. Unlike previous methods, CSP allows for fast and memory-efficient estimation of surface normals with a forward pass. The paper also presents a rendering algorithm and a meshing algorithm for CSPs, demonstrating the potential of CSP for high-fidelity 3D representation and downstream applications. Overall, the contributions of this paper include the CSP representation, efficient normal estimation, and faster surface extraction technique.
