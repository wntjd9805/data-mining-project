Matting is a widely used process in photography and film-making to separate the foreground from the background and composite it with a new background. With advancements in deep neural networks, automatic matting has become more mature. However, existing deep learning matting methods mostly extract pure human foreground under controlled settings. In this paper, we propose a new approach to handle situations where humans are interacting with objects. Current algorithms only focus on the body region, ignoring the object interaction. We believe that foreground matting algorithms should be able to handle such scenarios. We present a state-of-the-art foreground matting approach for handling challenging human-interactive images.
