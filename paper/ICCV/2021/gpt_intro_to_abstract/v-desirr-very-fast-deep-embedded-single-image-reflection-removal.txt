Image capture near reflective surfaces, such as glass windows, poses challenges due to unwanted reflection artifacts. These artifacts not only affect image quality but also impact high-level tasks like image recognition. Therefore, the removal of reflections is a desirable goal and an active area of research in image processing and computer vision. Previous methods have imposed handcrafted constraints on the problem, but they struggle to adapt to the complex reflection patterns found in real-life scenarios. To address this, data-driven approaches using deep neural networks have been proposed, but they suffer from high computation requirements and the inability to remove reflections from high-resolution images. In this paper, we propose a novel scale-space reflection removal method that increases the receptive field while minimizing computational overhead. Our approach utilizes a scale-space representation and identical deep CNNs at each scale, combined with Convolutional Guided Filters, to efficiently remove reflections. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method on high-resolution images, showing superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our method can be easily deployed on resource-limited devices such as smartphones, making it highly applicable in real-life situations. We provide a high-resolution dataset to facilitate future evaluations.
