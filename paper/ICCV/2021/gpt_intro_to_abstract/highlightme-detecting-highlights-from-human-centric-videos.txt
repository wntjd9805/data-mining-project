The paper introduces the problem of irrelevant and uninteresting content in human-centric videos and the need for efficient browsing. The authors discuss existing techniques for detecting highlights and summarizing videos. They emphasize the importance of leveraging human-centric modalities such as poses and faces for effective highlight detection. The paper presents the main contributions of an end-to-end learning system that detects highlights from human-centric videos without requiring domain-specific knowledge or annotations. The approach uses graph-based representations and spatial-temporal graph convolutions to map per-frame modalities to highlight scores. The authors highlight that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance in highlight detection across various domains and user preferences. Evaluation results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
