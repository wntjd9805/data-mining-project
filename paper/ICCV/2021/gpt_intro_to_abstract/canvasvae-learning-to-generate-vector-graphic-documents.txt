This paper introduces the concept of generative learning of vector graphic documents using a variational auto-encoder (VAE) architecture called CanvasVAE. Unlike previous studies that focused on conditional layout inference, CanvasVAE considers unconditional document generation, including both the canvas and a variable number of elements. The encoder-decoder architecture employs a Transformer-based network to handle the variable-length sequence of elements in a document. The paper also presents the Crello dataset, which contains a large number of design templates with complete vector information. Evaluation metrics are proposed to measure the quality of reconstruction and generation. The results demonstrate that the Transformer-based variant of CanvasVAE performs well in both document reconstruction and generation tasks. The contributions of this work include the CanvasVAE architecture, the Crello dataset, and the empirical validation of the Transformer-based model for vector graphic generation.
