Detecting human-object interactions (HOIs) involves localizing and describing pairs of interacting humans and objects. HOIs are defined as (subject, predicate, object) triplets, with the subject always being a human. Previous approaches to HOI detection treat it as a downstream task of object detection, leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors. However, this approach has limitations, as it may not accurately infer the interaction type and correspondences between instances. HOI recognition is challenging due to the need for reasoning about relationships and contexts between instances, particularly when there are multiple instances with the same interaction type. Many interactions lack strong visual cues and require logical reasoning beyond recognizing visual cues. To address these challenges, we propose a spatially conditioned message passing algorithm that incorporates spatial information into the message passing procedure. We also extend the spatial conditioning mechanism to other parts of the graph, such as the computation of the adjacency structure and the refinement of graph features. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on HOI detection benchmarks, showcasing the importance of spatial information in improving detection accuracy.
