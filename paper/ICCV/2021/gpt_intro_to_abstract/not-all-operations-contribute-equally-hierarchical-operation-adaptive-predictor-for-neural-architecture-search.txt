Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has gained significant attention in recent years for its ability to automate the architecture engineering process. NAS algorithms have shown competitive results compared to hand-crafted architectures in various tasks. This paper focuses on predictor-based methods for NAS and proposes a Hierarchical Operation-adaptive Predictor (HOP) using graph-based predictors. HOP introduces an operation-adaptive attention module (OAM) to learn the relative significance of operations during information aggregation. Additionally, a cell-hierarchical gated module (CGM) is proposed to integrate hierarchical knowledge from different iterations of OAM. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that HOP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods. HOP also exhibits high interpretability and has the potential to inspire new network architecture designs.
