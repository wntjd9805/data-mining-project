Deep convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable success in various computer vision tasks, largely due to the availability of well-designed and balanced datasets. However, in real-world scenarios, image data often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, with a few categories containing a majority of the training images and most categories having only a few samples. This leads to a bias towards the head categories and lower accuracy rates for the tail categories. Many methods have been proposed to address long-tailed recognition, including resampling, reweighting, and decoupling. However, these methods focus on individual categories and do not consider interactions among different categories. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that utilizes cross-category interactions for long-tailed recognition. We conduct experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset and demonstrate that our method, called DiVE, achieves significantly higher accuracy compared to existing methods. DiVE levels and distills the virtual example distribution, resulting in improved performance on various long-tailed recognition datasets.
