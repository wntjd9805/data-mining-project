This paper introduces the use of synthetic data in advancing pedestrian detection and tracking in computer science. The traditional approaches in this field are data-hungry and collecting and labeling real-world data is difficult and expensive. Privacy concerns also limit the acquisition of personal visual data. To address these issues, the paper proposes the use of virtual worlds and synthetic data. The authors create a large synthetic dataset called MOTSynth, which includes various environments, camera viewpoints, object textures, lighting conditions, weather, seasonal changes, and object identities. The dataset is evaluated for pedestrian detection, re-identification, and tracking tasks. The experiments show that models trained on the synthetic data perform on-par with state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets. The paper emphasizes the importance of diversity in bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. The contributions of the paper include the open-sourcing of the MOTSynth dataset and demonstrating its effectiveness in high-level tasks such as pedestrian detection and tracking. The paper also provides a comprehensive analysis of how synthetic worlds can advance the state-of-the-art in pedestrian tracking and detection.
