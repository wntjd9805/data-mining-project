This paper introduces a novel approach to real-time instance segmentation by integrating fine-grained expressions with an anchor-based detector. The proposed method uses a discriminative orientation-based mask representation, where orientation vectors are assigned to pixels based on their positive or negative labels. This representation allows for efficient encoding and decoding of multiple instance masks without the need for explicit foreground segmentation. To handle objects of different sizes, an instance grouping mechanism is introduced, where instances with similar sizes share a common orientation map. The enlarged annotated bounding boxes provide sufficient supervision for the background and help balance positive and negative samples. The proposed method, called OrienMask, is integrated with the YOLOv3 detector and achieves a competitive mask average precision (AP) of 34.8 at a speed of 42.7 frames per second (fps) on the COCO benchmark dataset.
