This paper introduces the problem of sparse-shot learning in the context of object localization in large images, particularly in medical imaging scenarios. Sparse-shot learning refers to the challenge of learning from only a few annotated locations in images where the total number of relevant objects is extremely high. The authors analyze the limitations of traditional supervised learning methods in this setting and propose a novel learning objective called exclusive cross-entropy (ECE) to address the issue of biased learning due to sparse annotations. The ECE objective incorporates a cut-off threshold to discard samples with large second-order derivatives, which contribute to biased learning. Extensive experimentation on multiple datasets and architectures demonstrates that the exclusive cross-entropy approach achieves similar performance to models trained with exhaustive annotations, especially in segmentation tasks. The findings of this study have implications for improving object localization in large images with sparse annotations in medical imaging applications.
