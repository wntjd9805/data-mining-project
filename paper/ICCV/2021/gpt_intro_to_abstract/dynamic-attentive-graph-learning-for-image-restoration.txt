Image restoration is a challenging task in computer vision, aiming to recover a high-quality image from a degraded measurement corrupted by various factors. Traditional model-based methods rely on prior knowledge such as total variation and sparse representation. Recently, deep learning-based methods have achieved remarkable success, but often overlook the internal prior information in images. Non-local methods have been proposed to exploit the self-similarity in images, but they are easily influenced by noise. Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have shown promise in establishing long-range correlations, but their applicability in image restoration is limited due to domain gaps. Existing GCN-based methods for image restoration either rely on fixed neighbors or predefined adjacency matrices. In this paper, we propose a dynamic attentive graph learning model (DAGL) that constructs an adaptive graph based on local feature patches for image restoration. Our method leverages the attention mechanism to identify the importance of neighboring nodes, leading to improved restoration performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DAGL method in various image restoration tasks.
