Learning disentangled representations in machine learning is crucial for various tasks such as image synthesis, person re-identification, interpretability, reasoning, and fairness. Image translation, where an image is translated from one domain to another, benefits from disentanglement by assuming common attributes between different domains. However, existing methods fail to handle cases where labeled and unlabeled attributes are correlated. This paper explores the disentanglement of labeled and unlabeled attributes and proposes a novel synthesis stage to improve perceptual quality. Additionally, the paper suggests simple transformations for learning pose-independent or localized correlated attributes, achieving better disentanglement compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed approach highlights that adversarial optimization is not necessary for disentanglement but rather useful for generating visually pleasing images. The contributions of this work include the introduction of a non-adversarial disentanglement method, the scaling of disentanglement methods to high perceptual quality, and achieving state-of-the-art results in multiple image translation settings in a unified framework.
