Abstract:Semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS) has gained significant attention in the field of computer vision. Memory-based VOS methods have shown success in predicting foreground object masks in videos by matching query frames to past frames with given or predicted masks. However, these methods have limitations in terms of spatio-temporal non-local and dense matching, temporal smoothness, and fine-grained memory information. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Memory Matching Network (HMMN) that addresses these limitations through two novel memory matching modules. The first module, kernel guided memory matching, enforces temporal smoothness constraints by restricting correspondences to a local window and applying kernel guidance. The second module, top-k guided memory matching, retrieves fine-grained memory information by selecting top-k candidate memory locations for each query pixel. Our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on DAVIS and YouTube-VOS benchmarks.
