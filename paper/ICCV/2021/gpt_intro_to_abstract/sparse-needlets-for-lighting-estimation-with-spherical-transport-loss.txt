Lighting estimation is a challenging task in computer vision and computer graphics, with applications in high-dynamic-range (HDR) relighting in mixed reality. This problem involves predicting the illumination from a full sphere of directions, including those unobserved from the current view. Existing approaches in frequency domain using Spherical Harmonics (SH) lack spatial localization capabilities, leading to weak shading and inaccurate relighting performance. Similarly, spatial domain approaches such as direct generation of illumination maps or indirect reconstruction through spherical Gaussian function also suffer from inaccuracies and limited consideration of lighting frequency.In this paper, we propose NeedleLight, a new model for accurate and robust lighting estimation from a single image. NeedleLight utilizes needlet, a new generation of spherical wavelets, which offers good localization properties in both frequency and spatial domains. This makes it ideal for illumination representation, addressing the limitations of previous approaches. We also design an optimal thresholding function to achieve sparse needlets, which significantly improves lighting estimation by removing redundant parameters that disturb the regression of principle light sources.To capture spatial information in the regression process, we introduce a Spherical Transport Loss (STL) based on optimal transport theory. STL utilizes a cost matrix and auxiliary point strategy to accurately estimate needlet coefficients, effective for preserving high-frequency information. Additionally, we design a new evaluation metric that measures the discrepancy between illumination maps, simplifying the evaluation procedure and providing concise yet effective assessment of lighting color, intensity, and position.The contributions of this work are threefold. Firstly, we introduce a novel needlet basis for illumination representation, enabling simultaneous regression of parameters in both frequency and spatial domains. Secondly, we develop an optimal thresholding function to achieve sparse needlets, removing redundant coefficients and enhancing lighting estimation. Lastly, we propose a novel Spherical Transport Loss (STL) that effectively incorporates spatial information in the regression process. Along with STL, we design a new evaluation metric that simplifies and improves the assessment of lighting estimation compared to existing metrics.
