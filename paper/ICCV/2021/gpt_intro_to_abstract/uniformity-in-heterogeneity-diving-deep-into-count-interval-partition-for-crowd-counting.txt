The task of crowd counting, which estimates the number of people in images or videos, has gained significant attention in recent years due to its practical applications in public safety. However, the commonly used density maps as learning targets are inaccurate and noisy, leading to poor performance and overfitting. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on local count classification, where the count value of a local patch is quantified into pre-defined count intervals. We address the issues of imbalanced training data and extreme counting errors by designing an optimal interval partition strategy called the Uniform Error Partition (UEP) criterion. This criterion ensures nearly equal expected counting errors for all intervals, minimizing prediction risk. Additionally, we propose the Mean Count Proxies (MCP) criterion for selecting an optimal count proxy value from each interval, effectively reducing discretization errors. To handle the ambiguity around interval borders, we introduce the Interleaved Prediction Heads (IPH) structure with overlapping count intervals. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our contributions include the UEP criterion for count interval partition, the MCP criterion for count proxy selection, and the UEP-Net model incorporating these two key criteria and the IPH structure.
