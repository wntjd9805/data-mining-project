Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision, with applications ranging from person re-identification to action recognition. Deep neural networks have significantly advanced object detection in recent years. Existing detectors using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be categorized into two types: multi-stage and one-stage approaches. Multi-stage detectors achieve high performance by sequentially applying multi-stage classification and localization. On the other hand, one-stage detectors, which eliminate object-based pruning, offer greater inference efficiency but generally lower detection accuracy. Modern CNN-based object detectors divide the task into separate branches for classification and regression. These branches are trained independently without explicit knowledge of each other. While this approach has led to significant progress, it overlooks the correlation between the classification and localization tasks, resulting in prediction inconsistency. This inconsistency is particularly pronounced for objects with irregular shapes or occlusion. To address this limitation, we propose a mutually supervised loss called Harmonic loss, which optimizes both the classification and regression branches jointly. During training, the classification branch supervises the optimization of the regression branch through a harmonic factor related to the classification loss, and vice versa. By incorporating the Harmonic loss into existing detectors, the network becomes training-aware and reduces the imbalance across tasks. This promotes the production of bounding boxes with high co-occurrence of top classification and localization during testing, alleviating prediction inconsistency.Additionally, we introduce the Harmonic IoU (HIoU) loss to balance the contribution of each level of samples in the training phase. This addresses the issue of imbalanced IoU distributions, where the localization losses of existing detectors are dominated by outliers. By dynamically scaling the weights of examples based on their IoU levels, the HIoU loss ensures more effective and stable training.We evaluate our proposed Harmonic loss and HIoU loss on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks using both two-stage and one-stage detection frameworks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach in improving existing detectors.In summary, this paper contributes three main aspects: 1) the introduction of the Harmonic loss to reconcile prediction consistency between classification and localization, 2) the introduction of the HIoU loss to balance the weight of localization loss for different IoU-level samples, and 3) the successful integration of these losses into various state-of-the-art detection algorithms, leading to significant performance improvements on benchmark datasets.
