Salient object detection is a crucial problem in computer vision, with applications in image/video compression, video object segmentation, image captioning, and image parsing. While the success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has improved feature representations, current saliency models often lack the ability to capture semantic contextual features. This issue leads to difficulties in distinguishing salient objects from distractors in complex scenes. In this paper, we propose a semantic scene context-aware framework for salient object detection. We introduce Instance Context Segmentation and Stuff Context Segmentation to semantically segment objects and scene context, and propose a Semantic Scene Context Refinement module to fuse salient object features with surrounding semantic scene context. Additionally, we propose a Contextual Instance Transformer to capture the relationship between objects and scene context. We also present a new salient object detection dataset with real-world complex scenes to consider semantic scene contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both our dataset and existing datasets.
