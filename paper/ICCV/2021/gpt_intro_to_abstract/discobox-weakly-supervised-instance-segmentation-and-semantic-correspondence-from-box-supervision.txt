The ability to localize and recognize objects is a fundamental task in computer vision. Object detection is widely studied, and instance segmentation has been introduced to enable localization with pixel-level accuracy. Recently, there has been a growing interest in extending these tasks to the 3D space. Landmark and correspondence methods have been explored to associate object parts across different views, which are critical components in pose estimation and reconstruction. Semantic correspondence, in particular, is challenging due to variations in appearance and pose. However, the literature on semantic correspondence and instance segmentation has remained largely separate. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing a unified framework for joint weakly supervised instance segmentation and semantic correspondence using bounding box supervision. The proposed framework, called DISCOBOX, leverages structured knowledge and self-supervision within and across images to reduce uncertainties. The contributions of this work include the introduction of a novel self-ensembling framework and achieving state-of-the-art performance on weakly supervised instance segmentation and semantic correspondence tasks. The results suggest the potential to remove mask labels in future instance segmentation problems and the wide applicability of DISCOBOX in various downstream applications, particularly in 3D tasks.
