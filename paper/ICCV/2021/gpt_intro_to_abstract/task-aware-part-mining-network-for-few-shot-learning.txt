Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been successful in computer vision tasks, but require large amounts of annotated images. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) aims to reduce the need for human annotation by learning a model that can classify unlabeled samples into new classes with only one or a few examples. Previous FSL methods utilize metric-based learning but often lose discriminative local information. Recent methods consider local representations for FSL, decomposing images into local patches and aggregating similarities between them. This study identifies three characteristics for building a robust few-shot model: automaticity, task-aware mechanism, and adaptive weights. To address these characteristics, an end-to-end Task-aware Part Mining Network (TPMN) is proposed, integrating automatic local part mining into metric-based FSL. TPMN utilizes Part Filters (PFs) to generate part-aware activation maps and introduces a Meta Filter Learner (MFL) to customize PFs for individual tasks. Adaptive weights are assigned to local parts using an adaptive importance generator. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TPMN in comparison to existing FSL methods. The contributions of TPMN include its joint exploitation of automatic local part mining and meta-learning, the generation of task-aware part filters, and the assignment of importance weights for local parts.
