Single image super-resolution (SR) is a problem in computer vision that aims to recover a high-resolution image from a low-resolution counterpart. Deep learning has recently provided a powerful tool to solve this problem, with numerous CNN-based methods being developed to improve SR performance. However, existing networks are primarily designed for image SR with specific integer scale factors, and cannot handle non-integer or asymmetric SR. To address this limitation, previous work proposed a Meta-SR network that dynamically predicts filters in the upscale module for different scale factors using meta-learning. While promising, this approach does not take full advantage of scale information and cannot handle SR with asymmetric scale factors. In this paper, we propose a plug-in module for existing SR networks that enables scale-arbitrary SR. The module consists of scale-aware feature adaptation blocks and a scale-aware upsampling layer, which adapt features in the backbone and enable scale-arbitrary upsampling. We use conditional convolutions to generate dynamic scale-aware filters, allowing our module to handle different scale factors. Our approach achieves promising results for non-integer and asymmetric SR, while maintaining state-of-the-art performance for integer scale factors with a single model. Our plug-in module is the first to handle asymmetric SR, and our experimental results showcase its effectiveness.
