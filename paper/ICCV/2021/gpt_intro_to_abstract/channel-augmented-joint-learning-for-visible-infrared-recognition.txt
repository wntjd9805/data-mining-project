Title: Channel Exchangeable Augmentation for Cross-Modality Visible-Infrared RecognitionAbstract: The recent success of identity recognition systems in the visible domain has spurred significant research efforts in this area. However, little attention has been given to the challenges posed by night-time surveillance and low-light environments, where near(far)-infrared cameras are commonly used. This raises the need for cross-modality visible-infrared recognition methods, such as visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-ReID) and NIR-VIS face recognition. The large modality gap and unknown environmental factors make matching the infrared imagery to visible-spectrum images a significant challenge. Current approaches, like image generation with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or using grayscale images, suffer from limitations such as increased computational cost or loss of discriminative color information. To address these challenges, we propose a novel channel exchangeable augmentation for visible-infrared recognition, which seamlessly integrates into existing augmentation operations without modifying the network structure or learning strategy. We also design an enhanced channel-mixed learning scheme that handles both intra- and cross-modality variations. Our joint learning strategy explicitly optimizes the channel augmented images. We evaluate the proposed method on both visible-infrared person re-identification and face recognition tasks, achieving significant accuracy gains across various settings. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the channel exchangeable augmentation in improving cross-modality visible-infrared recognition.
