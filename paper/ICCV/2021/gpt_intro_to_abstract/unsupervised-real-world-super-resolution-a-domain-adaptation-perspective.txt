Abstract:Single image super-resolution (SISR) using convolution neural networks (CNNs) has shown promising results in increasing the resolution of low-resolution images. However, the use of predetermined techniques like bicubic interpolation to down-sample high-resolution images limits the model's generalization capability. The domain gap between training and real-world testing images hinders the inference performance of CNNs. Blind SR, which processes real LR images with unknown degradation parameters, has also faced challenges in real-world scenarios. Recent studies have explored the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and CycleGAN framework for unpaired SR training, but training an ideal degraded LR image generator remains difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel unpaired SR training framework based on feature-level domain adaptation. Our approach focuses on obtaining degradation-indistinguishable feature maps and mapping them to HR images. Inspired by adversarial-based domain adaptation approaches, we introduce feature alignment techniques and additional constraints to align features and preserve image details. Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the advantages of our proposed method over existing unpaired SR training solutions. This work presents the first formulation of unpaired SR training as a feature-level domain adaptation problem, making significant contributions to the field.
