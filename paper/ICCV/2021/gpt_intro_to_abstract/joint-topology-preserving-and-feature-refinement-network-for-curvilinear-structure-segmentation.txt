Curvilinear Structure Segmentation (CSS) aims to segment binary masks of curvilinear objects in computer vision. This has various applications, such as detecting concrete cracks, extracting road networks from aerial images, and assisting doctors in recognizing lesions from medical images. Despite progress in CSS and semantic segmentation, there are two critical problems that remain: topology preserving and feature refinement. General CSS methods tend to focus on topology preserving, but existing approaches have limitations in handling complex backgrounds. On the other hand, semantic segmentation methods mainly focus on feature representations, but they still struggle with feature refinement for CSS. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Joint Topology-preserving and Feature-refinement Network (JTFN) that combines global topology preserving and refined features. JTFN uses object boundaries as global topology regularizations and incorporates a Feature Interactive Module (FIM) for feature exchange between CSS and boundary detection. It also introduces a Gated Attentive Unit (GAU) to utilize attentive masks as feedback guidance during feature refinement. Experimental results on various datasets validate the effectiveness of JTFN in preserving global topology and refining features simultaneously.
