Estimating 3D human poses and shapes from an image is important in various applications such as embodied AI, robotics, and AR/VR. While optimization methods have been successful, they can be slow for real-time applications. Deep learning regression methods have reduced computation times but still rely on optimization. In this paper, we propose a sparse constrained formulation for 3D human pose and shape estimation that is mathematically equivalent to dense unconstrained formulations. We show that our formulation allows for the exploitation of sparsity and constraints, resulting in faster computation times. Our method, SCOPE, is orders of magnitude faster than existing optimization methods, with average convergence time of 4 ms. We present a real-time 3D motion capture framework based on our method that can estimate 3D human poses and shapes from a single image at over 30 FPS. We compare our framework with state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets and achieve better accuracies than optimization methods and competitive accuracies compared to regression methods. Overall, our contributions include a new formulation, an efficient algorithm, and a real-time motion capture framework for 3D human pose and shape estimation.
