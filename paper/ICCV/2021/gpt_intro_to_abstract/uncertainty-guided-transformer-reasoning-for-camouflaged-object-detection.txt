Camouflaged object detection (COD), also known as de-camouflaging, is an important research topic in computer vision. It aims to uncover hidden targets from a given scene, with applications in image synthesis, species discovery, and medical image analysis. Previous COD approaches have used handcrafted features or convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to address the problem. However, these approaches have not explicitly considered the uncertainties caused by camouflage strategies, leading to suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a new learning paradigm called Uncertainty-Guided Transformer Reasoning (UGTR) for better decamouflaging performance. UGTR combines Bayesian learning with transformer-based reasoning and consists of three main components: uncertainty quantification network (UQN), uncertainty-induced transformer (UGT), and auxiliary prototyping transformer (PT). UGTR achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets and increases the interpretability of COD models. This work contributes to the advancements in camouflaged object detection and introduces a novel uncertainty-guided transformer reasoning model.
