Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of predicting the time course of COVID-19 patient outcomes, such as the probability of ICU admission, using time-to-event analysis. Traditional statistical techniques struggle with incorporating high-dimensional imaging data, which is crucial for assessing the degree of pulmonary involvement in COVID-19. To overcome this limitation, the paper proposes a deep learning approach that combines convolutional LSTM and RNN-LSTM architectures to extract features from time-dependent imaging studies and non-image data. The risk function is then predicted using fully connected layers. The paper introduces a novel loss function that handles ties in the data and evaluates the model's performance using concordance error. The proposed architecture and techniques offer a way to overcome the challenges of incorporating images and predicting the interrelated events in COVID-19 patient outcomes.
