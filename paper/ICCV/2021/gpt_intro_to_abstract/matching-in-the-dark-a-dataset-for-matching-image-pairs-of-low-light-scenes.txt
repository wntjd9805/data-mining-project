Structure-from-motion (SfM) and visual SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) have been widely used for real-world applications. These methods rely on point correspondences between multiple views of a scene and involve detecting keypoints, extracting local feature descriptors, and estimating camera poses and other geometric parameters. However, their application is limited in extremely low-light environments where standard raw image processing techniques yield mostly black images. To address this limitation, we explore the potential of using SfM and visual SLAM in low-light scenes by extracting information from the lower bits of the raw sensor signals. We propose several approaches, including developing keypoint detectors and descriptors for raw-format images, strengthening subsequent pipeline steps, and applying image enhancement methods. To facilitate further research in this area, we create a dataset featuring underexposed raw-format images and provide ground truth long-exposure images for evaluation purposes. Using this dataset, we experimentally evaluate different component methods of the SfM pipeline, highlighting the importance of using raw-format images and identifying areas for improvement. overall, our results demonstrate the potential of applying SfM and visual SLAM in low-light environments and the need for further advancements in this field.
