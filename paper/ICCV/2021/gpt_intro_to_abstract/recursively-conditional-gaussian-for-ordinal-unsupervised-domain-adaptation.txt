Deep learning models often require large amounts of labeled data for training. However, gathering labeled data in the target domain can be expensive or impractical. To address this issue, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have been developed. These methods aim to learn from both labeled data in a source domain and unlabeled data in the target domain. Existing UDA methods mainly focus on classification or segmentation tasks and do not consider inter-class correlations. In real-world scenarios, tasks with discrete and successively ordered labels are common, such as in medical diagnosis or age estimation. This paper introduces a novel approach for UDA of ordinal classification. The proposed method aims to disentangle class-related and unrelated factors in the data and adapt the class-relevant latent space. The prior for the class-related factors is constructed using a recursively conditional Gaussian (RCG) set, which enforces a partially ordered set (poset) constraint. This prior allows for the modeling of ordinal inter-class correlations in the latent space. The proposed method is evaluated on medical diagnosis tasks and age estimation, demonstrating significant improvements over previous non-ordinal UDA approaches.
