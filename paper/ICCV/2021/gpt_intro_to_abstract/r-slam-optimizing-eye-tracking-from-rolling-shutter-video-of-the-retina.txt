Eye tracking is a key process in determining the direction of gaze, which is crucial for various applications in computer vision and ophthalmology. However, existing eye tracking systems suffer from accuracy and precision limitations, particularly when it comes to capturing the dynamics of microsaccades and saccades. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to eye tracking using a high-resolution imaging device called the adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO). By formulating and solving an optimization problem, we aim to disentangle the eye motion from the rolling shutter video captured by the AOSLO. Our method, called R-SLAM (retina-based SLAM), involves two stages: convex optimization to compute an initial motion estimate and joint refinement of the retina map and motion estimate using gradient descent. Our contributions include the formulation of eye tracking from rolling-shutter retina video as an optimization problem, convex initialization, and gradient-based refinement of retina motion and map. Our method achieves significantly lower tracking error compared to prior work in offline tracking and enables real-time eye tracking with high accuracy using the produced retina maps.
