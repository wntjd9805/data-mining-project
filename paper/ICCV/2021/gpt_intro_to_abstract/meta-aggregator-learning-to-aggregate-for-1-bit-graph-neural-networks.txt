Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become the dominant approach for analyzing non-Euclidean data, with numerous GNN architectures developed for various applications. However, many GNN-based applications require compact and lightweight architectures for real-time interaction in resource-constrained environments. Existing approaches for compressing GNN models still rely on expensive floating-point operations and a well-performed teacher model. In this paper, we propose a novel GNN-customized binarization framework to train a 1-bit lightweight GNN model with competitive performance. We develop a naive GNN binarization framework by converting 32-bit features and parameters into 1-bit ones and leverage straight-aggregators for handling challenging 1-bit graph features. We also introduce two meta aggregators, Greedy Gumbel Aggregator (GNA) and Adapt-able Hybrid Aggregator (ANA), that enhance expressive capability. Our contribution is a customized framework that generates a 1-bit lightweight GNN model suitable for resource-constrained edge computing applications. We evaluate the framework on large-scale benchmarks and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on both 1-bit binarized GNN models and general full-precision models.
