Establishing reliable correspondences between images is crucial in various computer vision tasks such as Structure-from-Motion, Multiview Stereo, and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping. Traditionally, correspondences are obtained through nearest neighbour search and further pruned using heuristic techniques. Recent works have focused on designing learnable matching strategies using networks like PointNet. However, these methods have limitations in terms of their inability to find more matches than nearest neighbour matching and their neglect of the information from local visual descriptors.Another approach is to cast feature matching as a graph matching problem, as demonstrated by SuperGlue. However, this approach suffers from high computational and memory costs when applied to a large number of keypoints. This is due to the dense message passing in the graph. In this paper, we propose Seeded Graph Matching Network (SGMNet) to address these limitations. We introduce a Seeding Module to initialize matching from a small set of reliable matches and a Seeded Graph Neural Network with sparsified graph structure to reduce computation and redundancy. Our message passing blocks involve attentional pooling, seed filtering, and attentional unpooling.By using seeds as attention bottleneck, we significantly reduce computational complexity while maintaining accuracy. We evaluate SGMNet in different tasks and demonstrate its efficiency and effectiveness. Our contributions include the introduction of a seeding mechanism to identify inlier compatibility and the design of a sparsified graph neural network for more efficient message passing. Compared to SuperGlue, SGMNet achieves competitive or higher accuracy with improved efficiency. For example, when matching 10k features, SGMNet runs 7 times faster and consumes 50% less GPU memory than SuperGlue.
