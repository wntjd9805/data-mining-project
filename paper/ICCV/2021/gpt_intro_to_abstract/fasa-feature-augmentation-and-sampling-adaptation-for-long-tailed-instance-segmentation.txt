This paper introduces Feature Augmentation and Sampling Adaptation (FASA), an efficient and effective method for addressing the problem of long-tailed instance segmentation in computer vision tasks. Long-tailed data sets present challenges due to class imbalance, leading to poor performance on rare object classes. FASA aims to overcome this issue by performing online Feature Augmentation (FA) for each class, generating class-wise virtual features using a distributional prior calculated from previously observed real samples. Additionally, FASA adapts the sampling density of virtual features for each class to avoid underfitting or overfitting. Through adaptive feature augmentation and sampling, FASA significantly alleviates the imbalance issue for rare classes, as demonstrated on the LVIS v1.0 dataset. FASA can be easily integrated into existing methods and has been shown to consistently improve performance in instance segmentation and long-tailed image classification tasks. The contributions of this work include a fast and effective feature augmentation and sampling approach for long-tailed instance segmentation, the ability to be combined with existing methods, and generalizability to other long-tailed tasks. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods with only a minimal increase in training time.
