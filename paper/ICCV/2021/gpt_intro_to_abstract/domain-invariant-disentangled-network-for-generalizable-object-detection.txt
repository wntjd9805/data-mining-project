Object detection is a challenging problem in computer vision that aims to identify and locate objects in an image. While supervised object detection has made significant progress, performing object detection in practice remains difficult due to the complexity and diversity of real-world scenes. Collecting a large amount of labeled data for training a general object detector is expensive and impractical. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Domain-Invariant Disentangled Network (DIDN) for domain generalizable object detection. Our approach is inspired by recent disentangled works for image translation and consists of three components: Image-level Disentanglement, Instance-level Disentanglement, and Cross-level Reconstruction. The two-level disentanglement enables the extraction of generalized features suitable for object detection, while the cross-level reconstruction complements the detection model. Our contributions include: 1) the exploration of domain generalization for object detection, 2) the development of the DIDN framework, which learns domain-invariant representations on both image and instance levels, and 3) extensive experiments demonstrating that DIDN outperforms the best baseline on multiple benchmark datasets.
