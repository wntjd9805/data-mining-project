Optical flow estimation is a crucial aspect of computer vision, with applications in 3D reconstruction, video processing, and action recognition. Deep learning techniques have enabled the direct learning of optical flow using neural networks, resulting in improved performance and faster inference compared to traditional approaches. Cost volumes play a key role in deep learning-based optical flow frameworks, encoding the matchings between pixels in the source and target images. While previous methods have utilized quadratic complexities and coarse-to-fine warping frameworks to handle large displacements, they often struggle with small objects and introduce artifacts in occlusion regions. The state-of-the-art method, RAFT, achieves impressive performance but has difficulty scaling to high-resolution inputs. To address these challenges, we propose a new cost volume construction method for high-resolution optical flow estimation. Our approach leverages the factorization of the 2D search problem into two 1D substitutes in the vertical and horizontal directions. By using 1D correlations and proper feature propagation and aggregation schemes, we are able to construct compact cost volumes. Despite the unconventional use of 1D correlations, our method achieves comparable accuracy to RAFT while significantly reducing memory consumption. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on high-resolution images and videos, outperforming other methods such as FlowNet2 and PWC-Net in terms of accuracy. Overall, our contributions lie in the innovative cost volume construction method, the achievement of high accuracy with 1D correlations, and the ability to process high-resolution data with limited memory resources.
