Skeleton-based human action recognition is an area of increasing interest in computer science due to its relevance in various applications, such as human-robot interaction, self-driving vehicles, and security surveillance. Most existing works focus on using offline learning strategies to train action recognition models, which require all training action sequences to be provided at once. However, in real-world scenarios, recognition models may encounter continuous streams of new information, making it necessary for them to learn from non-stationary data distributions. Continual learning of human action recognition under non-stationary conditions is challenging due to the catastrophic forgetting problem. Humans, on the other hand, have the ability to continuously learn from their environment and accumulate new knowledge without forgetting old knowledge. In this paper, we propose a brain-inspired model, called the Elastic Semantic Network (Else-Net), that aims to achieve continual human action recognition by effectively accumulating new knowledge while retaining previously learned knowledge. The Else-Net consists of multiple layers of elastic units, each comprising learning blocks storing knowledge from different actions. The network can dynamically and flexibly search and activate the most relevant learning block for each action, preserving the knowledge of previously learned actions while effectively learning new ones. We also leverage the homogeneity of actions at the decomposed semantic body-part level by designing the Else-Net with multiple semantic branches for each body part, enabling the network to search and activate the best-matched pathway for each semantic body part separately.
