This paper focuses on the generation of images based on the number of object instances per object class, which is a fundamental vision task but remains unsolved in computer vision. The authors propose a modular extension to an existing network, StyleGAN2, for multi-class count conditioned image generation. They argue that object counting should be considered a multi-class regression problem, allowing the network to learn to generalize the concept of counting from one object class to another. The proposed approach is validated through experiments on synthetic data from the CLEVR dataset, real data from the SVHN dataset, and a new challenging dataset called CityCount. The generated images are shown to enhance the size and quality of training data for count prediction networks. This paper presents the first attempt to evaluate the potential of GANs for generating images based on multiple object class counts.
