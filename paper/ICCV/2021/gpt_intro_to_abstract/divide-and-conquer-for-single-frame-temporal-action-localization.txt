Temporal action localization (TAL) is a crucial task in video understanding, aimed at detecting and classifying action instances in untrimmed videos. While fully-supervised methods that require frame-level supervision have achieved impressive results, they are time-consuming and expensive. On the other hand, video-level weakly-supervised methods only require the action category label of the whole video but lack explicit location supervision. To bridge this gap, a single-frame weakly-supervised TAL (STAL) is introduced, which provides limited but precise action location supervision. This work explores the STAL task and proposes a novel two-stage framework to decouple the counting goal and the localization goal. In the instance counting stage, a seedframe detector is used to divide the video into multiple clips, each containing one action instance. In the location estimation stage, the action instance is localized in each clip using category supervision. A proposal-based representation is used to represent the action location, which reduces the solution space and promotes temporal smoothness. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Contributions include the two-stage framework, the proposal-based representation, and extensive experimental validation.
