Estimating the 3D pose of a human from a single monocular image is an active research field in computer vision with various applications. This paper introduces a method for modeling the posterior distribution of plausible 3D poses conditioned on a monocular image. Existing methods typically assume a single solution, ignoring the ambiguity of the problem. In contrast, this paper models 3D human pose estimation as an ambiguous inverse problem with multiple feasible solutions. The proposed approach utilizes a normalizing flow-based method to generate multiple 3D pose hypotheses that approximate the true posterior distribution. Additionally, the method incorporates uncertainty information from the predicted heatmaps of the 2D detector, effectively modeling occlusions and uncertain detections. The paper evaluates the approach on benchmark datasets, outperforming comparable methods in most metrics. The contributions of this work include being the first to employ a normalizing flow-based method for modeling the posterior distribution of 3D poses from a single image, incorporating uncertainty information from 2D detector heatmaps, and proposing a generalization of the best-of-M loss that improves prediction performance.
