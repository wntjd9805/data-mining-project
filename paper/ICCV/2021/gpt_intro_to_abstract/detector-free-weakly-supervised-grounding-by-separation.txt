This paper introduces the importance of natural free-form text supervision in the context of multi-modal text + images data sources. The authors discuss how automatic supervision of multi-image-text pairs is challenging due to noise and lack of localization. They emphasize the significance of weakly supervised grounding (WSG) in learning to localize image regions corresponding to text phrases, without annotations for correspondence. The authors highlight previous WSG methods and note the shift towards detector-based approaches, which deviate from true WSG. In this work, the authors propose a novel Grounding by Separation (GbS) approach for WSG that does not rely on pre-trained detectors. They suggest using image and text compositionality to create synthetic training data and describe the separation loss and regularization losses used in their approach. The authors demonstrate that GbS outperforms previous DF-WSG state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks, and they show that GbS is complementary to detector-based approaches when used in an ensemble. Their contributions include the GbS approach, establishing a new state-of-the-art for DF-WSG, an ablation study, and achieving a new absolute state-of-the-art in WSG on Flickr30K.
