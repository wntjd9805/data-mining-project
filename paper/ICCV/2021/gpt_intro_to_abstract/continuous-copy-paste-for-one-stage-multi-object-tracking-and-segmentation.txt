Multi-object tracking and segmentation (MOTS) is an important task in the domains of autonomous driving and video surveillance. MOTS provides per-pixel segmentation masks that accurately locate objects and eliminate ambiguities caused by overlapping bounding boxes. Current approaches for MOTS struggle to combine tracking with instance segmentation in a single forward pass. This paper proposes a novel video copy-paste data augmentation strategy named Continuous Copy-Paste (CCP) to bridge the performance gap between one-step and multi-step methods. CCP increases the number of instances and instance IDs in training by exploiting pixel-wise annotations. Additionally, CCPNet, a one-stage MOTS approach, is presented, which performs instance segmentation and tracking simultaneously. CCPNet outperforms existing MOTS methods and ranks first on the KITTI MOTS leaderboard. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of the CCP data augmentation strategy and the development of the CCPNet approach for MOTS.
