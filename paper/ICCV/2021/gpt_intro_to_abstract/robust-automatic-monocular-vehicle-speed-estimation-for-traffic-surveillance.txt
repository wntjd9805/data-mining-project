Accurately measuring traffic speed on road networks is crucial for various applications like intelligent transportation systems and traffic analysis. However, existing methods that rely on dedicated hardware sensors are expensive and not easily scalable. This paper focuses on the problem of estimating vehicle speed from monocular videos captured via surveillance cameras, which have the potential to serve as cost-effective traffic speed sensors. Current approaches often assume that cameras are already calibrated, which is rarely the case for CCTV cameras. This paper proposes novel calibration methods based on 3D reprojection error minimization and scene geometry prediction. Additionally, a new dataset collected from public CCTV video streams and annotated with GPS tracks is introduced. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on synthetic and real data, even in challenging conditions.
