Face recognition is a well-studied topic in computer vision, with advancements in both traditional methods and deep learning-based algorithms. While face recognition has achieved excellent performance, age-invariant face recognition (AIFR) remains under-explored in practical applications. AIFR faces three challenges: significant intra-class variations due to aging, complex impact of aging on facial shapes and textures, and insufficient cross-age databases for training. This paper proposes a novel approach, called MT-MIM, to learn age-invariant face representation by disentangling identity-dependent and age-dependent components using mutual information. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on four face aging datasets.
