Analyzing human activities in natural scenes is a fundamental task with various applications in computer science. While significant progress has been made in human activity recognition, the task of human interaction understanding has been less successful. Current methods often use shallow graphical representations, which are inadequate for modeling complex human interactions. To address this challenge, we propose a consistency-aware graph network (CAGNet) that incorporates third-order dependencies to represent interactive relations among people. Additionally, we introduce a consistency-aware reasoning (CAR) module to improve the consistency within action and interaction predictions. Our experimental results show that CAGNet outperforms existing approaches on three benchmarks for human interaction understanding. Our contributions include the development of a more powerful graph network for HIU, an efficient module for resolving inconsistencies, and the overall CAGNet architecture that achieves state-of-the-art performance.
