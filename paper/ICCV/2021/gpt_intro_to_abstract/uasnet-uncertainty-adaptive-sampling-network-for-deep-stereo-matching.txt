Stereo image disparity estimation is a crucial task in various applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. Existing stereo matching algorithms can be categorized into two types based on their cost volume representation. One approach constructs a 4D cost volume across the entire disparity range, while the other constructs a cascade cost volume with a narrowed disparity range. Cascade cost volume methods are popular due to their ability to achieve high-resolution depth maps with efficient hardware usage. However, existing methods for narrowing the disparity range can result in incorrect estimations and miss the true disparity values. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty adaptive sampling network (UASNet) that improves disparity range prediction and sampling accuracy. Our network includes a novel uncertainty distribution-guided range prediction (URP) module that utilizes deep learning to estimate per-pixel disparity range from the uncertainty distribution. We also introduce an uncertainty-based disparity sampler (UDS) that adaptively adjusts the sampling interval based on matching uncertainty. By employing these modules, we construct a cascade cost volume and obtain a full-resolution disparity map. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed UASNet outperforms existing methods in terms of disparity range prediction and matching accuracy.
