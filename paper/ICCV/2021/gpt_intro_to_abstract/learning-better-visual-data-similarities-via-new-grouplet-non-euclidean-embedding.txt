In many computer vision tasks, such as clustering, image retrieval, person re-identification, and few-shot learning, learning the semantic similarity between visual data is important. Traditionally, hand-crafted features and the Mahalanobis distance have been used to characterize the data. However, with the advancement of deep representation learning, refined distance metrics have been proposed to capture the geometric structure of data embeddings. Supervised deep metric learning methods can be categorized into pair-based methods and proxy-based methods. Pair-based methods consider pairwise relationships between data points, distinguishing them as positive or negative based on their labels. Sampling techniques are often used to select informative pairs for training. On the other hand, proxy-based methods introduce proxies to summarize subsets of training data and learn the data-wise relationships indirectly. This resolves the complexity issue in pair-based methods.Both pair-based and proxy-based paradigms have their own drawbacks. Pair-based methods require explicit pair relationships and substantially increase training time due to the large number of possible combinations. Proxy-based methods, while computationally efficient, may result in sub-optimal embedding manifolds as the data relationships are estimated and bounded through proxies.To address these issues, we propose a hybrid grouplet paradigm for non-Euclidean deep metric learning. Our method evaluates enlarged bipartite subgraphs called grouplets, consisting of multiple data points and proxies. Grouplets do not require explicit pair construction and dynamically determine the data-wise relationships through a constrained optimal transport layer. We also exploit a non-Euclidean embedding space and the associated similarity to capture the hierarchical structure of proxies and data points.Our contributions include providing a graph perspective for deep metric learning that generalizes pair-based and proxy-based methods, formulating a grouplet deep metric learning method that combines the accuracy of pair-based methods and the efficiency of proxy-based methods, and proposing the learning of non-Euclidean embeddings and the associated embedding-proxy similarity. Our ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of our method.Overall, our work addresses the limitations of existing supervised deep metric learning methods and provides a novel approach for learning semantic similarity in computer vision tasks.
