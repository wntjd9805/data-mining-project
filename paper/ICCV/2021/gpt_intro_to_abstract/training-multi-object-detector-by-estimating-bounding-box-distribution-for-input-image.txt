Multi-object detection, the task of identifying multiple objects with bounding boxes and class information, has seen significant advancements in computational efficiency and performance with the rise of deep neural networks. However, training a multi-object detection network still poses challenges due to the variable number of bounding boxes in different input images. To address this issue, methods have been developed to discretize the bounding box space and assign ground truth information directly to the network's output. This paper proposes a novel approach to training multi-object detection networks by reformulating the task as a density estimation of bounding boxes. The proposed method, called Mixture-Density-based Object Detector (MDOD), predicts the distribution of bounding boxes using a mixture model of continuous (Cauchy) and discrete (categorical) probability distributions. MDOD maximizes the log-likelihood of the estimated parameters for the mixture of Cauchy distribution for localization, and uses region of interest sampling for classification. The contributions of the proposed method include reducing the complexity and heuristics in training multi-object detection, introducing a new network architecture, and achieving improved detection performance and speed compared to previous detectors.
