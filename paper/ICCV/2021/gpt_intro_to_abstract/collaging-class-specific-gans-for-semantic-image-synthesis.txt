This paper presents a new approach for high-resolution image generation conditioned on input segmentation maps. Unlike previous methods that follow the SPADE architecture design, the authors develop a conditional version of StyleGAN2 that leverages an encoder to extract hierarchical feature representations from the segmentation map. This approach improves image generation quality and allows for better scalability to high resolutions. Additionally, the authors propose the use of multiple class-specific generators to enhance the quality of small foreground objects. The advantages of using different models for different classes include the generation of more details and improved shape integrity. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments and showcase potential applications, such as generating out-of-distribution scene images and easily changing the appearance of individual object instances. The contributions of this work include a general framework for high-quality conditional generation of complex scenes using multiple class-specific generators, a StyleGAN2-based conditional base generator, and state-of-the-art image quality synthesis.
