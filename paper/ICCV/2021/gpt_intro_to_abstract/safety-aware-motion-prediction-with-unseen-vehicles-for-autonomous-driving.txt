This paper introduces the concept of safety-aware motion prediction for autonomous driving systems. The authors highlight the importance of predicting the future trajectories of surrounding traffic participants to reduce the number of car accidents caused by human errors. The existing approaches to motion prediction are classified into two categories: trajectory prediction and occupancy map prediction. However, these approaches lack explicit modeling of safety and struggle with predicting unseen vehicles. To address these limitations, the authors propose a new task of safety-aware motion prediction that focuses on predicting the earliest occupancy time of each location, while also accounting for unseen vehicles. They propose a novel representation called earliest occupancy map and present a customized U-Net architecture with unique loss functions to train their model effectively. The authors also introduce new evaluation metrics to assess their model's performance and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods using the nuScene dataset. The paper also discusses different input and output representations used in prior work and highlights the need for explicit consideration of safety and unseen vehicles in motion prediction. The authors note that previous research on safety and uncertainty-aware autonomous driving systems has not adequately addressed the issue of unseen vehicles, making their proposed approach a valuable contribution to the field.
