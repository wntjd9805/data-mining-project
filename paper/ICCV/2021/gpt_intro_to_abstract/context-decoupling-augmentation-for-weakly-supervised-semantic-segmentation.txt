This paper introduces the concept of Context Decoupling Augmentation (CDA) as a method for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels. The authors highlight the limitations of traditional data augmentation methods, which focus on adjusting images as a whole without considering the contextual semantic relations. They propose CDA as an alternative approach to disassemble the inherent contextual information of the original image. This is achieved by randomly pasting well-segmented foreground instances into the input images. The authors conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of CDA, showing significant improvements in pseudo-masks. They achieve state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and COCO datasets. The main contributions of the paper are the introduction of a generally applicable data augmentation approach for WSSS and the development of CDA, which removes the correlation between foreground object instances and background context information. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of CDA in enhancing the performance of different WSSS methods.
