The quadratic assignment problem, also known as graph matching, is a combinatorial problem widely used in computer vision for feature matching. Deep graph matching, a modern approach that combines neural networks with combinatorial matching techniques, has gained increasing attention in the community. While previous deep graph matching methods employed linear assignment problem solvers, the most promising state-of-the-art method uses a fully featured graph matching solver. However, the scalability of deep graph matching is limited by the efficiency of the graph matching solvers. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a new graph matching technique that significantly improves the speed and accuracy of the state-of-the-art methods. The proposed technique achieves highly accurate solutions for problems with more than 500 features in less than a second.
