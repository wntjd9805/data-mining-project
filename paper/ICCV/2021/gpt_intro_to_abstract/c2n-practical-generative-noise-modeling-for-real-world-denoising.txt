Image denoising is a fundamental problem in computer vision, aiming to remove unintended signals from a noisy observation. While deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising performance for image denoising, there are challenges that prevent their practical application. One limitation is that learning-based approaches are usually data-driven and may not generalize well to real-world scenarios. Additionally, the assumption of additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) does not hold for real-world noise. While collecting well-aligned noisy and clean image pairs is an effective approach, it is challenging to acquire large-scale pairs. Self-supervised approaches using statistical properties of noise have also been found insufficient to represent real-world cases. Generation-based approaches that train a noise generator on target noisy images have been proposed, but a method for imitating real-world noise without paired clean images is lacking. In this paper, we introduce C2N, a generative noise modeling framework trained without paired data. C2N can learn complex noise distributions and generate accurate noisy images. We achieve state-of-the-art denoising performance by training existing models with the pairs generated by C2N. Our contributions include a novel noise generator that imitates real-world noise, a framework that simulates target noise distribution without unrealistic assumptions, and superior performance in denoising real photographs compared to unsupervised methods.
