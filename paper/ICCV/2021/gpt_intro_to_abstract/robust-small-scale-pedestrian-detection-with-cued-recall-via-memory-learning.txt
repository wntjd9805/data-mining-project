Pedestrian detection is a crucial topic in computer vision, with applications in video surveillance and autonomous driving systems. While visible modalities like RGB images are commonly used, thermal modalities have gained recent attention due to their robustness to illumination and weather variations. However, detecting small-scale pedestrians remains a challenge, as their visual appearance is often blurred and obscure in both modalities. Existing efforts to mitigate this issue have had limited success. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel pedestrian detection framework inspired by how humans distinguish small-scale pedestrians. Humans are able to recognize small-scale objects by recalling large-scale ones based on visual cues. The proposed framework includes a Large-scale Pedestrian Recalling (LPR) Memory, which memorizes and recalls the visual appearance of large-scale pedestrians even when faced with insufficient information from small-scale pedestrians. To effectively handle the small-scale pedestrians, the framework utilizes large-scale embedding learning. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through comprehensive experiments and visualization results using both thermal and visible modalities. The major contributions of this paper are twofold: first, it proposes a novel approach to small-scale pedestrian detection using the concept of cued recall; second, it introduces large-scale embedding learning to guide the LPR Memory in memorizing and recalling the appearance of large-scale pedestrians, resulting in robust detection of small-scale pedestrians.
