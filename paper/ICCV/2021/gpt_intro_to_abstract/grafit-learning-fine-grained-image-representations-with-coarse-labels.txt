This paper addresses the issue of training image classification models with limited or mismatched datasets and labels. While image classification has improved in performance, the granularity of training-time concepts may not be sufficient for fine-grained downstream tasks. The development of fine-grained classification datasets for specific domains has been challenging due to the difficulty of gathering a sufficiently large collection with fine-grained labels. Annotating rare classes precisely requires domain specialists, posing additional challenges. To overcome these issues, the paper proposes a strategy to achieve strong classification and image retrieval performance on fine concepts using only coarse labels at training. The approach leverages the use of multiple data augmentations and instance recognition to improve the granularity beyond provided labels. Additionally, a method is proposed that combines a coarse classifier and image embeddings to enhance fine-grained category-level retrieval. The proposed strategy liberates the data collection process from the limitations of fine-grained taxonomy and offers improved performance compared to existing approaches that do not explicitly rely on coarse labels for retrieving fine-grained concepts. The paper validates the strategy through two challenging use-cases: on-the-fly classification and category-level retrieval. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in both cases, offering significant improvements in accuracy and transfer learning. The paper concludes with comparisons against baselines, extensive ablation analysis, and supplementary material presenting additional experiments and visual results.
