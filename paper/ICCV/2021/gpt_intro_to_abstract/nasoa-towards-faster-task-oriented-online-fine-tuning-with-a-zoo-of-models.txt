Fine-tuning using pre-trained models has become the standard in computer vision, as it has shown impressive results in various tasks such as image classification, object detection, and segmentation. However, the current practice of fine-tuning has drawbacks when applied in an online setting. This paper proposes a faster online fine-tuning framework that addresses these drawbacks by decoupling the problem into finding efficient fine-tuning networks and generating optimal fine-tuning schedules. The authors introduce an offline Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to create an efficient fine-tuning model zoo, and an online learning algorithm to adaptively predict the best hyperparameter and model configurations for each task. The proposed framework achieves better fine-tuning results in terms of accuracy and efficiency compared to current practices and hyperparameter optimization methods. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework and the efficiency of the generated models. This work contributes to a faster fine-tuning pipeline that combines NAS and online adaptation, providing a personalized fine-tuning schedule and a flexible search space. The proposed framework has practical applications in cloud computing and AutoML pipelines, serving users with new data, tasks, and time constraints.
