This paper addresses the problem of collecting a large amount of video data from edge devices for training machine learning models in autonomous driving applications. The authors propose an online subset selection algorithm that can be deployed on edge devices to select the most informative video frames for training. They analyze and improve upon an existing multi-criteria subset selection framework by incorporating pointwise loss criteria. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using an autonomous driving simulator and real-world datasets for tasks such as drivable area segmentation and semantic segmentation. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing baselines in terms of compression ratio and preservation of task-specific information. The contributions of this work include introducing the challenge of multi-criteria subset selection in autonomous driving platforms, proposing two novel algorithms, and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods in reducing training data requirements.
