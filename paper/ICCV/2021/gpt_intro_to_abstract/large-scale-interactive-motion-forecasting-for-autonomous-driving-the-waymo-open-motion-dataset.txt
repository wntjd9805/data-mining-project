This paper introduces the importance of motion forecasting in autonomous driving systems and the challenges of predicting object motion in complex scenes. The authors argue that critical situations require the joint prediction of multiple interacting objects, and existing datasets have focused mostly on single agent representation. To address this limitation, the authors propose the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, a large-scale dataset with specific annotations for interacting objects. The dataset is derived from high-quality perception output across diverse scenes and multiple cities. The authors also introduce novel metrics for motion prediction analysis and provide benchmarks for evaluating prediction models. The Waymo Open Motion Dataset will be made publicly available to the research community to facilitate the development of motion forecasting models.
