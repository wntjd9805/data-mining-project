Abstract:Multi-view clustering (MvC) algorithms have been developed to integrate complementary information from multiple views and reveal the underlying data structure for clustering. Most MvC approaches are based on classical clustering methods like non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). In this paper, we focus on NMF-based MvC approaches. Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a fundamental clustering technique that factorizes input data into coefficient and base matrices. Orthogonality and low rank constraints have been explored in matrix factorization to achieve better performance. Some researches assume that all views share an underlying consensus manifold and employ a single coefficient matrix to capture the intrinsic data structure. Manifold regularization has been widely used to improve clustering performance, but it introduces higher computational and storage complexities. Existing approaches also fail to integrate multi-view matrix factorization with partition generation effectively. To address these issues, we propose an One-pass Multi-view Clustering (OPMC) algorithm that removes the non-negativity constraint and unifies matrix factorization with partition generation. The proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on six benchmarks and provides a non-parametric solution to the multi-view data clustering problem. An alternative strategy is designed to solve the optimization problem, and its convergence and computational complexity are analyzed theoretically and experimentally. Our contributions include the validation of the effectiveness of removing the non-negativity constraint and unifying matrix factorization with partition generation, the proposal of the OPMC algorithm, and the analysis of its convergence and computational complexity.
