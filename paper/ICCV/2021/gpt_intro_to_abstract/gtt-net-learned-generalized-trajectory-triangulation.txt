Trajectory triangulation is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims to estimate 3D geometry from sparse multi-view observations. Previous research has focused on modeling and estimating the spatio-temporal relationships among the observed 2D features, but has overlooked the analysis of higher-order semantic relationships among the estimated geometric entities. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to explicitly characterize and model these relationships within the context of generalized trajectory triangulation. The choice of geometric reference, either Eulerian or Lagrangian, impacts the analysis scope, with efficiency vs. comprehensiveness trade-offs. To achieve a middle ground, the paper introduces a method that learns to approximate pairwise affinities over all estimated geometric elements using sparse continuous convolutions. The paper builds upon the recent framework for generalized trajectory triangulation and focuses on learning to synthesize a global shape affinity matrix directly from the input 3D geometry. The contributions of this work include a learning-based solution for joint reconstruction and sequencing from multi-view image capture, a generalizable learning framework for diverse input shape domains, and an efficient and flexible cascaded training framework for diverse types of supervision.
