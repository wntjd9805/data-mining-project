The rapid growth of video capture and consumption has led to significant global video congestion. ML-based compression algorithms have shown promise in mitigating this issue. However, there are still challenges to overcome, such as achieving sufficient flexibility and efficiency to be practical in the real world. In this paper, we propose a new ML video codec, ELF-VC, that addresses these challenges by improving bitrate flexibility, compression efficiency, and speed. ELF-VC supports a wide range of bitrates on a per-frame basis with a single set of parameters, outperforms existing ML codecs in terms of compression efficiency, and runs at least 5x faster than other ML codecs. Our contributions include a novel framework for efficient rate control, an optimized backbone for strong compression performance, and an in-loop flow predictor for motion estimation.
