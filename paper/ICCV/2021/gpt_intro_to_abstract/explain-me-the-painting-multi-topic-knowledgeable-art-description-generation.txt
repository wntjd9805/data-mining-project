This paper introduces a framework for art description generation that aims to provide in-depth and comprehensive information about paintings from multiple artistic perspectives. The existing work in this field mainly focuses on the automatic analysis of paintings, such as attribute prediction and style identification. However, there is a lack of research that conveys detailed explanations of artworks for the general public. In this work, the authors propose a multi-topic and knowledgeable art description generation framework that generates rich descriptions of paintings. The framework incorporates external knowledge and utilizes a multi-topic language model to describe different aspects of the painting. The authors also introduce a knowledge retrieval module and a knowledge-filling module to retrieve relevant information and select appropriate concepts for each description. The framework is evaluated through quantitative comparisons, qualitative analysis, and human evaluation, showing that it generates satisfactory and informative art descriptions. The contributions of this work include the proposal of a framework for generating multi-topic long descriptions of fine-art paintings, the design of a multi-topic language modeling module, and the development of a knowledge retriever and knowledge-filling module. The authors also provide an annotated art description dataset and share it publicly to inspire future work in art understanding.
