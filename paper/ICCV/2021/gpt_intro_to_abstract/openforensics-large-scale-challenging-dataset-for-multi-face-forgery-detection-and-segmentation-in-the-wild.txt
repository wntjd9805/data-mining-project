Continuing advances in deep learning have led to impressive improvements in deepfake methods, which can change a person's identity. Techniques like autoencoder models and generative adversarial networks enable transferring one person's face to another while retaining the original expression and pose. The realistic appearance synthesized with deepfake methods has drawn attention in computer vision and graphics fields. However, falsified AI-synthesized images/videos have raised concerns about individual harassment and criminal deception. Conventional face forgery recognition methods are limited to processing one face at a time and are not suitable for real-world deployment due to their reliance on simple staged scenarios. To address the threats posed by face forgery attacks, it is crucial to develop countermeasures. This paper presents four contributions. First, it introduces multi-face forgery detection and segmentation tasks, aiming to process multiple faces simultaneously from an input image. Second, it proposes a forgery workflow that generates an infinite number of fake individual identities using GAN models for non-target face-swapping. Third, it introduces the OpenForensics dataset, a large-scale dataset designed for multi-face forgery detection and segmentation tasks. The dataset contains diverse backgrounds and multiple people of different characteristics. Finally, the paper presents a benchmark suite to evaluate and advance these tasks. The dataset, evaluation toolkit, and trained models will be freely available for further research and development.
