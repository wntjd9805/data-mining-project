The task of single image super-resolution (SISR) involves generating high resolution (HR) images from low resolution (LR) inputs. Traditional methods rely on prior cues from HR or LR images, while recent deep learning methods eliminate the need for explicit design of priors. However, most deep learning models are trained on HD images up to 2K resolution, making their performance on ultra-high definition (UHD) images unclear. This paper explores the performance of current SISR methods on UHD images, specifically 4K and 8K resolution. Two large-scale datasets, UHDSR4K and UHDSR8K, are collected from the internet. The paper proposes seven settings to evaluate existing methods, including upsampling factors, blur plus downsampling, and downsampling plus noise. Ten recent SISR methods are evaluated on these datasets, and models are trained on the new datasets. Additionally, the paper introduces a Mesh Attention Network (MANet) with a mesh attention module to enhance feature representation. The contributions of the paper include the introduction of the largest-scale UHD datasets for 4K and 8K image super-resolution, extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art SISR methods on these datasets, and the proposal of the MANet model with a mesh attention module.
