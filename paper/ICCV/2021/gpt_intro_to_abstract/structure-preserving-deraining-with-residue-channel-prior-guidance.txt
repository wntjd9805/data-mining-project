Single image deraining (SID) is a technique that aims to reconstruct visually pleasing images from rain-streaks-degraded images. Traditional methods for SID focused on exploring the physical properties of rain and background layers. However, these methods require complex iterative optimization to find the best solution. In recent years, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have achieved success in computer vision tasks, including rain removal. While CNN-based methods have shown improvements, they struggle to remove all rain streaks and recover the structural information of images in complex scenarios. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Structure-Preserving Deraining Network (SPDNet) with residue channel prior (RCP) guidance. The RCP, extracted from the rainy image, contains clear structures and can guide high-quality image reconstruction. SPDNet pays more attention to learning the background information and directly generates rain-free images with clear and accurate structures. It includes an RCP extraction module, an interactive fusion module (IFM), and a wavelet-based multi-level module (WMLM) as its backbone. The paper also introduces an iterative guidance strategy and a progressive reconstruction method to improve the accuracy of the RCP and the image quality. Experimental results show that SPDNet achieves state-of-the-art results in rain removal. The contributions of this paper include exploring the importance of RCP for rain removal, proposing SPDNet with RCP guidance, and designing modules and strategies for RCP extraction and progressive image reconstruction.
