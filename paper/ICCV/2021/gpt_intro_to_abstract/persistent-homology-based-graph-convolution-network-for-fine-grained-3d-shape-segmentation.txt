Fine-grained 3D semantic segmentation is a critical task for detailed processing and analysis of 3D shapes in various applications such as intelligent manufacturing, robotic manipulation, and human-machine interaction. However, segmenting fine-grained 3D objects faces challenges due to their complex structures and shape-dependent topological structures. Existing methods based on deep neural networks and geometric learning do not effectively capture the high-dimensional relationships and topological features of fine-grained objects. This paper proposes a novel network model called PHGCN that incorporates persistent homological features into a graph convolution network to enhance its ability to capture multi-scale topological features. Additionally, a Persistence Diagram Loss is introduced as a topological constraint to ensure coherent segmentation output. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PHGCN model achieves state-of-the-art results in fine-grained semantic segmentation. This work represents the first attempt to apply persistent homology to tackle fine-grained 3D semantic segmentation, and it extends the generic GNN/GCN structure with computational topological methods.
