The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the challenge of accurately forecasting the trajectories of autonomous systems such as self-driving vehicles. Multi-agent trajectory forecasting is difficult due to complex social interactions between agents and the uncertainty of each agent's future behavior. Most existing methods model the time and social dimensions separately, which can be suboptimal. To address this, the paper proposes a new Transformer model called AgentFormer that simultaneously learns representations from both dimensions. AgentFormer allows direct influence between agents' states in different time intervals and preserves agent identity information. The paper also introduces a multi-agent trajectory prediction framework that models social influence and uses a probabilistic formulation to generate socially-aware future trajectories. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on pedestrian and autonomous driving datasets. The contributions of the paper include the proposed Transformer model, the agent-aware attention mechanism, the multi-agent forecasting framework, and the improved performance on benchmark datasets.
