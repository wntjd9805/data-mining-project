In recent years, deep learning has led to significant advancements in the field of computer vision, particularly in the task of semantic segmentation. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great potential for real-world applications. However, these CNNs are often trained on a specific set of object classes and may struggle to identify objects that are not within this predefined set. These objects are referred to as out-of-distribution (OoD) samples. Detecting and correctly classifying OoD objects is crucial for ensuring the functional safety of neural networks in autonomous systems. An approach to address this challenge is to introduce a "none-of-the-known" class for objects that do not belong to any of the predefined classes. However, this approach requires a large amount of annotated data and may lead to performance drops. In this paper, we propose an alternative method for detecting OoD objects in semantic segmentation. Our method consists of two steps: re-training the segmentation CNN to predict low confidence scores for OoD inputs by maximizing model uncertainty and incorporating annotated OoD objects into the training process, and incorporating a meta classifier to flag incorrect class predictions at the segment level. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we use the Cityscapes dataset for initial model training and randomly select OoD samples from the COCO dataset. We evaluate the pixel-wise OoD detection performance using entropy thresholding on the LostAndFound and Fishyscapes datasets. Our contributions include successfully modifying the training of segmentation CNNs to improve OoD detection performance, outperforming baseline approaches and state-of-the-art methods from image classification. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of meta classification for distinguishing true positive and false positive OoD predictions without access to ground truth data. Overall, our approach provides an efficient and lightweight method for OoD detection in real-world applications based on deep learning.
