The paper introduces the concept of the light transport matrix (LTM) and its significance in various applications such as dual photography, image-based relighting, material properties acquisition, and depth estimation. It also discusses recent advancements in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging and the potential it holds in fields like medical imaging, autonomous driving, rescue operations, and defense. However, NLOS imaging still faces challenges due to the lack of established capabilities present in line-of-sight (LOS) imaging. To bridge this gap, the paper proposes a computational framework to obtain the LTM of a hidden scene using a wave-based phasor fields approach. The framework creates virtual light sources and cameras at the visible relay surface based on time-resolved measurements of the hidden scene. The authors address the challenges associated with NLOS imaging, including shallow depth-of-field and limited resolution, by developing virtual illumination and imaging functions. These functions exploit the NLOS virtual LTM to perform illumination decomposition and probe different elements of the matrix, including direct and indirect illumination and near-, middle-, and far-field indirect light decomposition. The paper concludes by summarizing its contributions, which include introducing the framework to obtain the LTM of a hidden scene, developing computational methods to address challenges in NLOS imaging, and demonstrating the separation of direct and indirect illumination components in hidden scenes using the virtual LTM.
