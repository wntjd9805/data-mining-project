3D object detection is an important task in robotics and autonomous driving, with applications in various fields. While traditional lidar systems are commonly used for accurate 3D detection, they are expensive and have limitations in terms of range and performance in challenging environments. Recently, a new approach called pseudo-lidar sensing has been proposed, which uses low-cost sensors to recover dense depth maps from conventional intensity imagers. However, these methods rely solely on passive camera-only sensing and suffer from limitations in long-range and low-light scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel 3D object detection method using gated imaging, which combines CMOS sensors with active temporal illumination. Gated imaging allows us to capture dense high-resolution images across different distances, and it can remove back-scatter by using early gates. We demonstrate that the temporal illumination variations in gated images can serve as a depth cue for 3D object detection. Our proposed method outperforms existing monocular and stereo detection methods, especially at long ranges. We validate our approach using real-world driving data and provide 3D annotations for gated data captured in different scenarios. Our method shows high accuracy in detecting objects up to 80 meters away, and it has the potential to replace expensive lidar systems for low-cost 3D object detection in automotive applications.
