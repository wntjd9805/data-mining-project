This paper introduces the concept of using mathematical models of the human body as an effective tool in various computer science tasks. Over the years, models of different levels of realism have been successfully utilized for tasks such as human motion analysis, pose and shape reconstruction, medical diagnosis and treatment, and image synthesis and video editing. These models are typically learned from large collections of 3D scans of real people, which capture the variations in body shape among the population.The GHUM model is a recently released model that describes the human body, including shape, pose, and facial expressions, as a mesh based on a low-dimensional parameterization. While this approach has been successful, there is still a need to explore how to best represent complex 3D deformable and articulated structures. Recent work has shown promise in representing surfaces as implicit functions, which describe surfaces by the zero-level-set of a function over points in 3D-space. This approach offers benefits such as flexibility in topology and spatial resolution.In this paper, the authors investigate the possibility of learning a data-driven statistical body model as an implicit function. They propose a novel network architecture and learning paradigm that enable the construction of detailed generative models of human pose, shape, and semantics, represented as Signed Distance Functions (SDFs). This approach aims to maintain the attractive properties of explicit human models, while overcoming the challenges of producing overly smooth shapes and failing for articulated humans.The authors present a multi-part network architecture that focuses on difficult-to-model body components such as hands and faces. Their model can be queried at arbitrary locations and is not bound to a specific resolution. It also carries the explicit semantics of mesh-based models, enabling tasks such as texturing and body part labeling. The authors demonstrate the capabilities of their model through extensive evaluation and showcase its usefulness in surface completion.Overall, this paper contributes to the field of computer science by proposing a novel approach to representing 3D deformable and articulated structures using implicit functions. The authors' model combines generative latent representations, network architectures, implicit losses, and multi-part components to achieve accurate and detailed representations of the human body. The availability of their models for research further enables future exploration and development in this area.
