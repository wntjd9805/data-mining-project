Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have greatly improved the accuracy of semantic segmentation. However, it is also important for these networks to indicate when their predictions may be unreliable. Existing approaches for joint prediction and calibration require changing the learning task and do not guarantee calibration. In this paper, we propose a post-processing calibration method for multi-label semantic segmentation that retains label probability order and segmentation accuracy. We extend the temperature scaling (TS) method to multi-label segmentation and make it adaptive to local image changes. Our contributions include spatially localized probability calibration, completely separated accuracy-preserving post-processing, theoretical justification, comprehensive analysis, and practical application in medical image analysis.
