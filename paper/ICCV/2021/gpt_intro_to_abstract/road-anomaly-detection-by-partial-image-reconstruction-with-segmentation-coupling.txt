Autonomous vehicles have led to advancements in computer vision methods, with deep neural networks being a key component. However, these networks require large amounts of labeled data, leading to extensive data acquisition and labeling efforts. This paper focuses on detecting road anomalies in a semantic segmentation setting, where the detection of unknown objects or "stuff" on the road surface is a challenge. To address this, the proposed approach combines information from a segmentation neural network with a reconstruction network module. The reconstruction module helps identify anomalies by emphasizing poor reconstruction outside of the known class. The main contributions of the paper include: (i) using image reconstruction to distinguish known classes from anomalies, (ii) efficiently coupling information from reconstruction and semantic segmentation, (iii) a plug-and-play module that can be used with existing segmentation networks, and (iv) achieving state-of-the-art results and better generalization to out-of-distribution data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to existing approaches. The paper concludes with a discussion of related work and a summary of the proposed JSR-Net method and its components.
