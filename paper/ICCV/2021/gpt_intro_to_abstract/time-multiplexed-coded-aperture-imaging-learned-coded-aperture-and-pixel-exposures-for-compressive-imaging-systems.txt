Computational imaging techniques that combine hardware and algorithms have led to the development of novel cameras for various applications, including spectral imaging, depth imaging, light-field imaging, and computed tomography. Compressive imaging approaches, in particular, have gained popularity for multiplexing visual information in a single snapshot to reconstruct high dynamic range images, videos, spectral information, and depth information. These systems use coding strategies to encode light and leverage physics-based forward models and optimization techniques for reconstruction. One advantage of compressive imaging is its ability to realize sparse measurements, such as capturing a single coded snapshot to recover a whole light field. However, the performance of compressive imaging is often impeded by sparse and highly structured measurement matrices. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a new coding technique called Time-Multiplexed Coded Aperture (TMCA), which provides better conditioning of the measurement matrices and can be realized using existing components in compressive imaging systems. The TMCA combines a conventional amplitude coded aperture with a coded exposure, achieved through temporal modulations of individual pixels. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of TMCA in two specific compressive imaging applications: hyperspectral imaging and light-field imaging. Additionally, the paper proposes learning the TMCA coding through joint optimization with a neural network decoder, enabling an end-to-end differentiable approach. The proposed TMCA codes, optimized for specific application constraints, can be deployed on physical devices for real-world scene capture. Experimental results show that the learned TMCA codes outperform traditional coded aperture systems and non-optimized TMCA baselines. Prototypes of a compressive light-field imaging system and a hyperspectral imager validate the improved performance of TMCA in real-world systems.
