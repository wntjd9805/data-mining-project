The fabrication of facial content in images and videos has become easier and faster with the advancement of deep-learning-based technologies. This has led to the creation of deepfakes, which are photorealistic fake images or videos produced by manipulating facial expressions or swapping faces. While deepfakes are often used for harmless purposes, such as parody videos and entertaining apps, they can also be used maliciously to defame individuals, spread disinformation, or commit fraud. As a result, there has been a growing interest in developing deepfake detection models.To contribute to the efforts in deepfake detection research, we introduce the Korean Deep-Fake Detection Dataset (KoDF). KoDF is the largest publicly available deepfake detection dataset, consisting of 175,776 fake clips and 62,166 real clips of 403 subjects. The deepfake samples in KoDF are generated using six different synthesis models, and the dataset includes measures to better manage the data distribution based on participants' age, sex, and content.KoDF aims to address the underrepresentation of Asian demographics in existing deepfake detection databases by primarily including Korean participants. In addition, we compare KoDF with other public deepfake detection datasets, highlighting its important differentiations. The quantitative comparison shows that KoDF provides a larger number of real and fake videos compared to other datasets.Our contributions are twofold. Firstly, we propose KoDF as the largest public deepfake detection dataset, considering the quality and diversity of its samples. Secondly, we experimentally demonstrate that using KoDF in conjunction with established deepfake detection datasets enhances the generality of a detection model, providing insights into future strategies in deepfake detection.
