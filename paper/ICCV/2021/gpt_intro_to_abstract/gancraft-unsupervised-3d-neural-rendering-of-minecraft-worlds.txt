This paper introduces GANcraft, a method for producing realistic renderings of 3D block worlds such as those in Minecraft. While existing image-to-image translation methods have made it possible to create photorealistic 2D images from simple sketches, creating realistic 3D scenes remains challenging and time-consuming. GANcraft aims to bridge this gap by allowing users to build a 3D world made of blocks representing various materials and then using an algorithm to generate a realistic looking 3D world. The proposed method has potential applications in entertainment, education, and rapid prototyping for artists. The paper presents the challenges in generating 3D photorealistic worlds from block representations and highlights the limitations of existing techniques. It then describes the GANcraft framework, which trains neural renderers using pseudo-ground truth images generated by a pretrained image synthesis model. The paper also introduces a new neural rendering network architecture that produces state-of-the-art results conditioned on a style image. The key contributions of this work include the novel task of world-to-world translation, a framework for training neural renderers without ground truth data, and a new neural rendering network architecture. The effectiveness of GANcraft is demonstrated using Minecraft, but the method can be applied to other 3D block world representations as well.
