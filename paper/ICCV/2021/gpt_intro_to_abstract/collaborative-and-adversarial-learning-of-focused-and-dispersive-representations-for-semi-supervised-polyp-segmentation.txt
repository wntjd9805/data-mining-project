Automatic segmentation of polyps is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC), which is a prevalent type of cancer globally. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in image segmentation tasks, including medical tasks like blood vessel segmentation, skin lesion segmentation, lung nodule segmentation, and cell nuclei segmentation. However, the lack of sufficient pixel-wise annotations poses a significant challenge for automatic medical segmentation, as annotating medical data such as polyps is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised polyp segmentation method that leverages collaborative segmentation networks with two different feature extraction modules. We use an adversarial learning approach in combination with auxiliary adversarial learning to train the segmentation networks with both labeled and unlabeled images. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive experiments on the Kvasir dataset and CVC-Clinic DB. Our contributions include the introduction of two feature extraction modules, the simultaneous training of two segmentation networks and a discriminator network, and the use of auxiliary adversarial learning to improve the quality of segmentation predictions from unlabeled images.
