In this paper, we address the problem of modeling hand-object interaction from a single image. We aim to estimate both the hand-object pose and the natural grasp configuration. While previous works have focused on separately estimating either the hand or the object, simultaneous estimation of hand-object pose with interaction has only recently gained attention. Most existing methods treat contact as a result of correct pose estimation, but achieving perfect recovery of both the hand and object is not practical. Therefore, we propose a novel representation called Contact Potential Field (CPF) to explicitly model the contacts between hand and object vertices. CPF assigns per-vertex contact semantics to the object mesh and controls disjointedness and interpenetration. We also introduce a new anatomically constrained hand model called A-MANO to improve the representation of the hand. To evaluate our method, we report scores on the FHB and HO3D datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on reconstruction and physical metrics. Our contributions include the proposal of CPF for contact modeling, the development of A-MANO for anatomical-constrained hand representation, and the introduction of the MIHO framework for modeling hand-object interaction.
