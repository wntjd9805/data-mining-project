The proposed paper introduces the Graph Contrastive Clustering (GCC) method, which aims to improve the clustering performance by incorporating the latent category information. Existing clustering methods lack discriminative features and suffer from sub-optimal clustering solutions. The GCC method uses a graph contrastive framework that assumes samples in the same cluster and their augmentations share similar representations and clustering assignments. The framework includes two graph contrastive modules: the representation graph contrastive module, which uses a graph Laplacian based contrastive loss to learn more discriminative features, and the assignment graph contrastive module, which uses a novel graph-based contrastive learning strategy to learn more compact clustering assignments. Experimental results on various datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The main contributions of the paper include the introduction of the graph contrastive framework, the GCC method for clustering, and significant improvements in clustering performance.
