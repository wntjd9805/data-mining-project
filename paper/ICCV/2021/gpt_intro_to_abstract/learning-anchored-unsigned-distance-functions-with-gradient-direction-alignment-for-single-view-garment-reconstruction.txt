This paper introduces a unified shape learning framework for single-view 3D garment reconstruction. The proposed framework utilizes the Anchored Unsigned Distance Function (AnchorUDF), a learnable unsigned distance function that enriches 3D position features of query points with anchor points around 3D surfaces. Unlike existing methods that rely on parametric models and predefined templates, the proposed framework can handle non-closed garment surfaces, capture multiple topologies of different garment categories, and retain fine-scale geometric details. The AnchorUDF is trained to align its spatial gradient direction with the ground-truth direction to the surface, resulting in more accurate projection of query points. The contributions of this work include the unified shape learning framework, the introduction of AnchorUDF, and the alignment of the gradient direction for more accurate projection.
