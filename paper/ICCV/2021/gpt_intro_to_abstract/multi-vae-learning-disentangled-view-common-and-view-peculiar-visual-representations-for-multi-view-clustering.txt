Clustering analysis is a widely studied topic in computer science, which aims to group data with similar patterns or characteristics together. With the rapid development of deep learning, deep clustering methods have shown significant improvements in clustering performance compared to shallow models. In real-world applications, visual data is often collected from multiple views or diverse sources, which requires the use of multi-view clustering methods to capture more comprehensive characteristics. Existing multi-view clustering methods can be categorized into three groups: multi-view spectral clustering, non-negative matrix factorization, and subspace clustering. However, these methods suffer from high complexity, making them inefficient for handling large-scale data clustering tasks.In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Multi-VAE for multi-view clustering. We introduce a view-common variable and multiple view-peculiar variables in a multiple Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture to learn disentangled and explainable visual representations. The view-common variable captures the common visual representation across views, while each view-peculiar variable focuses on the peculiar visual representation of each view. By disentangling the cluster information and peculiar visual information, our framework reduces interference and improves clustering performance. We use Gumbel Softmax distribution and Gaussian distribution as prior distributions for the cluster and peculiar visual representations, respectively. The mutual information capacity of the latent variables is controlled during training to disentangle the representations.The contributions of our work include the proposal of the Multi-VAE framework, which introduces view-common and view-peculiar variables for multi-view clustering. Our framework successfully disentangles the common cluster representation and peculiar visual representations of multiple views, leading to improved clustering performance. Compared to other methods, Multi-VAE shows superior performance and has linear complexity with respect to data size. This work is the first attempt to implement multi-view clustering using disentangled and explainable representations.
