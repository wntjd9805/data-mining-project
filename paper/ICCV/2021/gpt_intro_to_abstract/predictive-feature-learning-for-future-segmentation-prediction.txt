Future segmentation prediction is an essential task for various applications in decision-making intelligent systems, including autonomous driving, visual surveillance, and robot designing. This task involves predicting segmentation masks for unobserved future frames, which enables applications such as collision avoidance for self-driving cars. In this paper, we address the problem of future segmentation prediction by proposing a new approach that learns a predictive feature through an autoencoder. Previous methods have focused on predicting high-resolution and detailed segmentation features, but we argue that this approach conflicts with reliable future prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments, achieving state-of-the-art results in future instance segmentation and future semantic segmentation prediction. Our proposed framework offers a promising solution to improve future segmentation prediction by learning a more accurate and reliable predictive feature.
