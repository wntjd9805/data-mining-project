Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in various computer vision tasks, but their performance heavily relies on large amounts of labeled data. This creates a challenge as labeling data is time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, there is a need to train deep neural networks using only unlabeled data while maintaining comparable performance to supervised learning. Unsupervised learning techniques have been widely explored to address this challenge, but they suffer from limitations such as error-prone clustering, weak class discrimination, and inconsistent supervision. To overcome these limitations, we propose an Instance-to-Instance Semantic Learning (ISL) method that mines the underlying feature manifold and learns the semantic similarity among instances. Our method employs Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to achieve this and utilizes contrastive loss with hard positive enhancement to learn discriminative features. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ISL method, which outperforms other unsupervised learning methods. Furthermore, our ISL method can be integrated with existing unsupervised features to further improve performance.
