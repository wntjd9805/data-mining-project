The accurate identification of pixel-wise correspondences is crucial for various tasks in computer vision and robotics. However, existing methods often struggle with challenging cross-image variations, leading to incorrect matches. To address this issue, recent research has focused on correspondence pruning to identify correct matches while rejecting false ones. This paper proposes a progressive correspondence pruning approach that gradually prunes correspondences based on consensus scores estimated from local-to-global graphs. Unlike previous methods that treat correspondence pruning as a per-match classification task, the proposed approach aims to identify a subset of reliable candidates through iterative pruning. The paper also introduces a local-to-global consensus learning framework that captures local and global correspondence contexts using dynamic graphs. This approach mitigates the effects of unbalanced initial matches and random outlier distributions. The paper presents empirical evaluations on tasks such as line fitting, camera pose estimation, and retrieval-based image localization, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
