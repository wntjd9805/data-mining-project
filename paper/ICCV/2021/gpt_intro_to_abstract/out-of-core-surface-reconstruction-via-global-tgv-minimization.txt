This paper presents a surface reconstruction method for photogrammetry that utilizes the available data in an out-of-core fashion, allowing for highly detailed noise-free surface reconstructions on affordable computers with limited RAM. The method can take both depth maps and terrestrial LIDAR scans as input and has strong noise-filtering properties. The implementation of the method ensures low memory usage, even for large datasets, and utilizes parallelism for efficient processing. Calculation-heavy stages are accelerated using GPUs. The proposed method is demonstrated on a Copenhagen city dataset, showcasing the ability to handle an arbitrary large scene with 27472 aerial photos.
