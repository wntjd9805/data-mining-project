Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, and it has seen significant advancements with the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). One-stage detectors, also known as dense detectors, have gained popularity due to their speed and accuracy. However, these detectors suffer from inconsistency between the classification and regression heads, which affects localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new approach called mutual supervision (MuSu) for dense detectors. MuSu separates the training samples for the classification and regression heads and establishes mutual dependencies between them. By assigning soft targets and weights to the training samples, MuSu ensures consistency between the two heads during training. This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted geometric priors and achieves adaptive sample assignment. Experimental results on the MS COCO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving higher average precision (AP) compared to existing detectors. We also show that incorporating MuSu can further improve performance when using larger backbone networks.
