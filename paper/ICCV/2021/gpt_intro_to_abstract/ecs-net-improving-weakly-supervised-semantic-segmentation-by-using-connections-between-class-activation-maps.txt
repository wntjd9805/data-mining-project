Semantic segmentation is a crucial computer vision task that involves assigning category labels to each pixel in an image. Fully supervised semantic segmentation methods have seen significant advancements in recent years, thanks to the development of Fully Convolutional Network (FCN). However, these methods require datasets with pixel-level annotations, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive to create. To address these difficulties, researchers have explored weakly supervised strategies, where only image-level annotations are used.One common approach in weakly supervised semantic segmentation is to generate pseudo labels using low-degree supervision, such as bounding boxes, scribbles, points, or image-level annotations, and then train fully supervised segmentation approaches using these pseudo labels. In this work, we focus on image-level weakly supervised semantic segmentation, which has the lowest time and labor costs. However, image-level annotations fail to provide precise object localization information, which is crucial for accurate segmentation.To tackle this issue, researchers have used Class Activation Map (CAM) to introduce additional location supervisions. CAM, while simple in structure, has limitations that prevent it from being directly used as pseudo labels, such as focusing on specific object parts and introducing over-activation noise. Various object region mining techniques have been proposed to address these limitations, but they only use image-level labels as supervision, making it challenging to resolve the issues introduced by over-activation noise.To address the performance gap between weakly and fully supervised methods, we propose a novel framework called Erased CAM Supervision Net (ECS-Net). Our method leverages the predictions of erased images to provide additional segmentation supervisions. We first erase high response regions from images and generate new CAMs of these erased images. We then sample reliable pixels from the new CAMs and use their segmentation predictions as semantic labels to train the original CAMs. Compared to erasing multiple times, our method only requires a single erasing step, thus avoiding excessive noise. We conduct extensive ablation studies to determine optimal hyperparameters, and our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ECS-Net in learning better segment information, suppressing noise, and achieving higher mIoU scores on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.Overall, our work contributes a simple, efficient, and novel framework that narrows the performance gap between weakly and fully supervised semantic segmentation methods. By utilizing erased images and their predictions, our ECS-Net method provides additional segmentation cues, suppresses noise, and achieves state-of-the-art results.
