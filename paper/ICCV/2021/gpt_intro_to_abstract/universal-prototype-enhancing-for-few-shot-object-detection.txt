Recently, deep learning has made significant progress in object detection. However, the success of object detection relies on abundant annotated objects in training images for each category. Few-shot object detection (FSOD) is a challenging task that aims to improve the detection performance for novel objects that appear rarely in the annotated training images. The main challenge of FSOD lies in learning generalized object features from both abundant samples in base categories and few samples in novel categories. Meta-learning strategies have been utilized for this purpose but have shown weak performance compared to basic fine-tuning methods. This paper explores how to enhance the generalization ability of object feature learning by incorporating invariant object characteristics. The proposed approach uses universal prototypes, which are learned from all object categories and capture rich information from different categories and image contexts. The universal prototypes reduce the impact of data imbalance and can be effectively adapted to data-scarce novel categories. A framework called FSODup is developed, which utilizes a soft-attention mechanism to enhance object features with the learned universal prototypes. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The contributions of this work include the development of a dedicated prototype and a new framework for FSOD, demonstrating the successful adaptation of object detectors to novel categories with universal-prototype enhanced features, and achieving improved performance on benchmark datasets. The empirical evidence also confirms the ability of universal prototypes to enhance object characteristics, which is beneficial for FSOD.
