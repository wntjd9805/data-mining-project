Gait recognition is a crucial biometric pattern that can be authenticated at a distance without the subject's cooperation. However, variations in body shape and appearance pose challenges to gait recognition algorithms. Previous approaches focused on extracting global features using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), but these features do not consider spatial structure and local details. Part-based models have the potential to address these challenges by extracting part features, but existing methods neglect the varying scales and locations of different body parts. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel 3D local operation for gait recognition backbones. Our 3D local operations support the extraction of adaptive 3D local volumes for each specific body part and incorporate part-specific sequential information. We introduce four modules in our local operation, including localization, sampling, feature extraction, and fusion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on popular gait recognition datasets and show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, our framework enables the interaction and boosting of global and local 3D volume information in any layer of 3D CNNs. Overall, our work makes significant contributions to gait recognition research by addressing the limitations of existing approaches and introducing a new building block for backbone 3D CNNs.
