This paper addresses the problem of achieving coherence in surface representations for various applications such as UV-mapping, shape analysis, and partial scan-completion. Previous methods rely on explicitly computing correspondences between non-coherent input representations, but this approach does not retrieve a truly coherent surface representation. The authors propose a method that learns to reconstruct temporally-coherent surfaces from a sequence of 3D point clouds. They use the AtlasNet patch-based representation and enforce consistency of the patch locations to create a time-consistent atlas. The authors leverage differential geometry to require correspondences to model close-to-isometric deformations, resulting in a metric-consistency loss function that establishes meaningful point correspondences. Their unsupervised approach does not require ground-truth correspondences and can operate on any shape category without a known template. Experimental results demonstrate the reliable correspondences provided by their method, even in complex shape and severe deformation scenarios.
