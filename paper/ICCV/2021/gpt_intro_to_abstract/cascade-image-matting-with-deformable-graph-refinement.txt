Image matting is a widely used image processing technology that involves extracting high-quality alpha mattes from given images. Alpha mattes represent the opacity of foreground objects at each pixel and are essential for various applications in image and video editing. However, existing matting methods have limitations in terms of accuracy and handling slender objects. This paper proposes a Cascade Image Matting Network with Deformable Graph Refinement (CasDGR) to address these limitations. The CasDGR approach uses a network cascade architecture to generate accurate contours and details of foreground objects. It also incorporates a Deformable Graph Refinement module based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to extract high-quality features and handle slender objects. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Adobe human image dataset and demonstrates good results on real-world human images. The CasDGR approach is automatic and does not require trimaps as additional inputs, making it convenient and feasible for various applications. The experimental results show that the CasDGR approach outperforms existing trimap-based methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.
