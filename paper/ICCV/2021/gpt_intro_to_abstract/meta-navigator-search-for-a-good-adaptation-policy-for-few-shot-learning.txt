Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have revolutionized computer vision tasks by leveraging hierarchical feature representations learned from annotated data. However, CNNs require a large amount of labeled data, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. Few-shot learning has emerged as a promising solution to address the data scarcity issue by utilizing prior knowledge learned from previous tasks. In this paper, we propose an automated approach to search for optimal parameter adaptation policies for few-shot learning. Our search space includes policies for adapting convolutional layers and obtaining class prototypes, covering popular meta-learning algorithms. We develop a differentiable meta-learning policy search algorithm that efficiently searches for these policies using gradient-based optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming baselines and achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets. This work contributes to the advancement of automated meta-learning designs for few-shot learning tasks.
