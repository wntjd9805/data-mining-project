Co-salient object detection (Co-SOD) is a task that aims to identify common and salient objects in a group of related images. While previous Co-SOD methods have made progress, they often fail to mimic the human visual system's approach to this problem. Humans typically observe all the images in a group and summarize the consensus knowledge about what objects the group is focusing on before searching for corresponding objects in each image.This paper presents a novel consensus-aware dynamic convolution (CADC) model for Co-SOD. The model first summarizes the features of the entire group of images and encodes the consensus knowledge as dynamic kernels, which capture the appearance traits of common objects. Then, the searching step is performed by convolving the image features with the dynamic kernels to obtain final results. To address the limitations of existing models, the proposed CADC model combines multi-scale max-pooling and self-attention mechanisms to achieve both model scalability and stability in consensus feature extraction. In terms of dynamic kernel generation, the model constructs image-adaptive kernels and a common kernel simultaneously. The image-adaptive kernels capture fine-grained image-specific cues, while the common kernel summarizes coarse group-wise common knowledge. This dual kernel approach helps avoid overemphasizing image-specific information and considers spatial structures in the searching process.In addition, the paper proposes a novel and effective data synthesis method to improve the Co-SOD performance by simulating real-world scenarios. This method fuses common objects with unrelated salient objects in two different ways, providing more diverse training data for Co-SOD models.The contributions of this work include the introduction of the CADC model, which leverages dynamic convolution for Co-SOD. The model incorporates multi-scale max-pooling and self-attention mechanisms to extract consensus features and generates two types of dynamic kernels for image-specific cues and group-wise common knowledge. The paper also presents a data synthesis method to enhance training data diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CADC network achieves state-of-the-art Co-SOD results.
