Image forgery forensics involves the challenging task of localizing forged regions, especially in the presence of post-processing operations like filtering, resampling, and compression. JPEG compression is widely used to reduce transmission bandwidth and storage space in social networks, but it eliminates subtle tampering artifacts, degrading the performance of forgery forensic methods. Additionally, various image tampering manipulations can seriously impact the generalization capability of forensic methods. Conventional handcrafted feature-based methods rely on specific manipulation artifacts to expose forgeries, while deep learning-based methods offer better performance in forgery localization due to their powerful feature representation capability. However, training deep learning models using targeted data augmentation strategies with tampered JPEG images suffers from two main issues: undermining boundary transitions and demanding diverse JPEG samples. To address these issues, this paper proposes a self-supervised domain adaptation network, consisting of a backbone network and a compression approximation network (ComNet), for JPEG-resistant image forgery localization. The ComNet approximates the JPEG compression operation through self-supervised learning, generating JPEG-agent images with generalizable compression characteristics. The backbone network, with a Siamese architecture, is trained using domain adaptation to improve performance against JPEG compression. The paper's contributions include a conditional random field-based attention module to highlight the transition boundary of forged regions, an encoder-decoder based ComNet to approximate JPEG compression, and the application of domain adaptation to alleviate the domain shift.
