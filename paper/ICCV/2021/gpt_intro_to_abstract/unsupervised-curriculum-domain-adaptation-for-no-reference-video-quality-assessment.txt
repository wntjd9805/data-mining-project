The recent explosion of user-generated videos shared and streamed over the Internet has led to the need for improved video coding, storage, and streaming over communication networks. This has spurred research in video quality assessment (VQA) algorithms that can predict human judgments of perceptual quality. Objective VQA models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising results but often struggle with practical applications due to domain disparities between training and testing data. To address this, domain adaptation techniques have been proposed to learn domain-invariant representations. However, applying domain adaptation to VQA is challenging due to the subjective nature of quality assessment. Additionally, the traditional approach of predicting mean-opinion-score (MOS) may not adequately capture the subjectivity in quality assessment. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised domain adaptation approach, called Unsupervised Curriculum Domain Adaptation (UCDA), for no-reference VQA. Our approach leverages the distribution of subjective scores to reveal the intrinsic subjectivity of quality assessment. The proposed approach consists of two stages: aligning feature distributions between labeled source data and unlabeled target data, and conducting fine-level adaptation between two subdomains based on prediction confidences. We introduce an uncertainty-based ranking function to sort samples into different subdomains and apply a two-stage adversarial adaptation to improve adaptation performance. Our contributions include the explicit highlighting of transferable knowledge in VQA across different domains, the development of a ranking function for curriculum construction, and the introduction of a two-stage adversarial adaptation approach.
