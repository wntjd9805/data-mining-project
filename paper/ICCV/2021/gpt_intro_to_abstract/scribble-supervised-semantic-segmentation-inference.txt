Semantic segmentation is a fundamental topic in computer vision, with numerous deep learning methods developed to tackle this task. However, these methods typically require a large number of fully annotated samples, which can be challenging and time-consuming. To address this, weakly supervised semantic segmentation, which relies on more convenient annotations, is desired. There are four main annotation methods for weakly supervised semantic segmentation: image-level labels, clicks, bounding boxes, and scribbles. While image-level labels and clicks provide limited supervision, bounding boxes can lead to confusion labels, and scribbles offer more flexibility.In this paper, we focus on scribble-supervised semantic segmentation and propose a progressive segmentation inference framework. This framework leverages the dependence between low-level vision and high-level semantics to infer segmentation. It consists of two components: multi-granular contextual pattern propagation (CPP) and progressive semantic label diffusion (SLD). CPP mines pattern correlations from different convolutional layers and spatial positions, enhancing pixel-level feature patterns through information aggregation in the contextual domain. The introduction of a graph structure in CPP allows for better estimation of pixel labels and more effective supervision of top layers on bottom layers during training. SLD extends annotated scribbles to neighboring confident areas based on segmentation model predictions from CPP. An adaptive decision strategy is used to select high-confidence regions as pseudo ground truths for continuous refinement of unknown segmentation labels. These two components are encapsulated in a close-looping inference process for progressive segmentation prediction.The proposed progressive segmentation inference framework is evaluated through extensive experiments, demonstrating its successful evolution of segmentation model and labels. The results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in scribble-supervised semantic segmentation. In summary, our contributions are three-fold: (1) the proposal of a novel progressive segmentation inference framework for scribble-supervised semantic segmentation, (2) the development of two crucial components, multi-granular contextual pattern propagation and progressive semantic label diffusion, and (3) the validation of the effectiveness of these components through experimental results.
