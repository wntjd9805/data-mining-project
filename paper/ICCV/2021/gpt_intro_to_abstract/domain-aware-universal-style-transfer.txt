The paper introduces a novel approach, called Domain-aware Style Transfer Networks (DSTN), for image style transfer. The authors address the limitations of existing style transfer methods in handling reference images from different domains, such as artistic and photo-realistic. They propose a unified architecture that combines an auto-encoder with domain-aware skip connections and a domainness indicator. The domain-aware skip connections balance between content preservation and texture stylization, while the domainness indicator captures the characteristics of the reference image. Experimental results on Microsoft COCO and WikiArt datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DSTN in generating high-quality stylized results for both photo-realistic and artistic styles. The contributions of the paper include the proposed architecture, the domainness indicator, and the improved performance in preservation and stylization compared to previous methods.
