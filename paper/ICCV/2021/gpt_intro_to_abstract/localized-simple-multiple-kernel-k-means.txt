Multiple kernel clustering (MKC) is a powerful method for grouping samples into clusters by combining information from multiple sources. Various algorithms have been developed in this field, such as the multiple kernel k-means clustering algorithm and the optimal neighborhood multiple kernel clustering algorithm. Late fusion based multiple kernel clustering strategies aim to achieve consensus on the partition level by aligning multiple base partitions with a consensus partition. A recent development in MKC is the SimpleMKKM algorithm, which minimizes kernel weights and maximizes the clustering partition matrix. However, the authors of this paper observe that SimpleMKKM does not effectively handle sample variation and local structures, leading to unsatisfying clustering performance. To address this issue, the authors propose a local kernel alignment criterion that aligns the generated combined kernel with the ideal similarity matrix in the k-nearest neighborhood of each sample. They derive the objective function of their algorithm based on the minimization-maximization optimization framework of SimpleMKKM and prove that SimpleMKKM is a special case of their proposed algorithm. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed localized SimpleMKKM algorithm, outperforming state-of-the-art competitors. The contributions of this paper include the identification of the limitations of SimpleMKKM, the development of a local kernel alignment criterion, and the theoretical connection between SimpleMKKM and the proposed algorithm.
