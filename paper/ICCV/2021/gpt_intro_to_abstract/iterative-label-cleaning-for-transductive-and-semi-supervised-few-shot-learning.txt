Few-shot learning is a challenging task in deep learning due to limited supervision and limited data. Meta-learning and transfer learning have shown promise in addressing these limitations, with semi-supervised learning being a dominant approach. Transductive inference, a pillar of semi-supervised learning, is closely related to few-shot learning. In this paper, we propose a method that leverages the idea of predicting pseudo-labels on unlabeled data, using graph-based methods such as label propagation. However, the quality of pseudo-labels is crucial in few-shot learning, and we address this by cleaning the labels based on the loss value statistics of a small-capacity classifier. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in transductive and semi-supervised few-shot learning tasks.
