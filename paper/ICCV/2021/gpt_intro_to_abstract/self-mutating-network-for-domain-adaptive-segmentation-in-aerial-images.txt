Aerial imagery is widely used in various applications such as urban planning and autonomous vehicles. The segmentation of buildings from aerial images is crucial for digital map generation. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successful in building segmentation, outperforming classical methods. However, CNNs suffer from performance degradation when applied to different domains of aerial imagery. Domain adaptation (DA) has recently gained attention as a technique for resolving these limitations. Transfer learning and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been explored for DA, but have shown limitations. In this paper, we propose a GAN-based self-mutating network (SMN) to improve building segmentation in aerial images from different domains. The SMN adaptively adjusts the parameters of the network itself based on the domain of the input image using parameter mutation and fluctuation techniques. The main contributions of this study are the development of the SMN and the introduction of parameter mutation and fluctuation techniques for precise domain-adaptive semantic segmentation. The proposed SMN fine-tunes the parameters on every testing image, resulting in improved performance.
