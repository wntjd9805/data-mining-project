Nowadays, image enhancement has become popular as more people take photographs to record and share their valuable moments. However, these photos often suffer from low dynamic ranges or distorted color tones due to inadequate lighting conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel enhancement approach called "representative color transform" (RCT) to effectively address these issues. RCT takes advantage of the high-level context information extracted from the input image to determine representative colors and estimate transformed colors for these representatives. The similarity between the input image and the representative colors is computed, and a representative color transform is developed to obtain the enhanced image by combining the similarity and the representative color transformation. To achieve this, we introduce the representative color transform network (RCTNet), which consists of encoder, feature fusion, global RCT, and local RCT modules. Experimental results on the MIT-Adobe 5K dataset show that RCTNet outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, and we also demonstrate the scalability of RCTNet in low-light image enhancement and underwater image enhancement scenarios. The main contributions of this paper are the development of the representative color transformation for image enhancement, the design of RCTNet, and the demonstration of its scalability in various image enhancement problems.
