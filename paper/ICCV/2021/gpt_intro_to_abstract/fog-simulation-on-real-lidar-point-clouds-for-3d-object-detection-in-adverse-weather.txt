The introduction to the computer science paper discusses the importance of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) in the development of safe autonomous cars. LiDAR measures precise distances of objects from the sensor, providing valuable depth information. However, LiDAR sensors face challenges when it comes to the presence of fog, as the light pulses emitted by the sensor undergo backscattering and attenuation in the presence of water particles. This can result in spurious returns in the acquired LiDAR point cloud, making it difficult to achieve robust performance in outdoor applications under all weather conditions. The paper highlights the scarcity of LiDAR foggy data for training deep neural networks and proposes a physically-based fog simulation to generate foggy LiDAR point clouds from clear-weather data. The authors demonstrate that training state-of-the-art 3D object detection pipelines on partially synthetic foggy data leads to improved robustness on real foggy data. The paper also explores the non-uniform distribution of noise introduced by fog around the LiDAR sensor and discusses potential solutions, such as electric vehicles reducing sensor noise caused by exhaust smoke.
