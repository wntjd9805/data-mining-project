The paper introduces Pyramid R-CNN, a two-stage 3D detection framework for vehicles, pedestrians, and other objects using 3D point clouds as input. It aims to enhance detection adaptability and performance by applying it on multiple 3D backbones. The framework leverages RoI reÔ¨Ånement stage to surpass single-stage detectors. Unlike 2D counterparts, 3D detection models perform various RoI feature extraction operations on the Points of Interest (PoI) originating from the raw point clouds. However, PoIs suffer from sparsity and non-uniform distribution characteristics of input point clouds, making it challenging to identify object categories and handle imbalanced conditions effectively. To overcome these limitations, the paper proposes Pyramid R-CNN with a novel RoI feature extraction head called pyramid RoI head. This head consists of three key components: RoI-grid Pyramid, RoI-grid Attention, and Density-Aware Radius Prediction (DARP) module. RoI-grid Pyramid captures more PoIs outside RoIs while maintaining geometric details. RoI-grid Attention extracts RoI-grid features effectively by attending to crucial PoIs. DARP module predicts the feature extraction radius of each RoI based on the neighboring distribution of PoIs, addressing the imbalanced distribution problem. Experimental results show that Pyramid R-CNN consistently outperforms baselines, achieving high detection accuracy on datasets like KITTI and Waymo.
