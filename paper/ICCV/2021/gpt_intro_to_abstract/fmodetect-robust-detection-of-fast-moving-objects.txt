Fast moving objects (FMOs) are objects that appear significantly blurred in images due to their high speed. These objects, such as fast cars, falling objects, and flying insects, are commonly seen in sports videos. However, the research community has largely ignored the detection and tracking of FMOs. Existing tracking datasets do not include FMOs as their ground truth annotations. In this paper, we propose a method to detect and track FMOs by combining deep learning and energy minimization-based deblurring. Our method is simpler, requires less parameter tuning, and performs well across various scenarios. We also introduce a new synthetic dataset for training and demonstrate the method's effectiveness on real-world data. Our approach is faster than previous methods and allows for real-time FMO retrieval from large video collections. Additionally, we propose a novel energy minimization-based deblurring approach for sharp appearance estimation of FMOs. we present the first learned approach to the problem of FMO detection and our method achieves state-of-the-art results.
