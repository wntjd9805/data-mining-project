In recent years, deep learning techniques have made significant advancements in medical image classification using large-scale datasets. Several studies have achieved impressive results in detecting chest and lung diseases, classifying skin lesions, and screening for breast cancer. However, a key question remains: can we further improve deep learning performance on medical datasets without relying on domain knowledge? This paper presents a novel approach to optimize deep learning by maximizing the AUC score (area under the ROC curve), which offers several advantages over minimizing cross-entropy loss. The AUC score is the default metric for evaluation in medical classification tasks and is better suited for handling imbalanced data distributions. While maximizing AUC is more challenging than minimizing misclassification error, the proposed method tackles scalability issues associated with previous AUC maximization techniques. To address the limitations of existing methods, the paper introduces a new margin-based surrogate loss, the AUC min-max-margin loss, which is robust to noisy data and not adversely affected by easy data. The min-max form of the AUC margin loss allows for scalability and can be optimized with existing large-scale optimization algorithms. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through empirical studies on difficult medical image classification tasks, where it outperforms standard deep learning methods. The paper concludes by highlighting the contributions of the study, including the introduction of the robust surrogate loss and the demonstration of superior performance in medical image classification.
