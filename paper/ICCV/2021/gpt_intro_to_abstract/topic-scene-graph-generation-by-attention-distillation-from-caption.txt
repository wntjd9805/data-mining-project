This paper introduces the concept of the Topic Scene Graph, a more informative and concise representation of image contents, by leveraging the information from image captions. The traditional scene graph, consisting of objects and relationships between them, often contains irrelevant and trivial details. To address this issue, the authors propose a method to identify important relationships by distilling visual attention during caption generation. By transforming humans' attention from individual objects to relational events, the importance of relationships can be estimated without the need for strong supervision. Additionally, the authors suggest generating image captions and scene graphs simultaneously using a single model, allowing for better diversity in relationship descriptions. The redefined scene graph, consisting of short relational sentences, can be generated using a shared captioning module. Overall, this approach provides a more focused and informative representation of image contents by extracting relevant information from image captions.
