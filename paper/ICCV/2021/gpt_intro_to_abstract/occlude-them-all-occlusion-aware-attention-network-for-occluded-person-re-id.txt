Person re-identification (ReID) is a task in computer vision that aims to identify the same individual across different camera views. With the advancement of deep learning, convolutional neural network (CNN) based ReID approaches have shown impressive performance. However, these approaches primarily focus on the overall body of the person and ignore occlusions that frequently occur in real-world scenarios. Occluded pedestrians pose significant challenges in ReID as they contain fewer distinguishable features and introduce ambiguity from the occluded regions. Existing approaches use auxiliary models to capture information from occluded body parts, but they often mislead appearance representation. To address this problem, we propose an occlusion-aware mask network (OAMN). OAMN consists of three innovative components: an attention-guided mask module, occlusion augmentation, and occlusion unification. The attention-guided mask module allows existing attention mechanisms to accurately capture body parts regardless of occlusions. The occlusion augmentation scheme generates diverse occluded images and precise labels, while the occlusion unification scheme ensures that ambiguous information is unified during the test phase.Our contributions are as follows: 1. We propose OAMN, an efficient and effective approach for occlusion handling in person ReID. It enables attention mechanisms to accurately capture body parts regardless of occlusions.2. We introduce novel occlusion augmentation and unification schemes, which produce diverse occluded images and unify ambiguity in occlusion handling.3. We evaluate OAMN on three person ReID datasets containing occlusions, and our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with high rank-1 accuracies.In conclusion, OAMN addresses the challenges of occlusion in person ReID by employing attention mechanisms and innovative occlusion handling techniques. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of OAMN in handling occluded persons and achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.
