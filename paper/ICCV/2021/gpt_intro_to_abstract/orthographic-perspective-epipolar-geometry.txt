This paper focuses on the essential matrix for mixed orthographic and perspective cameras in the context of epipolar geometry. The geometry of a two-view scene, where one camera is a fully calibrated perspective camera and the other is an orthographic camera, is explained. Previous work by Zhang et al. derived the ortho-perspective essential matrix, but this paper extends their analysis and presents a parallel theory to the classical results for the perspective essential matrix. The paper also considers cases where the perspective camera is only partially calibrated or when it is a non-central camera. Novel minimal solvers are derived for each case, allowing for robust estimation in RANSAC frameworks. While true orthographic projections are not common in optical systems, the orthographic camera can be applied in various other settings such as 2D maps or approximating perspective projection in certain scenarios. The experiments conducted in this paper show that using the orthographic model can even be preferable to the full perspective model when estimating the focal length. Additionally, complicated camera models used for satellite or aerial photography can be well-approximated by the simpler orthographic model.
