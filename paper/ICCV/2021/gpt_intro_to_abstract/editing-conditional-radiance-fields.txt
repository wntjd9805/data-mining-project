The paper discusses the challenges and techniques involved in editing and controlling an implicit continuous volumetric representation of a 3D object. The authors propose a method using a conditional radiance field, which allows for user edits to be propagated to selected regions without explicit constraints. They introduce a shape branch in the conditional radiance field to improve shape reconstruction and investigate the network layers affecting different editing tasks. Color and shape editing losses are introduced to satisfy user targets while preserving the original object structure. The effectiveness of their approach is demonstrated on rendered views of various shape datasets and real single-view photographs, showing improved object view synthesis and editing compared to previous methods. The paper concludes by providing links to code, results, and a video demonstration of their editing technique.
