Recently, 3D point cloud processing has gained significant attention in fields such as autonomous driving, robotics, and geomatics. However, this task is challenging due to the non-grid structure and orderless permutation of point clouds. Shape analysis for point clouds is also difficult due to the visually elusive underlying shape formed by discrete points. In order to address these challenges, many manually-designed geometric descriptors have been developed, but they often suffer from poor performance and task-adaptivity. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success in regular data processing, and there is growing interest in applying CNNs to irregular point cloud processing. Some researchers have transformed point clouds into regular multi-view images or voxel grids for CNN applications, but this often leads to the loss of shape information. PointNet and PointNet++ have been proposed to learn directly on point clouds, but they have limitations in learning fine-grained shape representation and capturing diverse local structures. Many follow-up research efforts have focused on manually designing convolution variants, but these methods often depend on heuristic rules and experienced engineering. In this paper, we argue that manually-designed convolutions may not be optimal for point cloud processing in the era of deep learning. To address this, we propose PointSeaConv, a novel differentiable convolution search paradigm for point clouds. PointSeaConv formulates a general convolution for geometric structure modeling and transforms it into a searchable process using a dynamic and learnable directed acyclic graph (DAG). Most handcrafted convolutions can be considered as special cases of PointSeaConv. We also develop a joint and differentiable optimization framework for simultaneously searching the internal convolution and external architecture. The framework incorporates the epsilon-greedy algorithm to alleviate the effect of discretization error. The proposed method represents a purely data-driven approach for creating suitable convolutions for point cloud processing. Our contributions include the introduction of PointSeaConv, the design of a joint optimization framework, and the application of the epsilon-greedy algorithm to alleviate discretization error.
