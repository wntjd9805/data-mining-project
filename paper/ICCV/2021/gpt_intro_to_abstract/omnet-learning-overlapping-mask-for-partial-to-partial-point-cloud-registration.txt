The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the importance of point cloud registration in various computational fields, such as augmented reality, 3D reconstruction, and autonomous driving. It highlights the challenges of aligning two point clouds due to partiality and noise. The paper mentions the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm and its limitations, as well as the emergence of deep learning approaches for handling large rotation angles. Different categories of deep learning methods are discussed, including correspondence matching based methods and global feature based methods. The paper introduces the proposed OMNet, an end-to-end iterative network that estimates 3D rigid transformations while preserving robustness to noise and partiality. The approach involves predicting overlapping masks for input point clouds and rejecting non-overlapping points during the aggregation of global features. The paper also addresses issues with the ModelNet40 dataset used for registration tasks and proposes a more suitable method for generating data pairs. The main contributions of the paper are identified as the proposed OMNet registration network, addressing over-fitting and axisymmetrical categories in the dataset, and providing qualitative and quantitative comparisons to other approaches.
