The use of whole slide imaging scanners has demonstrated the effectiveness and reliability of histopathological analysis for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The shape and distribution of cell nuclei in pathology images play a critical role in cancer identification and prognosis. However, manual searching and segmenting of nuclei from large-scale histopathology images is costly, time-consuming, and prone to errors. Therefore, there is a demand for automatic detection and segmentation methods to improve the efficiency and scalability of histopathological image analysis. Automated detection and segmentation of histological nuclei face challenges due to variations in object appearance, conjoined and overlapping nuclei, weak boundaries, and tissue preparation procedures. Deep learning approaches, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have shown promising results in medical image analysis. However, these methods often require a large amount of annotated data, which is time-consuming and may suffer from subjective interpretation errors. Weakly supervised methods and unsupervised methods have been proposed to alleviate the reliance on annotated samples, but they still have limitations in handling complex and degenerated cases caused by canceration.In this paper, we propose a Mutual-Complementing Framework (MCF) for nuclei detection and segmentation in pathology images. The MCF leverages the similarities in structure and color of nuclei to achieve good detection and segmentation results with only a few nucleus patches. The framework combines a detection branch with correlation filters and a segmentation branch with a dynamic binarization technique. Response map fusion strategies and gradient direction postprocessing are used to obtain optimal responses and eliminate incorrect ones. A conﬁdence loss is designed to train the segmentation network with high conﬁdence areas, and synthetic samples are synthesized to enhance the segmentation performance. The MCF is trained iteratively to optimize the detection and segmentation branches. Extensive experiments show that MCF achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods with only a few nucleus patches and exhibits good robustness on degenerated samples.The main contributions of this work are: 1) the proposal of the Mutual-Complementing Framework for nuclei detection and segmentation, enabling iterative optimization with limited nucleus patches; 2) the development of response map fusion strategies and gradient direction postprocessing to enhance detection accuracy; 3) the design of a conﬁdence loss combined with synthetic samples and self-finetuning to improve segmentation performance; and 4) the demonstration of MCF's comparable performance to fully supervised methods and robustness on degenerated samples with limited nucleus patches.
