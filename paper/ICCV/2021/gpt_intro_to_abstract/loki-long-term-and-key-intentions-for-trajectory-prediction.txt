This paper introduces the problem of predicting future trajectories of dynamic agents in scenes, such as pedestrians and vehicles, which is crucial for safety critical applications like autonomous vehicles and social robot navigation. While there have been advancements in trajectory prediction methods, there is a lack of comprehensive benchmarks that specifically test the models' ability to reason about maneuvers and intentions of agents. This paper proposes a new dataset for intention and trajectory prediction and highlights the importance of reasoning about long-term goals and short-term intents in trajectory prediction. The authors believe that explicitly considering agents' goals and intents can improve the accuracy of trajectory prediction. The paper also discusses the hierarchical nature of human decision-making and proposes an architecture that combines heterogeneous multi-agent trajectory forecasting with intention prediction. The authors introduce the LOKI dataset, which contains RGB images and LiDAR point clouds with frame-wise labels for pedestrians and vehicles, allowing for explicit modeling of agents' future intent and benchmarking for both trajectory and intention prediction. The paper demonstrates that by modeling short-term intent and long-term goals with explicit supervision and predicting specific intentions at each frame, better trajectory prediction accuracy can be achieved. The contribution of the work includes the release of the LOKI dataset and the proposal of a model that outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks. The paper also suggests that the dataset can further the exploration of intention-based prediction and serve as a strong baseline for the task of intention estimation.
