Person re-identification (Re-ID) is a challenging task in computer vision, as it requires matching a pedestrian image with target images of the same identity. Many existing methods for Re-ID rely on manual labeling, which is costly and time-consuming. Therefore, unsupervised learning approaches have gained attention in recent years. However, these methods often struggle with determining the number of clusters and produce inaccurate pseudo labels. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Meta Pairwise Relationship Distillation (MPRD) for unsupervised person Re-ID. Our method utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to learn discriminative features and estimate pseudo labels, respectively. The CNN and GCN are trained alternatively, with the GCN leveraging meta knowledge from a small amount of labeled samples to generate pseudo labels. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods on three benchmark datasets. Our contributions include reformulating unsupervised feature learning as a pairwise relationship estimation problem, introducing the MPRD method, and designing an effective GCN for generating accurate pseudo labels.
