In computer science, solving structure-from-motion is crucial for various applications such as 3D reconstruction from images, image matching, and visual odometry and localization. The main problem in structure-from-motion is determining which image sets can be reconstructed, typically analyzed through the viewing graph or epipolar graph. The viewing graph represents a set of images as a graph, with cameras or images as vertices and fundamental matrices as edges. A viewing graph is solvable if it uniquely determines a projective configuration of cameras, up to a single projective transformation. Non-solvable viewing graphs allow for multiple transformations without affecting the fundamental matrices. Solvability is important for 3D reconstruction, as projective structure-from-motion methods rely on viewing graphs to recover projective cameras. Solvability assessment is essential before reconstruction, as non-solvable problems will not provide useful reconstructions based solely on fundamental matrices. Calibrated cameras using essential matrices have solvable graphs known as parallel rigidity, extensively studied in literature. This paper focuses on the less understood scenario of uncalibrated cameras.
