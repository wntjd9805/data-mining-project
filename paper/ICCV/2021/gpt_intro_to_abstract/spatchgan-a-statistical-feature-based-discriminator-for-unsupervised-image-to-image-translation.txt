Unsupervised image-to-image translation using generative adversarial networks (GANs) has gained significant interest in the field of computer vision. While recent works have been successful in changing local texture and style without the need for paired data, they still struggle with tasks that require larger shape deformations. This paper aims to improve unsupervised image-to-image translation for applications involving geometric changes between the source and target domains.Modern unsupervised image translation frameworks rely on a PatchGAN discriminator, which produces multiple outputs for overlapping image patches. While this approach is effective for identifying specific textures throughout the image, it falls short in handling complex shape changes. Discriminative features for one area, such as the eyes of an animated face, can differ greatly from another area, like the hair, making accurate decisions for each patch difficult.PatchGAN alone also fails to guarantee the stability of unsupervised image translation networks. Various constraints, such as cycle constraints and shared latent space assumptions, have been proposed to improve stability and training. However, these constraints often create conflicts with GANs and lead to incomplete translations.To address these issues, this paper introduces SPatchGAN, an improved multi-scale discriminator architecture that leverages statistical features over patches. The network benefits from the stability and global view of statistical features at low-level scales, as well as the strong discrimination capability at high-level scales. All scale levels are jointly optimized in a unified network.With the improved discriminator, the need for full cycle constraints is reduced to a weak form that only operates on the forward cycle and low-resolution images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The main contributions of this paper are the novel discriminator architecture that stabilizes the network through matching statistical feature distributions and employing a shared backbone for multiple scales, as well as the simplified framework that reduces conflicts and facilitates shape deformation.
