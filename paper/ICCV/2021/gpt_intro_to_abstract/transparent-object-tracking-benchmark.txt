Object tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision and has numerous applications such as robotics and video analysis. While there has been significant progress in opaque object tracking, less attention has been given to transparent object tracking. Tracking transparent objects is challenging due to their weak appearances that are mixed with the background. Additionally, the lack of a benchmark for transparent object tracking has hindered advancements in this area. To address this gap, the authors propose the Transparent Object Tracking Benchmark (TOTB), which consists of 225 sequences of 15 common transparent object classes. They also evaluate 25 state-of-the-art trackers on TOTB and observe surprising findings, such as the fact that deeper features do not always improve tracking performance for transparent objects. Furthermore, the authors introduce TransATOM, a transparent object tracker that outperforms other algorithms on TOTB. Overall, this work contributes a dedicated benchmark for transparent object tracking and insights into the performance of existing trackers in this domain.
