The detection of vanishing points (VPs) in computer vision is an important research topic with applications in camera calibration, 3-D reconstruction, virtual reality, robot navigation, scene tracking, and vehicle automatic driving. VPs are points in the image plane where parallel lines in 3-D space converge. They contain crucial information for perspective projection transformation and can be used to determine the direction of parallel lines in 3-D space. VPs formed by co-plane parallel lines are collinear and can be used to derive the internal and external parameters of the camera. The horizon line, a virtual line passing through horizontal vanishing points, is a special type of vanishing line. Zenith (or nadir) VP is formed by lines perpendicular to the horizontal plane. The process of VP detection involves searching for the common intersection of inlier edges (line segments) that are projections of parallel line segments in space. Due to background noise and image distortion, inlier edges do not converge precisely to a single point but intersect within a bounded region, with the centroid of this region considered as the VP.
