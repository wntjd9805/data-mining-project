Rigid registration is a common task in computer science, used in applications such as 3D scene reconstruction and localization. It involves aligning a source shape with a target shape using a rigid transformation. The alignment error is measured by computing the distance between corresponding points on the source and target surfaces. Traditional methods for point correspondence, such as the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm, can be prone to local optimal solutions and struggle with noisy or incomplete data. Similarly, the distance metric used in alignment error measurement can be affected by noise and outliers. In this paper, we propose a novel error metric for rigid alignment that does not rely on accurate point correspondence. Instead, we intersect the source and target shapes with random straight lines that are uniformly distributed. The distance between the intersection points serves as a proxy for the alignment error. By applying Welsch's function to the distance values, we obtain a robust measure for the error. Our approach does not assume a specific correspondence rule, allowing us to gather rich alignment information from multiple directions. This new error metric improves the robustness of optimization-based rigid registration, making it less susceptible to local minimum solutions. Additionally, our metric can be used in supervised learning frameworks to train models on unlabeled data, thereby eliminating the need for ground-truth alignment. Furthermore, it can be used to fine-tune models trained with a supervised metric for real-world applications. In summary, our contributions include the introduction of a novel error metric for rigid alignment based on intersections with random straight lines, which improves optimization-based registration. We demonstrate its potential for training supervised learning frameworks on unlabeled data.
