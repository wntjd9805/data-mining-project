Abstract:Pansharpening is an important technique in remote sensing image processing, aiming to fuse a low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image and a high-resolution (HR) panchromatic (PAN) image to generate a final HR image with the same spectral resolution as the MS image. This technique has various applications in land monitoring, mineral exploration, and change detection. Traditional methods for pansharpening can be categorized into component substitution (CS), multi-resolution analysis (MRA), and variational optimization (VO) approaches. However, with the recent advancement in deep learning (DL) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), CNN-based methods for pansharpening have shown promising results. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture called dynamic cross feature fusion network (DCFNet) for pansharpening. DCFNet consists of three parallel branches, with one branch maintaining the same resolution as the PAN image and serving as the main branch. The other two branches have different spatial resolutions and dynamically fuse their information with the main branch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCFNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of information fidelity and results obtained from various satellite sensors. The proposed DCFNet architecture also has potential applications in other visual tasks.
