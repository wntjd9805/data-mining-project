Object detection and instance segmentation methods in computer vision often rely on complex loss functions combining different tasks. These loss functions have a large number of hyper-parameters and require manual tuning. In recent years, ranking-based loss functions have been proposed as an alternative to traditional score-based functions, offering advantages such as direct optimization of performance measures and robustness to class imbalance. However, existing ranking-based losses do not explicitly model positive-to-positive interactions. In this paper, we introduce the Rank & Sort (RS) Loss, a new ranking-based loss function for visual detection methods. RS Loss not only ranks positives above negatives but also sorts positives based on their continuous Intersection over Union (IoU) values. This approach simplifies training by eliminating the need for auxiliary heads and enables handling of imbalanced data without additional sampling heuristics. RS Loss does not require hyper-parameter tuning and can be applied to different detection and segmentation methods. Experimental results demonstrate that RS Loss consistently outperforms existing baselines on various benchmark datasets. Our contributions include a reformulation of error-driven optimization for ranking-based losses and the introduction of the RS Loss for improved object detection and instance segmentation.
