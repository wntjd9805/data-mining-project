Inferring dense 3D maps from a single image has been a challenging problem in computer vision. However, the advent of deep neural networks, particularly deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has provided promising solutions. By training CNNs on large datasets with ground-truth depth labels, accurate depth predictions can be obtained. More recently, self-supervised learning approaches have emerged, which do not require ground-truth depth labels but instead rely on photometric consistency as a supervisory signal. While these methods have shown high-quality results on benchmark datasets, they tend to struggle when applied to indoor images due to the lack of textures in such environments. This results in weak photometric signals for training accurate depth models. Several attempts have been made to address this issue, including using optical flow fields and applying additional constraints within planar regions. However, these methods do not fully exploit the structural regularities present in indoor environments, such as the Manhattan-world model. The Manhattan-world model describes the existence of major planes aligned with dominant directions, which can be a valuable source of information for 3D learning. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised depth estimation approach that leverages the structural regularities of indoor environments. Specifically, we introduce two additional supervisory signals: the Manhattan normal constraint and the co-planar constraint. The Manhattan normal constraint enforces the alignment of major surfaces (floor, ceiling, and walls) with dominant directions, while the co-planar constraint ensures that 3D points within the same planar region are well-fitted by a plane. We incorporate two novel components into the training process: Manhattan normal detection and planar region detection. These components use depth predictions from the network to produce supervisory signals during training. We evaluated our approach on multiple indoor benchmark datasets and achieved state-of-the-art results. Our contributions include a novel learning pipeline that leverages indoor structural regularities, two novel components for providing extra supervisory signals, and setting a new state-of-the-art in self-supervised indoor depth estimation.
