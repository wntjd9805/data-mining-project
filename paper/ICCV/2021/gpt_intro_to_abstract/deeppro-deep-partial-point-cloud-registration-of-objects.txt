This work focuses on developing an online and real-time point cloud registration algorithm for unseen real-world objects. The goal is to find the 3D rotation and translation parameters between a depth sensor and an object based on captured point clouds. Existing literature does not fully address the challenges posed by this problem, including the lack of one-to-one correspondence between input points or clusters and the domain gap between real-world partial point clouds and synthetic 3D CAD models. Additionally, it is difficult to extract precise keypoints for small objects, and the registration algorithm should be efficient and effective for a small baseline. Avoiding expensive, multi-step iterative approaches is encouraged for real-time performance. This study demonstrates the difficulties of point cloud registration for real-world objects and presents experimental results comparing existing methods.
