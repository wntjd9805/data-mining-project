Unsupervised visual category discovery is a valuable task in computer vision for automatically identifying recurring patterns in images without human labeling. However, the lack of consistent task definition and scalability of existing approaches has hindered its wide adoption in recognition. In this paper, we propose a large-scale benchmark for evaluating unsupervised object discovery approaches and a scalable never-ending discovery approach inspired by human learning processes. Our approach utilizes memory modules to represent knowledge and drive the discovery of new concepts. We also introduce a realistic protocol for evaluating concept discovery, leveraging existing datasets such as ImageNet, Pascal VOC, and COCO. Our benchmark allows for evaluating performance on known and unknown classes and can be used to compare different approaches on a standardized protocol. Overall, our contributions aim to address the limitations of current unsupervised discovery methods and provide a framework for continuous learning in computer vision.
