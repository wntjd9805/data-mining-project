In this paper, the authors introduce the concept of curve aggregation, a novel feature aggregation paradigm for point cloud shape analysis. They argue that existing local and non-local operators are insufficient for extracting underlying patterns in point cloud shapes and propose the use of continuous sequences of point segments (curves) as more adequate descriptors for depicting the geometry of point cloud objects. They formulate their method by defining the curve grouping policy and the aggregation between curve features and point features. They construct a novel point cloud processing network called CurveNet by integrating the proposed modules into a ResNet style network. The authors present three main contributions: the proposal of a novel feature aggregation paradigm using curve grouping and aggregation for improved point cloud shape analysis, the mitigation of potential drawbacks of grouping loops and the introduction of a dynamic encoding strategy to enhance curve information while suppressing crossovers, and the embedding of curve modules into CurveNet, which achieves state-of-the-art results on object classification, normal estimation, and object part segmentation tasks.
