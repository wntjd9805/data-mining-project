The introduction highlights the advancements in deep learning for computer vision, particularly in tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. It emphasizes the high cost of obtaining labels for challenging tasks like semantic and instance segmentation. The paper aims to explore self-supervised representation learning from raw high-resolution videos, which mimic the way the human brain learns visual representations. The authors propose a flow equivariance objective, utilizing optical flow estimation, to minimize the distance between consecutive video frames. The experiments conducted on complex driving video datasets show competitive performance in semantic and instance segmentation tasks, surpassing pre-trained representations from ImageNet.
