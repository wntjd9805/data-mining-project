This paper introduces a new method for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in semantic segmentation, a crucial task for visual perception in autonomous vehicles. The authors address the limitations of existing methods by proposing a two-stage approach called ObsNet+LAA, which aims to achieve reliable OOD detection without compromising on accuracy and computational time. The authors outline four design principles to mitigate common pitfalls and cover architecture and training aspects. These principles focus on decoupling OOD detection from segmentation, observing the entire segmentation network, generating additional training data, and focusing adversarial attacks on localized regions. The proposed method is evaluated on three datasets and outperforms 10 diverse methods in terms of both accuracy and speed. The strengths of the approach include compatibility with pre-trained segmentation networks, fast computation, and top performance compared to existing methods. However, a limitation is that the observer network has a computational overhead similar to the segmentation network. Overall, this paper contributes a new approach for OOD detection in semantic segmentation that effectively addresses the challenges of real-world decision systems.
