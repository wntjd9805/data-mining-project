Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, presents a significant public health concern. The use of brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) research has the potential to provide diagnostic biomarkers for AD risk factors. While sMRI measures typically focus on brain structural volumes, surface-based measures offer more detailed and patient-specific shape information. This study aims to use the Minkowski Problem solid method, which focuses on intrinsic surface geometric features, to identify reliable imaging biomarkers for AD. The Minkowski problem addresses how to reconstruct a convex shape that fulfills a given Gaussian curvature measure. By solving the Minkowski problem, we can visualize the Riemannian metric of the input surface and compare it to others. The existence and computation of a convex shape representation depend on the Minkowski problem and the Minkowski theorem. This study aims to prove the existence of a solution to the Minkowski problem using Monge-Kantorovich theory and develop an algorithm to compute the Alexandrov polyhedron in the discrete case. The obtained Alexandrov polyhedron can serve as a shape signature for the original surface and be used to identify significant geometric changes in brain cortical surfaces affected by early AD. The experimental results show that Alexandrov polyhedra effectively capture and visualize these structural changes. The computation of Alexandrov polyhedra is based on computing intrinsic spherical optimal transport maps, where new mathematical formulas and algorithms are used to improve efficiency. Overall, this research showcases the potential of surface-based measures and the Minkowski problem solid method in diagnosing and monitoring early AD.
