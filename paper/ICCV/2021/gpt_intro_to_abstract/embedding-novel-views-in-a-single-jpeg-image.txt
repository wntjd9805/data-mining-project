This paper introduces a novel approach to embedding a novel view synthesis model into a single embedding image, allowing users to easily share 3D photographs on social media. The proposed method focuses on embedding multiple plane images (MPIs) into JPEG images, a widely adopted image format on social media platforms. The objective is to create visually pleasing embedding images without noticeable artifacts, while still achieving nearly perfect restoration of novel views. The paper presents a specific neural network architecture, featuring an encoder and a lightweight decoder, as well as novel frequency-domain and adversarial losses to suppress high-frequency artifacts. Additionally, the proposed framework is designed to be robust to real-world scenarios, with image perturbations applied to account for retouching and manipulation on social media. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model in terms of novel view synthesis quality and perceptual performance, achieving high-fidelity novel views while preserving the visual quality of the embedding image. The contributions of this paper include the first dedicated model for embedding MPIs in JPEG images, the introduction of adversarial training and frequency-domain loss for artifact suppression, and the development of a robust system capable of embedding MPIs in imperceptible form and restoring high-fidelity novel views synthesis in the presence of image manipulations.
