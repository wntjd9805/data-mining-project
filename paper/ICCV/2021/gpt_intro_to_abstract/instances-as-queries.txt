Instance segmentation is a challenging task in computer vision that involves assigning a pixel-level mask with a category label for each instance of interest in an image. Current state-of-the-art methods, such as the Mask R-CNN family, follow a multi-stage paradigm using object detectors to extract regions-of-interest for segmentation. However, integrating these practices into query-based detectors for instance mask generation is inefficient. In this paper, we present QueryInst, a query-based end-to-end instance segmentation method that utilizes parallel dynamic mask heads to achieve high accuracy and speed. By leveraging the one-to-one correspondence between object queries and mask RoI features, and sharing queries between object detection and instance segmentation sub-networks, QueryInst demonstrates improved performance compared to non-query based methods. Our experiments show that QueryInst surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy and speed on the COCO test-dev dataset. Additionally, we extend QueryInst to the video instance segmentation task and achieve superior results compared to existing methods.
