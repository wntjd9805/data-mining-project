This paper introduces a novel and versatile reconfigurable Image Signal Processor (ISP) framework called Recon-figISP. Traditional ISP systems rely on a fixed pipeline with specialized modules for different tasks, requiring costly manual tuning. The proposed framework allows changes and rerouting in the ISP architecture, optimizing it towards designated objectives. By combining specialized modules, numerous ISP pipelines can be generated to handle different application scenarios while preserving modularity. The paper addresses the challenges of non-differentiable modules by using a convolutional neural network to imitate each module's output. Additionally, an approach called proxy tuning is introduced to resolve the gap in data distribution during architecture search. This involves fine-tuning proxy networks with observed data to update the ISP architecture and gradually prune modules with low performance. Compared to deep ISP approaches, Recon-figISP offers flexibility in adjusting the pipeline driven by objective functions, while preserving modularity and allowing human intervention. It requires tuning fewer parameters with limited data, making it more practical for complex tasks like object detection. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of Recon-figISP over traditional camera pipelines.
