Vanishing points play a crucial role in various computer vision applications, such as camera calibration, facade detection, 3D reconstruction, and autonomous driving. Previous approaches for vanishing point detection involved a two-stage process, consisting of line detection and line clustering. However, these methods often suffer from noisy line extraction and require additional assumptions about the scene. Recent advancements in deep learning, particularly CNN-based approaches, have shown promising results in vanishing point detection. While these methods achieve satisfactory performance, they are inefficient and not suitable for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose VaPiD, a novel end-to-end rapid vanishing point detector that significantly improves model efficiency using learned optimizers. VaPiD consists of two components: a vanishing point proposal network (VPPN) and a neural vanishing point optimizer (NVPO). The VPPN efficiently processes dense vanishing point anchors, while the NVPO iteratively refines the vanishing points using regression and estimation updates. Our approach avoids enumerating all possible candidate positions, leading to improved inference speed. We evaluate VaPiD on four public datasets and compare it with previous methods. Our results show that VaPiD outperforms existing approaches in terms of efficiency while maintaining competitive or even better accuracy. Notably, on a synthetic dataset, VaPiD achieves a median angle error close to the machine epsilon of 32-bit floating-point numbers, indicating its high accuracy. With fewer refinement iterations, VaPiD operates at 26 frames per second while maintaining a low median angle error for images with three vanishing points. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of VaPiD in real-time applications requiring vanishing point detection.
