Semantic segmentation has made significant progress with the use of fully convolutional neural networks. However, fully-supervised semantic segmentation requires a large number of pixel-wise annotations, which can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain. This has led to the emergence of few-shot segmentation, where only a small number of annotations are needed for novel classes. Existing methods in this field often suffer from overfitting and do not effectively exploit the inherent problems of few-shot segmentation, such as the feature undermining problem and the prototype bias problem.In this paper, we propose a novel approach that aims to overcome these challenges. We introduce a latent class mining strategy with pseudo labeling, which allows us to effectively exploit latent novel classes in the background. By considering that every pixel matters in the training set, including temporally annotated backgrounds, we can enhance feature discrimination and improve segmentation performance. Our method also leverages extra unlabeled data for further feature enhancement.Additionally, we propose a prototype rectification technique to address the prototype bias problem. We model the background using a broader set, namely the whole training set, and incorporate a stable global background prototype. We also incorporate more stable region features for the foreground prototype rectification.Our contributions can be summarized as follows: First, we propose a novel framework that jointly mines latent objects and learns the pairwise metric. This allows our method to be directly applied to unseen classes without the need for additional training or fine-tuning, while also avoiding the feature undermining problem. Second, we introduce a prototype rectification technique that alleviates the prototype bias problem and improves segmentation accuracy. Third, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it requires fewer parameters, has faster model speed, and achieves better performance compared to existing methods. Finally, we conduct extension experiments on unlabeled data from different sources, confirming that our latent class mining method can effectively exploit unlabeled data and further boost segmentation performance.
