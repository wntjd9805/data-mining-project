Abstract:Shadow removal is a fundamental challenge in computer vision that affects the accuracy and effectiveness of various tasks. Existing methods for shadow removal can be classified into physical-based and learning-based methods, but they often neglect the contextual information hidden in images. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage context-aware network, CANet, for shadow removal. CANet integrates a contextual patch matching module and a contextual feature transfer mechanism to effectively remove shadows. The proposed CPM module searches for potential relationships between shadow and non-shadow patches, while the CFT mechanism transfers contextual features from non-shadow regions to shadow regions. Experimental results show that CANet outperforms existing methods in generating realistic shadow-removal images.
