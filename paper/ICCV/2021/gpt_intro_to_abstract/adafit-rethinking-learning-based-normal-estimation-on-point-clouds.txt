Surface normal estimation is a fundamental task in point cloud processing with various practical applications. However, it remains challenging due to noise, density variations, and missing structures. Existing methods rely on weighted surface fitting, but they suffer from underfitting, overfitting, and sensitivity to outliers. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective approach that predicts additional point-wise offsets to adjust the distribution of neighboring points. This allows for more flexibility in projecting points onto a surface and reduces the impact of outliers. Furthermore, we introduce a novel architecture called the Cascaded Scale Aggregation (CSA) layer to address the challenge of selecting the optimal neighborhood size. Our proposed method, called AdaFit, achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets and demonstrates superior generalization ability on real-world datasets. We also show the applications of AdaFit in point cloud denoising and surface reconstruction. Overall, our contributions include a comprehensive analysis of weighted surface fitting, the proposal of a robust normal estimation approach, and the design of the AdaFit network with CSA layers for improved performance.
