This paper addresses two limitations in the current state-of-the-art methods for estimating surface normal from a single RGB image. Firstly, these methods are unable to estimate the aleatoric uncertainty, which is important for real-world applications. Secondly, they lack detail in the prediction, as they are biased towards large planar surfaces. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a new method that captures aleatoric uncertainty and improves detail by applying the loss function on a subset of carefully selected pixels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet and NYUv2 datasets. The predicted results show a higher level of detail compared to existing methods.
