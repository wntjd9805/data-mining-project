The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the growing interest in data-driven and learning-based approaches in the study of 3D indoor scenes. It mentions the accumulation of indoor scene datasets for driving the deep learning revolution, such as NYU-Depth v2, TUM, SUN3D, S3DIS, and others. The paper categorizes existing datasets into acquired (scanned and reconstructed) and designed (synthetic scenes) and compares their data volumes and quality. It highlights the recent emergence of Structured3D and OpenRoom as promising alternatives in the synthetic scene dataset landscape. The paper then introduces 3D-FRONT, a new repository of synthetic 3D indoor scenes that includes professionally designed layouts, object semantics, and a large number of rooms populated with high-quality textured 3D furniture objects. The selection of furniture objects from the 3D-FUTURE dataset is based on expert interior designs to ensure stylistic compatibility. The paper describes the essential features of 3D-FRONT and compares it to other datasets. It also mentions the Trescope rendering tool provided with 3D-FRONT and discusses potential AI-powered applications that can be enabled by the dataset.
