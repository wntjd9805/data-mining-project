This abstract presents an overview of the research in 3D computer vision using internet photos capturing tourist landmarks. Despite variations in lighting, seasons, and special events, these photos share underlying 3D scene geometry, enabling the exploitation of geometric anchoring for various geometry-related vision tasks. However, prior work primarily focused on lower-level tasks, neglecting higher-level scene understanding and recognition tasks.
