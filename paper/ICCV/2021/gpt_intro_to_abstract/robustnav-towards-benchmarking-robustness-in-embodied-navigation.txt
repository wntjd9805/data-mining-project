The paper introduces the concept and importance of developing algorithms for embodied agents in artificial intelligence that are capable of reasoning about rich perceptual information and accomplishing tasks through navigation and interaction with their environments. It highlights the challenge of ensuring that these agents can generalize to different environments than the ones they were trained on, and proposes the framework ROBUSTNAV to assess the performance of embodied navigation agents when exposed to various visual and dynamics corruptions. The paper presents two navigation tasks within ROBUSTNAV and evaluates agent performance in corrupted test environments using standard metrics. The findings show significant degradation in performance under corruptions, and indicate the advantages of incorporating multiple sensing modalities and exploring visual robustness within embodied tasks. The paper also analyzes the behaviors exhibited by agents under corruptions and suggests that further improvements are needed to fully recover lost performance. Overall, the contributions of the paper include the introduction of ROBUSTNAV as a framework for benchmarking and assessing the robustness of embodied navigation agents, the investigation of agent mistakes under corruptions, and the identification of areas for improvement in terms of recovering performance. ROBUSTNAV provides a fast framework for developing and testing robust embodied policies before deployment on real robots.
