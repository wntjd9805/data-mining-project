The paper introduces a deep learning model called HPNet that aims to segment a 3D object into primitive surface patches. This task is fundamental in various applications such as reverse engineering, shape compression, and robot learning. HPNet combines traditional geometric heuristics with deep primitive detection using powerful feature learning. It utilizes a hybrid point descriptor that combines a learned semantic descriptor and two spectral descriptors. The spectral descriptors are derived from the adjacency matrix between points and predicted primitive parameters, as well as the adjacency matrix that models sharp edges. The paper also presents an effective approach to train HPNet and evaluates its performance on benchmark datasets, showing significant improvements in segmentation accuracy. The code for HPNet is made available for further exploration.
