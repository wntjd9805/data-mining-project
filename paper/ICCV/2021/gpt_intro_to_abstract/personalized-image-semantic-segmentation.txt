This paper addresses the problem of personalized image segmentation, which has not been discussed in previous works. While state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation focus on publicly available datasets, the assumption of independent and identically distributed images does not hold in real-world scenarios. Personalized images taken by a user have a different distribution and are correlated. The main difficulties in personalized image segmentation are the large distribution gap between public datasets and personalized data, as well as the proper utilization of personalized traits. To tackle these challenges, we propose a personalized dataset called PSS and a baseline segmentation method. The PSS dataset contains 15 users' personalized images, and we randomize validation annotations on a subset of the data. We consider the personalization issue from a broader perspective, where personal traits lie in each individual's images. We propose a method that investigates contextual connections and utilizes correlated local region representations for pixel prediction. Additionally, we address the lack of labeled training images in the dataset by incorporating a domain adaptation framework. The contributions of this work include the proposal of the personalization issue in image segmentation, the collection of the PSS dataset, and the evaluation of state-of-the-art methods on the dataset. The proposed baseline method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the personalized dataset.
