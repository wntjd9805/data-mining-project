This paper addresses the problem of removing compression artifacts from still images that are generated by JPEG compression. The JPEG compression algorithm applies discrete cosine transformation (DCT) and quantization to reduce file size, but this leads to visual artifacts such as blocking, blurring, and banding. Existing methods for artifact removal can be categorized into model-based and deep learning-based approaches. Model-based methods use filtering techniques, while deep learning-based methods learn the inverse mapping of compression degradations. However, both approaches have limitations in terms of representation abilities and interpretability. Therefore, this paper proposes an interpretable deep network that combines the advantages of model-based methods and data-driven deep learning models. The network incorporates pixel-level regression for image content and semantic-level discrimination for image gradient. An alternating minimization algorithm is developed to solve the proposed variational model, and the algorithm is unfolded into the deep network architecture. The network is trained to automatically estimate the two priors using an effective training strategy. The proposed method is shown to produce visually pleasing results in terms of artifact removal, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets as well as real-world use cases. A new dataset containing compressed/clear image pairs is also introduced to support further research in this area.
