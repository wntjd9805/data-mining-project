Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where a small amount of adversarial noise added to an input image can deceive the classifier with a high probability. In this paper, we focus on black-box attacks, where the attacker can only query the victim network and obtain its output score for a given image. The objective of black-box attacks is to minimize the number of queries while achieving a high attack success rate. Existing approaches for black-box attacks include transfer-based and query-based methods, but they suffer from low success rates and require a large number of queries. Therefore, there is a need to reduce the number of queries for black-box attacks while maintaining a high success rate. In this work, we propose a consistency-sensitivity guided ensemble attack (CSEA) method to efficiently search and estimate the victim model in the high-dimensional model space. We construct an ensemble of surrogate models with diversified structures and use random block masks on the input image to jointly construct and submit randomized and sparsified queries to the victim model. The feedback results from these queries allow the surrogate models to learn and evolve themselves in the model space. We estimate the victim model using a learned linear composition of the surrogate models, guided by a consistency constraint. Additionally, the block-wise queries provide information to estimate the attack sensitivity map for the input image, allowing for block-based local refinement of the attack to increase its success rate. Experimental results demonstrate that our CSEA approach can significantly reduce the number of queries needed for successful attacks compared to state-of-the-art black-box attack methods.
