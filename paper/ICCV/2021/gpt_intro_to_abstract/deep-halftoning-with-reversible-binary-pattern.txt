Halftoning is commonly used in the printing industry to reproduce tone with limited colors. However, this process results in the loss of both color and fine details, making it difficult to recover the original image from the degraded halftones. Existing inverse halftoning methods can only recover an approximate grayscale version. This paper introduces the concept of reversible halftoning, which aims to retain the necessary information for restoration. The authors propose a Noise Incentive Block (NIB) to introduce spatial variation in the halftone images, addressing the issue of flatness degradation. The NIB is a model-agnostic plug-in that can be applied to other relevant applications. Additionally, the authors formulate a binary gate to achieve binary halftones and train the model using various loss terms. Comparative evaluation and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The paper contributes to the field by introducing the idea of reversible halftoning, providing a solution to the ill-posed inverse halftoning problem, introducing the noise incentive block to address flatness degradation, and proposing an effective measurement for discrete halftoning patterns.
