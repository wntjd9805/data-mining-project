Image flares are common and undesirable light artifacts in photographs caused by bright light sources. These artifacts can affect the visual quality of images and hinder the performance of computer vision tasks. Existing methods for flare removal have limitations and cannot handle diverse types of flares or real-world images effectively. In this paper, we propose a light source guided learning framework for single-image flare removal (SIFR). Our framework utilizes the shape, brightness, and position of the light source as cues to detect and remove flares reliably. We also address the challenge of collecting a large-scale dataset of paired flare and flare-free images by leveraging unpaired data. Our approach includes a light source detection module, a flare detection module, a flare removal module, and a flare generation module. We impose cycle-consistency constraints to learn the underlying relationships between the flare region and the light source region. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in flare removal and flare effect manipulation. We contribute the first unpaired flare and flare-free image dataset with diverse scenarios, providing a valuable resource for future research in this area.
