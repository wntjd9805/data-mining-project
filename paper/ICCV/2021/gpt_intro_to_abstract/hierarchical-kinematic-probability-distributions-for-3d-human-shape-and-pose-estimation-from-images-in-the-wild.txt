Human body shape and pose estimation from RGB images is a challenging problem in computer vision, especially when the subject is occluded. Current approaches use deep neural networks to regress a single body shape and pose solution, but this does not fully capture the space of plausible 3D reconstructions. In this paper, we propose estimating a structured probability distribution over 3D body shape and pose, allowing for sampling of multiple plausible reconstructions and quantifying prediction uncertainty. We utilize the SMPL body model to represent shape and pose, with a multivariate Gaussian distribution over shape parameters and a matrix-Fisher distribution over relative 3D joint rotations. We train a deep neural network to predict these distributions and introduce a differentiable rejection sampler for sampling. We also address the lack of accurate and diverse training datasets by using synthetic data with convolutional edge filters to bridge the gap between synthetic and real RGB data. Our contributions include the prediction of a hierarchical matrix-Fisher distribution, the development of a differentiable rejection sampler, and the use of edge filters to improve the synthetic training framework.
