Popular low-budget commercial cameras often use CMOS sensors with a rolling shutter (RS) mechanism, which exposes the image row by row. This results in RS effects such as stretching and wobbling. Ignoring these effects in 3D geometric vision applications can lead to distorted and inaccurate results. To mitigate the RS effect, RS correction methods have been developed. Existing approaches are either single-frame-based or multi-frame-based, but they have limitations in terms of assumptions and computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel symmetric undistortion network architecture for RS correction using two consecutive RS images. Our network includes a PWC-based undistortion flow estimator and a time-centered GS image decoder. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in removing RS artifacts and restoring GS images. Our contributions include the development of an end-to-end symmetric RS undistortion network and the effective aggregation of contextual cues from two input RS images.
