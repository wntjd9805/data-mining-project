In this paper, we propose a novel and systematic reformulation of Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) tree called CSG-Stump. CSG-Stump has a fixed three-layer tree structure and is proven to be equivalent to the typical CSG-Tree in terms of representation. This reformulation allows for highly compact, interpretable, and editable shape representation while freeing from the limitations of a tree structure. We also demonstrate that CSG-Stump is highly compatible with deep learning, enabling dynamic shape abstraction. Two methods for automatically constructing CSG-Stump from unstructured inputs, such as point clouds, are proposed. The first approach involves detecting basic primitives and solving a Binary Programming problem, while the second approach utilizes an unsupervised end-to-end network for joint detection and estimation. Experimental results show that CSG-Stump achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of representation capability, interpretability, and editability. Overall, this paper contributes to the development of a better shape modeling and understanding technique in computer vision and graphics.
