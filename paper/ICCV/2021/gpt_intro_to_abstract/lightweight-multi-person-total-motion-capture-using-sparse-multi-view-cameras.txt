Marker-less motion capture has been a popular research topic in computer vision and graphics due to its potential applications in behavior understanding, sports analysis, human animation, video editing, and virtual reality. Total motion capture, which captures multi-person total interactive behaviors including facial expressions, body and hand poses, has attracted widespread interest in the computer vision community. However, existing total motion capture methods require expensive and sophisticated hardware setups and have low run-time efficiency. To address these issues, researchers have attempted to perform total motion capture using only a single image or video, achieving real-time performance for single-person scenarios. However, handling severe occlusions and challenging poses under multi-person interactive scenarios remains difficult for monocular methods. In this paper, we propose a lightweight total capture system using only sparse multi-view cameras, which guarantees both lightweight setups and robust performance. We address the challenges of hand/face association, pixel-aligned fitting, and robust body association under severe occlusions and close interactions. Our contributions include a new hand and face bootstrapping method, a unified two-stage parametric fitting method, and a feedback mechanism to improve association accuracy.
