This paper discusses the limitations of existing methods for enhancing dynamic range in images captured by mobile devices. These methods often result in artifacts in dynamic scenes and require multiple LDR images with different exposure levels. The paper proposes a collaborative learning framework that uses a dual-path network with edge-aware modules to enhance color and texture details. A 3D Tucker reconstruction scheme is also introduced to prevent the amplification of pseudo edges and noises. The proposed algorithm is able to process UHD images in real-time and outperforms state-of-the-art HDR reconstruction methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real-world images of different sizes.
