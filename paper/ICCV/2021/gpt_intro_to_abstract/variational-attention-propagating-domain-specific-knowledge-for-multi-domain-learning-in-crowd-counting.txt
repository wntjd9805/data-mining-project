Crowd counting is a complex problem in computer vision due to multiple challenges such as variability in scales, occlusions, and background scenarios. To address these challenges, collecting a large-scale dataset with diverse data is essential, but human-labeling makes it difficult to obtain such a dataset. This paper proposes a multi-domain learning approach called Domain-specific Knowledge Propagating Network (DKPNet) to learn a general and robust density estimating model for crowd counting. DKPNet prevents biased learning by refining and highlighting domain-specific knowledge. The proposed Variational Attention (VA) technique facilitates domain-specific attention learning, and the Gaussian Mixture distribution is used as the prior in the proposed VA for multi-domain learning. Additionally, the Intrinsic Variational Attention (InVA) is introduced to handle overlapped-domains and sub-domains. The contributions of this work include the development of DKPNet, the use of VA and InVA for crowd counting, and achieving state-of-the-art performances on popular datasets.
