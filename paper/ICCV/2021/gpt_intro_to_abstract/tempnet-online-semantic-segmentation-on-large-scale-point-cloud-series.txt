Automated vehicles rely on LiDAR sensors to acquire point cloud data for understanding the driving context. Semantic segmentation algorithms are crucial for real-time decision making in automated vehicles. However, the segmentation of large-scale point cloud series presents challenges due to the sparse spatial distribution of points. Existing segmentation methods for single frames produce inconsistent results when applied to consecutive frames. Additionally, these methods are computationally expensive. This paper proposes a lightweight semantic segmentation framework called TempNet for point cloud series. TempNet combines a frame aggregation scheme to improve accuracy and efficiency. It selectively conducts feature fusion and aggregation to eliminate flickers and achieve reliable segmentation results. Two main challenges in designing TempNet are addressed: computational cost and feature augmentation. To handle computational cost, only key frames undergo full feature extraction and aggregation, while non-key frames receive propagated enhanced features. To improve feature augmentation, a temporal feature aggregation network is designed based on graph attention convolution, leveraging local spatial consistency of point clouds. TempNet is implemented on five state-of-the-art segmentation models and evaluated on the SemanticKITTI dataset. Experimental results show that TempNet outperforms competitors with little extra computational cost. The main contributions of this paper are: the proposal of TempNet, a light-weight framework for semantic segmentation, the design of a temporal feature aggregation network, and the demonstration of TempNet's efficacy through extensive experiments.
