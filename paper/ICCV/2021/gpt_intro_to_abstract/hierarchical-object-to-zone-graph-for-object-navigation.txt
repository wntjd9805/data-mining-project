This paper addresses the challenge of efficiently navigating to a specified goal in unseen environments. Conventional methods rely on spatial layout information, which is easily obtained in seen environments but not available in unseen environments. Previous works have used deep reinforcement learning to learn a navigation policy based on visual input, but generalization to unseen environments, especially when the target is not in sight, remains a challenge. Recent approaches have attempted to embed prior knowledge, such as object and relation graphs, but their generalization ability is limited due to inconsistent object relations and spatial layout across different environments. To enhance the generalization ability of the navigation model, this paper proposes the hierarchical object-to-zone (HOZ) graph, which captures prior knowledge of scene layout for object navigation. A general HOZ graph is constructed from all scenes during training, with each scene node corresponding to a scene-wise HOZ graph. Zone nodes are obtained by matching and merging room-wise HOZ graphs, representing groups of relevant objects, and zone edges model the adjacent probability of two zones. A zone-to-action LSTM policy is trained using deep reinforcement learning, where the pre-learned HOZ graph helps plan optimal paths and deduce sub-goals. The initial HOZ graph is updated online according to the current unseen environment's specific layout, improving navigation success. In addition to commonly used evaluation metrics, a new metric called Success weighted by Action Efficiency (SAE) is proposed, which considers the efficiency of navigation actions. Experimental results demonstrate that the HOZ graph outperforms the baseline approach in terms of success rate, path length, and action efficiency. The contributions of this paper include the proposal of the HOZ graph for guiding object navigation with easier sub-goals, the introduction of the SAE evaluation metric, and the significant improvement in navigation performance achieved by integrating the HOZ graph into the zone-to-action policy.
