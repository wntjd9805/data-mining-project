This paper tackles the problem of weakly supervised amodal instance segmentation (WAIS), which involves segmenting both visible and occluded parts of object instances in images. This is crucial for applications like autonomous driving and robot path planning, where accurately identifying the spatial extents of occluded objects is necessary. However, obtaining reliable ground truth for occluded object parts is challenging, as different annotators may provide inconsistent or inaccurate guesses. To address this, the authors propose a two-stage training approach using the PCNet and Mask-RCNN models.The authors' contributions focus on improving the first training stage using UNet. They introduce a new method to exploit weak supervision by using the occlusion boundary instead of the occluder's mask as input to UNet. This allows for occluders to be partially occluded themselves, simplifying the estimation of pseudo-ground-truth amodal segmentation. Additionally, the authors enable UNet to estimate uncertainty in the predicted amodal segmentation and enforce the minimization of this uncertainty during training.To account for shape priors, the authors learn to estimate an uncertainty map for the predicted amodal segmentation. This uncertainty map captures the spatial distribution of object shapes and is utilized to regularize the learning process. By modulating the difference between the predicted amodal segmentation and the ground-truth mask of the occludee based on the uncertainty map, the authors incur lower loss on regions with high uncertainty.These contributions are integrated into a new approach called Amodal Segmenter with Boundary Uncertainty (ASBU). The performance of ASBU is evaluated on the COCOA and KINS datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over the state-of-the-art methods in three tasks: amodal instance segmentation, amodal completion, and ordering recovery.The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a review of previous work, Section 3 describes ASBU in detail, Section 4 formalizes the uncertainty estimation and weighting of loss, Section 5 presents implementation details and experimental results, and finally, Section 6 concludes the paper.
