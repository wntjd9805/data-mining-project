This paper addresses the challenging problem of cross-domain retrieval, specifically focusing on sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) and introducing a more realistic and challenging scenario called universal cross-domain retrieval (UCDR). UCDR combines two separate problems in the literature: zero-shot SBIR, which involves test data from unseen classes, and domain generalization, which involves test data from unseen domains. The authors propose a novel framework called SnMpNet, which consists of a single-branch network with a feature extractor and classifier, for learning a domain-independent embedding of input data that also generalizes to unseen category test data. They introduce two novel losses, Semantic Neighbourhood loss and Mixture Prediction loss, to account for unseen classes and unseen domains during testing. Extensive experiments and analysis are conducted on Sketchy-Extended and DomainNet datasets, comparing the proposed framework to other state-of-the-art approaches modified for this application. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed framework.
