This paper discusses the progress made in semantic segmentation using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and the challenges posed by the need for dense pixel-level annotations in supervised learning. To overcome this challenge, researchers have turned to synthetic datasets and unsupervised domain adaptation methods. Two common approaches in domain adaptive segmentation are image-to-image translation based methods and self-supervised learning (SSL) based methods. However, both approaches suffer from visual inconsistency and noise introduced by the translation process. To address this issue, the paper proposes a dual path learning (DPL) framework that combines the strengths of image-to-image translation and SSL in a single framework. The proposed framework consists of two paths, one for adaptation in the source domain and the other for adaptation in the target domain. These paths interact with each other throughout the training process, resulting in a closed-loop learning system. The paper presents two interactive modules and a warm-up strategy to enhance the performance of the framework. The proposed DPL framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation domain adaptation.
