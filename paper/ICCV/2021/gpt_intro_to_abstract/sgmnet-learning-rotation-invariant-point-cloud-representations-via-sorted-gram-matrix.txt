In recent years, there has been significant development in 3D computer vision, driven by its wide range of applications in areas such as robotics, augmented and virtual reality, and self-driving technology. Point cloud data, which is the most common format for representing 3D information, has gained increasing attention, leading to numerous works focused on extracting 3D features directly from points. However, compared to dense images, point clouds are irregular and unstructured, requiring the design of permutation invariant feature extractors. The existing Point-Net approach addresses this by using symmetric functions but fails to adequately handle spatial transformations such as translation and rotation, which are common in the 3D world. Rotation-invariance is particularly important for tasks like classification, part segmentation, matching, and shape retrieval, where objects or scenes can be arbitrarily rotated. While some methods based on point-pair features have attempted to address rotation-invariance, they suffer from information loss and lower performance compared to methods based on local reference frames. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective local feature representation called Sorted Gram Matrix (SGM) that captures the pairwise relationship between all points in a neighborhood while maintaining rotation-invariance. We integrate the SGM as a drop-in module into popular point-based networks, demonstrating its robustness, efficiency, and generalizability. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in point cloud shape classification and part segmentation tasks while being invariant to rotation.
