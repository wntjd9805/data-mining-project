Super-resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-frequency (HF) information from a low-resolution (LR) image, which is lost during downsampling from a high-resolution (HR) image. Recent single image SR methods have achieved successful restoration of HF details. However, these methods often result in blurry images due to conservative estimates imposed by pixel-wise supervision losses. To address this issue, various loss functions have been proposed to promote higher frequencies and enhance perceptual quality. Additionally, the development of low-complexity networks for efficient deployment on smartphones has become increasingly important. Designing an efficient network with high-performance is a challenging task. This paper proposes novel loss functions for perceptual SR, focusing on the frequency domain and using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to calculate frequency components. A supervision loss is proposed in Fourier domain for reconstruction, along with a discriminator architecture to learn the HF distribution. The benefits of the proposed losses over existing ones are demonstrated through an ablation study. The paper also compares the trained efficient generator with state-of-the-art methods, showing that the proposed losses can significantly improve the performance of a low-complexity generator.
