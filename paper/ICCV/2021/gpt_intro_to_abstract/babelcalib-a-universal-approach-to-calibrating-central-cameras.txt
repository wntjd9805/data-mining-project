Cameras with wide fields of view, such as fish-eye lenses and catadioptric rigs, often require complex and non-linear models for calibration. However, the calibration process for these cameras can be tedious and prone to failure. Additionally, the choice of calibration toolbox limits the available camera models and expanding the toolbox can be challenging. This paper presents a method for robustly estimating accurate camera models for central projection cameras with various fields of view. The proposed method can estimate popular camera models for lens types like pinhole, fish-eye, and catadioptric, and allows for easy extension to new camera models. The method addresses common failure modes in camera calibration, such as poor initial guesses for unknown parameters and inaccurate measurements of calibration targets. It introduces a solver that recovers all calibration parameters, including the center of projection and pixel aspect ratio, while improving corner detections and camera pose estimation. The solver assumes a planar calibration target. A range of camera models are supported, including Brown-Conrady, Kannala-Brandt, Unified Camera, Extended Unified Camera, Double Sphere, and Division models. Each model has a corresponding radial or back-projection function for projection or back-projection calculations. The proposed method is applied within a RANSAC framework for efficient model generation, where model proposals are evaluated for consistency with extracted features. The approach uses a back-projection model as an intermediate step to simplify the calibration task for general camera models. This allows for a more efficient and stable estimation process. Overall, the proposed method provides a robust and accurate solution for camera calibration that overcomes the issues caused by non-linear behavior in flexible camera models. The method is demonstrated to achieve high accuracy for a fish-eye lens on hold-out test images.
