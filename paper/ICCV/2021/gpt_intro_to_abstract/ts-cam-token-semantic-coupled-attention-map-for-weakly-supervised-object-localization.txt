Weakly supervised learning involves using training data with incomplete annotations to learn recognition models. Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) is a method that only requires image-level annotations to learn localization models. The Class Activation Mapping (CAM) is a popular technique used in WSOL, but it suffers from underestimation of object regions. Limited effort has been made to address the inherent defects of CNN's local representation, such as capturing long-range feature dependencies. Visual transformer, a recent development in computer vision, can capture long-range semantic correlations and complex spatial transforms. However, it cannot be directly applied to WSOL due to the destruction of spatial topology and the lack of semantic-awareness. In this paper, we propose the token semantic coupled attention map (TS-CAM), which combines the advantages of visual transformer and semantic coupling. TS-CAM improves object localization in WSOL by leveraging long-range feature dependency and coupling semantic-aware and semantic-agnostic attention maps. The contributions of this work include introducing TS-CAM as a solid baseline for WSOL using visual transformer, proposing the semantic coupling module, and achieving improved performance on WSOL benchmarks.
