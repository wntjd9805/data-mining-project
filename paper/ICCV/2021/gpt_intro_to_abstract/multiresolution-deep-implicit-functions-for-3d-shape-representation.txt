In recent years, deep implicit functions (DIF) have become popular as a 3D shape representation in various applications. Unlike explicit representations, DIF encodes a 3D shape into a compact latent vector, which can be used to evaluate an implicit function for surface reconstruction. This paper aims to design a DIF that has three main properties: the ability to represent shapes with fine details, support for encoder-decoder inference and decoder-only latent optimization, and enable detail-preserving shape completion from inputs with large unobserved regions. Existing DIF methods can be categorized into global and local approaches, each with its limitations. Global methods lack fine-grained detail, while local methods lack a global prior and cannot handle shape completion with large unobserved regions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a Multiresolution Deep Implicit Function (MDIF) representation, which encodes a shape as a multiresolution hierarchy of latent vectors. Each level provides different frequencies of an implicit function, allowing for progressive decoding to achieve arbitrary levels of detail. Additional features, such as global connections across levels and dropout on the latent codes, are proposed to enable detailed shape completion through decoder-only latent optimization. The proposed MDIF model offers high accuracy in representing complex shapes, supports multiple applications, and achieves detailed shape completion while preserving detail in observed regions and producing plausible results in unobserved regions.
