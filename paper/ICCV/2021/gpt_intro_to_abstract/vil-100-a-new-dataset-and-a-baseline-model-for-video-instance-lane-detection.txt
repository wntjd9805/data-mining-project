Autonomous driving and lane detection in traffic scenes have gained significant attention in recent years. Lane detection is crucial for car driving and advanced driving assistance systems but is challenging due to various factors such as occlusion and bad weather conditions. While deep learning has made progress in image-based lane detection, the extension to video-level detection is desired as it can leverage temporal consistency to resolve ambiguities. However, there is a lack of video datasets with appropriate annotations for training deep networks. To address this, the authors collect a new video instance lane detection (VIL-100) dataset and propose a multi-level memory aggregation network (MMA-Net). MMA-Net utilizes local and global memory information to enhance CNN features and produces video instance lane detection results. The authors evaluate 10 state-of-the-art models on the VIL-100 dataset and show that MMA-Net outperforms existing methods in both single-image lane detection and video instance object segmentation.
