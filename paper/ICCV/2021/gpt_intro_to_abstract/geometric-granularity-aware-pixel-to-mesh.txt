In this paper, we address the limitations of existing 3D mesh reconstruction methods, specifically focusing on the challenges of generating precise and rich details, as well as reconstructing non-zero genus objects. We propose a geometric granularity-aware pixel-to-mesh framework with a fidelity-selection-and-guarantee strategy. Our framework includes a Multi-scale Geometry Structure Extractor (GSE) to capture important local geometry features, a geometry-aware deformation network to improve reconstruction details, and a fine-grained mesh edit module to break through the restrictions of the initial template mesh. We introduce the concept of a multi-scale shape preserving constraint and a fine-grained mesh edit module to overcome the limitations of existing methods and improve the fidelity and topology of reconstructed meshes. Our contributions include the development of the GSE to extract local geometry information, the design of a multi-scale shape preserving constraint, and the introduction of a fine-grained mesh edit module to handle objects of various genus. Our framework is the first to address both challenges simultaneously and shows promising results in improving the fidelity and topology of reconstructed 3D meshes.
