This paper introduces a framework for building SO(3) equivariant and invariant pointcloud networks. The framework uses a Vector Neuron (VN) representation, extending scalar neurons to 3D vectors, and latent matrix representations instead of latent vector representations. The framework addresses the challenges in achieving equivariance to 3D rotations and order symmetries in pointcloud processing. The proposed framework is simple and lightweight compared to existing approaches, such as Tensor Field Networks and SE(3)-Transformers. Experimental results demonstrate that the VN version of popular non-equivariant architectures achieves state-of-the-art performance in classification and segmentation tasks. This work contributes to the development of 3D equivariant networks for 3D reconstruction.
