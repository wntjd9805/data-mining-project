Semantic segmentation has made remarkable progress in recent years due to advancements in deep learning algorithms and the availability of large-scale labeled datasets. However, existing methods for semantic segmentation rely on extensive pixel-level annotation for every single class, making them less scalable to new classes. The high annotation cost has hindered the general applicability of semantic segmentation models, hindering their adoption in real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages few-shot learning techniques to enable semantic segmentation models to adapt to new classes with minimal training images. Our approach focuses on meta-learning the classiﬁer part of the model while pre-training and freezing the encoder and decoder. By assuming that the pre-trained model can capture discriminative segmentation features suitable for both training and unseen test classes, we can solely focus on adapting the classiﬁer to achieve few-shot adaptation. We introduce a novel meta-learning algorithm that utilizes a Classiﬁer Weight Transformer (CWT) to dynamically adapt the classiﬁer weights to each query image in an inductive manner. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular backbones and outperforms existing alternatives, particularly in more challenging cross-domain scenarios. Our approach offers a more scalable and cost-effective solution for semantic segmentation in real-world applications.
