Single image deraining is a problem in image processing where the goal is to estimate a rain-free image from a rainy image. Recovering rain-free images is of great interest due to the degradation of images caused by rainy environments, which affects tasks such as traffic detection and environmental monitoring. Rain introduces color fidelity loss and visual occlusions through rain streaks in the background scene. Mathematically, the raining process can be represented by a linear superimposition model, where the rainy image, O, is the result of the rain-free image, B, plus the rain map, R. The ill-posed nature of this problem arises from the fact that multiple pairs of rain-free and rain maps can generate the same rainy image. Existing methods for image deraining make assumptions on the rain map and rain-free image or utilize end-to-end trainable networks. However, imposing constraints on the derained images alone neglects the distribution and motion of rain streaks. To address this, a rain direction regularizer is proposed to model the properties of the rain map, preserving consistent and sharp rain structures. To improve the generalization ability for real rainy images, a semi-supervised learning method with knowledge distillation is developed. This method estimates rain maps and derained images, and a new dataset, RealDirection, with direction labels is constructed. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in rain removal tasks. The contributions of this work include the proposal of a rain direction regularizer, the development of an unpaired learning method for rain removal, and the introduction of the RainDirection and Real3000 datasets for training and evaluation.
