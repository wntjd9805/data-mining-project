This paper explores the application of self-supervised learning methods to large-scale remote sensing datasets and geo-tagged natural image datasets. While self-supervised learning methods have shown promising results in traditional computer vision datasets, their application to remote sensing images is largely unexplored. The paper experimentally evaluates the performance of an existing self-supervised contrastive learning method on remote sensing datasets and identifies a performance gap compared to supervised learning using labels. To bridge this gap, the authors propose geography-aware contrastive learning, taking into account the spatio-temporal structure of remote sensing data. They also design a novel unsupervised learning method that leverages geo-location information. The proposed methods are integrated into a single geography-aware contrastive learning objective. Experimental results on different datasets demonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy, object detection, semantic segmentation, and land cover classification. The proposed geography-aware learning approach even outperforms the supervised learning counterpart on temporal data classification. Additionally, the authors extend their approach to geo-located ImageNet images and show improved performance on image classification. The paper presents a detailed schematic overview of the proposed approach.
