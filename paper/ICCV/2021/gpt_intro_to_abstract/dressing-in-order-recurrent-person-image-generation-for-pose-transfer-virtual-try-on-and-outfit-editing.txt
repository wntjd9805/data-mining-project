Person generation research has seen rapid growth in recent years due to advancements in deep generative models and commercial opportunities. This paper focuses on the development of a flexible 2D person generation pipeline that can be applied to various tasks such as pose transfer, virtual try-on, and fashion editing. Existing systems often address these tasks individually and lack the ability to preserve details or offer flexible representations of shape and texture. In contrast, the proposed system, called DiOr, separates the encoding of pose, skin, and garments, with the garment encodings further segmented into shape and texture. This separation allows for greater flexibility in achieving different looks. The system also incorporates a novel recurrent generation module that produces different looks based on the order in which garments are layered. Unlike existing methods that generate the entire outfit in a single step, DiOr is able to generate different looks by considering the interaction of garments. The paper describes the system architecture and encoding techniques in detail, including the use of soft masks for shape encoding and a flow field estimation component for accurate garment deformation. Experimental results and editing functionalities enabled by the system are also presented.
