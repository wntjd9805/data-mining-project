Recent studies in semantic segmentation have focused on improving the performance of segmenting urban scenes. However, these approaches struggle to identify unexpected objects that were not included in the pre-defined classes during training. This limitation is especially critical for safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. For example, wrongly predicting a dog on the road as the road itself could result in accidents. Therefore, it is crucial to develop methods that can detect unexpected objects and handle them differently. Several approaches have been proposed to address this problem, including the use of external datasets or leveraging image resynthesis models. However, these approaches often require significant labor or have lengthy inference times. On the other hand, simple approaches that use only a pre-trained model have been proposed for out-of-distribution detection in image classification. These approaches utilize anomaly scores, such as the maximum softmax probability (MSP) or maximum logit, to detect anomalous objects. However, using these scores directly has limitations, such as the softmax function's fast-growing exponential property leading to highly confident predictions even for anomalous samples. Additionally, the values of the maximum logit vary within each predicted class, which makes it challenging to set a single threshold for detecting anomalous objects.In this work, we propose a new approach called standardized max logits (SML) to address these limitations. SML standardizes the max logits in a class-wise manner to align their distributions, reducing false positives. We further improve the detection of unexpected objects by considering local semantics through iterative boundary suppression and dilated smoothing.Our approach offers several contributions: 1) it provides a simple yet effective solution for identifying unexpected objects in semantic segmentation of urban scenes, 2) it can be easily applied to existing models without the need for additional training or external datasets, and 3) it achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Fishyscapes Lost & Found Leaderboard, surpassing previous approaches. These achievements are obtained with a large margin and negligible computation overhead.
