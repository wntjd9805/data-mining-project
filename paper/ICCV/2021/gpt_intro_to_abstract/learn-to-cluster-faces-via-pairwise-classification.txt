Face clustering is an important task in face analysis technology, especially in scenarios like dataset preparation for face recognition and photo album management. Traditional clustering methods have limitations and their performances can be sensitive to hyper-parameters. Graph-based face clustering methods have shown promising results, but they come with high computational costs and memory demands. Previous works have proposed solutions to alleviate these problems, but they still have issues with large-scale face clustering scenarios. Additionally, these methods require a manual-setting threshold to determine the connectivities between samples, which limits their generalization in real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose a memory-friendly and threshold-free face clustering method that focuses on the homogeneity of samples. Instead of learning on the graph or cluster level, our method operates on the pair level, significantly reducing memory consumption. We use a simple yet effective classifier network to determine the connection relationship between a pair of samples. We train the classifier on our designed weighted-neighbor features to improve its performance. Our method directly gives the pairwise relationships and generates the final clusters efficiently with limited memory usage. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce a rank-weighted density that gives more importance to nearby neighbors, reducing the time complexity and improving the overall performance. Our contributions include: proposing a memory-friendly and threshold-free face clustering method based on pairwise classification, introducing a rank-weighted density for pair selection, and achieving superior performance on public face clustering benchmarks compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.The paper provides a brief review of related work, details our proposed method, presents experimental results and analysis, and concludes with the impact of our approach.
