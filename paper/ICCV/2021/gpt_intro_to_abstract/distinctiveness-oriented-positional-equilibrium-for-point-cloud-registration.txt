Point cloud registration is a common task in computer vision, aiming to match two point clouds through a rigid transformation. Traditional algorithms have been used for this task, but recent advances in deep learning have led to significant improvements. These learning-based registration methods typically consist of a feature extraction backbone, such as a graph neural network (GNN), followed by a feature matching step. However, these methods often overlook the importance of distinctiveness in the extracted features, which can greatly affect registration accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a novel positional embedding module called Distinctiveness oriented Positional Equilibrium (DoPE). This module enhances the distinctiveness of point features by augmenting them with global positional information computed with respect to the centroid of the point clouds. DoPE is used in an iterative registration framework, gradually aligning the point clouds through rigid transformations computed from DoPE's position-aware features. By refining the joint origin and correspondence matrix, the network eventually converges to a positional equilibrium, resulting in high registration accuracy. We analyze the indistinguishable feature problem and demonstrate the effectiveness of DoPE through comprehensive experiments on various registration datasets and task settings. DoPE improves the performance of state-of-the-art registration architectures and yields unprecedented performance improvements.
