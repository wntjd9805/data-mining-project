Image denoising is an important task in computer vision, and image modeling and prior learning are crucial for the design of effective denoising algorithms. Traditional image modeling methods are typically hand-designed and may not capture the complexity of real-world images. Data-driven learning methods have shown promising results in denoising, but their performance relies on the availability of clean images during training, which is often not practical. To address this limitation, self-supervised learning, which only requires noisy images during training, has gained attention. One recent self-supervised method is deep image prior (DIP), which performs self-supervised learning for the generator network. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algorithm for image denoising. We conduct experiments and theoretical analysis to study the influence of Gaussian noise on GMM parameters, particularly the covariance eigenvalues. We also develop a noise level estimation module for our algorithm to determine the level of sparsity constraint. Our self-supervised learning algorithm for GMM achieves image prior learning from a single noisy image and is easy to implement. Our contributions include a detailed study on the impact of Gaussian noise on GMM parameters, a self-contained noise level estimation module, and an efficient self-supervised learning algorithm for GMM.
