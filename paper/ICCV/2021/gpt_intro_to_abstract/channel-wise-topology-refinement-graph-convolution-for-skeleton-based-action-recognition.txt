Human action recognition plays a crucial role in various applications such as human-robot interaction and video surveillance. Among different approaches, skeleton-based human action recognition has gained attention due to its robustness against complicated backgrounds and the availability of depth sensors. However, early deep-learning-based methods overlook the inherent correlations between joints, which reveal the human body topology and provide important information for human skeleton analysis. To address this limitation, recent approaches have employed graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model correlations between joints. However, these methods either use a single shared topology for all channels, limiting the flexibility of feature extraction, or employ individual parameterized topologies for channel groups, which increases the model complexity and hindering effective modeling of channel-wise topologies.In this paper, we propose a novel channel-wise topology refinement graph convolution (CTR-GC) for skeleton-based action recognition. Instead of learning topologies of different channels independently, CTR-GC learns a shared topology and channel-specific correlations simultaneously. The shared topology provides generic correlations between vertices, while the channel-specific correlations are dynamically inferred for each sample, capturing subtle relationships within each channel. By refining the shared topology with channel-specific correlations, CTR-GC obtains channel-wise topologies, allowing for flexible and effective correlation modeling.We further combine CTR-GC with temporal modeling modules to construct a powerful graph convolutional network called CTR-GCN. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that CTR-GC significantly outperforms other graph convolutions proposed for skeleton-based action recognition. Additionally, CTR-GCN achieves notable performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods. In summary, our contributions include the proposal of a channel-wise topology refinement approach for skeleton-based action recognition, the unification of various graph convolutions, and the demonstration of the superior performance of CTR-GCN on multiple benchmark datasets.
