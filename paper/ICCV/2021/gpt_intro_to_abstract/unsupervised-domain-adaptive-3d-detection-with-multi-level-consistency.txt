The prevalent use of LiDARs for autonomous vehicles and mobile robots has led to increasing research in 3D object detection on point clouds. Deep learning-based models have achieved remarkable success with the help of large-scale 3D object detection datasets. However, these models often suffer from performance degradation when evaluated on different datasets, known as the domain gap. In this paper, we investigate the problem of bounding box scale mismatch as a major contributor to the domain gap in 3D detection. We propose MLC-Net, an unsupervised domain adaptive 3D detection method, to address this problem. MLC-Net employs the mean teacher learning paradigm to create scale-adaptive targets and enforce consistency at multiple levels. Our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of performance and is compatible with popular 3D detectors. We validate our approach through rigorous experiments on multiple datasets and highlight the unique challenges associated with point clouds. Our contributions include the formulation and study of unsupervised domain adaptive 3D detection, the proposal of the mean-teacher paradigm, and the validation of our approach through comprehensive evaluations.
