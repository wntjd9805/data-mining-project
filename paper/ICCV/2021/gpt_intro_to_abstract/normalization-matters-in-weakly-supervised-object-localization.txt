This paper addresses the problem of weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL), which involves localizing an object in a scene using only its class information. While fully-supervised object detectors perform well with bounding box annotations, the task of localization in the absence of these annotations is still challenging. Previous WSOL methods, such as the class activation map (CAM) approach, use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to generate activation maps for object localization. However, these methods are limited by the fact that discriminative parts of an object can mislead the model and result in inaccurate localization. Previous works have proposed various methods to address this issue, but they have been evaluated under different conditions and their hyperparameters have been chosen empirically, making fair comparisons difficult. This paper introduces a new evaluation protocol and compares six previous WSOL methods using a min-max normalization scheme. The authors demonstrate that the min-max normalization approach can degrade the performance of most WSOL methods. They revisit the use of max normalization, showing that it can resolve the problems associated with min-max normalization. Additionally, the authors propose a new normalization method called inferior value removal (IVR) and show through experimental results that IVR improves the localization performance of almost all WSOL methods. The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of various normalization methods on different datasets and architectures, offering a renewed benchmark for WSOL methods.
