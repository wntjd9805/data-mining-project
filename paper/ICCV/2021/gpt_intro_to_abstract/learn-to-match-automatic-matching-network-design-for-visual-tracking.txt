In this paper, we address the problem of generic object tracking in computer vision. Object tracking involves inferring the location and scale of an object in a video sequence. Previous methods have decomposed the tracking problem into a relation learning task and a state estimation task. However, the advancements in relation learning have been limited, with heuristically designed matching operators being used.To overcome this limitation, we propose a search algorithm for automatic matching network design in Siamese tracking. Instead of using conventional cross-correlation and its variants, we explore the feasibility of selecting different matching operators. We introduce six novel matching operators, namely Concatenation, Pointwise-Addition, Pairwise-Relation, FiLM, Simple-Transformer, and Transductive-Guidance, and compare their performances under different environment degradation types.We show that by simply replacing cross-correlation with concatenation, a strong baseline tracker achieves significant improvements in success score. We also observe that different matching operators exhibit different resilience to challenging factors and image contents. This inspires us to combine them to exploit complementary informative features.To automatically select and combine matching operators, we propose a search algorithm called Binary Channel Manipulation (BCM). This algorithm constructs a search space with the matching operators and applies Gumbel-Softmax to discretize manipulators as binary decisions. Bilevel optimization is used to find the optimal manipulators on the validation set, with the weight of other layers learned on the training data.We validate the effectiveness of our framework on multiple benchmark datasets, and our approach outperforms the baseline tracker as well as recent online updating methods. The main contributions of this work are the introduction of six novel matching operators for Siamese tracking and the proposal of a conceptually simple algorithm for automatic matching network design, which achieves remarkable performance gains with neglectable overhead on tracking speed.
