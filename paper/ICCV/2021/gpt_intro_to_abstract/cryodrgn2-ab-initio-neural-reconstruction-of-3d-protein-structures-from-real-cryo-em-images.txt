In the last decade, single particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has experienced significant growth in its development and application for determining the 3D structures of proteins and biomolecules. This progress has been facilitated by advancements in hardware and image processing algorithms, allowing for the resolution of complex structures that were previously inaccessible through crystallography. Cryo-EM involves freezing a purified solution of the molecule of interest in a thin layer of vitreous ice and capturing transmission electron microscope images at cryogenic temperatures. The resulting dataset contains thousands to millions of noisy and randomly oriented 2D projection images, and the goal of cryo-EM reconstruction is to infer the underlying 3D structure. However, this task presents challenges due to unknown image poses and high image noise. Moreover, molecules can adopt varying conformations, making it difficult to determine their structures. To address these issues, researchers have proposed algorithms for heterogeneous reconstruction, which extract multiple structures from the imaging dataset. Recently, neural methods have shown promise in dealing with the structural variability in cryo-EM data. One such method, cryoDRGN, utilizes a deep generative model for 3D cryo-EM volumes to perform heterogeneous reconstruction. However, previous versions of cryoDRGN had limitations in scalability and quality of reconstructions. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a novel approach that combines image pose optimization with volume estimation using a feed-forward MLP representation. They also introduce search techniques to address the computational complexity of MLPs and identify and address a problem of vanishing gradients during training. The results show that this improved version of cryoDRGN achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for unsupervised ab initio reconstruction on both homogeneous and heterogeneous cryo-EM datasets.
