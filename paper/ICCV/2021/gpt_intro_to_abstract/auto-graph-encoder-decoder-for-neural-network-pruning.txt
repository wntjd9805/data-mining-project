With the growing demand for deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices with limited resources, model compression techniques have become essential. Existing methods rely heavily on hand-crafted rules and may not lead to fully compressed models. In this paper, we propose a graph-based Auto Graph encoder-decoder Model Compression (AGMC) method that combines graph convolutional networks (GCNs) and reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the compression strategy of DNNs without expert knowledge. The method leverages the structural information within computational graphs to identify redundancy and pruning policies for DNN hidden layers. Our approach successfully applies network pruning to various DNNs and achieves state-of-the-art results. The contributions of this paper include a novel automatic layer embedding based on computational graph structure, an efficient method for automating channel pruning using GCN and RL, and state-of-the-art model pruning results on various DNN models.
