Image-based retrieval systems have achieved impressive performance in various tasks such as face verification, landmark retrieval, place instance retrieval, and recognition. However, these systems lack a notion of confidence, which can be problematic in safety-critical applications. For example, a self-driving car relying on visual place recognition should be able to filter out unreliable place estimates. In addition, quantifying retrieval uncertainty can improve the user experience in human-computer interfaces by excluding low-confidence results for a query.Practical retrieval systems require high-level features that can generalize to unseen classes. However, current uncertainty estimation methods for retrieval are often impractical and heuristic. To address these challenges, we propose the use of stochastic image embeddings instead of deterministic ones. By considering the posterior distribution over possible features given an image, we can obtain direct uncertainty estimates and assign probabilities to events such as two images belonging to the same place. We derive a likelihood to satisfy the conventional triplet constraint and a prior over the feature space that mimics conventional l2 normalization.To ensure computational efficiency during both training and testing, we derive a variational approximation to the posterior distribution. This allows us to encode an image to a distribution in the feature space. Through experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance while providing state-of-the-art uncertainty estimates.
