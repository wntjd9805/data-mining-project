Image hiding is a technique used to conceal a secret image within a cover image to generate a stego image. The stego image should be indistinguishable from the cover image and only visible to informed receivers. This task is more challenging compared to bit-level message hiding or steganography, as it requires large capacity, high invisibility, and security. Image hiding has various applications, with secret communication and privacy protection being the most significant. Traditional steganographic approaches have limitations in terms of capacity. In this paper, we propose HiNet, an invertible image hiding network where the concealing and revealing processes share the same set of network parameters. This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of recovery accuracy, hiding security, and invisibility. The main contributions of this paper are the introduction of HiNet, the design of reversible concealing and revealing modules, and the proposal of a low-frequency wavelet loss for improved hiding security.
