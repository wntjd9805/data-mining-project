Cross-modal pre-training has made significant progress in representation learning in the vision-language field. This approach aims to bridge the gap between vision and language by utilizing large-scale image-text pairs to learn unified representations. This paper focuses on multi-modal retrieval tasks, such as cross-modal retrieval and single-modal matching. However, existing methods have limitations, such as time-consuming feature extraction and limited cross-modal interactions. To address these limitations, the authors propose a novel framework called COOKIE (Contrastive Cross-Modal Knowledge Sharing Pre-training). COOKIE leverages the advantages of both one-stream and double-stream methods while avoiding their disadvantages. The framework consists of a double-stream visual semantic embedding structure with a weight-sharing transformer encoder (WS-TE) and utilizes cross-modal and single-modal contrastive learning methods.The double-stream visual semantic embedding structure with WS-TE improves the efficiency of cross-modal training and testing while strengthening semantic alignment. It avoids the computation cost of one-stream methods by using ResNet for feature extraction instead of Faster R-CNN. Additionally, a weight-sharing transformer encoder is designed to enhance cross-modal interactions and refine vision-language alignment.COOKIE is optimized using three types of contrastive learning: cross-modal contrastive learning, single-modal visual contrastive learning (VCL), and textual contrastive learning (TCL). This approach shares knowledge from pre-trained image and text encoders, such as ResNet and BERT, through cross-modal knowledge sharing.Experimental results show that COOKIE outperforms previous methods in multi-modal matching tasks, such as image-text matching, video-text matching, text matching, and image retrieval. It achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art method Oscar but with significantly reduced inference time. COOKIE also improves performance in single-modal matching tasks, with gains in text matching and image retrieval.
