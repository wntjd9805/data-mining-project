Few-shot classification aims to train a model that can generalize to unseen novel classes with only a few labeled examples. While recent progress has been made using the meta-learning paradigm, most methods and benchmarks in few-shot classification focus on single-domain scenarios and fail to learn generalized models across different visual domains. However, there is a prevalent need for cross-domain generalization in practical applications. To address this limitation, a new benchmark called META-DATASET has been proposed, which consists of multiple diverse datasets and raises the problem of multi-domain few-shot classification. This introduces two challenges: efficiently generating multi-domain representations and exploring domain correlations for better cross-domain generalization. Existing multi-domain methods are unable to effectively address these challenges. In this paper, a Multi-Mode Modulator (tri-M) is proposed to simultaneously model multi-domain feature representation and cross-domain correlations. The modulator achieves multi-domain representation by incorporating multiple modulation parameters in a single network and captures both intra-domain and inter-domain information. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the META-DATASET benchmark for unseen test domains. Overall, the contributions of this work include the introduction of a multi-mode modulator for multi-domain few-shot classification, the explicit modeling of domain correlations, and the achievement of state-of-the-art performance on the META-DATASET benchmark.
