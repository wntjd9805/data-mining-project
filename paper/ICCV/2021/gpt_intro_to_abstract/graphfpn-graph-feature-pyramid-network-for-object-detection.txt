This paper introduces the concept of graph feature pyramid networks to overcome limitations in existing feature pyramid networks used in computer vision tasks. The proposed network adapts its topology to the varying intrinsic structures of input images and supports simultaneous feature interactions across all scales. The network is based on a superpixel hierarchy derived from hierarchical segmentation of the input image, which reveals intrinsic image structures. Graph nodes in the network correspond to superpixels, and edges are set up between neighboring superpixels as well as corresponding superpixels in ancestor-descendant relationships. The network utilizes contextual and hierarchical graph neural network layers to promote feature interactions within the same scale and across different scales, respectively. The final features at all levels of the graph feature pyramid are fused with features from a conventional feature pyramid network to generate enhanced multi-scale features. Experimental results on MS-COCO 2017 validation and test datasets show that the proposed graph feature pyramid network outperforms existing object detection methods.
