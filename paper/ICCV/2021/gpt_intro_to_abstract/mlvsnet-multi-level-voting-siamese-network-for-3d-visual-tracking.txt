Visual tracking is a crucial component in various computer vision applications, such as robot vision and autopilot systems. While significant progress has been made in 2D visual tracking using Siamese based trackers, the direct application of these algorithms to 3D tracking is impractical due to differences in data structure. 3D tracking, which utilizes point cloud data, offers advantages in terms of robustness to illumination and appearance changes, but also presents challenges such as irregularity, noise, and sparsity in outdoor environments. This paper introduces a novel approach called Multi-level Voting Siamese Network (MLVSNet) for 3D visual tracking from point cloud data in outdoor scenes. The proposed MLVSNet builds on the concept of Hough voting used in 3D object detection, specifically the recently proposed VoteNet algorithm. MLVSNet addresses two challenges specific to 3D tracking: handling irregular, noisy, and sparse point cloud data, and efficiently transferring information from the target to the search area for tracking. To address the first challenge, MLVSNet incorporates PointNet++ for hierarchical feature learning, which effectively captures high-level features from irregular and noisy data. To address sparsity, MLVSNet introduces a multi-level voting strategy (MLV) to aggregate votes from seed points at multiple levels. This strategy captures information at different scales and improves detection performance. To address the second challenge, MLVSNet proposes a lightweight module called Target-Guided Attention (TGA) to establish the relationship between the search area and the target. Additionally, an attention mechanism is used in the Vote-cluster Feature Enhancement (VFE) module to exploit the relationship between different vote clusters. Experimental results demonstrate that MLVSNet outperforms state-of-the-art models in 3D visual tracking using point cloud sequences. The contributions of this work include the introduction of the MLV strategy for more effective target detection in sparse point clouds, the design of the TGA module for efficient embedding of target information, and the development of the MLVSNet model for 3D visual tracking, which achieves new state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks.
