Data augmentation is a popular technique used in machine learning to improve generalization by generating additional data. It has been successfully applied in various domains, including machine translation, object detection, and semi-supervised learning. This work focuses specifically on data augmentation for image classification. Image augmentations in this context aim to generate new images that still belong to the same classification category as the original dataset. This allows the dataset to expand based on the biases introduced by the augmentations, leading to improved performance. However, data augmentations require domain knowledge and can be time-consuming to design manually. Automatic augmentation methods have emerged as a solution to this problem, as they automatically design augmentation policies. These methods have shown significant improvements in model performance across tasks, particularly in image classification. Despite their success, the belief that these automatic augmentation methods result in augmentation policies that are well-suited to the model and dataset is challenged in this work. Introducing a trivial baseline method called TrivialAugment (TA), the authors demonstrate that TA performs comparably to more expensive augmentation methods without the need to learn a specific augmentation policy. The contributions of this paper include an analysis of the minimal requirements for well-performing automatic augmentation methods, the introduction of TA as a practical and state-of-the-art augmentation baseline, a comprehensive performance analysis of TA and other automatic augmentation methods, and recommendations for the practical usage of automatic augmentation methods. The authors also provide their code for easy application and future research.
