Glass-like objects, such as bottles, windows, and mirrors, are common in the real world and their accurate segmentation is important for various applications. However, the segmentation of these objects presents several challenges including their variable shape, transparency, and confounding appearance with the background. Existing state-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation and salient object detection struggle to accurately segment glass-like objects. Only a few dedicated methods have been proposed to address this task, but they have limitations in terms of excessive comparison and context information or the lack of consideration for pixel-wise relationships on the boundary. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel module called Refined Differential Module (RDM) which uses differential edge detection and morphological processing to generate accurate boundary predictions. Additionally, we introduce an efficient edge-aware Point-based Graph convolution network Module (PGM) to enhance global feature learning around the edge. We also propose a joint loss function to supervise both the edge and non-edge parts of the segmentation result. Our approach achieves significant improvements over previous methods, both quantitatively and visually, and achieves state-of-the-art results on three glass-like object segmentation datasets.
