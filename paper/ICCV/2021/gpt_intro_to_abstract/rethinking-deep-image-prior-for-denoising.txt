Deep neural networks have revolutionized computer vision tasks, including image denoising. However, traditional methods like BM3D have outperformed early deep learning approaches for denoising tasks until the introduction of DnCNN. Deep image prior (DIP) has shown promising results for inverse problems, but struggles with denoising. This paper proposes a modified version of DIP called stochastic temporal ensembling (STE) that improves denoising performance. The proposed method incorporates noise regularization and exponential moving average and achieves better results than DIP and other state-of-the-art methods. The method is evaluated on various datasets using metrics like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. Additionally, the method is extended to handle Poisson noise. The contributions of this paper include the analysis of DIP's effective degrees of freedom, the development of a loss-based stopping criterion, the incorporation of noise regularization through STE, and the extensive evaluation on different metrics and datasets.
