This paper introduces a new framework for utilizing multiple pseudo labels in the context of image-level category label based salient object detection (WSOD). The current state-of-the-art methods in WSOD rely heavily on hand-labeling data with pixel-level annotations, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, the authors propose an approach that leverages multiple pseudo labels to establish a more robust framework and avoid negative effects caused by a single biased label. Two different refinement algorithms are used to synthesize the pseudo labels, each capturing different aspects of the salient objects. The authors then extract and integrate comprehensive and robust saliency cues from these multiple pseudo labels using a multi-filter directive network (MFNet). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of their method, and the proposed framework is also extended to an existing method, resulting in significant improvements.
