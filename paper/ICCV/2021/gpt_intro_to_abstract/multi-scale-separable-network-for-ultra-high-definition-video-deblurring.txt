Ultra-High-Definition (UHD) videos with 4K resolution have become increasingly popular, but they often suffer from blurring due to camera shakes and high-speed movements. This blurring reduces the visual quality of the videos and hinders high-level vision tasks. Various image and video deblurring methods have been proposed to address this issue, but they often make assumptions that do not hold in real cases, leading to inaccurate estimations of blur kernels and undesirable deblurred image quality. To overcome these limitations, deep learning deblurring algorithms have been introduced, but they are computationally expensive and lack flexibility in handling different types of information. In this paper, we present a new UHDVD network that offers high efficiency, low memory usage, and high-quality deblurring performance. Our network is inspired by patch-hierarchical image deblurring methods but overcomes their limitations by introducing a separable-patch architecture combined with a multi-scale integration scheme. We also propose a cascaded residual channel and spatial attention (RCSA) module to improve deblurring performance without sacrificing speed. We evaluate our method on a 4K video deblurring dataset and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
