3D object detection is a challenging problem in computer vision with various applications like autonomous driving and robotic manipulation. However, detecting and classifying objects from 3D point clouds in cluttered indoor scenes, especially without color information, remains difficult. While deep learning techniques have shown promise in improving performance, there is still room for enhancement. This paper introduces VENet, a voting enhancement network based on the VoteNet architecture. VENet improves the voting procedure by enhancing seed point feature description, addressing object-noise from adjacent objects, and reducing background-noise from background seed points. It introduces an Attentive MLP to enhance seed point features, a vote attraction loss to ensure compact grouping of votes, and a vote weighting module to reduce the impact of background votes. Experimental results demonstrate that VENet outperforms existing methods on public datasets, making significant contributions to the field of 3D object detection.
