Point cloud registration is a crucial task in computer vision, involving aligning two point clouds and estimating the relative transformation between them. While methods exist that rely on known correspondences between points for efficient solutions, our paper focuses on correspondence-free registration. The widely used iterative closest point (ICP) method computes alignment based on point-to-point correspondences, but it requires good initialization and is sensitive to outliers, noise, and missing points. Probabilistic methods, such as the coherent point drift (CPD) and FilterReg, approach point cloud registration as a probability density estimation problem. These methods describe the geometry of the first point cloud using a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with isotropic covariances placed at each point. The second set is fitted to this distribution using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). While robust, these methods do not capture local planar geometry in point cloud data, leading to inaccuracies in registration.To address this limitation, we propose a novel method called CPD with Local Surface Geometry (LSG-CPD). This approach incorporates local surface geometry, including surface normals and surface variation, to construct a GMM on the target set. The source set is then fitted to this distribution using MLE. We adaptively impose different levels of point-to-plane penalization, resulting in anisotropic covariances, based on the local surface's curvature and variation. This ensures that flatter surfaces are attracted towards the local plane, while surfaces with larger curvature or noisy normal estimations maintain robustness. Additionally, we introduce methods to estimate the weight of the outlier component in the GMM and propose confidence filtering (CF) to flexibly reallocate weights based on measurement confidence. The Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm is used for solving the MLE problem, and we optimize the computation process using parallelizable matrix manipulations on a GPU. In the M-step, we employ an unconstrained optimization method using Newton's method on a matrix Lie group. Our motivation is to enhance the GMM-based description of point cloud geometry by incorporating local surface geometry information. This allows for improved registration accuracy while maintaining the robustness of probabilistic methods. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy and robustness on various datasets captured by range scanners, RGBD cameras, and LiDARs.
