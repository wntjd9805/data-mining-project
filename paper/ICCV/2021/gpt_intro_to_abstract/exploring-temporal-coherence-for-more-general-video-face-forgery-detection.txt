This paper introduces a novel approach for detecting face forgery in videos by leveraging temporal coherence. Previous methods have shown limited generalization capability and vulnerability to common perturbations. The proposed approach focuses on detecting temporal incoherence, which is a common artifact in forged videos. To achieve this, the paper introduces a fully temporal convolution network (FTCN) that restricts the network's capability for handling spatial-related artifacts. Additionally, a Temporal Transformer is utilized to capture long-range dependencies in frames to handle discontinuity. The approach is shown to outperform previous methods in terms of generalization and robustness. Experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The contributions include the framework combining FTCN and Temporal Transformer, the ability to locate and visualize temporal incoherence, and the superior performance in detecting unseen forgeries.
