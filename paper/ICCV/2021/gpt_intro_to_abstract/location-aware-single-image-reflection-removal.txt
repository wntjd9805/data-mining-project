This paper introduces a novel single image reflection removal (SIRR) method using deep learning. Reflections in images captured through reflective and transparent media can negatively affect image quality and computer vision tasks. The proposed method models the image composition as the weighted combination of a transmission layer and a reflection layer, and incorporates a reflection detection module to detect reflection-dominated regions. The detection module generates a reflection confidence map (RCMap) which improves the subsequent restoration process. Compared to existing methods, the proposed approach effectively removes strong reflected highlights. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in handling reflection removal.
