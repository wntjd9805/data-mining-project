This paper introduces a method called Unsupervised Deep Video Denoising (UDVD) for training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to denoise videos without access to ground-truth clean videos. Inspired by the blind-spot technique used in still image denoising, UDVD trains a blind-spot architecture to process the spatio-temporal neighborhood of each pixel to estimate noisy pixels without including the pixel itself. The paper shows that UDVD is competitive with state-of-the-art supervised methods on standard benchmarks and can produce high-quality denoising even when trained on a single brief noisy video sequence. Additionally, UDVD is effective in denoising real-world datasets from surveillance cameras, fluorescence microscopy videos, and electron microscopy videos. Contrary to conventional wisdom, UDVD and supervised CNNs achieve excellent empirical performance without explicitly estimating optical flow, demonstrating the ability to perform spatio-temporal adaptive filtering that compensates for motion. The paper also presents UDVD's contributions, including the blind-spot architecture, the use of aggressive data augmentation and early stopping for training, the effectiveness in denoising real-world datasets, and an analysis of the denoising mechanism learned by UDVD.
