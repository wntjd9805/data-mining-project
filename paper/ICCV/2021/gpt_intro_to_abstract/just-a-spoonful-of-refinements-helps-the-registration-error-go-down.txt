Abstract:The problem of aligning two point sets, which is crucial for various tasks in computer science, poses several challenges such as unknown correspondences, partial observations, varying density, and noise and outliers in point clouds. Existing optimization-based methods aim to minimize the distance between point sets using criteria like Chamfer distance but rely heavily on the quality of point correspondences. Recent approaches leverage deep neural networks to learn transformations that align point clouds. However, to ensure the validity of the estimated transformation, state-of-the-art methods employ the Kabsch algorithm, which requires differentiating through the SVD operation. In this paper, we propose a novel differentiable rotation estimator that performs iterative pose refinements to improve point correspondences without relying on the Kabsch algorithm. We linearize the non-linear constraints of rotation matrices and solve the optimization problem using Lagrange multipliers to obtain closed-form solutions. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach can be used with existing learning-based methods for point cloud registration, improving performance without the need for additional losses. Our contributions include the proposal of the differentiable rotation estimator, the linearization of rotation constraints, and the augmentation of state-of-the-art methods for point cloud registration.
