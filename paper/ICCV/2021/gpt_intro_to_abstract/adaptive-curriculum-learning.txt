This paper introduces a new curriculum learning approach called Adaptive CL that adapts the difficulty score to the current state of the network while remembering the useful knowledge learned from a pre-trained model. The authors propose a simple but effective method that gradually adapts the order of examples from easy to hard, using the difficulty score to measure the difficulty of examples. They also introduce a parameter to control the adaptation process and prevent the model from forgetting previous knowledge. The authors provide a theoretical analysis of curriculum learning under a non-linear model for binary classification and show that Adaptive CL can improve the convergence rate in the early stages of learning. The proposed method is compared with existing methods on several benchmarks and networks, and extensive empirical results demonstrate its superiority.
