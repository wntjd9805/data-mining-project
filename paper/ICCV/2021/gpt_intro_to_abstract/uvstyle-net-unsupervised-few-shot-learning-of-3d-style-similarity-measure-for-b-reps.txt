B-Reps are widely used in industrial design, particularly in the consumer product and automotive industries. They offer precise boundaries with continuous smooth surfaces and are highly editable and memory efficient. This paper introduces a few-shot learning method for capturing a user-defined 3D style using the activations of a pre-trained 3D object encoder. The relative importance of each layer's Gram matrix is learned through a selection of user examples. The paper also addresses the lack of publicly available B-Rep data for training machine learning models by adapting the SolidLetters dataset to improve style consistency. The proposed method is evaluated on various datasets, including the ABC dataset, and demonstrates its effectiveness in capturing subjective user-defined style similarity measures. Overall, this paper presents a geometric style similarity measure for 3D solids that can be used in unlabeled settings for any object class, with user subjectivity handled through few-shot learning. The benefits of the approach are shown through its application to B-Reps.
