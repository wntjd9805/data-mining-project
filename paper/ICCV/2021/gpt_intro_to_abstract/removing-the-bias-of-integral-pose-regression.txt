This paper introduces the problem of pose estimation, which involves determining the spatial position of articulated joints such as the human body or hand. While direct regression methods have been used to predict joint coordinates, they are less effective compared to methods that estimate a likelihood heatmap. Heatmap methods use a Gaussian centered at the ground truth joint coordinate, therefore converting pose estimation into a detection problem. The standard approach is to use an argmax function to decode the output heatmap into joint coordinates. However, this function is not differentiable and fixes the resolution of the estimated coordinate. An alternative decoding method is to use a softmax function together with an expectation, which is differentiable and allows for end-to-end training. This approach is referred to as latent heatmap regression in hand pose estimation literature and integral pose estimation in body pose estimation literature. Previous research has compared integral regression and detection-based heatmap methods and found that they are comparable in performance. However, the slow convergence of integral regression may be due to an induced bias. This paper proposes a compensation scheme to counter this bias, improving the learning and performance of integral regression. Performance comparisons show that integral regression outperforms heatmap-based detection in hard cases of pose estimation. To leverage the benefits of both methods, a combined learning framework is proposed. The contributions of this paper include the derivation and compensation of the bias in integral pose regression, analysis of performance differences for different factors of variation, and the proposal of a bias-compensated joint framework for detection and regression, which achieves state-of-the-art results in human and hand pose estimation.
