Modern recognition systems often require large amounts of labeled data, which can be challenging to acquire, especially for domains with subtle distinctions that require expert annotations. Zero-shot learning (ZSL) aims to address this issue by building recognition models solely from class descriptions. However, current ZSL systems still require annotators to specify numerous attributes for thousands of classes, resulting in a significant annotation burden. Previous approaches have explored using freely available text or word embeddings for attribute description but have shown reduced accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new learning interface for ZSL that leverages the concept of field guides used by experts to train novices. We find that this approach is more accurate and time-efficient compared to alternatives. We also introduce novel query strategies for the ZSL learner to actively acquire informative attributes from experts, considering attribute uncertainty and expected model change. Our experiments on three datasets demonstrate a significant reduction in annotation costs while maintaining performance comparable to fully annotated models. Our contributions include a new field-guide-inspired active ZSL approach and effective query strategies, highlighting the importance of considering the information to acquire from annotators and the expert interface for building accurate recognition models.
