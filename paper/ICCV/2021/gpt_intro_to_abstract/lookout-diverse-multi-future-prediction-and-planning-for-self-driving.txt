Self-driving vehicles (SDVs) have the potential to enhance road safety by constantly scanning and perceiving their surroundings. The ability to accurately predict the future trajectory of traffic participants is crucial for safe decision making. However, predicting human behavior and handling uncertain and multimodal futures poses challenges. Existing prediction systems require large numbers of samples to cover the long-tails of the distribution, which can impact safety. Additionally, current motion planners do not effectively utilize prediction systems that produce scene-consistent samples and often result in suboptimal and overly conservative trajectories. In this paper, we propose LOOKOUT, an end-to-end autonomy system that addresses these challenges. LOOKOUT detects actors in the scene, predicts a diverse set of consistent futures with high sample efficiency, and plans defensive actions while avoiding overreaction to low probability dangers. We approach motion forecasting as a diverse set prediction problem, directly optimizing the diversity of ego-vehicle motion plans. A scenario scoring module estimates the probability of each future, allowing for consideration of safety-critical but unlikely scenarios. We also introduce a contingency planner that plans separate long-term responses for each future while sharing an initial non-conservative short-term action to avoid immediate collision. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LOOKOUT in large-scale scenarios, showing improved safety and reduced conservatism compared to previous approaches. We highlight a trade-off between diversity and reconstruction quality in forecasts, with our approach providing better reconstruction and higher diversity compared to other methods.
