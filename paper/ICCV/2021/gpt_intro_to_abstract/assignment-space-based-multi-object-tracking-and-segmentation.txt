This paper introduces the problem of Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation (MOTS) and its importance in various fields, such as autonomous driving and robotics. While there has been significant attention given to the detection and segmentation of objects in individual frames of a video, tracking objects over multiple frames remains a challenge, especially when dealing with occlusions and viewpoint variations. The existing methods for MOTS tracking, whether batch or online, mainly focus on local tracking, which hinders accurate global tracking and the preservation of object identities. Additionally, directly formulating tracking on object detections leads to a combinatorial growth of options, making optimization complex. To address these challenges, the paper proposes formulating tracking over assignments rather than object detections. The top-k assignments of object detections/segmentations between consecutive frames are found using the Hungarian-Murty algorithm. A structured prediction formulation is then developed to globally score assignment sequences. The paper also introduces a post-processing step to establish long-term connections between previously unassigned object detections. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on MOTS datasets, outperforming other existing methods. Results are significantly improved in terms of association and overall performance in comparison to TrackR-CNN and PointTrack. The method also outperforms MOTSFusion on pedestrian tracking. The paper concludes with a qualitative comparison showing the benefits of using assignment space for preserving object identities. The proposed approach is also studied on the MOT task and compared with other batch methods.
