In this paper, we propose an Asynchronous Kalman Filter (AKF) algorithm for reconstructing high dynamic range (HDR) video from hybrid event/frame cameras. Event cameras, which offer advantages such as high temporal resolution and minimal motion blur, have limitations in imaging slowly varying or static scenes. Hybrid sensors, combining event and frame-based cameras, have been used for video reconstruction, but there is a need to further enhance conventional video by overcoming motion blur and increasing dynamic range. Our AKF algorithm utilizes an explicit noise model for events and frames and applies an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) algorithm to estimate pixel intensity. We propose an exact discretization of the EKF equations, called the Asynchronous Kalman Filter (AKF), which is computed only when events occur. Additionally, we introduce a novel temporal interpolation scheme and apply a de-blurring algorithm for data preprocessing. Our proposed algorithm achieves state-of-the-art image reconstruction and we compare its performance with existing methods on public datasets. To address the lack of HDR references in existing datasets, we collected high-quality events and HDR ground truth using a hybrid system. We evaluate the qualitative and quantitative performance of our proposed algorithm on our proposed HDR hybrid event/frame dataset. Our AKF algorithm demonstrates superior performance compared to existing event and event/frame reconstruction algorithms. The contributions of this work include the AKF algorithm, a unifying event/frame uncertainty model, deblur and temporal interpolation techniques, and the creation of a real-world HDR hybrid event/frame dataset for evaluation.
