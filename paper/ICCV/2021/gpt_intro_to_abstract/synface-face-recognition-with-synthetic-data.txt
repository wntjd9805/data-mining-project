This paper explores the potential of using synthetic images for face recognition. While there have been advancements in deep neural networks, loss functions, and large-scale training datasets, it remains challenging to improve face recognition performance due to label noise, privacy issues, and the long-tailed problem in training datasets. In order to address these issues, the authors investigate the use of synthetic images, generated using GANs and 3DMM, for face recognition. They show that synthetic images can be used to create large-scale datasets of non-existing identities without privacy concerns, and can also be used to analyze the impact of different face dataset properties and facial attributes on face recognition. However, there is a performance gap between models trained on synthetic and real face datasets, which is attributed to poor intra-class variations in synthetic images and the domain gap between synthetic and real datasets. To address these issues, the authors introduce identity mixup and domain mixup techniques to enhance the intra-class variations in synthetic images and alleviate the domain gap. Experimental results show that these techniques significantly improve the performance of models trained on synthetic face images. The paper concludes with contributions in narrowing the performance gap between real and synthetic face images, discussing the impact of synthetic dataset properties, and analyzing the influence of different facial attributes on face recognition.
