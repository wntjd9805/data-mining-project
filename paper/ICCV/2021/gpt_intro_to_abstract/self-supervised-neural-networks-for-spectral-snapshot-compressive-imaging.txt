Recent advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics have created a demand for capturing multi-dimensional high resolution data, such as high-speed videos and hyperspectral images. However, existing imaging devices face challenges in capturing such data. Compressive sensing (CS) offers an alternative approach to imaging systems by allowing the capture of high-dimensional data in a compressed way. Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) is a representative CS technique that uses the multiplexing technique to modulate the optical path and captures 3D spectral or temporal data using a 2D detector. This paper focuses on the spectral SCI system, specifically the algorithm design for the software decoder. The main motivation behind this research is the bottleneck of the reconstruction algorithm in CS systems, which is typically slow or of low quality. Deep learning has improved the speed and quality of the reconstruction algorithm, but the limited availability of training data for hyperspectral imaging poses a challenge. To address this challenge, untrained neural networks have been used to learn priors directly from the raw measurements, eliminating the need for training data. The proposed self-supervised framework combines these untrained neural networks with the plug-and-play (PnP) algorithm for spectral SCI reconstruction. The contributions of this work include the development of a self-supervised framework for spectral SCI reconstruction, an alternating optimization algorithm for joint network learning and reconstruction, and extensive results on both synthetic and real datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The proposed algorithm is robust to Poisson noise and does not require training data, yet achieves competitive results with similar quality to supervised deep learning algorithms. Integration with a pre-trained hyperspectral imaging (HSI) deep denoising prior further improves the results.
