Homography is a widely used image alignment model in computer science. It is typically estimated through feature detection and matching, followed by solving a Direct Linear Transform (DLT) with outlier removal. However, deep homography methods have emerged as an alternative approach that directly outputs a homography matrix using neural networks. These deep methods can be classified as supervised or unsupervised. The former uses synthesized examples with ground-truth labels, while the latter minimizes the differences between images without relying on synthesized examples. Previous deep homography methods regress offsets of a homography matrix, but this may not be optimal due to different magnitudes of these elements. In this work, a new "homography flow" representation is proposed, which generates multiple homography matrices that can be transformed into flow maps. To reduce the rank of motion features and enhance robustness, a Low Rank Representation (LRR) block is introduced. Additionally, a Feature Identity Loss (FIL) is proposed to enforce warp-equivariance of image features, improving the stability and effectiveness of unsupervised optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed techniques compared to state-of-the-art methods. The contributions of this work include the introduction of the homography flow representation, the LRR block for rank reduction, and the FIL loss for warp-equivariance enforcement.
