Instance segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision, with applications in autonomous vehicles, robotics, and medical imaging. Recent instance segmentation methods have been successful due to the availability of large-scale datasets with mask labels for individual instances. However, acquiring these mask labels is time-consuming. Weak labels, such as bounding boxes, are faster to annotate but result in subpar performance for classes without sufficient mask labels. To address this issue, partially supervised learning has been explored, where classes are annotated with box labels, and only a subset of these classes have mask labels. Existing methods either use meta-learning or class-agnostic mask heads to generalize mask predictions for weak classes, but they often fail to produce accurate results. This paper introduces an object mask prior (OMP) that highlights the correct foreground in ambiguous regions of interest (RoIs) and aids in generalization to weak classes. The OMP is optimized using box supervision and leverages the fact that the box classification head learns a general concept of the foreground. By embedding the OMP into the Mask R-CNN architecture, the proposed model, called OPMask (Object Prior Mask R-CNN), significantly improves performance compared to baseline methods on the COCO dataset. The OPMask outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches while using a simpler architecture.
