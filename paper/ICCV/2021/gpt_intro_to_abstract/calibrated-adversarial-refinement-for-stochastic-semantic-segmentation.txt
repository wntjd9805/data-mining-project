This paper introduces the concept of stochastic semantic segmentation, which aims to capture the multiple valid solutions for ambiguous real-world datasets. The majority of current semantic segmentation approaches only assign a single solution to each input image, limiting their ability to capture the entire empirical distribution. These approaches typically model each pixel independently, leading to incoherent predictions in regions of label inconsistencies. In contrast, the proposed approach, called calibrated adversarial refinement (CAR), leverages inter-pixel correlations and uncertainty information to generate diverse and coherent labels. CAR consists of a two-stage framework that first trains a network to estimate pixelwise class probabilities and uncertainty, and then uses an adversarial network to sample realistic predictions. The sample diversity is calibrated relative to the predicted distribution from the first stage. The paper presents a novel cascaded architecture for adversarial refinement, introduces a calibration loss term to improve learning of calibrated stochastic mappings, and demonstrates that the model can be trained independently or used to augment existing semantic segmentation models. This approach has potential applications in safety-critical domains such as medical imaging and map making, where it is important to consider all possible interpretations and their likelihoods before making decisions.
