This paper introduces the concept of geometric deep learning using the geometry of neurons. The authors propose the use of hyperspheres as decision surfaces instead of hyperplanes to properly represent isometries. They employ Clifford algebra and conformal geometry to perform computations in this context. The paper focuses on the application of the multilayer hypersphere perceptron (MLHP) model to classify 3D Tetris shapes. The authors demonstrate that spherical decision surfaces improve the understanding of neural network decision-making processes when constructed according to input space geometry. They introduce an extension to the MLHP model, called the multilayer geometric perceptron (MLGP) with geometric neurons, which achieves favorable results in classifying perturbed 3D Tetris shapes. Additionally, the authors derive an isomorphism between motor operators and geometric objects in the conformal space, demonstrating the isometry of geometric neuron activations in rotation and translation equivariance.
