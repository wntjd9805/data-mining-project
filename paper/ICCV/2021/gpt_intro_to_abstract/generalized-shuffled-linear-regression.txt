Linear regression is a widely used tool for parameter estimation in science and engineering. However, there are cases where the correspondences between covariates and responses are unknown. This problem has led to the development of shuffled linear regression (SLR), which aims to recover both the correspondences and the regression variable. In this paper, we propose a generalization of SLR called generalized shuffled linear regression (GSLR) that can handle cases where the cardinalities of covariates and responses are different and only partial matches are required. We present a simple yet effective algorithm for solving GSLR and provide theoretical analysis. We also demonstrate the applicability of GSLR in computer vision tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracies. We compare GSLR with other algorithms and show that nearest neighbors-based methods are not suitable for SLR due to violation of one-to-one matching constraints. We also discuss the relation of GSLR to robust estimation and quadratic assignment problems. Overall, GSLR expands the capabilities of SLR and can be used in various practical situations.
