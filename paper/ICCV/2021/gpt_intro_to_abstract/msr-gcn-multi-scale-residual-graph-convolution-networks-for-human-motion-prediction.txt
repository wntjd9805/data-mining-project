Human motion prediction is an important task in various fields such as human-computer interaction, autonomous driving, and video completion. While traditional methods can handle simple periodic motion patterns, more complex motion remains challenging to predict accurately. Previous approaches using deep learning methods have achieved success, but they often neglect the kinematic dependencies between body joints. Recently, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) have been employed for human motion prediction, showing promising results. However, the hierarchical structure of human pose is not effectively captured by GCN alone. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Residual Graph Convolution Network (MSR-GCN) for 3D human motion prediction. Our approach treats a human pose as a fully connected graph and employs GCNs to learn the relations between all pairs of joints. Additionally, we incorporate a hierarchical structure by gradually abstracting body parts, which stabilizes the motion pattern. We design multiple GCNs with a multi-scale architecture to extract features at different scales and predict poses at each scale. Intermediate supervision is applied to learn more representative features, resulting in high-quality future prediction. Our method differs from previous approaches by organizing the encoder and decoder in a U-Net-like multi-scale manner. Our main contributions include the proposal of the MSR-GCN framework and the extraction of features in both fine-to-coarse and coarse-to-fine manners. The intermediate supervision further improves prediction quality.
