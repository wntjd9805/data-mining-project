This paper introduces DenseTNT, an anchor-free and end-to-end multi-trajectory prediction method for autonomous driving systems. The prediction of future behaviors of road participants is crucial for safe and smooth autonomous driving. However, the inherent stochasticity and multimodality of human behaviors make motion prediction a challenging task. Previous approaches have used sampling-based methods or variety loss to model uncertainty, but these methods lack the ability to output the likelihood of predicted futures or interpretability. Recent goal-based methods have gained popularity by first predicting the goal(s) of an agent and then completing the corresponding full trajectory for each goal. However, these methods heavily rely on heuristically defined sparse goal anchors and rule-based algorithms for goal selection, limiting their prediction performance and capturing of fine-grained information. To overcome these limitations, DenseTNT generates dense goal candidates with probabilities from scene context and employs a goal set predictor to produce a final set of trajectory goals, eliminating the need for post-processing. DenseTNT achieves state-of-the-art performance in autonomous driving trajectory prediction tasks, ranking 1st on the Argoverse motion forecasting benchmark and 1st in the 2021 Waymo Open Dataset Motion Prediction Challenge. To tackle the challenge of supervising the model for multi-label prediction, an offline model is devised to provide multi-future pseudo-labels for the online model training. This paper presents the architecture and evaluation results of DenseTNT, highlighting its advantages over existing methods.
