Clustering is a fundamental component of unsupervised learning, involving the grouping of data points based on a specified criterion. However, selecting an appropriate criterion and validating the outcomes can be challenging. Existing unsupervised clustering methods often require a separate model selection criterion to obtain a unique solution. In this paper, we propose a novel approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for hierarchical/agglomerative clustering. Our method leverages a meta-training set with provided cluster labels to learn how to cluster different test sets with varying numbers of identities. We use GNNs to predict the connectivity among test data and merge connected components to form a new graph at each level of the hierarchy. Convergence is determined by the training set, eliminating the need for an arbitrary model selection criterion. Our method achieves improved accuracy in F-score and Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) compared to state-of-the-art GNN-based clustering methods for face and species clustering benchmarks. Additionally, the pseudo-labels generated by our clustering approach can be used for regularization and reduce face verification error. We discuss our contributions, technical innovations, experimental results, and limitations in the following sections.
