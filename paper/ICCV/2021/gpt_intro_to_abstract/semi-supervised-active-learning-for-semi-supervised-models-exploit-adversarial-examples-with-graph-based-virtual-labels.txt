In this paper, we address the problem of limited labeled data in deep learning models for computer vision. We introduce the concept of active learning (AL), which utilizes labeling procedures to improve model performance within a budget-limited annotation setting. However, existing AL algorithms often waste data as they do not consider the potential of semi-supervised learning (SSL). We propose a novel framework called gRaph-basEd VIrtual adVersarial Active Learning (REVIVAL) that combines AL and SSL to achieve mutual enhancement. REVIVAL overcomes the limitations of existing SSL-AL methods and demonstrates significant improvements in model performance, reducing the demand for labeling by up to 10%.
