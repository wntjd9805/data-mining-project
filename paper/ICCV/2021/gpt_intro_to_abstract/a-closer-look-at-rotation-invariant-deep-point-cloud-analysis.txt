This paper focuses on the problem of achieving rotational invariance in high-level applications of point cloud analysis. While point clouds are commonly used as inputs for neural networks, the inconsistency in inferences caused by varying affine transformations remains a challenge. Previous methods have attempted to address this issue through learning optimal poses or handcrafted features, but they are not strictly rotation-invariant and suffer from information loss. Recent works have proposed using PCA-based canonical poses to avoid information loss, but they have not explicitly addressed the ambiguity problem associated with these poses. In this work, the authors analyze the PCA-based canonical poses in detail and study the actual number of ambiguities. They propose a pose selector module for disambiguation and demonstrate through experiments and analysis that accurately identifying ambiguities can lead to significant performance improvements. The contributions of this work include a deeper understanding of the ambiguities in PCA-based canonical poses, the demonstration of the effectiveness of PCA in point cloud analysis, and the proposal of a pose selector for disambiguation.
