Future prediction in traffic scenarios is crucial for path planning and collision avoidance. However, existing prediction methods primarily focus on simple scenarios, where trajectory extrapolation suffices. Safety-critical scenarios involving close-by dynamic obstacles are underrepresented in both training and test data, making it challenging to accurately predict future locations in these cases. In this paper, we address the long-tailed distribution of data in future prediction and propose a novel approach to prioritize rare but important cases. We reshape the feature embedding of the predictor to ensure that challenging scenarios are grouped together, allowing for better prediction accuracy. Our approach is agnostic to network architecture and input modalities and can be easily integrated into existing methods. We evaluate our approach on multiple public datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving prediction quality for challenging scenarios while maintaining performance on simpler cases.
