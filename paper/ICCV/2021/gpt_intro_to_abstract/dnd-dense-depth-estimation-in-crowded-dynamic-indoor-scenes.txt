This paper introduces a novel approach to estimate depth maps using dynamic scenes collected from a moving monocular camera and given sparse depth maps. The method utilizes a 3D model generated by traditional 3D reconstruction algorithms and incorporates two constraints based on optical flow and surface normal to improve the accuracy of the monocular depth estimation network. The benefits of the approach are highlighted through improvements in RMSE on crowded indoor environments, and the method also performs well on diverse indoor datasets. Overall, this paper presents a solution to overcome limitations in depth estimation for crowded indoor environments and demonstrates promising results.
