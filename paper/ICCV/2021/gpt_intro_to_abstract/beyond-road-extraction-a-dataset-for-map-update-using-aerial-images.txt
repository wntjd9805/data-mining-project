Maintaining street map datasets is a labor-intensive and expensive process, leading to interest in automatically updating maps using aerial images. However, current methods focus on road extraction and do not address the challenge of updating existing maps accurately. In this paper, we propose a shift in focus to the map update task and develop a comprehensive dataset, MUNO21, for evaluating map update methods. The dataset includes aerial imagery and map data from 21 cities in the United States, allowing for the capture of the evolution of the physical road network and real street maps over time. We discuss the challenges involved in map update, such as accurately identifying changes in the road network and incorporating complex road topology. To evaluate map update methods, we incorporate 514 real map update scenarios into the dataset, where changes made to the OpenStreetMap are provided and methods are evaluated based on their ability to reproduce these changes. We also propose a semi-automated annotation approach for identifying these scenarios. The dataset is divided into a training set and a testing set, and five state-of-the-art road extraction and map update methods are evaluated on MUNO21. Our evaluation shows that there is room for improvement in accuracy on the map update problem, and we believe that MUNO21 will facilitate advancements in this area. The paper is organized into sections discussing related work, detailing the MUNO21 dataset, describing the annotation approach and evaluation metrics, proposing extensions to existing methods, and presenting the results of the evaluation.
