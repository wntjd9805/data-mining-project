In this paper, we address the issue of bias in machine learning models, focusing specifically on medical and healthcare applications. Flawed datasets, such as those related to Parkinson's Disease, can introduce age bias that hinders the reliability of learned models for disease diagnosis and analysis. Various methods have been proposed to remove dataset bias, including regularization and adversarial learning approaches. However, these methods often neglect the rich cross-sample information, which is crucial for debiasing. To address this limitation, we propose a cross-sample adversarial debiasing (CSAD) method. CSAD explicitly disentangles the target and bias representations, allowing for the utilization of cross-sample and structural information. This is achieved by employing a cross-sample neural mutual information estimator. Our method comprehensively eliminates the correlation between target and bias information from different samples, thereby improving debiasing performance. Additionally, we incorporate the local structural representation using Random Walk with Restart. Our main contributions include: 1) proposing a flexible framework for adversarial debiasing that explicitly disentangles target and bias representation, 2) introducing CSAD, which jointly utilizes cross-sample content and structural features to eliminate bias, and 3) conducting extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the superiority of CSAD over existing methods.
