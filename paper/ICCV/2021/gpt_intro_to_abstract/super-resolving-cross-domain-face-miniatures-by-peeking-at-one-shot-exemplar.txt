Face Super-Resolution (FSR) is the process of reconstructing high-resolution (HR) face images from low-resolution (LR) inputs. FSR is crucial for various computer vision and machine learning tasks, such as face detection, recognition, and photo editing. While FSR has seen success due to generative adversarial networks, previous methods assume that LR images in training and testing are from the same domain. However, in real-world scenarios, there is often a domain gap between the LR images used for training and testing. This results in previous methods failing to accurately upsample HR faces in the target domain. It is inefficient to retrain FSR models for every target domain, so there is a need for efficient adaptation methods using limited samples. In this paper, we propose One-Shot Domain Adaptation for Face Super-Resolution (OSDA-FSR), a method that addresses the challenges of domain gap and limited data by leveraging one-shot exemplar from the target domain. We introduce a novel Domain-Aware Pyramid based Face Super-Resolution network (DAP-FSR) that consists of a domain-aware pyramid encoder and an upsampling decoder. We also propose the Domain-Aware latent Mixing and Model Adaptation algorithm (DAMMA) to adapt the model to the target domain using the one-shot example. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods in super-resolving LR face images across different domains. Our method is a practical solution for cross-domain face super-resolution.
