Deep learning has shown great promise in solving complex tasks, but it often struggles with domain shift, which refers to the difficulty of transferring knowledge from one domain to another. To address this challenge, domain adaptation (DA) approaches aim to map data from different domains onto a common feature space. While most existing DA methods focus on single-source domain datasets, we explore the more challenging problem of Multi-source unsupervised DA (MDA). Previous adversarial MDA approaches have relied on multiple domain discriminators to approximate pairwise domain discrepancies, but we argue that this approach has limitations in terms of information distribution, computational load, and training stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Multi-source Information regularized Adaptation Networks (MIAN). Instead of using multiple pairwise domain discrepancies, MIAN utilizes mutual information regularization to optimize the divergence between source and target domains. We show that MIAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various MDA scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency.
