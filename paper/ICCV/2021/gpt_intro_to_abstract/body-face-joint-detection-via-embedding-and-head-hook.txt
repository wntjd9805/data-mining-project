This paper introduces a novel framework called Body-Face Joint (BFJ) detector for pedestrian detection in computer vision. The accurate localization of individuals in the scene is important for downstream processes such as recognition, re-identification, and tracking. The development of deep learning and convolutional neural networks has significantly improved the detecting performance on general objects and pedestrians. Finding the body and face of a pedestrian jointly is meaningful, but there are three main obstacles: visibility, occlusion, and miss-matching in crowded scenes. To overcome these obstacles, the BFJ detector treats body and face as independent categories and detects them in parallel. Correlations are made from both the appearance and geometry levels using an extra branch for embeddings and the concept of "head hook". The paper proposes an Embedding Matching Loss (EML) and introduces a metric called log-average miss matching rate (mMR-2) to evaluate the quality of body-face association. The BFJ detector outperforms intuitive methods in both cascade mode and position mode. The contributions of this work include the proposal of a joint body-face detection scheme and the investigation of the performance of body-face joint detection. Annotation of face boxes in Crowd-Human and CityPersons datasets is also conducted, creating new benchmarks for joint body-face detection.
