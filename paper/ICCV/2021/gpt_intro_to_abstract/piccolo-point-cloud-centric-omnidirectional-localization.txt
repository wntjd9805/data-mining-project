This paper introduces PICCOLO, a simple and effective omnidirectional localization algorithm for visual localization. The paper addresses the limitations of conventional visual localization methods, such as vulnerability to changes in illumination and local geometric variations. The use of omnidirectional cameras with a 360Â° field of view is proposed as a solution to overcome these limitations. However, the spherical projection equation causes significant visual distortion, making it difficult to apply conventional localization algorithms. PICCOLO addresses this challenge by optimizing a point cloud-centric loss function called sampling loss, which compares color values from the query image with the point cloud color. Unlike image-centric approaches, PICCOLO's point cloud-centric formulation significantly improves performance in omnidirectional localization. The paper also introduces the OmniScenes dataset to demonstrate the practicality of the PICCOLO algorithm, which consistently outperforms previous approaches in various datasets. Overall, PICCOLO is a cost-effective and robust algorithm that can be applied to any scene with 3D maps.
