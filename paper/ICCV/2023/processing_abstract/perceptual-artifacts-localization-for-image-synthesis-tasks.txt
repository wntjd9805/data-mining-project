Recent advancements in deep generative models have fa-cilitated the creation of photo-realistic images across var-ious tasks. However, these generated images often exhibit perceptual artifacts in specific regions, necessitating man-⋆ indicates equal contribution. ♠ work done when Lingzhi is a grad-uate student at University of Pennsylvania. ual correction.In this study, we present a comprehen-sive empirical examination of Perceptual Artifacts Local-ization (PAL) spanning diverse image synthesis endeavors.We introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,168 generated images, each annotated with per-pixel perceptual artifact labels across ten synthesis tasks. A segmentation model, trained on our proposed dataset, effectively localizes arti-facts across a range of tasks. Additionally, we illustrate 1its proficiency in adapting to previously unseen models us-ing minimal training samples. We further propose an in-novative zoom-in inpainting pipeline that seamlessly recti-fies perceptual artifacts in the generated images. Through our experimental analyses, we elucidate several invaluable downstream applications, such as automated artifact recti-fication, non-referential image quality evaluation, and ab-normal region detection in images.
