We consider low-shot counting of arbitrary semantic cat-egories in the image using only few annotated exemplars (few-shot) or no exemplars (no-shot). The standard few-shot pipeline follows extraction of appearance queries from exemplars and matching them with image features to infer the object counts. Existing methods extract queries by fea-ture pooling which neglects the shape information (e.g., size and aspect) and leads to a reduced object localization ac-curacy and count estimates.We propose a Low-shot Object Counting network with iterative prototype Adaptation (LOCA). Our main contribu-tion is the new object prototype extraction module, which iteratively fuses the exemplar shape and appearance infor-mation with image features. The module is easily adapted to zero-shot scenarios, enabling LOCA to cover the en-tire spectrum of low-shot counting problems. LOCA out-performs all recent state-of-the-art methods on FSC147 benchmark by 20-30% in RMSE on one-shot and few-shot and achieves state-of-the-art on zero-shot scenarios, while demonstrating better generalization capabilities. The code and models are available here: https://github. com/djukicn/loca.Figure 1. LOCA injects shape and appearance information into object queries to precisely count objects of various sizes in densely and sparsely populated scenarios.It also extends to a zero-shot scenario and achieves excellent localization and count errors across the entire low-shot spectrum.
