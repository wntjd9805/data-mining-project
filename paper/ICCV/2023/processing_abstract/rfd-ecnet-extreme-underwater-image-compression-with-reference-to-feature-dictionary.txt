Thriving underwater applications demand efficient ex-treme compression technology to realize the transmission of underwater images (UWIs) in very narrow underwater bandwidth. However, existing image compression meth-ods achieve inferior performance on UWIs because they do not consider the characteristics of UWIs: (1) Multifari-ous underwater styles of color shift and distance-dependent clarity, caused by the unique underwater physical imaging; (2) Massive redundancy between different UWIs, caused by the fact that different UWIs contain several common ocean objects, which have plenty of similarities in struc-tures and semantics. To remove redundancy among UWIs, we first construct an exhaustive underwater multi-scale fea-ture dictionary to provide coarse-to-fine reference features for UWI compression. Subsequently, an extreme UWI com-pression network with reference to the feature dictionary (RFD-ECNet)1 is creatively proposed, which utilizes feature match and reference feature variant to significantly remove redundancy among UWIs. To align the multifarious un-derwater styles and improve the accuracy of feature match, an underwater style normalized block (USNB) is proposed, which utilizes underwater physical priors extracted from the underwater physical imaging model to normalize the underwater styles of dictionary features toward the input.Moreover, a reference feature variant module (RFVM) is de-signed to adaptively morph the reference features, improv-ing the similarity between the reference and input features.Experimental results on four UWI datasets show that ourRFD-ECNet is the first work that achieves a significant BD-rate saving of 31% over the most advanced VVC.
