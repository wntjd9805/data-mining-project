Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) enables the agent to navigate to a remote location following the nat-ural language instruction in 3D environments. To repre-sent the previously visited environment, most approaches for VLN implement memory using recurrent states, topolog-ical maps, or top-down semantic maps. In contrast to these approaches, we build the top-down egocentric and dynam-ically growing Grid Memory Map (i.e., GridMM) to struc-ture the visited environment. From a global perspective, his-torical observations are projected into a unified grid map in a top-down view, which can better represent the spatial rela-tions of the environment. From a local perspective, we fur-ther propose an instruction relevance aggregation method to capture fine-grained visual clues in each grid region. Ex-tensive experiments are conducted on both the REVERIE,R2R, SOON datasets in the discrete environments, and theR2R-CE dataset in the continuous environments, showing the superiority of our proposed method.
