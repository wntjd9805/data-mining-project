Knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising approach that facilitates the compact student model to learn dark knowledge from the huge teacher model for better results.Although KD methods are well explored in the 2D detection task, existing approaches are not suitable for 3D monocular detection without considering spatial cues. Motivated by the potential of depth information, we propose a novel dis-tillation framework that validly improves the performance of the student model without extra depth labels. Specif-ically, we Ô¨Årst put forward a perspective-induced feature imitation, which utilizes the perspective principle (the far-ther the smaller) to facilitate the student to imitate more features of farther objects from the teacher model. More-over, we construct a depth-guided matrix by the predicted depth gap of teacher and student to facilitate the model to learn more knowledge of farther objects in prediction level distillation. The proposed method is available for ad-vanced monocular detectors with various backbones, which also brings no extra inference time. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks with diverse set-tings demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art KD methods.
