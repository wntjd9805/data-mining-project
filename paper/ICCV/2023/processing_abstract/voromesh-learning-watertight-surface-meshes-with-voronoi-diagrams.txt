In stark contrast to the case of images, ﬁnding a con-cise, learnable discrete representation of 3D surfaces re-mains a challenge.In particular, while polygon meshes are arguably the most common surface representation used in geometry processing, their irregular and combinatorial structure often make them unsuitable for learning-based applications. In this work, we present VoroMesh, a novel and differentiable Voronoi-based representation of water-tight 3D shape surfaces. From a set of 3D points (called generators) and their associated occupancy, we deﬁne our boundary representation through the Voronoi diagram of the generators as the subset of Voronoi faces whose two associated (equidistant) generators are of opposite occu-pancy: the resulting polygon mesh forms a watertight ap-proximation of the target shape’s boundary. To learn the position of the generators, we propose a novel loss func-tion, dubbed VoroLoss, that minimizes the distance from ground truth surface samples to the closest faces of theVoronoi diagram which does not require an explicit con-struction of the entire Voronoi diagram. A direct optimiza-tion of the Voroloss to obtain generators on the Thingi32 dataset demonstrates the geometric efﬁciency of our repre-sentation compared to axiomatic meshing algorithms and recent learning-based mesh representations. We further useVoroMesh in a learning-based mesh prediction task from input SDF grids on the ABC dataset, and show comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods while guaranteeing closed output surfaces free of self-intersections.
