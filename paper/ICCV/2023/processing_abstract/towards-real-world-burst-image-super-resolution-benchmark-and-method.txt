SR (single image)SR (4 images)SR (8 images)Despite substantial advances, single-image super-resolution (SISR) is always in a dilemma to reconstruct high-quality images with limited information from one in-put image, especially in realistic scenarios. In this paper, we establish a large-scale real-world burst super-resolution dataset, i.e., RealBSR, to explore the faithful reconstruction of image details from multiple frames. Furthermore, we in-troduce a Federated Burst Afﬁnity network (FBAnet) to inves-tigate non-trivial pixel-wise displacements among images un-der real-world image degradation. Speciﬁcally, rather than using pixel-wise alignment, our FBAnet employs a simple homography alignment from a structural geometry aspect and a Federated Afﬁnity Fusion (FAF) strategy to aggre-gate the complementary information among frames. Those fused informative representations are fed to a Transformer-based module of burst representation decoding. Besides, we have conducted extensive experiments on two versions of our datasets, i.e., RealBSR-RAW and RealBSR-RGB. Exper-imental results demonstrate that our FBAnet outperforms existing state-of-the-art burst SR methods and also achieves visually-pleasant SR image predictions with model details.Our dataset, codes, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/yjsunnn/FBANet.
