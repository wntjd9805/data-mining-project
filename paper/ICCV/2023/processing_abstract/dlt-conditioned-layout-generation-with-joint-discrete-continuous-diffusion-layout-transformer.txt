Generating visual layouts is an essential ingredient of graphic design. The ability to condition layout genera-tion on a partial subset of component attributes is criti-cal to real-world applications that involve user interaction.Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated high-quality generative performances in various domains. However, it is unclear how to apply diffusion models to the natural rep-resentation of layouts which consists of a mix of discrete (class) and continuous (location, size) attributes. To ad-dress the conditioning layout generation problem, we in-troduce DLT, a joint discrete-continuous diffusion model.DLT is a transformer-based model which has a flexible con-ditioning mechanism that allows for conditioning on any given subset of all the layout component classes, locations, and sizes. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art gen-erative models on various layout generation datasets with respect to different metrics and conditioning settings. Ad-ditionally, we validate the effectiveness of our proposed conditioning mechanism and the joint continuous-diffusion process. This joint process can be incorporated into a wide range of mixed discrete-continuous generative tasks.More information can be found on our project webpage: https://wix-incubator.github.io/DLTFigure 1: Overview of our Joint Discrete-Continuous diffusion process for layout generation. The diffusion process is applied jointly on both the continuous attributes of the components (size and location) by adding a small Gaussian noise, and on the discrete attributes of the components (class) by adding a noise that adds a mass to the Mask class. The reverse diffusion model can be conditioned on any given subset of the attributes.
