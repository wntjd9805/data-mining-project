Despite the success of StyleGAN in image synthesis, the images it synthesizes are not always perfect and the well-known truncation trick has become a standard post-processing technique for StyleGAN to synthesize high qual-ity images. Although effective, it has long been noted that the truncation trick tends to reduce the diversity of synthe-sized images and unnecessarily sacrifices many distinct im-age features. To address this issue, in this paper, we first delve into the StyleGAN image synthesis mechanism and discover an important phenomenon, namely Feature Pro-liferation, which demonstrates how specific features repro-duce with forward propagation. Then, we show how the occurrence of Feature Proliferation results in StyleGAN im-age artifacts. As an analogy, we refer to it as the “cancer” in StyleGAN from its proliferating and malignant nature.Finally, we propose a novel feature rescaling method that identifies and modulates risky features to mitigate feature proliferation. Thanks to our discovery of Feature Prolif-eration, the proposed feature rescaling method is less de-structive and retains more useful image features than the truncation trick, as it is more fine-grained and works in a lower-level feature space rather than a high-level la-tent space. Experimental results justify the validity of our claims and the effectiveness of the proposed feature rescal-ing method. Our code is available at https:// github.com/ songc42/ Feature-proliferation.
