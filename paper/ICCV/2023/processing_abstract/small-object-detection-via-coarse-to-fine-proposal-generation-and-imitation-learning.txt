The past few years have witnessed the immense success of object detection, while current excellent detectors strug-gle on tackling size-limited instances. Concretely, the well-known challenge of low overlaps between the priors and object regions leads to a constrained sample pool for opti-mization, and the paucity of discriminative information fur-ther aggravates the recognition. To alleviate the aforemen-tioned issues, we propose CFINet, a two-stage framework tailored for small object detection based on the Coarse-to-ﬁne pipeline and Feature Imitation learning. Firstly, we introduce Coarse-to-ﬁne RPN (CRPN) to ensure sufﬁ-cient and high-quality proposals for small objects through the dynamic anchor selection strategy and cascade regres-sion. Then, we equip the conventional detection head with a Feature Imitation (FI) branch to facilitate the re-gion representations of size-limited instances that perplex the model in an imitation manner. Moreover, an auxil-iary imitation loss following supervised contrastive learn-ing paradigm is devised to optimize this branch. When integrated with Faster RCNN, CFINet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale small object detec-tion benchmarks, SODA-D and SODA-A, underscoring its superiority over baseline detector and other mainstream detection approaches.
