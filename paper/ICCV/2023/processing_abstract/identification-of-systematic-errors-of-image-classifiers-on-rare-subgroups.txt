Despite excellent average-case performance of many im-age classifiers, their performance can substantially deteri-orate on semantically coherent subgroups of the data that were under-represented in the training data. These system-atic errors can impact both fairness for demographic mi-nority groups as well as robustness and safety under do-main shift. A major challenge is to identify such subgroups with subpar performance when the subgroups are not anno-tated and their occurrence is very rare. We leverage recent advances in text-to-image models and search in the space of textual descriptions of subgroups (“prompts”) for sub-groups where the target model has low performance on the prompt-conditioned synthesized data. To tackle the expo-nentially growing number of subgroups, we employ combi-natorial testing. We denote this procedure as PROMPTAT-TACK as it can be interpreted as an adversarial attack in a prompt space. We study subgroup coverage and identi-fiability with PROMPTATTACK in a controlled setting and find that it identifies systematic errors with high accuracy.Thereupon, we apply PROMPTATTACK to ImageNet classi-fiers and identify novel systematic errors on rare subgroups.
