3D human pose estimation has been a long-standing challenge in computer vision and graphics, where multi-view methods have significantly progressed but are limited by the tedious calibration processes. Existing multi-view methods are restricted to fixed camera pose and therefore lack generalization ability. This paper presents a novelProbabilistic Triangulation module that can be embedded in a calibrated 3D human pose estimation method, gen-eralizing it to uncalibration scenes. The key idea is to use a probability distribution to model the camera pose and iteratively update the distribution from 2D features instead of using camera pose.Specifically, We main-tain a camera pose distribution and then iteratively up-date this distribution by computing the posterior proba-bility of the camera pose through Monte Carlo sampling.This way, the gradients can be directly back-propagated from the 3D pose estimation to the 2D heatmap, en-abling end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on Hu-man3.6M and CMU Panoptic demonstrate that our method outperforms other uncalibration methods and achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art calibration meth-ods. Thus, our method achieves a trade-off between es-timation accuracy and generalizability. Our code is in https://github.com/bymaths/probabilistic triangulation
