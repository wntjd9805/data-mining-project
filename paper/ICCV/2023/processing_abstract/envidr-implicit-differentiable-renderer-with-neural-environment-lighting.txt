Recent advances in neural rendering have shown great potential for reconstructing scenes from multiview images.However, accurately representing objects with glossy sur-In this faces remains a challenge for existing methods. work, we introduce ENVIDR, a rendering and modeling framework for high-quality rendering and reconstruction of surfaces with challenging specular reflections. To achieve this, we first propose a novel neural renderer with decom-posed rendering components to learn the interaction be-tween surface and environment lighting. This renderer is trained using existing physically based renderers and is de-coupled from actual scene representations. We then pro-pose an SDF-based neural surface model that leverages this learned neural renderer to represent general scenes.Our model additionally synthesizes indirect illuminations caused by inter-reflections from shiny surfaces by marching surface-reflected rays. We demonstrate that our method out-performs state-of-art methods on challenging shiny scenes, providing high-quality rendering of specular reflections while also enabling material editing and scene relighting.
