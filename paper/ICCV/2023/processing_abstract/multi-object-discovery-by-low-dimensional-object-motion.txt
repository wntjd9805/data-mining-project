Recent work in unsupervised multi-object segmentation shows impressive results by predicting motion from a sin-gle image despite the inherent ambiguity in predicting mo-tion without the next image. On the other hand, the set of possible motions for an image can be constrained to a low-dimensional space by considering the scene structure and moving objects in it. We propose to model pixel-wise ge-ometry and object motion to remove ambiguity in recon-structing ﬂow from a single image. Speciﬁcally, we divide the image into coherently moving regions and use depth to construct ﬂow bases that best explain the observed ﬂow in each region. We achieve state-of-the-art results in unsuper-vised multi-object segmentation on synthetic and real-world datasets by modeling the scene structure and object motion.Our evaluation of the predicted depth maps shows reliable performance in monocular depth estimation.
