Instance segmentation on 3D point clouds has been at-tracting increasing attention due to its wide applications, especially in scene understanding areas. However, most ex-isting methods operate on fully annotated data while man-ually preparing ground-truth labels at point-level is very cumbersome and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we propose a novel weakly supervised method RWSeg that only requires labeling one object with one point. With these sparse weak labels, we introduce a unified framework with two branches to propagate semantic and instance informa-tion respectively to unknown regions using self-attention and a cross-graph random walk method. Specifically, we propose a Cross-graph Competing Random Walks (CRW) algorithm that encourages competition among different in-stance graphs to resolve ambiguities in closely placed ob-jects, improving instance assignment accuracy. RWSeg gen-erates high-quality instance-level pseudo labels. Exper-imental results on ScanNet-v2 and S3DIS datasets show that our approach achieves comparable performance with fully-supervised methods and outperforms previous weakly-supervised methods by a substantial margin.
