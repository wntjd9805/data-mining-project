We present Skill Transformer, an approach for solving long-horizon robotic tasks by combining conditional se-quence modeling and skill modularity. Conditioned on ego-centric and proprioceptive observations of a robot, SkillTransformer is trained end-to-end to predict both a high-level skill (e.g., navigation, picking, placing), and a whole-body low-level action (e.g., base and arm motion), using a transformer architecture and demonstration trajectories that solve the full task.It retains the composability and modularity of the overall task through a skill predictor mod-ule while reasoning about low-level actions and avoiding hand-off errors, common in modular approaches. We testSkill Transformer on an embodied rearrangement bench-mark and Ô¨Ånd it performs robust task planning and low-level control in new scenarios, achieving a 2.5x higher suc-cess rate than baselines in hard rearrangement problems.
