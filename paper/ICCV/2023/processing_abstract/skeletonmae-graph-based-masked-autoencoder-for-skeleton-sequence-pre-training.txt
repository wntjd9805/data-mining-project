2D posesSkeleton sequence representation learning has shown great advantages for action recognition due to its promis-ing ability to model human joints and topology. However, the current methods usually require sufﬁcient labeled data for training computationally expensive models. Moreover, these methods ignore how to utilize the ﬁne-grained de-pendencies among different skeleton joints to pre-train an efﬁcient skeleton sequence learning model that can gen-eralize well across different datasets.In this paper, we propose an efﬁcient skeleton sequence learning framework, named Skeleton Sequence Learning (SSL). To comprehen-sively capture the human pose and obtain discriminative skeleton sequence representation, we build an asymmet-ric graph-based encoder-decoder pre-training architecture named SkeletonMAE, which embeds skeleton joint sequence into graph convolutional network and reconstructs the masked skeleton joints and edges based on the prior human topology knowledge. Then, the pre-trained SkeletonMAE encoder is integrated with the Spatial-Temporal Represen-tation Learning (STRL) module to build the SSL frame-work. Extensive experimental results show that our SSL generalizes well across different datasets and outperforms the state-of-the-art self-supervised skeleton-based methods on FineGym, Diving48, NTU 60 and NTU 120 datasets.Moreover, we obtain comparable performance to some fully supervised methods.
