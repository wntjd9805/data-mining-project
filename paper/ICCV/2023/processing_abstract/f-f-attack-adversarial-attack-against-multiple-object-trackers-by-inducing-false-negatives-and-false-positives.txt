Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to build moving tra-jectories for number-agnostic objects. Modern multi-object trackers commonly follow the tracking-by-detection strat-egy. Therefore, fooling detectors can be an effective solution but it usually requires attacks in multiple successive frames, resulting in low efficiency. Attacking association processes improves efficiency but may require model-specific design, leading to poor generalization. In this paper, we propose a novel False negative and False positive attack (F&F attack) mechanism: it perturbs the input image to erase original detections and to inject deceptive false alarms around orig-inal ones while integrating the association attack implic-itly. The mechanism can produce effective identity switches against multi-object trackers by only fooling detectors in a few frames. To demonstrate the flexibility of the mech-anism, we deploy it to three multi-object trackers (Byte-Track, SORT, and CenterTrack) which are enabled by two representative detectors (YOLOX and CenterNet). Compre-hensive experiments on MOT17 and MOT20 datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing attack-ers, revealing the vulnerability of the tracking-by-detection paradigm to detection attacks.
