Multi-person 3D mesh recovery from videos is a critical first step towards automatic perception of group behavior in virtual reality, physical therapy and beyond. However, existing approaches rely on multi-stage paradigms, where the person detection and tracking stages are performed in a multi-person setting, while temporal dynamics are only modeled for one person at a time. Consequently, their per-formance is severely limited by the lack of inter-person in-teractions in the spatial-temporal mesh recovery, as well as by detection and tracking defects. To address these chal-lenges, we propose the Coordinate transFormer (Coord-Former) that directly models multi-person spatial-temporal relations and simultaneously performs multi-mesh recov-ery in an end-to-end manner.Instead of partitioning the feature map into coarse-scale patch-wise tokens, Coord-Former leverages a novel Coordinate-Aware Attention to preserve pixel-level spatial-temporal coordinate informa-tion. Additionally, we propose a simple, yet effective BodyCenter Attention mechanism to fuse position information.Extensive experiments on the 3DPW dataset demonstrate that CoordFormer significantly improves the state-of-the-art, outperforming the previously best results by 4.2%, 8.8% and 4.7% according to the MPJPE, PAMPJPE, and PVE metrics, respectively, while being 40% faster than recent video-based approaches.
