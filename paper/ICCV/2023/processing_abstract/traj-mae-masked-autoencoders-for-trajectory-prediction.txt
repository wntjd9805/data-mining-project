Trajectory prediction has been a crucial task in build-ing a reliable autonomous driving system by anticipat-ing possible dangers. One key issue is to generate con-sistent trajectory predictions without colliding. To over-come the challenge, we propose an efficient masked au-toencoder for trajectory prediction (Traj-MAE) that better represents the complicated behaviors of agents in the driv-ing environment. Specifically, our Traj-MAE employs di-verse masking strategies to pre-train the trajectory encoder and map encoder, allowing for the capture of social and temporal information among agents while leveraging the effect of environment from multiple granularities. To ad-dress the catastrophic forgetting problem that arises when pre-training the network with multiple masking strategies, we introduce a continual pre-training framework, which can help Traj-MAE learn valuable and diverse information from various strategies efficiently. Our experimental results in both multi-agent and single-agent settings demonstrate that Traj-MAE achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art methods and significantly outperforms our base-line model.
