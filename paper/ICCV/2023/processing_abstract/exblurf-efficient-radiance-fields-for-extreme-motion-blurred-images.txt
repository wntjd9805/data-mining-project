We present ExBluRF, a novel view synthesis method for extreme motion blurred images based on efficient radiance fields optimization. Our approach consists of two main components: 6-DOF camera trajectory-based motion blur formulation and voxel-based radiance fields. From ex-tremely blurred images, we optimize the sharp radiance fields by jointly estimating the camera trajectories that gen-erate the blurry images.In training, multiple rays along the camera trajectory are accumulated to reconstruct sin-gle blurry color, which is equivalent to the physical mo-tion blur operation. We minimize the photo-consistency loss on blurred image space and obtain the sharp radi-ance fields with camera trajectories that explain the blur of all images. The joint optimization on the blurred im-age space demands painfully increasing computation and resources proportional to the blur size. Our method solves this problem by replacing the MLP-based framework to low-dimensional 6-DOF camera poses and voxel-based ra-diance fields. Compared with the existing works, our ap-proach restores much sharper 3D scenes from challenging motion blurred views with the order of 10Ã— less training time and GPU memory consumption.
