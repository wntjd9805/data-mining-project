We investigate compositional structures in data embed-dings from pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs).Traditionally, compositionality has been associated with al-gebraic operations on embeddings of words from a pre-existing vocabulary.In contrast, we seek to approxi-mate representations from an encoder as combinations of a smaller set of vectors in the embedding space. These vectors can be seen as “ideal words” for generating con-cepts directly within embedding space of the model. Weﬁrst present a framework for understanding compositional structures from a geometric perspective. We then explain what these compositional structures entail probabilistically in the case of VLM embeddings, providing intuitions for why they arise in practice. Finally, we empirically explore these structures in CLIP’s embeddings and we evaluate their use-fulness for solving different vision-language tasks such as classiﬁcation, debiasing, and retrieval. Our results show that simple linear algebraic operations on embedding vec-tors can be used as compositional and interpretable meth-ods for regulating the behavior of VLMs.
