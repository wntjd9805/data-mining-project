Estimating the 6-DoF pose of a rigid object from a single RGB image is a crucial yet challenging task. Re-cent studies have shown the great potential of dense correspondence-based solutions, yet improvements are still needed to reach practical deployment.In this paper, we propose a novel pose estimation algorithm named Check-erPose, which improves on three main aspects. Firstly,CheckerPose densely samples 3D keypoints from the sur-face of the 3D object and finds their 2D correspondences progressively in the 2D image. Compared to previous so-lutions that conduct dense sampling in the image space, our strategy enables the correspondence searching in a 2D grid (i.e., pixel coordinate). Secondly, for our 3D-to-2D correspondence, we design a compact binary code representation for 2D image locations. This representa-tion not only allows for progressive correspondence refine-ment but also converts the correspondence regression to a more efficient classification problem. Thirdly, we adopt a graph neural network to explicitly model the interac-tions among the sampled 3D keypoints, further boosting the reliability and accuracy of the correspondences. To-gether, these novel components make CheckerPose a strong pose estimation algorithm. When evaluated on the pop-ular Linemod, Linemod-O, and YCB-V object pose esti-mation benchmarks, CheckerPose clearly boosts the accu-racy of correspondence-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performances.
