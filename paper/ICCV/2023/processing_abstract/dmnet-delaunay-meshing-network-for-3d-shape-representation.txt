Recently, there has been a growing interest in learning-based explicit methods due to their ability to respect the original input and preserve details. However, the connec-tivity on complex structures is still difficult to infer due to the limited local shape perception, resulting in artifacts and non-watertight triangles.In this paper, we present a novel learning-based method with Delaunay triangula-tion to achieve high-precision reconstruction. We model the Delaunay triangulation as a dual graph, extract local geometric information from the points, and embed it into the structural representation of Delaunay triangulation in an organic way, benefiting fine-grained details reconstruc-tion. To encourage neighborhood information interaction of edges and nodes in the graph, we introduce a local graph iteration algorithm, which is a variant of graph neural net-work. Moreover, a geometric constraint loss further im-proves the classification of tetrahedrons. Benefiting from our fully local network, a scaling strategy is designed to en-able large-scale reconstruction. Experiments show that our method yields watertight and high-quality meshes. Espe-cially for some thin structures and sharp edges, our method shows better performance than the current state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, it has a strong adaptability to point clouds of different densities.
