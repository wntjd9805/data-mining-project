Ordinal regression refers to classifying object instances into ordinal categories. It has been widely studied in many scenarios, such as medical disease grading and movie rat-ing. Known methods focused only on learning inter-class ordinal relationships, but still incur limitations in distin-guishing adjacent categories thus far.In this paper, we propose a simple sequence prediction framework for or-dinal regression called Ord2Seq, which, for the first time, transforms each ordinal category label into a special la-bel sequence and thus regards an ordinal regression taskIn this way, we de-as a sequence prediction process. compose an ordinal regression task into a series of re-cursive binary classification steps, so as to subtly dis-tinguish adjacent categories. Comprehensive experiments show the effectiveness of distinguishing adjacent categories for performance improvement and our new approach ex-ceeds state-of-the-art performances in four different sce-narios.
