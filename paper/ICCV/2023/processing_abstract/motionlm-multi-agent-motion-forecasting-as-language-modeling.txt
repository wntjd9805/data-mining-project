Reliable forecasting of the future behavior of road agents is a critical component to safe planning in autonomous ve-hicles. Here, we represent continuous trajectories as se-quences of discrete motion tokens and cast multi-agent mo-tion prediction as a language modeling task over this do-main. Our model, MotionLM, provides several advantages:First, it does not require anchors or explicit latent variable optimization to learn multimodal distributions. Instead, we leverage a single standard language modeling objective, maximizing the average log probability over sequence to-kens. Second, our approach bypasses post-hoc interaction heuristics where individual agent trajectory generation is conducted prior to interactive scoring. Instead, MotionLM produces joint distributions over interactive agent futures in a single autoregressive decoding process. In addition, the modelâ€™s sequential factorization enables temporally causal conditional rollouts. The proposed approach establishes new state-of-the-art performance for multi-agent motion prediction on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, ranking 1st on the interactive challenge leaderboard.
