The whole slide image (WSI) classification is often for-mulated as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem.Since the positive tissue is only a small fraction of the gi-gapixel WSI, existing MIL methods intuitively focus on iden-tifying salient instances via attention mechanisms. How-ever, this leads to a bias towards easy-to-classify instances while neglecting hard-to-classify instances. Some litera-ture has revealed that hard examples are beneficial for modeling a discriminative boundary accurately. By ap-plying such an idea at the instance level, we elaborate a novel MIL framework with masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL), which uses a Siamese structure (Teacher-Student) with a consistency constraint to explore the poten-tial hard instances. With several instance masking strate-gies based on attention scores, MHIM-MIL employs a mo-mentum teacher to implicitly mine hard instances for train-ing the student model, which can be any attention-basedMIL model. This counter-intuitive strategy essentially en-ables the student to learn a better discriminating boundary.Moreover, the student is used to update the teacher with an exponential moving average (EMA), which in turn identi-fies new hard instances for subsequent training iterations and stabilizes the optimization. Experimental results on theCAMELYON-16 and TCGA Lung Cancer datasets demon-strate that MHIM-MIL outperforms other latest methods in terms of performance and training cost.
