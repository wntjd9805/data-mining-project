Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a pre-trained model to the target domain in a batch-by-batch manner dur-ing inference. While label distributions often exhibit im-balances in real-world scenarios, most previous TTA ap-proaches typically assume that both source and target do-main datasets have balanced label distribution. Due to the fact that certain classes appear more frequently in certain domains (e.g., buildings in cities, trees in forests), it is natu-ral that the label distribution shifts as the domain changes.However, we discover that the majority of existing TTA methods fail to address the coexistence of covariate and la-bel shifts. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel label shift adapter that can be incorporated into existing TTA ap-proaches to deal with label shifts during the TTA process effectively. Specifically, we estimate the label distribution of the target domain to feed it into the label shift adapter.Subsequently, the label shift adapter produces optimal pa-rameters for target label distribution. By predicting only the parameters for a part of the pre-trained source model, our approach is computationally efficient and can be eas-ily applied, regardless of the model architectures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that integrating our strategy with TTA approaches leads to substantial perfor-mance improvements under the joint presence of label and covariate shifts.
