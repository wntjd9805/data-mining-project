Accurate segmentation of topological tubular structures, is crucial in various such as blood vessels and roads, fields, ensuring accuracy and efficiency in downstream tasks. However, many factors complicate the task, includ-ing thin local structures and variable global morphologies.In this work, we note the specificity of tubular structures and use this knowledge to guide our DSCNet to simultane-ously enhance perception in three stages: feature extrac-tion, feature fusion, and loss constraint. First, we propose a dynamic snake convolution to accurately capture the fea-tures of tubular structures by adaptively focusing on slen-der and tortuous local structures. Subsequently, we pro-pose a multi-view feature fusion strategy to complement the attention to features from multiple perspectives during fea-ture fusion, ensuring the retention of important information from different global morphologies. Finally, a continuity constraint loss function, based on persistent homology, is proposed to constrain the topological continuity of the seg-mentation better. Experiments on 2D and 3D datasets show that our DSCNet provides better accuracy and continuity on the tubular structure segmentation task compared with several methods. Our codes are publicly available1.Figure 1. Challenges. The above figure shows a 3D heart vascular dataset and a 2D remote road dataset. Both datasets aim to extract tubular structures, but this task faces challenges due to fragile local structures and complex global morphology. Motivation. The stan-dard convolutional kernel is intended to extract local features. On this basis, deformable convolutional kernels have been designed to enrich their application and adapt to geometric deformations of different targets. However, due to the aforementioned challenges, it is difficult to focus efficiently on the thin tubular structures.
