Natural image compression has been greatly improved in the deep learning era. However, the compression per-formance will be heavily degraded if the pretrained en-coder is directly applied on screen content image compres-sion. Meanwhile, we observe that parameter-efficient trans-fer learning (PETL) methods have shown great adaptation ability in high-level vision tasks. Therefore, we propose aDec-Adapter, a pioneering entropy-efficient transfer learn-ing module for the decoder to bridge natural image and screen content compression. The adapterâ€™s parameters are learned during encoding and transmitted to the decoder for image-adaptive decoding. Our Dec-Adapter is lightweight, domain-transferable, and architecture-agnostic with gener-alized performance in bridging the two domains. Experi-ments demonstrate that our method outperforms all exist-ing methods by a large margin in terms of BD-rate per-formance on screen content image compression. Specifi-cally, our method achieves over 2 dB gain compared with the baseline when transferred to screen content image com-pression.
