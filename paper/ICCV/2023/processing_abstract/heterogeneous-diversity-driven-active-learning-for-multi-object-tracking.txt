The existing one-stage multi-object tracking (MOT) al-gorithms have achieved satisfactory performance beneﬁt-ing from a large amount of labeled data. However, acquir-ing plenty of laborious annotated frames is not practical in real applications. To reduce the cost of human anno-tations, we propose Heterogeneous Diversity driven ActiveMulti-Object Tracking (HD-AMOT), to infer the most infor-mative frames for any MOT tracker by observing the hetero-geneous cues of samples. HD-AMOT deﬁnes the diversiﬁed informative representation by encoding the geometric and semantic information, and formulates the frame inference strategy as a Markov decision process to learn an optimal sampling policy based on the designed informative repre-sentation. Speciﬁcally, HD-AMOT consists of a diversiﬁed informative representation module as well as an informa-tive frame selection network. The former produces the sig-nal characterizing the diversity and distribution of frames, and the latter receives the signal and conducts multi-frame cooperation to enable batch frame sampling. Extensive ex-periments conducted on the MOT15, MOT17, MOT20, andDancetrack datasets demonstrate the efﬁcacy and effective-ness of HD-AMOT. Experiments show that under 50% bud-get our HD-AMOT can achieve similar or even higher per-formance as fully-supervised learning.
