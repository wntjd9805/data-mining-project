Reverberant EnvironmentAnechoic EnvironmentWe present AdVerb, a novel audio-visual dereverbera-tion framework that uses visual cues in addition to the re-verberant sound to estimate clean audio. Although audio-only dereverberation is a well-studied problem, our ap-proach incorporates the complementary visual modality to perform audio dereverberation. Given an image of the en-vironment where the reverberated sound signal has been recorded, AdVerb employs a novel geometry-aware cross-modal transformer architecture that captures scene geome-try and audio-visual cross-modal relationship to generate a complex ideal ratio mask, which, when applied to the rever-berant audio predicts the clean sound. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive quanti-tative and qualitative evaluations. Our approach signiﬁ-cantly outperforms traditional audio-only and audio-visual baselines on three downstream tasks: speech enhancement, speech recognition, and speaker veriﬁcation, with relative improvements in the range of 18% - 82% on the LibriSpeech test-clean set. We also achieve highly satisfactory RT60 er-ror scores on the AVSpeech dataset.
