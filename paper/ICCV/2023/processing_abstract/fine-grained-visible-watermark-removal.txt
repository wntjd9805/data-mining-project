Visible watermark removal aims to erase the watermark from watermarked image and recover the background im-age, which is a challenging task due to the diverse wa-termarks. Previous works have designed dynamic network to handle various types of watermarks adaptively, but they ignore that even the watermarked region in a single im-age can be divided into multiple local parts with distinct visual appearances.In this work, we advance image-specific dynamic network towards part-specific dynamic network, which discovers multiple local parts within the wa-termarked region and handle them adaptively. Specifically, we propose a query-based multi-task framework, in which part query embeddings are jointly used in two branches to predict part masks and restore watermarked parts. Exten-sive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our fine-grained watermark removal network.
