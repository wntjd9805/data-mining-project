In real-world scenarios, typical visual recognition sys-tems could fail under two major causes, i.e., the misclas-sification between known classes and the excusable misbe-havior on unknown-class images. To tackle these deficien-cies, flexible visual recognition should dynamically predict multiple classes when they are unconfident between choices and reject making predictions when the input is entirely out of the training distribution. Two challenges emerge along with this novel task. First, prediction uncertainty should be separately quantified as confusion depicting inter-class uncertainties and ignorance identifying out-of-distribution samples. Second, both confusion and ignorance should be comparable between samples to enable effective decision-making.In this paper, we propose to model these two sources of uncertainty explicitly with the theory of Subjec-tive Logic. Regarding recognition as an evidence-collecting process, confusion is then defined as conflicting evidence, while ignorance is the absence of evidence. By predictingDirichlet concentration parameters for singletons, compre-hensive subjective opinions, including confusion and igno-rance, could be achieved via further evidence combinations.Through a series of experiments on synthetic data analysis, visual recognition, and open-set detection, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in quantifying two sources of uncertainties and dealing with flexible recognition.
