Shadows often occur when we capture the document with casual equipment, which influences the visual quality and readability of the digital copies. Different from the algo-rithms for natural shadow removal, the algorithms in doc-ument shadow removal need to preserve the details of fonts and figures in high-resolution input. Previous works ig-nore this problem and remove the shadows via approxi-mate attention and small datasets, which might not work in real-world situations. We handle high-resolution doc-ument shadow removal directly via a larger-scale real-world dataset and a carefully-designed frequency-aware network. As for the dataset, we acquire over 7k cou-ples of high-resolution (2462 Ã— 3699) images of real-world documents pairs with various samples under dif-ferent lighting circumstances, which is 10 times larger the net-than existing datasets. work, we decouple the high-resolution images in the fre-quency domain, where the low-frequency details and high-frequency boundaries can be effectively learned via the carefully designed network structure. Powered by our net-work and dataset, the proposed method shows a clearly better performance than previous methods in terms of vi-sual quality and numerical results.
