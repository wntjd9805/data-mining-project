In 3D human action recognition, limited supervised data makes it challenging to fully tap into the modeling poten-tial of powerful networks such as transformers. As a re-sult, researchers have been actively investigating effectiveIn this work, we self-supervised pre-training strategies. show that instead of following the prevalent pretext task to perform masked self-component reconstruction in hu-man joints, explicit contextual motion modeling is key to the success of learning effective feature representation for 3D action recognition. Formally, we propose the MaskedMotion Prediction (MAMP) framework. To be specific, the proposed MAMP takes as input the masked spatio-temporal skeleton sequence and predicts the correspond-ing temporal motion of the masked human joints. Con-sidering the high temporal redundancy of the skeleton se-quence, in our MAMP, the motion information also acts as an empirical semantic richness prior that guide the masking process, promoting better attention to semanti-cally rich temporal regions. Extensive experiments onNTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD datasets show that the proposed MAMP pre-training substantially improves the performance of the adopted vanilla transformer, achiev-ing state-of-the-art results without bells and whistles.
