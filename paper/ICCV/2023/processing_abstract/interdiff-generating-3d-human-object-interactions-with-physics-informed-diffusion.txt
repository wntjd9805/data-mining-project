capable of producing realistic, vivid, and remarkably long-term 3D HOI predictions.This paper addresses a novel task of anticipating 3D human-object interactions (HOIs). Most existing research on HOI synthesis lacks comprehensive whole-body interac-tions with dynamic objects, e.g., often limited to manipulat-ing small or static objects. Our task is significantly more challenging, as it requires modeling dynamic objects with various shapes, capturing whole-body motion, and ensur-ing physically valid interactions. To this end, we proposeInterDiff, a framework comprising two key steps: (i) inter-action diffusion, where we leverage a diffusion model to en-code the distribution of future human-object interactions; (ii) interaction correction, where we introduce a physics-informed predictor to correct denoised HOIs in a diffusion step. Our key insight is to inject prior knowledge that the interactions under reference with respect to contact points follow a simple pattern and are easily predictable. Ex-periments on multiple human-object interaction datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for this task,*Equal contribution.
