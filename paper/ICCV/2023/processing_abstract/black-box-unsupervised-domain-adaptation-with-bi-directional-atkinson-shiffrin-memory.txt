Black-box unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) learns with source predictions of target data without ac-cessing either source data or source models during train-ing, and it has clear superiority in data privacy and flexibil-ity in target network selection. However, the source predic-tions of target data are often noisy and training with them is prone to learning collapses. We propose BiMem, a bi-directional memorization mechanism that learns to remem-ber useful and representative information to correct noisy pseudo labels on the fly, leading to robust black-box UDA that can generalize across different visual recognition tasks.BiMem constructs three types of memory, including sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory, which interact in a bi-directional manner for comprehensive and robust memorization of learnt features. It includes a for-ward memorization flow that identifies and stores useful fea-tures and a backward calibration flow that rectifies featuresâ€™ pseudo labels progressively. Extensive experiments show that BiMem achieves superior domain adaptation perfor-mance consistently across various visual recognition tasks such as image classification, semantic segmentation and ob-ject detection.
