Pose-free neural radiance fields (NeRF) aim to trainNeRF with unposed multi-view images and it has achieved very impressive success in recent years. Most existing works share the pipeline of training a coarse pose estimator with rendered images at first, followed by a joint optimization of estimated poses and neural radiance field. However, as the pose estimator is trained with only rendered im-ages, the pose estimation is usually biased or inaccurate for real images due to the domain gap between real im-ages and rendered images, leading to poor robustness for the pose estimation of real images and further local min-ima in joint optimization. We design IR-NeRF, an innova-tive pose-free NeRF that introduces implicit pose regular-ization to refine pose estimator with unposed real images and improve the robustness of the pose estimation for real images. With a collection of 2D images of a specific scene,IR-NeRF constructs a scene codebook that stores scene fea-tures and captures the scene-specific pose distribution im-plicitly as priors. Thus, the robustness of pose estimation can be promoted with the scene priors according to the ra-tionale that a 2D real image can be well reconstructed from the scene codebook only when its estimated pose lies within the pose distribution. Extensive experiments show that IR-NeRF achieves superior novel view synthesis and outper-forms the state-of-the-art consistently across multiple syn-thetic and real datasets.
