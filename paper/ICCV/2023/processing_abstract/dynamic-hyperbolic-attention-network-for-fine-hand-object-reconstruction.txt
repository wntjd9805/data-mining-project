Reconstructing both objects and hands in 3D from a sin-gle RGB image is complex. Existing methods rely on man-ually defined hand-object constraints in Euclidean space, leading to suboptimal feature learning. Compared with Eu-clidean space, hyperbolic space better preserves the ge-ometric properties of meshes thanks to its exponentially-growing space distance, which amplifies the differences be-In this work, we tween the features based on similarity. propose the first precise hand-object reconstruction method in hyperbolic space, namely Dynamic Hyperbolic AttentionNetwork (DHANet), which leverages intrinsic properties of hyperbolic space to learn representative features. Our method that projects mesh and image features into a unified hyperbolic space includes two modules, i.e. dynamic hy-perbolic graph convolution and image-attention hyperbolic graph convolution. With these two modules, our method learns mesh features with rich geometry-image multi-modal information and models better hand-object interaction. Our method provides a promising alternative for fine hand-object reconstruction in hyperbolic space. Extensive experi-ments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms most state-of-the-art methods.
