This work investigates the use of smooth neural networks for modeling dynamic variations of implicit surfaces un-der the level set equation (LSE). For this, it extends the representation of neural implicit surfaces to the space-timeR3R, which opens up mechanisms for continuous geo-metric transformations. Examples include evolving an ini-tial surface towards general vector ﬁelds, smoothing and sharpening using the mean curvature equation, and inter-polations of initial conditions.⇥The network training considers two constraints. A data term is responsible for ﬁtting the initial condition to the cor-responding time instant, usually R3 0. Then, a LSE term}⇥{ forces the network to approximate the underlying geometric evolution given by the LSE, without any supervision. The network can also be initialized based on previously trained initial conditions, resulting in faster convergence compared to the standard approach.
