t = ˆt t = ˆt + kMultiple object tracking (MOT) is a fundamental compo-nent of perception systems for autonomous driving, and its robustness to unseen conditions is a requirement to avoid life-critical failures. Despite the urge of safety in driving systems, no solution to the MOT adaptation problem to do-main shift in test-time conditions has ever been proposed.However, the nature of a MOT system is manifold - requir-ing object detection and instance association - and adapt-ing all its components is non-trivial. In this paper, we an-alyze the effect of domain shift on appearance-based track-ers, and introduce DARTH, a holistic test-time adaptation framework for MOT. We propose a detection consistency formulation to adapt object detection in a self-supervised fashion, while adapting the instance appearance represen-tations via our novel patch contrastive loss. We evaluate our method on a variety of domain shifts - including sim-to-real, outdoor-to-indoor, indoor-to-outdoor - and substan-tially improve the source model performance on all metrics.Project page: https://www.vis.xyz/pub/darth.
