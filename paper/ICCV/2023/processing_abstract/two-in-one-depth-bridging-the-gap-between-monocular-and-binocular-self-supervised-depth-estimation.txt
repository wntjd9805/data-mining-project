Monocular and binocular self-supervised depth estima-tions are two important and related tasks in computer vi-sion, which aim to predict scene depths from single im-ages and stereo image pairs respectively. In literature, the two tasks are usually tackled separately by two different kinds of models, and binocular models generally fail to pre-dict depth from single images, while the prediction accu-racy of monocular models is generally inferior to binocu-lar models. In this paper, we propose a Two-in-One self-supervised depth estimation network, called TiO-Depth, which could not only compatibly handle the two tasks, but also improve the prediction accuracy. TiO-Depth employs a Siamese architecture and each sub-network of it could be used as a monocular depth estimation model. For binocu-lar depth estimation, a Monocular Feature Matching mod-ule is proposed for incorporating the stereo knowledge be-tween the two images, and the full TiO-Depth is used to predict depths. We also design a multi-stage joint-training strategy for improving the performances of TiO-Depth in both two tasks by combining the relative advantages of them. Experimental results on the KITTI, Cityscapes, andDDAD datasets demonstrate that TiO-Depth outperforms both the monocular and binocular state-of-the-art methods in most cases, and further verify the feasibility of a two-in-one network for monocular and binocular depth estimation.The code is available at https://github.com/ZM-Zhou/TiO-Depth pytorch.
