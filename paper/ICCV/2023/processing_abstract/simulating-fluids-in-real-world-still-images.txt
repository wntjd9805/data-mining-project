realistic results. Code, and dataset are publicly available.In this work, we tackle the problem of real-world fluid animation from a still image. The key of our system is a surface-based layered representation, where the scene is decoupled into a surface fluid layer and an impervi-ous background layer with corresponding transparencies to characterize the composition of the two layers. The ani-mated video can be produced by warping only the surface fluid layer according to the estimation of fluid motions and recombining it with the background.In addition, we in-troduce surface-only fluid simulation, a 2.5D fluid calcula-tion, as a replacement for motion estimation. Specifically, we leverage triangular mesh based on a monocular depth estimator to represent fluid surface layer and simulate the motion with the inspiration of classic physics theory of hy-brid Lagrangian-Eulerian method, along with a learnable network so as to adapt to complex real-world image tex-tures. Extensive experiments indicate our methodâ€™s com-petitive performance for common fluid scenes and better ro-bustness and reasonability under complex transparent fluid scenarios. Moreover, as proposed surface-based layer rep-resentation and surface-only fluid simulation naturally dis-entangle the scene, interactive editing such as adding ob-jects and texture replacing could be easily achieved with*Equal contribution and joint first authorship.
