Semantic scene completion (SSC) requires an accurate understanding of the geometric and semantic relationships between the objects in the 3D scene for reasoning the oc-cluded objects. The popular SSC methods voxelize the 3D objects, allowing the deep 3D convolutional network (3DCNN) to learn the object relationships from the complex scenes. However, the current networks lack the controllable kernels to model the object relationship across multiple views, where appropriate views provide the relevant infor-mation for suggesting the existence of the occluded objects.In this paper, we propose Cross-View Synthesis Trans-former (CVSformer), which consists of Multi-View FeatureSynthesis and Cross-View Transformer for learning cross-view object relationships. In the multi-view feature synthe-sis, we use a set of 3D convolutional kernels rotated dif-ferently to compute the multi-view features for each voxel.In the cross-view transformer, we employ the cross-view fu-sion to comprehensively learn the cross-view relationships, which form useful information for enhancing the features of individual views. We use the enhanced features to predict the geometric occupancies and semantic labels of all vox-els. We evaluate CVSformer on public datasets, where CVS-former yields state-of-the-art results.
