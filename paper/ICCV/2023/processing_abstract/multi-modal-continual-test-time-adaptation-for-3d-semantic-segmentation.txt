The key to MM-CTTA is to adaptively attend to the reliable modality while avoiding catastrophic forgetting during continual domain shifts, which is out of the capability of previous TTA orCTTA methods. To fulﬁll this gap, we propose an MM-CTTA method called Continual Cross-Modal Adaptive Clustering (CoMAC) that addresses this task from two perspectives.On one hand, we propose an adaptive dual-stage mecha-nism to generate reliable cross-modal predictions by attend-ing to the reliable modality based on the class-wise feature-centroid distance in the latent space. On the other hand, to perform test-time adaptation without catastrophic forget-ting, we design class-wise momentum queues that capture conﬁdent target features for adaptation while stochastically restoring pseudo-source features to revisit source knowl-edge. We further introduce two new benchmarks to facilitate the exploration of MM-CTTA in the future. Our experimen-tal results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both benchmarks. Visit our project website at https://sites.google.com/view/mmcotta.
