Understanding how humans use physical contact to inter-act with the world is key to enabling human-centric artificial intelligence. While inferring 3D contact is crucial for mod-eling realistic and physically-plausible human-object inter-actions, existing methods either focus on 2D, consider body joints rather than the surface, use coarse 3D body regions, or do not generalize to in-the-wild images. In contrast, we focus on inferring dense, 3D contact between the full body surface and objects in arbitrary images. To achieve this, we first collect DAMON, a new dataset containing dense vertex-level contact annotations paired with RGB images containing complex human-object and human-scene con-tact. Second, we train DECO, a novel 3D contact detector that uses both body-part-driven and scene-context-driven attention to estimate vertex-level contact on the SMPL body.DECO builds on the insight that human observers recognize contact by reasoning about the contacting body parts, their proximity to scene objects, and the surrounding scene con-* Equal contribution text. We perform extensive evaluations of our detector onDAMON as well as on the RICH and BEHAVE datasets. We significantly outperform existing SOTA methods across all benchmarks. We also show qualitatively that DECO gen-eralizes well to diverse and challenging real-world human interactions in natural images.
