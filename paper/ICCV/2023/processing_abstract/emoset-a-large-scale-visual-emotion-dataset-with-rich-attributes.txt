Visual Emotion Analysis (VEA) aims at predicting peo-ple’s emotional responses to visual stimuli.This is a task in affective computing, promising, yet challenging, which has drawn increasing attention in recent years. Most of the existing work in this area focuses on feature design, while little attention has been paid to dataset construction.In this work, we introduce EmoSet, the ﬁrst large-scale vi-sual emotion dataset annotated with rich attributes, which is superior to existing datasets in four aspects: scale, anno-tation richness, diversity, and data balance. EmoSet com-prises 3.3 million images in total, with 118,102 of these im-ages carefully labeled by human annotators, making it ﬁve times larger than the largest existing dataset. EmoSet in-cludes images from social networks, as well as artistic im-ages, and it is well balanced between different emotion cat-egories. Motivated by psychological studies, in addition to emotion category, each image is also annotated with a set of describable emotion attributes: brightness, colorfulness, scene type, object class, facial expression, and human ac-tion, which can help understand visual emotions in a precise and interpretable way. The relevance of these emotion at-tributes is validated by analyzing the correlations between them and visual emotion, as well as by designing an at-tribute module to help visual emotion recognition.
