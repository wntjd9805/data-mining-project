Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation aims to re-duce labeling costs by training semantic segmentation mod-els using weak supervision, such as image-level class la-bels. However, most approaches struggle to produce ac-curate localization maps and suffer from false predictions in class-related backgrounds (i.e., biased objects), such as detecting a railroad with the train class. Recent methods that remove biased objects require additional supervision for manually identifying biased objects for each problem-atic class and collecting their datasets by reviewing predic-tions, limiting their applicability to the real-world dataset with multiple labels and complex relationships for bias-ing. Following the first observation that biased features can be separated and eliminated by matching biased ob-jects with backgrounds in the same dataset, we propose a fully-automatic/model-agnostic biased removal framework called MARS (Model-Agnostic biased object Removal with-out additional Supervision), which utilizes semantically consistent features of an unsupervised technique to elimi-nate biased objects in pseudo labels. Surprisingly, we show that MARS achieves new state-of-the-art results on two pop-ular benchmarks, PASCAL VOC 2012 (val: 77.7%, test: 77.2%) and MS COCO 2014 (val: 49.4%), by consistently improving the performance of various WSSS models by at least 30% without additional supervision.
