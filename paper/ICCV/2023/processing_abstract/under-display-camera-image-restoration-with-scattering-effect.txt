The under-display camera (UDC) provides consumers with a full-screen visual experience without any obstruc-tion due to notches or punched holes. However, the semi-transparent nature of the display inevitably introduces the severe degradation into UDC images. In this work, we ad-dress the UDC image restoration problem with the speciﬁc consideration of the scattering effect caused by the display.We explicitly model the scattering effect by treating the dis-play as a piece of homogeneous scattering medium. With the physical model of the scattering effect, we improve the image formation pipeline for the image synthesis to con-struct a realistic UDC dataset with ground truths. To sup-press the scattering effect for the eventual UDC image re-covery, a two-branch restoration network is designed. More speciﬁcally, the scattering branch leverages global model-ing capabilities of the channel-wise self-attention to esti-mate parameters of the scattering effect from degraded im-ages. While the image branch exploits the local represen-tation advantage of CNN to recover clear scenes, implicitly guided by the scattering branch. Extensive experiments are conducted on both real-world and synthesized data, demon-strating the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art UDC restoration techniques.
