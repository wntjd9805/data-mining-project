Underwater image instance segmentation is a fundamen-tal and critical step in underwater image analysis and un-derstanding. However, the paucity of general multiclass instance segmentation datasets has impeded the develop-ment of instance segmentation studies for underwater im-ages.In this paper, we propose the first underwater im-age instance segmentation dataset (UIIS), which provides 4628 images for 7 categories with pixel-level annotations.Meanwhile, we also design WaterMask for underwater im-age instance segmentation for the first time.In Water-Mask, we first devise Difference Similarity Graph Atten-tion Module (DSGAT) to recover lost detailed information due to image quality degradation and downsampling to help the network prediction. Then, we propose Multi-levelFeature Refinement Module (MFRM) to predict foreground masks and boundary masks separately by features at differ-ent scales, and guide the network through Boundary MaskStrategy (BMS) with boundary learning loss to provide finer prediction results. Extensive experimental results demon-strates that WaterMask can achieve significant gains of 2.9, 3.8 mAP over Mask R-CNN when using ResNet-50 andResNet-101.
