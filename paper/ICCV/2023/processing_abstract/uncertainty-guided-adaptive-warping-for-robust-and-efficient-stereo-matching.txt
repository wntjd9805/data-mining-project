Correlation based stereo matching has achieved out-standing performance, which pursues cost volume between two feature maps. Unfortunately, current methods with a ﬁxed model do not work uniformly well across various datasets, greatly limiting their real-world applicability.To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a new perspec-tive to dynamically calculate correlation for robust stereo matching. A novel Uncertainty Guided Adaptive Correla-tion (UGAC) module is introduced to robustly adapt the same model for different scenarios. Speciﬁcally, a variance-based uncertainty estimation is employed to adaptively ad-just the sampling area during warping operation. Addition-ally, we improve the traditional non-parametric warping*Work was done while interning at Megvii. † Corresponding authors. with learnable parameters, such that the position-speciﬁc weights can be learned. We show that by empowering the recurrent network with the UGAC module, stereo matching can be exploited more robustly and effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance over the ETH3D, KITTI, and Middle-bury datasets when employing the same ﬁxed model over these datasets without any retraining procedure. To tar-get real-time applications, we further design a lightweight model based on UGAC, which also outperforms other meth-ods over KITTI benchmarks with only 0.6 M parameters.
