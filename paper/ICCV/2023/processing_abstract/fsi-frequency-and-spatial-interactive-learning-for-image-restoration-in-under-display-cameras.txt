Under-display camera (UDC) systems remove the screen notch for bezel-free displays and provide a better interac-tive experience. The main challenge is that the pixel ar-ray of light-emitting diodes used for display diffracts and attenuates the incident light, leading to complex degrada-tion. Existing models eliminate spatial diffraction by maxi-mizing model capacity through complex design and ignore the periodic distribution of diffraction in the frequency do-main, which prevents these approaches from satisfactoryIn this paper, we introduce a new perspective to results. handle various diffraction in UDC images by jointly ex-ploring the feature restoration in the frequency and spa-tial domains, and present a Frequency and Spatial Interac-tive Learning Network (FSI). It consists of a series of well-designed Frequency-Spatial Joint (FSJ) modules for feature learning and a color transform module for color enhance-ment. In particular, in the FSJ module, a frequency learning block uses the Fourier transform to eliminate spectral bias, a spatial learning block uses a multi-distillation structure to supplement the absence of local details, and a dual transfer unit to facilitate the interactive learning between features of different domains. Experimental results demonstrate the su-periority of the proposed FSI over state-of-the-art models, through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations in three widely-used UDC benchmarks.
