Humans are highly adaptable, swiftly switching between different modes to progressively handle different tasks, situ-ations and contexts. In Human-object interaction (HOI) ac-tivities, these modes can be attributed to two mechanisms: (1) the large-scale consistent plan for the whole activity and (2) the small-scale children interactive actions that start and end along the timeline. While neuroscience and cog-nitive science have confirmed this multi-mechanism nature of human behavior, machine modeling approaches for hu-man motion are trailing behind. While attempting to use gradually morphing structures (e.g., graph attention net-works) to model the dynamic HOI patterns, they miss the expeditious and discrete mode-switching nature of the hu-man motion. To bridge that gap, this work proposes to model two concurrent mechanisms that jointly control hu-man motion: the Persistent process that runs continually on the global scale, and the Transient sub-processes that op-erate intermittently on the local context of the human while interacting with objects. These two mechanisms form an interactive Persistent-Transient Duality that synergistically governs the activity sequences. We model this conceptual duality by a parent-child neural network of Persistent andTransient channels with a dedicated neural module for dy-namic mechanism switching. The framework is trialed onHOI motion forecasting. On two rich datasets and a wide variety of settings, the model consistently delivers superior performances, proving its suitability for the challenge.
