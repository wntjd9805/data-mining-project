Synthesizing interaction-involved human motions has been challenging due to the high complexity of 3D environ-ments and the diversity of possible human behaviors within.We present LAMA, Locomotion-Action-MAnipulation, to synthesize natural and plausible long- term human move-ments in complex indoor environments. The key motiva-tion of LAMA is to build a unified framework to encom-pass a series of everyday motions including locomotion, scene interaction, and object manipulation. Unlike existing methods that require motion data “paired” with scanned 3D scenes for supervision, we formulate the problem as a test-time optimization by using human motion capture data only for synthesis. LAMA leverages a reinforcement learning framework coupled with a motion matching al-gorithm for optimization, and further exploits a motion editing framework via manifold learning to cover possi-ble variations in interaction and manipulation. Through-out extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LAMA outperforms previous approaches in synthesizing realistic motions in various challenging scenarios.
