Few-shot classification aims to learn a discriminative feature representation to recognize unseen classes with few labeled support samples. While most few-shot learning methods focus on exploiting the spatial information of im-age samples, frequency representation has also been proven essential in classification tasks.In this paper, we inves-tigate the effect of different frequency components on the few-shot learning tasks. To enhance the performance and generalizability of few-shot methods, we propose a novelFrequency-Guided Few-shot Learning framework (dubbedFGFL), which leverages the task-specific frequency com-ponents to adaptively mask the corresponding image in-formation, with a novel multi-level metric learning strat-egy including a triplet loss among original, masked and un-masked image as well as a contrastive loss between masked and original support and query sets to exploit more dis-criminative information. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks under several few-shot scenarios, i.e., stan-dard, cross-dataset, cross-domain, and coarse-to-fine an-notated classification, are conducted. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that our proposed FGFL scheme can attend to the class-discriminative frequency compo-nents, thus integrating those information towards more ef-fective and generalizable few-shot learning.
