Pseudo-Labeling (PL) is a critical approach in semi-supervised 3D object detection (SSOD). In PL, delicately selected pseudo-labels, generated by the teacher model, are provided for the student model to supervise the semi-supervised detection framework. However, such a paradigm may introduce misclassiﬁed labels or loose localized box predictions, resulting in a sub-optimal solution of detec-tion performance. In this paper, we take PL from a noisy learning perspective: instead of directly applying vanilla pseudo-labels, we design a noise-resistant instance super-vision module for better generalization. Speciﬁcally, we soften the classiﬁcation targets by considering both the quality of pseudo labels and the network learning ability, and convert the regression task into a probabilistic mod-eling problem. Besides, considering that self-supervised learning works in the absence of labels, we incorporate dense pixel-wise feature consistency constraints to elim-inate the negative impact of noisy labels. To this end, we propose NoiseDet, a simple yet effective framework for semi-supervised 3D object detection. Extensive ex-periments on competitive ONCE and Waymo benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms current semi-supervised approaches by a large margin. Notably, ourNoiseDet achieves state-of-the-art performance under var-ious dataset scales on ONCE dataset.For example,NoiseDet improves its NoiseyStudent baseline from 55.5 mAP to 58.0 mAP, and further reaches 60.2 mAP with en-hanced pseudo-label generation.
