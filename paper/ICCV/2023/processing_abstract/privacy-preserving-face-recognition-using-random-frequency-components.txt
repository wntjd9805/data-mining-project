The ubiquitous use of face recognition has sparked in-creasing privacy concerns, as unauthorized access to sensi-tive face images could compromise the information of in-dividuals. This paper presents an in-depth study of the privacy protection of face imagesâ€™ visual information and against recovery. Drawing on the perceptual disparity be-tween humans and models, we propose to conceal visual information by pruning human-perceivable low-frequency components. For impeding recovery, we first elucidate the seeming paradox between reducing model-exploitable in-formation and retaining high recognition accuracy. Based on recent theoretical insights and our observation on model attention, we propose a solution to the dilemma, by advo-cating for the training and inference of recognition mod-els on randomly selected frequency components. We distill our findings into a novel privacy-preserving face recogni-tion method, PartialFace. Extensive experiments demon-strate that PartialFace effectively balances privacy protec-tion goals and recognition accuracy. Code is available at: https://github.com/Tencent/TFace.
