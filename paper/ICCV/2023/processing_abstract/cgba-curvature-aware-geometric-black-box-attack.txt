lack-box a¯ eometric decision-based b¯Decision-based black-box attacks often necessitate a large number of queries to craft an adversarial exam-ple. Moreover, decision-based attacks based on querying boundary points in the estimated normal vector direction often suffer from inefficiency and convergence issues.In urvature-this paper, we propose a novel query-efficient c¯ ttack (CGBA) aware g¯ that conducts boundary search along a semicircular path on a restricted 2D plane to ensure finding a boundary point successfully irrespective of the boundary curvature. While the proposed CGBA attack can work effectively for an ar-bitrary decision boundary, it is particularly efficient in ex-ploiting the low curvature to craft high-quality adversar-ial examples, which is widely seen and experimentally ver-ified in commonly used classifiers under non-targeted at-tacks.In contrast, the decision boundaries often exhibit higher curvature under targeted attacks. Thus, we develop a new query-efficient variant, CGBA-H, that is adapted for the targeted attack. In addition, we further design an algo-rithm to obtain a better initial boundary point at the expense of some extra queries, which considerably enhances the performance of the targeted attack. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed methods against some well-known classifiers on the Ima-geNet and CIFAR10 datasets, demonstrating the superiority of CGBA and CGBA-H over state-of-the-art non-targeted and targeted attacks, respectively.
