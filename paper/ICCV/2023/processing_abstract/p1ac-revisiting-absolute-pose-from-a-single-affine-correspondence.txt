Affine correspondences have traditionally been used to improve feature matching over wide baselines. While recent work has successfully used affine correspondences to solve various relative camera pose estimation problems, less at-tention has been given to their use in absolute pose esti-mation. We introduce the first general solution to the prob-lem of estimating the pose of a calibrated camera given a single observation of an oriented point and an affine cor-respondence. The advantage of our approach (P1AC) is that it requires only a single correspondence, in compar-ison to the traditional point-based approach (P3P), sig-nificantly reducing the combinatorics in robust estimation.P1AC provides a general solution that removes restric-tive assumptions made in prior work and is applicable to large-scale image-based localization. We propose a mini-mal solution to the P1AC problem and evaluate our novel solver on synthetic data, showing its numerical stability and performance under various types of noise. On standard image-based localization benchmarks we show that P1AC achieves more accurate results than the widely used P3P algorithm.
