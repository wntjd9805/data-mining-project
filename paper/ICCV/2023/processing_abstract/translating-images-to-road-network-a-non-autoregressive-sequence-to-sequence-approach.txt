The extraction of road network is essential for the gen-eration of high-definition maps since it enables the pre-cise localization of road landmarks and their interconnec-tions. However, generating road network poses a signif-icant challenge due to the conflicting underlying combi-nation of Euclidean (e.g., road landmarks location) and non-Euclidean (e.g., road topological connectivity) struc-tures. Existing methods struggle to merge the two types of data domains effectively, but few of them address it properly.Instead, our work establishes a unified repre-sentation of both types of data domain by projecting bothEuclidean and non-Euclidean data into an integer series called RoadNet Sequence. Further than modeling an auto-regressive sequence-to-sequence Transformer model to un-derstand RoadNet Sequence, we decouple the dependency of RoadNet Sequence into a mixture of auto-regressive and non-autoregressive dependency. Building on this, our pro-posed non-autoregressive sequence-to-sequence approach leverages non-autoregressive dependencies while fixing the gap towards auto-regressive dependencies, resulting in suc-cess on both efficiency and accuracy. Extensive experiments on nuScenes dataset demonstrate the superiority of Road-Net Sequence representation and the non-autoregressive approach compared to existing state-of-the-art alternatives.
