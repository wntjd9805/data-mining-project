“Search for” or “Navigate to”? When we find a spe-cific object in an unknown environment, the two choices al-ways arise in our subconscious mind. Before we see the target, we search for the target based on prior experience.Once we have seen the target, we can navigate to it by re-membering the target location. However, recent object nav-igation methods consider using object association mostly to enhance the “search for” phase while neglecting the im-portance of the “navigate to” phase. Therefore, this paper proposes a dual adaptive thinking (DAT) method that flexi-bly adjusts thinking strategies in different navigation stages.Dual thinking includes both search thinking according to the object association ability and navigation thinking ac-cording to the target location ability. To make navigation thinking more effective, we design a target-oriented memory graph (TOMG) (which stores historical target information) and a target-aware multi-scale aggregator (TAMSA) (which encodes the relative position of the target). We assess our methods based on the AI2-Thor and RoboTHOR datasets.Compared with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, our ap-proach significantly raises the overall success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL) while enhancing the agent’s performance in the “navigate to” phase.
