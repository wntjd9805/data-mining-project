We present a novel type of neural fields that uses gen-eral radial bases for signal representation. State-of-the-art neural fields typically rely on grid-based representations for storing local neural features and N-dimensional linear ker-nels for interpolating features at continuous query points.The spatial positions of their neural features are fixed on grid nodes and cannot well adapt to target signals. Our method instead builds upon general radial bases with flex-ible kernel position and shape, which have higher spatial adaptivity and can more closely fit target signals. To further improve the channel-wise capacity of radial basis functions, we propose to compose them with multi-frequency sinusoid functions. This technique extends a radial basis to multipleFourier radial bases of different frequency bands without requiring extra parameters, facilitating the representation of details. Moreover, by marrying adaptive radial bases with grid-based ones, our hybrid combination inherits both adaptivity and interpolation smoothness. We carefully de-signed weighting schemes to let radial bases adapt to dif-ferent types of signals effectively. Our experiments on 2D image and 3D signed distance field representation demon-strate the higher accuracy and compactness of our method than prior arts. When applied to neural radiance field re-construction, our method achieves state-of-the-art render-ing quality, with small model size and comparable training speed.
