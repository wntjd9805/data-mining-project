Human Pose Estimation (HPE) is widely used in various fields, including motion analysis, healthcare, and virtual re-ality. However, the great expenses of labeled real-world datasets present a significant challenge for HPE. To over-come this, one approach is to train HPE models on synthetic datasets and then perform domain adaptation (DA) on real-world data. Unfortunately, existing DA methods for HPE neglect data privacy and security by using both source and target data in the adaptation process. source model,To this end, we propose a new task, named source-free domain adaptive HPE, which aims to address the challenges of cross-domain learning of HPE without ac-cess to source data during the adaptation process. We further propose a novel framework that consists of three models: intermediate model, and tar-get model, which explores the task from both source-The source-protect and target-relevant perspectives. protect module preserves source information more effec-tively while resisting noise, and the target-relevant module reduces the sparsity of spatial representations by building a novel spatial probability space, and pose-specific con-trastive learning and information maximization are pro-posed on the basis of this space. Comprehensive experi-ments on several domain adaptive HPE benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches by a considerable margin.
