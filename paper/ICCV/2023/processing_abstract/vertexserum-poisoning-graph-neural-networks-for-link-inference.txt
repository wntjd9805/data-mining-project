Graph neural networks (GNNs) have brought superb performance to various applications utilizing graph struc-tural data, such as social analysis and fraud detection. The graph links, e.g., social relationships and transaction his-tory, are sensitive and valuable information, which raises privacy concerns when using GNNs. To exploit these vul-nerabilities, we propose VertexSerum, a novel graph poi-soning attack that increases the effectiveness of graph link stealing by amplifying the link connectivity leakage. To infer node adjacency more accurately, we propose an at-tention mechanism that can be embedded into the link de-tection network. Our experiments demonstrate that Ver-texSerum signiÔ¨Åcantly outperforms the SOTA link infer-ence attack, improving the AUC scores by an average of 9.8% across four real-world datasets and three differentGNN structures. Furthermore, our experiments reveal the effectiveness of VertexSerum in both black-box and on-line learning settings, further validating its applicability in real-world scenarios.
