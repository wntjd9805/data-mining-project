Weather degraded conditions such as rain, haze, snow, etc. may degrade the performance of most computer vi-sion systems. Therefore, effective restoration of multi-weather degraded images is an essential prerequisite for successful functioning of such systems. The current multi-weather image restoration approaches utilize a model that is trained on a combined dataset consisting of individ-ual images for rainy, snowy, and hazy weather degrada-tions. These methods may face challenges when deal-ing with real-world situations where the images may have multiple, more intricate weather conditions. To address this issue, we propose a domain translation-based uni-In this fied method for multi-weather image restoration. approach, the proposed network learns multiple weather degradations simultaneously, making it immune for real-world conditions. Specifically, we first propose an instance-level domain (weather) translation with multi-attentive fea-ture learning approach to get different weather-degraded variants of the same scenario. Next, the original and translated images are used as input to the proposed novel multi-weather restoration network which utilizes a progres-sive multi-domain deformable alignment (PMDA) with cas-caded multi-head attention (CMA). The proposed PMDA fa-cilitates the restoration network to learn weather-invariant clues effectively. Further, PMDA and respective decoder features are merged via proposed CMA module for restora-tion. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real-world hazy, rainy, and snowy image databases clearly demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-weather image restoration methods.
