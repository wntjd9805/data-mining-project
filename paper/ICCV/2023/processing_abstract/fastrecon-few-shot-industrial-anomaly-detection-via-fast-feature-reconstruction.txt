In industrial anomaly detection, data efficiency and the ability for fast migration across products become the main concerns when developing detection algorithms. Existing methods tend to be data-hungry and work in the one-model-one-category way, which hinders their effectiveness in real-world industrial scenarios. In this paper, we propose a few-shot anomaly detection strategy that works in a low-data regime and can generalize across products at no cost. Given a defective query sample, we propose to utilize a few nor-mal samples as a reference to reconstruct its normal ver-sion, where the final anomaly detection can be achieved by sample alignment. Specifically, we introduce a novel re-gression with distribution regularization to obtain the op-timal transformation from support to query features, which guarantees the reconstruction result shares visual similarity with the query sample and meanwhile maintains the prop-erty of normal samples. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art at both image and pixel-level AUROC performances from 2 to 8-shot scenarios. Besides, with only a limited num-ber of training samples (less than 8 samples), our method reaches competitive performance with vanilla AD methods which are trained with extensive normal samples.
