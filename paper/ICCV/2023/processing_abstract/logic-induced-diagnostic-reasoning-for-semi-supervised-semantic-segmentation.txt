(a) Confidence ThresholdingRecent advances in semi-supervised semantic segmenta-tion have been heavily reliant on pseudo labeling to com-pensate for limited labeled data, disregarding the valuable relational knowledge among semantic concepts. To bridge this gap, we devise LOGICDIAG, a brand new neural-logic semi-supervised learning framework. Our key insight is that conﬂicts within pseudo labels, identiﬁed through sym-bolic knowledge, can serve as strong yet commonly ignored learning signals. LOGICDIAG resolves such conﬂicts via reasoning with logic-induced diagnoses, enabling the re-covery of (potentially) erroneous pseudo labels, ultimately alleviating the notorious error accumulation problem. We showcase the practical application of LOGICDIAG in the data-hungry segmentation scenario, where we formalize the structured abstraction of semantic concepts as a set of logic rules. Extensive experiments on three standard semi-supervised semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of LOGICDIAG. Moreover,LOGICDIAG highlights the promising opportunities arising from the systematic integration of symbolic reasoning into the prevalent statistical, neural learning approaches.
