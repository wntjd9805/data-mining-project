Event-based cameras are ideal for line-based motion es-timation, since they predominantly respond to edges in the scene. However, accurately determining the camera dis-placement based on events continues to be an open prob-lem. This is because line feature extraction and dynamics estimation are tightly coupled when using event cameras, and no precise model is currently available for describing the complex structures generated by lines in the space-time volume of events. We solve this problem by deriving the cor-rect non-linear parametrization of such manifolds, which we term eventails, and demonstrate its application to event-based linear motion estimation, with known rotation from an Inertial Measurement Unit. Using this parametrization, we introduce a novel minimal 5-point solver that jointly es-timates line parameters and linear camera velocity projec-tions, which can be fused into a single, averaged linear ve-locity when considering multiple lines. We demonstrate on both synthetic and real data that our solver generates more stable relative motion estimates than other methods while capturing more inliers than clustering based on spatio-In particular, our method consistently temporal planes. achieves a 100% success rate in estimating linear veloc-ity where existing closed-form solvers only achieve between 23% and 70%. The proposed eventails contribute to a bet-ter understanding of spatio-temporal event-generated ge-ometries and we thus believe it will become a core building block of future event-based motion estimation algorithms.Project page: https://mgaoling.github.io/eventail/
