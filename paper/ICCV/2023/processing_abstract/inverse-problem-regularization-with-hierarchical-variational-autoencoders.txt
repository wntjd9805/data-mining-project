In this paper, we propose to regularize ill-posed inverse problems using a deep hierarchical variational autoencoder (HVAE) as an image prior. The proposed method synthe-sizes the advantages of i) denoiser-based Plug & Play ap-proaches and ii) generative model based approaches to in-verse problems. First, we exploit VAE properties to de-sign an efficient algorithm that benefits from convergence guarantees of Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods. Second, our approach is not restricted to specialized datasets and the proposed PnP-HVAE model is able to solve image restora-tion problems on natural images of any size. Our experi-ments show that the proposed PnP-HVAE method is com-petitive with both SOTA denoiser-based PnP approaches, and other SOTA restoration methods based on genera-tive models.
