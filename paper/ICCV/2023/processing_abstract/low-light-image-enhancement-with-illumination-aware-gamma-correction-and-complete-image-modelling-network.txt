This paper presents a novel network structure with illumination-aware gamma correction and complete image modelling to solve the low-light image enhancement prob-lem. Low-light environments usually lead to less informa-tive large-scale dark areas, directly learning deep repre-sentations from low-light images is insensitive to recover-ing normal illumination. We propose to integrate the ef-fectiveness of gamma correction with the strong modelling capacities of deep networks, which enables the correction factor gamma to be learned in a coarse to elaborate man-ner via adaptively perceiving the deviated illumination. Be-cause exponential operation introduces high computational complexity, we propose to use Taylor Series to approxi-mate gamma correction, accelerating the training and in-ference speed. Dark areas usually occupy large scales in low-light images, common local modelling structures, e.g.,CNN, SwinIR, are thus insufÔ¨Åcient to recover accurate il-lumination across whole low-light images. We propose a novel Transformer block to completely simulate the depen-dencies of all pixels across images via a local-to-global hi-erarchical attention mechanism, so that dark areas could be inferred by borrowing the information from far informa-tive regions in a highly effective manner. Extensive experi-ments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
