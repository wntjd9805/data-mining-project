Unsupervised anomaly detection and localization in im-ages is a challenging problem, leading previous methods to attempt an easier supervised one-class classiﬁcation for-malization. Assuming training images to be realizations of the underlying image distribution, it follows that nomi-nal patches from these realizations will be well associated between and represented across realizations. From this, we propose Inter-Realization Channels (InReaCh), a fully unsupervised method of detecting and localizing anoma-InReaCh extracts high-conﬁdence nominal patches lies. from training data by associating them between realiza-tions into channels, only considering channels with high spans and low spread as nominal. We then create our nominal model from the patches of these channels to test new patches against.InReaCh extracts nominal patches from the MVTec AD dataset with 99.9% precision, then archives 0.968 AUROC in localization and 0.923 AU-ROC in detection with corrupted training data, competitive with current state-of-the-art supervised one-class classiﬁ-cation methods. We test our model up to 40% of training data containing anomalies with negligibly affected perfor-mance. The shift to fully unsupervised training simpliﬁes dataset creation and broadens possible applications. Code: github.com/DeclanMcIntosh/InReaCh
