For monocular RGB-based 3D pose and shape esti-mation, multiple solutions are often feasible due to fac-tors like occlusions and truncations. This work presents a multi-hypothesis probabilistic framework by optimizing the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD) between the data and model distribution. Our formulation reveals a connec-tion between the pose entropy and diversity in the multi-ple hypotheses that has been neglected by previous works.For a comprehensive evaluation, besides the best hypoth-esis (BH) metric, we factor in visibility for evaluating di-versity. Additionally, our framework is label-friendly – it can be learned from only partial 2D keypoints, such as vis-ible keypoints. Experiments on both ambiguous and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method outper-forms other state-of-the-art multi-hypothesis methods.
