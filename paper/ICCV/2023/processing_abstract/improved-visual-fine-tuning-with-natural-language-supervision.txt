Fine-tuning a visual pre-trained model can leverage the semantic information from large-scale pre-training data and mitigate the over-fitting problem on downstream vi-sion tasks with limited training examples. While the prob-lem of catastrophic forgetting in pre-trained backbone has been extensively studied for fine-tuning, its potential bias from the corresponding pre-training task and data, attracts less attention. In this work, we investigate this problem by demonstrating that the obtained classifier after fine-tuning will be close to that induced by the pre-trained model. To reduce the bias in the classifier effectively, we introduce a reference distribution obtained from a fixed text classi-fier, which can help regularize the learned vision classifier.The proposed method, Text Supervised fine-tuning (TeS), is evaluated with diverse pre-trained vision models includ-ing ResNet and ViT, and text encoders including BERT andCLIP, on 11 downstream tasks. The consistent improve-ment with a clear margin over distinct scenarios confirms the effectiveness of our proposal. Code is available at https://github.com/idstcv/TeS.
