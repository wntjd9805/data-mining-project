Face de-identification involves concealing the true iden-tity of a face while retaining other facial characteristics.Current target-generic methods typically disentangle iden-tity features in the latent space, using adversarial training to balance privacy and utility. However, this pattern of-ten leads to a trade-off between privacy and utility, and the latent space remains difficult to explain. To address these issues, we propose IDeudemon, which employs a “divide and conquer” strategy to protect identity and preserve util-ity step by step while maintaining good explainability. InStep I, we obfuscate the 3D disentangled ID code calculated by a parametric NeRF model to protect identity. In Step II, we incorporate visual similarity assistance and train a GAN with adjusted losses to preserve image utility. Thanks to the powerful 3D prior and delicate generative designs, our approach could protect the identity naturally, produce high quality details and is robust to different poses and expres-sions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposedIDeudemon outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.
