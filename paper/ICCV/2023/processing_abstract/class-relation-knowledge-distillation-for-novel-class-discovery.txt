A key challenge lies in transferring the knowledge in the known-class data to the learning of novel classes. Previous methods mainly focus on building a shared representation space for knowledge transfer and often ignore modeling class relations. To ad-dress this, we introduce a class relation representation for the novel classes based on the predicted class distribution of a model trained on known classes. Empirically, we ﬁnd that such class relation becomes less informative during typical discovery training. To prevent such information loss, we propose a novel knowledge distillation framework, which utilizes our class-relation representation to regularize theIn addition, to enable a ﬂexi-learning of novel classes. ble knowledge distillation scheme for each data point in novel classes, we develop a learnable weighting function for the regularization, which adaptively promotes knowl-edge transfer based on the semantic similarity between the novel and known classes. To validate the effectiveness and generalization of our method, we conduct extensive experi-ments on multiple benchmarks, including CIFAR100, Stan-ford Cars, CUB, and FGVC-Aircraft datasets. Our results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the pre-vious state-of-the-art methods by a signiﬁcant margin on almost all benchmarks. Code is available at here.
