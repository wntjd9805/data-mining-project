The realm of graph-based modeling has proven its adaptability across diverse real-world data types. How-ever, its applicability to general computer vision tasks had been limited until the introduction of the Vision Graph Neu-ral Network (ViG). ViG divides input images into patches, conceptualized as nodes, constructing a graph through con-nections to nearest neighbors. Nonetheless, this method of graph construction confines itself to simple pairwise rela-tionships, leading to surplus edges and unwarranted mem-ory and computation expenses. In this paper, we enhanceViG by transcending conventional “pairwise” linkages and harnessing the power of the hypergraph to encapsulate im-age information. Our objective is to encompass more in-tricate inter-patch associations.In both training and in-ference phases, we adeptly establish and update the hy-pergraph structure using the Fuzzy C-Means method, en-suring minimal computational burden. This augmentation yields the Vision HyperGraph Neural Network (ViHGNN).The model’s efficacy is empirically substantiated through its state-of-the-art performance on both image classifica-tion and object detection tasks, courtesy of the hypergraph structure learning module that uncovers higher-order rela-tionships.
