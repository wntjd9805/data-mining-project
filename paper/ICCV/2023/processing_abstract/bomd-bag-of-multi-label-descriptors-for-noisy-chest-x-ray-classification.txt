Deep learning methods have shown outstanding classi-fication accuracy in medical imaging problems, which is largely attributed to the availability of large-scale datasets manually annotated with clean labels. However, given the high cost of such manual annotation, new medical imag-ing classification problems may need to rely on machine-generated noisy labels extracted from radiology reports. In-deed, many Chest X-Ray (CXR) classifiers have been mod-elled from datasets with noisy labels, but their training pro-cedure is in general not robust to noisy-label samples, lead-ing to sub-optimal models. Furthermore, CXR datasets are mostly multi-label, so current multi-class noisy-label learn-ing methods cannot be easily adapted.In this paper, we propose a new method designed for noisy multi-label CXR learning, which detects and smoothly re-labels noisy sam-ples from the dataset to be used in the training of common multi-label classifiers. The proposed method optimises a bag of multi-label descriptors (BoMD) to promote their sim-ilarity with the semantic descriptors produced by language models from multi-label image annotations. Our experi-ments on noisy multi-label training sets and clean testing sets show that our model has state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness in many CXR multi-label classification bench-marks, including a new benchmark that we propose to sys-tematically assess noisy multi-label methods.
