4D temporal exposure datasetAutoexposure (AE) is a critical step applied by camera systems to ensure properly exposed images. While cur-rent AE algorithms are effective in well-lit environments with constant illumination, these algorithms still struggle in environments with bright light sources or scenes with abrupt changes in lighting. A signiÔ¨Åcant hurdle in devel-oping new AE algorithms for challenging environments, es-pecially those with time-varying lighting, is the lack of suit-able image datasets. To address this issue, we have cap-tured a new 4D exposure dataset that provides a large so-lution space (i.e., shutter speed range from 1 500 to 15 sec-onds) over a temporal sequence with moving objects, bright lights, and varying lighting. In addition, we have designed a software platform to allow AE algorithms to be used in a plug-and-play manner with the dataset. Our dataset and associate platform enable repeatable evaluation of differentAE algorithms and provide a much-needed starting point to develop better AE methods. We examine several existing AE strategies using our dataset and show that most users pre-fer a simple saliency method for challenging lighting con-ditions.
