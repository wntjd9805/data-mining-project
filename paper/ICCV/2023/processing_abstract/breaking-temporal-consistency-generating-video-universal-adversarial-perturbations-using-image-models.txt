1. Image model-based optimizationAs video analysis using deep learning models becomes more widespread, the vulnerability of such models to ad-versarial attacks is becoming a pressing concern. In par-ticular, Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) poses a signiﬁcant threat, as a single perturbation can mislead deep learning models on entire datasets. We propose a novel video UAP using image data and image model. This en-ables us to take advantage of the rich image data and im-age model-based studies available for video applications.However, there is a challenge that image models are limited in their ability to analyze the temporal aspects of videos, which is crucial for a successful video attack. To address this challenge, we introduce the Breaking Temporal Con-sistancy (BTC) method, which is the ﬁrst attempt to incor-porate temporal information into video attacks using im-age models. We aim to generate adversarial videos that have opposite patterns to the original. Speciﬁcally, BTC-UAP minimizes the feature similarity between neighboring frames in videos. Our approach is simple but effective at attacking unseen video models. Additionally, it is applica-ble to videos of varying lengths and invariant to temporal shifts. Our approach surpasses existing methods in terms of effectiveness on various datasets, including ImageNet,UCF-101, and Kinetics-400.
