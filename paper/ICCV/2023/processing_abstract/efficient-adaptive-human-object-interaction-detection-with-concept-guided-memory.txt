Human Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to lo-calize and infer the relationships between a human and an object. Arguably, training supervised models for this task from scratch presents challenges due to the perfor-mance drop over rare classes and the high computational cost and time required to handle long-tailed distributions of HOIs in complex HOI scenes in realistic settings. This observation motivates us to design an HOI detector that can be trained even with long-tailed labeled data and can leverage existing knowledge from pre-trained models. In-spired by the powerful generalization ability of the largeVision-Language Models (VLM) on classification and re-trieval tasks, we propose an efficient Adaptive HOI De-tector with Concept-guided Memory (ADA-CM). ADA-CM has two operating modes. The first mode makes it tun-able without learning new parameters in a training-free paradigm. Its second mode incorporates an instance-aware adapter mechanism that can further efficiently boost per-formance if updating a lightweight set of parameters can be afforded. Our proposed method achieves competitive re-sults with state-of-the-art on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets with much less training time. Code can be found at https://github.com/ltttpku/ADA-CM .
