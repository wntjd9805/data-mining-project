The accuracy of the visual tasks for top-view ﬁsheye cameras is limited by the Euclidean geometry for pose-distorted objects in images. In this paper, we demonstrate the analogy between the ﬁsheye model and the Poincar´e ball and that learning the shape of convolution kernels in the Poincar´e Ball can alleviate the spatial distortion prob-lem. In particular, we propose the Deformable Convolution based on the Poincar´e Ball, named DCPB, which conducts the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) in the Poincar´e ball and calculates the geodesic distances to Poincar´e hy-perplanes as the offsets and modulation scalars of the modulated deformable convolution. Besides, we explore an appropriate network structure in the baseline with theDCPB. The DCPB markedly improves the neural network’s performance. Experimental results on the public datasetTHEODORE show that DCPB obtains a higher accuracy, and its efﬁciency demonstrates the potential for using tem-poral information in ﬁsheye videos.
