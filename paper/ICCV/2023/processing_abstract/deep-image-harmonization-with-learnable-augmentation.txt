composite image.The goal of image harmonization is adjusting the fore-ground appearance in a composite image to make the whole image harmonious. To construct paired training images, existing datasets adopt different ways to adjust the illumination statistics of foregrounds of real images to produce synthetic composite images. However, differ-ent datasets have considerable domain gap and the per-formances on small-scale datasets are limited by insuffi-cient training data. In this work, we explore learnable aug-mentation to enrich the illumination diversity of small-scale datasets for better harmonization performance. In particu-lar, our designed SYthetic COmposite Network (SycoNet) takes in a real image with foreground mask and a ran-dom vector to learn suitable color transformation, which is applied to the foreground of this real image to pro-duce a synthetic composite image. Comprehensive exper-iments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed learn-able augmentation for image harmonization. The code of SycoNet is released at https://github.com/bcmi/SycoNet-Adaptive-Image-Harmonization.
