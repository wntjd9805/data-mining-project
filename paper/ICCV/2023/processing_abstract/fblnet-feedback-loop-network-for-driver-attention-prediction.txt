The problem of predicting driver attention from the driv-ing perspective is gaining increasing research focus due to its remarkable significance for autonomous driving and as-sisted driving systems. The driving experience is extremely important for safe driving, a skilled driver is able to effort-lessly predict oncoming danger (before it becomes salient) based on the driving experience and quickly pay attention to the corresponding zones. However, the nonobjective driv-ing experience is difficult to model, so a mechanism simu-lating the driver experience accumulation procedure is ab-sent in existing methods, and the current methods usually follow the technique line of saliency prediction methods to predict driver attention. In this paper, we propose a Feed-Back Loop Network (FBLNet), which attempts to model the driving experience accumulation procedure. By over-and-over iterations, FBLNet generates the incremental knowl-edge that carries rich historically-accumulative and long-term temporal information. The incremental knowledge in our model is like the driving experience of humans. Under the guidance of the incremental knowledge, our model fuses the CNN feature and Transformer feature that are extracted from the input image to predict driver attention. Our model exhibits a solid advantage over existing methods, achieving an outstanding performance improvement on two driver at-tention benchmark datasets.
