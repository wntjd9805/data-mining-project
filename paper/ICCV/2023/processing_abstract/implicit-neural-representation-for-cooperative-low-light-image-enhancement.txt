The following three factors restrict the application of existing low-light image enhancement methods: unpre-dictable brightness degradation and noise, inherent gap be-tween metric-favorable and visual-friendly versions, and the limited paired training data. To address these lim-itations, we propose an implicit Neural Representation method for Cooperative low-light image enhancement, dubbed NeRCo. It robustly recovers perceptual-friendly re-sults in an unsupervised manner. Concretely, NeRCo uni-ﬁes the diverse degradation factors of real-world scenes with a controllable ﬁtting function, leading to better ro-bustness. In addition, for the output results, we introduce semantic-oriented supervision with priors from the pre-trained vision-language model. Instead of merely following reference images, it encourages results to meet subjective expectations, ﬁnding more visual-friendly solutions. Fur-ther, to ease the reliance on paired data and reduce solution space, we develop a dual-closed-loop constrained enhance-ment module. It is trained cooperatively with other afﬁli-ated modules in a self-supervised manner. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness and superior effec-tiveness of our proposed NeRCo.
