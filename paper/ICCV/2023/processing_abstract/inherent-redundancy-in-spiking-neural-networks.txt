Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are well known as a promising energy-efficient alternative to conventional ar-tificial neural networks. Subject to the preconceived im-pression that SNNs are sparse firing, the analysis and opti-mization of inherent redundancy in SNNs have been largely overlooked, thus the potential advantages of spike-based neuromorphic computing in accuracy and energy efficiencyIn this work, we pose and focus on three are interfered. key questions regarding the inherent redundancy in SNNs.We argue that the redundancy is induced by the spatio-temporal invariance of SNNs, which enhances the efficiency of parameter utilization but also invites lots of noise spikes.Further, we analyze the effect of spatio-temporal invari-ance on the spatio-temporal dynamics and spike firing ofSNNs. Then, motivated by these analyses, we propose anAdvance Spatial Attention (ASA) module to harness SNNsâ€™ redundancy, which can adaptively optimize their membrane potential distribution by a pair of individual spatial atten-tion sub-modules. In this way, noise spike features are ac-curately regulated. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly drop the spike fir-ing with better performance than state-of-the-art SNN base-lines.
