To deal with the domain shift between training and test samples, current methods have primarily focused on learn-ing generalizable features during training and ignore the specificity of unseen samples that are also critical during the test. In this paper, we investigate a more challenging task that aims to adapt a trained CNN model to unseen do-mains during the test. To maximumly mine the information in the test data, we propose a unified method called Do-mainAdaptor for the test-time adaptation, which consists of an AdaMixBN module and a Generalized Entropy Mini-mization (GEM) loss. Specifically, AdaMixBN addresses the domain shift by adaptively fusing training and test statis-tics in the normalization layer via a dynamic mixture co-efficient and a statistic transformation operation. To fur-ther enhance the adaptation ability of AdaMixBN, we de-sign a GEM loss that extends the Entropy Minimization loss to better exploit the information in the test data. Extensive experiments show that DomainAdaptor consistently out-performs the state-of-the-art methods on four benchmarks.Furthermore, our method brings more remarkable improve-ment against existing methods on the few-data unseen do-main.
