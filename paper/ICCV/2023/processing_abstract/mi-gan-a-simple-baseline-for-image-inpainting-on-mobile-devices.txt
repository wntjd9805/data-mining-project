In recent years, many deep learning based image in-painting methods have been developed by the research com-munity. Some of those methods have shown impressive im-age completion abilities. Yet, to the best of our knowl-edge, there is no image inpainting model designed to run on mobile devices. In this paper we present a simple im-age inpainting baseline, Mobile Inpainting GAN (MI-GAN), which is approximately one order of magnitude computa-tionally cheaper and smaller than existing state-of-the-art inpainting models, and can be efficiently deployed on mo-bile devices. Excessive quantitative and qualitative eval-uations show that MI-GAN performs comparable or, in some cases, better than recent state-of-the-art approaches.Moreover, we perform a user study comparing MI-GAN re-sults with results from several commercial mobile inpaint-ing applications, which clearly shows the advantage ofMI-GAN in comparison to existing apps. With the pur-pose of high quality and efficient inpainting, we utilize an effective combination of adversarial training, model re-parametrization, and knowledge distillation.
