Faster-RCNN [27]Ground truth detectionsThe goal of this paper is to detect objects by exploit-ing their interrelationships. Contrary to existing methods, which learn objects and relations separately, our key idea is to learn the object-relation distribution jointly. We first propose a novel way of creating a graphical representa-tion of an image from inter-object relation priors and ini-tial class predictions, we call a context-likelihood graph.We then learn the joint distribution with an energy-based modeling technique which allows to sample and refine the context-likelihood graph iteratively for a given image. Our formulation of jointly learning the distribution enables us to generate a more accurate graph representation of an im-age which leads to a better object detection performance.We demonstrate the benefits of our context-likelihood graph formulation and the energy-based graph refinement via ex-periments on the Visual Genome and MS-COCO datasets where we achieve a consistent improvement over object de-tectors like DETR and Faster-RCNN, as well as alternative methods modeling object interrelationships separately. Our method is detector agnostic, end-to-end trainable, and es-pecially beneficial for rare object classes.
