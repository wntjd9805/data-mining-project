TamperedGtMantra-NetSPANMVSS-NetPSCC-NetOursSince image editing methods in real world scenarios cannot be exhausted, generalization is a core challenge for image manipulation detection, which could be severelyIn this paper weakened by semantically related features. we propose SAFL-Net, which constrains a feature extrac-tor to learn semantic-agnostic features by designing spe-ciÔ¨Åc modules with corresponding auxiliary tasks. Applying constraints directly to the features extracted by the encoder helps it learn semantic-agnostic manipulation trace fea-tures, which prevents the biases related to semantic infor-mation within the limited training data and improves gener-alization capabilities. The consistency of auxiliary bound-ary prediction task and original region prediction task is guaranteed by a feature transformation structure. Experi-ments on various public datasets and comparisons in mul-tiple dimensions demonstrate that SAFL-Net is effective for image manipulation detection.
