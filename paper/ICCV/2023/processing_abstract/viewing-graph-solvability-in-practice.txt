We present an advance in understanding the projectiveStructure-from-Motion, focusing in particular on the view-ing graph: such a graph has cameras as nodes and funda-mental matrices as edges. We propose a practical method for testing finite solvability, i.e., whether a viewing graph in-duces a finite number of camera configurations. Our formu-lation uses a significantly smaller number of equations (up to 400Ë†) with respect to previous work. As a result, this is the only method in the literature that can be applied to large viewing graphs coming from real datasets, comprising up to 300K edges. In addition, we develop the first algorithm for identifying maximal finite-solvable components.
