Weakly-supervised temporal action localization (WTAL) is a practical yet challenging task. Due to large-scale datasets, most existing methods use a network pretrained in other datasets to extract features, which are not suitable enough for WTAL. To address this problem, researchers de-sign several modules for feature enhancement, which im-prove the performance of the localization module, espe-cially modeling the temporal relationship between snip-pets. However, all of them omit that ambiguous snippets deliver contradictory information, which would reduce the discriminability of linked snippets. Considering this phe-nomenon, we propose Discriminability-Driven Graph Net-work (DDG-Net), which explicitly models ambiguous snip-pets and discriminative snippets with well-designed connec-tions, preventing the transmission of ambiguous informa-tion and enhancing the discriminability of snippet-level rep-resentations. Additionally, we propose feature consistency loss to prevent the assimilation of features and drive the graph convolution network to generate more discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on THUMOS14 andActivityNet1.2 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness ofDDG-Net, establishing new state-of-the-art results on both datasets.
