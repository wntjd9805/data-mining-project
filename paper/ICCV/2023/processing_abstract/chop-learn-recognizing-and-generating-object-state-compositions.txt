Recognizing and generating object-state compositions has been a challenging task, especially when generalizingIn this paper, we study the task to unseen compositions. of cutting objects in different styles and the resulting object state changes. We propose a new benchmark suite Chop& Learn, to accommodate the needs of learning objects and different cut styles using multiple viewpoints. We also propose a new task of Compositional Image Generation, which can transfer learned cut styles to different objects, by generating novel object-state images. Moreover, we also use the videos for Compositional Action Recognition, and show valuable uses of this dataset for multiple video tasks.Project website: https://chopnlearn.github.io.
