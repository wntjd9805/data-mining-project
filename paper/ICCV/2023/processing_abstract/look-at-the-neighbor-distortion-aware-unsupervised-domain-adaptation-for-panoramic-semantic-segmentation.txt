Endeavors have been recently made to transfer knowl-edge from the labeled pinhole image domain to the unla-beled panoramic image domain via Unsupervised DomainAdaptation (UDA). The aim is to tackle the domain gaps caused by the style disparities and distortion problem from the non-uniformly distributed pixels of equirectangular pro-jection (ERP). Previous works typically focus on transfer-ring knowledge based on geometric priors with specially designed multi-branch network architectures. As a result, considerable computational costs are induced, and mean-while, their generalization abilities are profoundly hindered by the variation of distortion among pixels.In this pa-per, we ﬁnd that the pixels’ neighborhood regions of theERP indeed introduce less distortion. Intuitively, we pro-pose a novel UDA framework that can effectively address the distortion problems for panoramic semantic segmenta-∗Corresponding author. tion. In comparison, our method is simpler, easier to im-plement, and more computationally efﬁcient. Speciﬁcally, we propose distortion-aware attention (DA) capturing the neighboring pixel distribution without using any geomet-ric constraints. Moreover, we propose a class-wise feature aggregation (CFA) module to iteratively update the feature representations with a memory bank. As such, the fea-ture similarity between two domains can be consistently optimized. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance while remark-ably reducing 80% parameters.
