Bias mitigation in image classification has been widely researched, and existing methods have yielded notable re-sults. However, most of these methods implicitly assume that a given image contains only one type of known or un-known bias, failing to consider the complexities of real-world biases. We introduce a more challenging scenario, agnostic biases mitigation, aiming at bias removal regard-less of whether the type of bias or the number of types is unknown in the datasets. To address this difficult task, we present the Partition-and-Debias (PnD) method that uses a mixture of biases-specific experts to implicitly divide the bias space into multiple subspaces and a gating module to find a consensus among experts to achieve debiased classifi-cation. Experiments on both public and constructed bench-marks demonstrated the efficacy of the PnD. Code is avail-able at: https://github.com/Jiaxuan-Li/PnD.
