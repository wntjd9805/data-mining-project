Recovering missing modality is popular in incomplete multimodal learning because it usually benefits downstream tasks. However, the existing methods often directly estimate missing modalities from the observed ones by deep neural networks, lacking consideration of the distribution gap be-tween modalities, resulting in the inconsistency of distri-butions between the recovered and the true data. To mit-igate this issue, in this work, we propose a novel recov-ery paradigm, Distribution-Consistent Modal Recovering (DiCMoR), to transfer the distributions from available modalities to missing modalities, which thus maintains the distribution consistency of recovered data.In particular, we design a class-specific flow based modality recovery method to transform cross-modal distributions on the condi-tion of sample class, which could well predict a distribution-consistent space for missing modality by virtue of the invert-ibility and exact density estimation of normalizing flow. The generated data from the predicted distribution is integrated with available modalities for the task of classification. Ex-periments show that DiCMoR gains superior performances and is more robust than existing state-of-the-art methods under various missing patterns. Visualization results show that the distribution gaps between recovered modalities and missing modalities are mitigated. Codes are released at https://github.com/mdswyz/DiCMoR.
