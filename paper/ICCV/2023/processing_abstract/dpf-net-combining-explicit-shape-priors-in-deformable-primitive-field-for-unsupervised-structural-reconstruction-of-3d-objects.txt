Unsupervised methods for reconstructing structures face significant challenges in capturing the geometric details with consistent structures among diverse shapes of the same category. To address this issue, we present a novel unsuper-vised structural reconstruction method, named DPF-Net, based on a new Deformable Primitive Field (DPF) repre-sentation, which allows for high-quality shape reconstruc-tion using parameterized geometric primitives. We design a two-stage shape reconstruction pipeline which consists of a primitive generation module and a primitive deformation module to approximate the target shape of each part pro-gressively. The primitive generation module estimates the explicit orientation, position, and size parameters of pa-rameterized geometric primitives, while the primitive de-formation module predicts a dense deformation field based on a parameterized primitive field to recover shape details.The strong shape prior encoded in parameterized geometric primitives enables our DPF-Net to extract high-level struc-tures and recover fine-grained shape details consistently.The experimental results on three categories of objects in diverse shapes demonstrate the effectiveness and general-ization ability of our DPF-Net on structural reconstruction and shape segmentation.
