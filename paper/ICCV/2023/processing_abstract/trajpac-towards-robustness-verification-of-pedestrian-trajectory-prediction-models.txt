Robust pedestrian trajectory forecasting is crucial to developing safe autonomous vehicles. Although previous works have studied adversarial robustness in the context of trajectory forecasting, some signiﬁcant issues remain un-In this work, we try to tackle these crucial addressed. problems. Firstly, the previous deﬁnitions of robustness in trajectory prediction are ambiguous. We thus provide formal deﬁnitions for two kinds of robustness, namely la-bel robustness and pure robustness. Secondly, as previous works fail to consider robustness about all points in a dis-turbance interval, we utilise a probably approximately cor-rect (PAC) framework for robustness veriﬁcation. Addition-ally, this framework can not only identify potential coun-terexamples, but also provides interpretable analyses of the original methods. Our approach is applied using a pro-totype tool named TRAJPAC. With TRAJPAC, we evalu-ate the robustness of four state-of-the-art trajectory predic-tion models — Trajectron++, MemoNet, AgentFormer, andMID — on trajectories from ﬁve scenes of the ETH/UCY dataset and scenes of the Stanford Drone Dataset. Using our framework, we also experimentally study various fac-tors that could inﬂuence robustness performance.
