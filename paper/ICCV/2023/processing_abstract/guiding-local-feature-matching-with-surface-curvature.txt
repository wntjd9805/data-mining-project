We propose a new method, called curvature similar-ity extractor (CSE), for improving local feature matching across images. CSE calculates the curvature of the local 3D surface patch for each detected feature point in a viewpoint-invariant manner via fitting quadrics to predicted monocu-lar depth maps. This curvature is then leveraged as an addi-tional signal in feature matching with off-the-shelf matchers like SuperGlue and LoFTR. Additionally, CSE enables end-to-end joint training by connecting the matcher and depth predictor networks. Our experiments demonstrate on large-scale real-world datasets that CSE consistently improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods. Fine-tuning the depth prediction network further enhances the accuracy.The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the ScanNet dataset, showcasing the effectiveness of incor-porating 3D geometric information into feature matching.1
