Visual Prompting (VP) is an emerging and powerful technique that allows sample-efficient adaptation to down-stream tasks by engineering a well-trained frozen source model. In this work, we explore the benefits of VP in con-structing compelling neural network classifiers with dif-ferential privacy (DP). We explore and integrate VP into canonical DP training methods and demonstrate its sim-plicity and efficiency. In particular, we discover that VP in tandem with PATE, a state-of-the-art DP training method that leverages the knowledge transfer from an ensemble of teachers, achieves the state-of-the-art privacy-utility trade-off with minimum expenditure of privacy budget. Moreover, we conduct additional experiments on cross-domain image classification with a sufficient domain gap to further unveil the advantage of VP in DP. Lastly, we also conduct exten-sive ablation studies to validate the effectiveness and contri-bution of VP under DP consideration. Our code is available at https://github.com/EzzzLi/Prompt-PATE.
