Recently, neural implicit surfaces have become popular for multi-view reconstruction. To facilitate practical appli-cations like scene editing and manipulation, some works extend the framework with semantic masks input for the object-compositional reconstruction rather than the holis-tic perspective. Though achieving plausible disentangle-ment, the performance drops significantly when process-ing the indoor scenes where objects are usually partially observed. We propose RICO to address this by regular-izing the unobservable regions for indoor compositional reconstruction. Our key idea is to first regularize the smoothness of the occluded background, which then in turn guides the foreground object reconstruction in unob-servable regions based on the object-background relation-ship. Particularly, we regularize the geometry smooth-ness of occluded background patches. With the improved background surface, the signed distance function and the reversedly rendered depth of objects can be optimized to bound them within the background range. Extensive experi-ments show our method outperforms other methods on syn-thetic and real-world indoor scenes and prove the effective-ness of proposed regularizations.
