Unsupervised learning of 3D-aware generative adver-sarial networks has lately made much progress. Some re-cent work demonstrates promising results of learning hu-man generative models using neural articulated radiance fields, yet their generalization ability and controllability lag behind parametric human models, i.e., they do not perform well when generalizing to novel pose/shape and are not part controllable. To solve these problems, we propose VeRi3D, a generative human vertex-based radiance field parameter-ized by vertices of the parametric human template, SMPL.*Corresponding authors.We map each 3D point to the local coordinate system de-fined on its neighboring vertices, and use the corresponding vertex feature and local coordinates for mapping it to color and density values. We demonstrate that our simple ap-proach allows for generating photorealistic human images with free control over camera pose, human pose, shape, as well as enabling part-level editing.
