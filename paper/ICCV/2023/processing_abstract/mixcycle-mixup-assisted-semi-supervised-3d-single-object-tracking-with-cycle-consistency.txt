3D single object tracking (SOT) is an indispensable part of automated driving. Existing approaches rely heavily on large, densely labeled datasets. However, annotating point clouds is both costly and time-consuming. Inspired by the great success of cycle tracking in unsupervised 2D SOT, we introduce the first semi-supervised approach to 3D SOT.Specifically, we introduce two cycle-consistency strategies for supervision: 1) Self tracking cycles, which leverage la-bels to help the model converge better in the early stages of training; 2) forward-backward cycles, which strengthen the tracker’s robustness to motion variations and the tem-plate noise caused by the template update strategy. Further-more, we propose a data augmentation strategy named SOT-Mixup to improve the tracker’s robustness to point cloud diversity. SOTMixup generates training samples by sam-pling points in two point clouds with a mixing rate and as-signs a reasonable loss weight for training according to the mixing rate. The resulting MixCycle approach gen-eralizes to appearance matching-based trackers. On theKITTI benchmark, based on the P2B tracker [16], Mix-Cycle trained with 10% labels outperforms P2B trained with 100% labels, and achieves a 28.4% precision improve-ment when using 1% labels.
