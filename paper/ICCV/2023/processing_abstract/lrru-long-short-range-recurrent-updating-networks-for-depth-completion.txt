Existing deep learning-based depth completion meth-ods generally employ massive stacked layers to predict the dense depth map from sparse input data. Although such approaches greatly advance this task, their accompa-nied huge computational complexity hinders their practical applications. To accomplish depth completion more effi-ciently, we propose a novel lightweight deep network frame-work, the Long-short Range Recurrent Updating (LRRU) network. Without learning complex feature representa-tions, LRRU first roughly fills the sparse input to obtain an initial dense depth map, and then iteratively updates it through learned spatially-variant kernels. Our itera-tive update process is content-adaptive and highly flexi-ble, where the kernel weights are learned by jointly con-sidering the guidance RGB images and the depth map to be updated, and large-to-small kernel scopes are dynam-ically adjusted to capture long-to-short range dependen-cies. Our initial depth map has coarse but complete scene depth information, which helps relieve the burden of di-rectly regressing the dense depth from sparse ones, while our proposed method can effectively refine it to an ac-curate depth map with less learnable parameters and in-ference time. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed LRRU variants achieve state-of-the-art perfor-In particular, mance across different parameter regimes. the LRRU-Base model outperforms competing approaches on the NYUv2 dataset, and ranks 1st on the KITTI depth completion benchmark at the time of submission.
