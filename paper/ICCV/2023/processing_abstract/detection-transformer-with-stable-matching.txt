This paper is concerned with the matching stability prob-lem across different decoder layers in DEtection TRans-formers (DETR). We point out that the unstable matching in DETR is caused by a multi-optimization path problem, which is highlighted by the one-to-one matching design inDETR. To address this problem, we show that the most im-portant design is to use and only use positional metrics (likeIOU) to supervise classification scores of positive examples.Under the principle, we propose two simple yet effective modifications by integrating positional metrics to DETR’s classification loss and matching cost, named position-supervised loss and position-modulated cost. We verify our methods on several DETR variants. Our methods show con-sistent improvements over baselines. By integrating our methods with DINO, we achieve 50.4 and 51.5 AP on theCOCO detection benchmark using ResNet-50 backbones under 1× (12 epochs) and 2× (24 epochs) training settings, achieving a new record under the same setting. We achieve 63.8 AP on COCO detection test-dev with a Swin-Large backbone. Our code will be made available at https:// github.com/IDEA-Research/Stable-DINO.
