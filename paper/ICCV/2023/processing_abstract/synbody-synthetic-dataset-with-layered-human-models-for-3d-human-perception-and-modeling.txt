Synthetic data has emerged as a promising source for 3D human research as it offers low-cost access to large-scale human datasets. To advance the diversity and anno-tation quality of human models, we introduce a new syn-thetic dataset, SynBody, with three appealing features: 1) a clothed parametric human model that can generate a di-verse range of subjects; 2) the layered human represen-tation that naturally offers high-quality 3D annotations to support multiple tasks; 3) a scalable system for produc-ing realistic data to facilitate real-world tasks. The dataset comprises 1.2M images with corresponding accurate 3D annotations, covering 10,000 human body models, 1,187 actions, and various viewpoints. The dataset includes two subsets for human pose and shape estimation as well as human neural rendering. Extensive experiments on Syn-Body indicate that it substantially enhances both SMPL andSMPL-X estimation. Furthermore, the incorporation of lay-ered annotations offers a valuable training resource for in-vestigating the Human Neural Radiance Fields(NeRF).
