Because of the diversity in lighting environments, ex-isting illumination estimation techniques have been de-signed explicitly on indoor or outdoor environments. Meth-ods have focused specifically on capturing accurate energy (e.g., through parametric lighting models), which empha-sizes shading and strong cast shadows; or producing plau-sible texture (e.g., with GANs), which prioritizes plausible reflections. Approaches which provide editable lighting ca-pabilities have been proposed, but these tend to be with simplified lighting models, offering limited realism. In this work, we propose to bridge the gap between these recent trends in the literature, and propose a method which com-bines a parametric light model with 360â—¦ panoramas, ready*Research partly done when Mohammad Reza was an intern at Adobe. to use as HDRI in rendering engines. We leverage recent advances in GAN-based LDR panorama extrapolation from a regular image, which we extend to HDR using parametric spherical gaussians. To achieve this, we introduce a novel lighting co-modulation method that injects lighting-related features throughout the generator, tightly coupling the orig-inal or edited scene illumination within the panorama gen-eration process.In our representation, users can easily edit light direction, intensity, number, etc. to impact shad-ing while providing rich, complex reflections while seam-lessly blending with the edits. Furthermore, our method en-compasses indoor and outdoor environments, demonstrat-ing state-of-the-art results even when compared to domain-specific methods.
