Panoptic segmentation methods assign a known class to each pixel given in input. Even for state-of-the-art ap-proaches, this inevitably enforces decisions that system-atically lead to wrong predictions for objects outside the training categories. However, robustness against out-of-distribution samples and corner cases is crucial in safety-critical settings to avoid dangerous consequences. Since real-world datasets cannot contain enough data points to adequately sample the long tail of the underlying distri-bution, models must be able to deal with unseen and un-known scenarios as well. Previous methods targeted this by re-identifying already-seen unlabeled objects.In this work, we propose the necessary step to extend segmenta-tion with a new setting which we term holistic segmen-tation. Holistic segmentation aims to identify and sepa-rate objects of unseen, unknown categories into instances without any prior knowledge about them while performing panoptic segmentation of known classes. We tackle this new problem with U3HS, which finds unknowns as highly un-certain regions and clusters their corresponding instance-aware embeddings into individual objects. By doing so, for the first time in panoptic segmentation with unknown objects, our U3HS is trained without unknown categories, reducing assumptions and leaving the settings as uncon-strained as in real-life scenarios. Extensive experiments on public data from MS COCO, Cityscapes, and Lost&Found demonstrate the effectiveness of U3HS for this new, chal-lenging, and assumptions-free setting called holistic seg-mentation.
