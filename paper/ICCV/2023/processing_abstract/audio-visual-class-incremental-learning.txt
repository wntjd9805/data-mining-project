incrementalIn this paper, we introduce audio-visual tasks can be forgotten as leading to poor performance. learning, but current methods fail class-incremental learning, a class-incremental learning sce-nario for audio-visual video recognition. We demon-strate that joint audio-visual modeling can improve class-incremental to pre-serve semantic similarity between audio and visual fea-tures as incremental step grows.Furthermore, we observe that audio-visual correlations learned in pre-vious steps progress,To overcome these challenges, we propose AV-CIL, which incorpo-rates Dual-Audio-Visual Similarity Constraint (D-AVSC) to maintain both instance-aware and class-aware seman-tic similarity between audio-visual modalities and Vi-sual Attention Distillation (VAD) to retain previously learned audio-guided visual attentive ability. We create three audio-visual class-incremental datasets, AVE-Class-Incremental (AVE-CI), Kinetics-Sounds-Class-Incremental (K-S-CI), and VGGSound100-Class-Incremental (VS100-CI) based on the AVE, Kinetics-Sounds, and VGGSound datasets, respectively. Our experiments on AVE-CI, K-S-CI, and VS100-CI demonstrate that AV-CIL significantly outperforms existing class-incremental learning methods in audio-visual class-incremental learning.
