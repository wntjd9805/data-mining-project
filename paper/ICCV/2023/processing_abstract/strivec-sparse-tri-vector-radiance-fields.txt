We propose Strivec, a novel neural representation that models a 3D scene as a radiance field with sparsely dis-tributed and compactly factorized local tensor feature grids.Our approach leverages tensor decomposition, following the recent work TensoRF [6], to model the tensor grids. In contrast to TensoRF which uses a global tensor and focuses on their vector-matrix decomposition, we propose to uti-lize a cloud of local tensors and apply the classic CANDE-COMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition [4] to factorize each tensor into triple vectors that express local feature distribu-tions along spatial axes and compactly encode a local neu-ral field. We also apply multi-scale tensor grids to discover the geometry and appearance commonalities and exploit spatial coherence with the tri-vector factorization at mul-tiple local scales. The final radiance field properties are re-gressed by aggregating neural features from multiple local tensors across all scales. Our tri-vector tensors are sparsely distributed around the actual scene surface, discovered by a fast coarse reconstruction, leveraging the sparsity of a 3D scene. We demonstrate that our model can achieve better rendering quality while using significantly fewer parame-ters than previous methods, including TensoRF and Instant-NGP [23].
