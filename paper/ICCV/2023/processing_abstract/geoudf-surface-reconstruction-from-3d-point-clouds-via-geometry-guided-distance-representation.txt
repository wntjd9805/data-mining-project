We present a learning-based method, namely GeoUDF, to tackle the long-standing and challenging problem of re-constructing a discrete surface from a sparse point cloud.To be specific, we propose a geometry-guided learning method for UDF and its gradient estimation that explic-itly formulates the unsigned distance of a query point as the learnable affine averaging of its distances to the tan-gent planes of neighboring points on the surface. Besides, we model the local geometric structure of the input point clouds by explicitly learning a quadratic polynomial for each point. This not only facilitates upsampling the in-put sparse point cloud but also naturally induces unori-ented normal, which further augments UDF estimation. Fi-nally, to extract triangle meshes from the predicted UDF we propose a customized edge-based marching cube mod-ule. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation stud-ies to demonstrate the significant advantages of our method over state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction ac-curacy, efficiency, and generality.
