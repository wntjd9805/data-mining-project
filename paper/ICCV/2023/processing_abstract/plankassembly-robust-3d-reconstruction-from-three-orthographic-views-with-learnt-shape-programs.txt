FrontTopSideIn this paper, we develop a new method to automat-ically convert 2D line drawings from three orthographic views into 3D CAD models. Existing methods for this prob-lem reconstruct 3D models by back-projecting the 2D ob-servations into 3D space while maintaining explicit cor-respondence between the input and output. Such methods are sensitive to errors and noises in the input, thus often fail in practice where the input drawings created by hu-man designers are imperfect. To overcome this difficulty, we leverage the attention mechanism in a Transformer-based sequence generation model to learn flexible mappings be-tween the input and output. Further, we design shape pro-grams which are suitable for generating the objects of inter-est to boost the reconstruction accuracy and facilitate CAD modeling applications. Experiments on a new benchmark dataset show that our method significantly outperforms ex-isting ones when the inputs are noisy or incomplete.
