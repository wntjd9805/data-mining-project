Extracting and using class-discriminative features is critical for fine-grained recognition. Existing works have demonstrated the possibility of applying deep CNNs to ex-ploit features that distinguish similar classes. However,CNNs suffer from problems including frequency bias and loss of detailed local information, which restricts the perfor-mance of recognizing fine-grained categories. To address the challenge, we propose a novel texture branch as com-plimentary to the CNN branch for feature extraction. We innovatively utilize Gabor filters as a powerful extractor to exploit texture features, motivated by the capability of Ga-bor filters in effectively capturing multi-frequency features and detailed local information. We implement several de-signs to enhance the effectiveness of Gabor filters, includ-ing imposing constraints on parameter values and develop-ing a learning method to determine the optimal parameters.Moreover, we introduce a statistical feature extractor to uti-lize informative statistical information from the signals cap-tured by Gabor filters, and a gate selection mechanism to enable efficient computation by only considering qualified regions as input for texture extraction. Through the integra-tion of features from the Gabor-filter-based texture branch and CNN-based semantic branch, we achieve comprehen-sive information extraction. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on multiple datasets, including CUB-200-2011,NA-bird, Stanford Dogs, and GTOS-mobile. State-of-the-art performance is achieved using our approach.
