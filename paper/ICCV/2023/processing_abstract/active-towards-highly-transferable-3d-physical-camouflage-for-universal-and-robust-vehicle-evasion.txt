Adversarial camouflage has garnered attention for its ability to attack object detectors from any viewpoint by cov-ering the entire objectâ€™s surface. However, universality and robustness in existing methods often fall short as the trans-ferability aspect is often overlooked, thus restricting their application only to a specific target with limited perfor-mance. To address these challenges, we present Adversar-ial Camouflage for Transferable and Intensive Vehicle Eva-sion (ACTIVE), a state-of-the-art physical camouflage at-tack framework designed to generate universal and robust adversarial camouflage capable of concealing any 3D vehi-cle from detectors. Our framework incorporates innovative techniques to enhance universality and robustness, includ-ing a refined texture rendering that enables common texture application to different vehicles without being constrained to a specific texture map, a novel stealth loss that renders the vehicle undetectable, and a smooth and camouflage loss to enhance the naturalness of the adversarial camouflage.Our extensive experiments on 15 different models show thatACTIVE consistently outperforms existing works on various public detectors, including the latest YOLOv7. Notably, our universality evaluations reveal promising transferability to other vehicle classes, tasks (segmentation models), and the real world, not just other vehicles.
