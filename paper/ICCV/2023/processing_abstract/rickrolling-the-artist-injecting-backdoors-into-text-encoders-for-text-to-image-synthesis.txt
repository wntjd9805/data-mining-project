While text-to-image synthesis currently enjoys great pop-ularity among researchers and the general public, the se-curity of these models has been neglected so far. Many text-guided image generation models rely on pre-trained text encoders from external sources, and their users trust that the retrieved models will behave as promised. Unfor-tunately, this might not be the case. We introduce backdoor attacks against text-guided generative models and demon-strate that their text encoders pose a major tampering risk.Our attacks only slightly alter an encoder so that no sus-picious model behavior is apparent for image generations with clean prompts. By then inserting a single charac-ter trigger into the prompt, e.g., a non-Latin character or emoji, the adversary can trigger the model to either gener-ate images with pre-defined attributes or images following a hidden, potentially malicious description. We empirically demonstrate the high effectiveness of our attacks on StableDiffusion and highlight that the injection process of a single backdoor takes less than two minutes. Besides phrasing our approach solely as an attack, it can also force an encoder to forget phrases related to certain concepts, such as nu-dity or violence, and help to make image generation safer.Our source code is available at https://github.com/LukasStruppek/Rickrolling-the-Artist.
