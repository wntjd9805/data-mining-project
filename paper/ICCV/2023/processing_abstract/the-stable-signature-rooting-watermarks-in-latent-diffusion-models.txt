Generative image modeling enables a wide range of ap-plications but raises ethical concerns about responsible de-ployment. We introduce an active content tracing method combining image watermarking and Latent Diffusion Mod-els. The goal is for all generated images to conceal an invis-ible watermark allowing for future detection and/or identi-fication. The method quickly fine-tunes the latent decoder of the image generator, conditioned on a binary signature.A pre-trained watermark extractor recovers the hidden sig-nature from any generated image and a statistical test then determines whether it comes from the generative model. We evaluate the invisibility and robustness of the watermarks on a variety of generation tasks, showing that the StableSignature is robust to image modifications. For instance, it detects the origin of an image generated from a text prompt, then cropped to keep 10% of the content, with 90+% accu-racy at a false positive rate below 10âˆ’6.
