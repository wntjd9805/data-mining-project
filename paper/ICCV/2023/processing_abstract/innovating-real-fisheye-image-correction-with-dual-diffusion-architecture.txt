Fisheye image rectiﬁcation is hindered by synthetic mod-els producing poor results for real-world correction. To ad-dress this, we propose a Dual Diffusion Architecture (DDA) for ﬁsheye rectiﬁcation that offers better practicality. TheDDA leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model-s (DDPMs) to gradually introduce bidirectional noise, al-lowing the synthesized and real images to develop into a consistent noise distribution. As a result, our network can perceive the distribution of unlabelled real ﬁsheye images without relying on a transfer network, thus improving the performance of real ﬁsheye correction. Additionally, we design an unsupervised one-pass network that generates a plausible new condition to strengthen guidance and address the non-negligible indeterminacy between the prior condi-tion and the target. It can signiﬁcantly affect the rectiﬁca-tion task, especially in cases where radial distortion causes signiﬁcant artifacts. This network can be regarded as an alternate scheme for fast producing reliable results without iterative inference. Compared to the state-of-the-art meth-ods, our approach achieves superior performance in both synthetic and real ﬁsheye image corrections.
