This paper introduces an end-to-end residual network that operates entirely on the Poincar´e ball model of hyper-bolic space. Hyperbolic learning has recently shown great potential for visual understanding, but is currently only per-formed in the penultimate layer(s) of deep networks. All visual representations are still learned through standardEuclidean networks.In this paper we investigate how to learn hyperbolic representations of visual data directly from the pixel-level. We propose Poincar´e ResNet, a hyperbolic counterpart of the celebrated residual network, starting from Poincar´e 2D convolutions up to Poincar´e residual con-nections. We identify three roadblocks for training convolu-tional networks entirely in hyperbolic space and propose a solution for each: (i) Current hyperbolic network initial-izations collapse to the origin, limiting their applicability in deeper networks. We provide an identity-based initial-ization that preserves norms over many layers. (ii) Resid-ual networks rely heavily on batch normalization, which comes with expensive Fr´echet mean calculations in hyper-bolic space. We introduce Poincar´e midpoint batch normal-ization as a faster and equally effective alternative. (iii) Due to the many intermediate operations in Poincar´e layers, the computation graphs of deep learning libraries blow up, lim-iting our ability to train on deep hyperbolic networks. We provide manual backward derivations of core hyperbolic operations to maintain manageable computation graphs.
