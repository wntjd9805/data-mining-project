Medical image arbitrary-scale super-resolution (MI-ASSR) has recently gained widespread attention, aiming to supersample medical volumes at arbitrary scales via a single model. However, existing MIASSR methods face two major limitations: (i) reliance on high-resolution (HR) volumes and (ii) limited generalization ability, which re-stricts their applications in various scenarios. To over-come these limitations, we propose Cube-based Neural Ra-diance Field (CuNeRF), a zero-shot MIASSR framework that is able to yield medical images at arbitrary scales and free viewpoints in a continuous domain. Unlike exist-ing MISR methods that only fit the mapping between low-resolution (LR) and HR volumes, CuNeRF focuses on build-ing a continuous volumetric representation from each LR volume without the knowledge of the corresponding HR one. This is achieved by the proposed differentiable mod-ules: cube-based sampling, isotropic volume rendering, and cube-based hierarchical rendering. Through extensive ex-*Corresponding author. periments on magnetic resource imaging (MRI) and com-puted tomography (CT) modalities, we demonstrate thatCuNeRF can synthesize high-quality SR medical images, which outperforms state-of-the-art MISR methods, achiev-ing better visual verisimilitude and fewer objectionable ar-tifacts. Compared to existing MISR methods, our CuNeRF is more applicable in practice.
