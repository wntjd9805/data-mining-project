(cid:1)(cid:4)(cid:5)(cid:3) (cid:2) (cid:1) (cid:1)(cid:2)Anchor-based detectors have been continuously devel-oped for object detection. However, the individual an-chor box makes it difﬁcult to predict the boundary’s off-set accurately.Instead of taking each bounding box as a closed individual, we consider using multiple boxes to-gether to get prediction boxes. To this end, this paper pro-poses the Box Decouple-Couple(BDC) strategy in the in-ference, which no longer discards the overlapping boxes, but decouples the corner points of these boxes. Then, ac-cording to each corner’s score, we couple the corner points to select the most accurate corner pairs. To meet the BDC strategy, a simple but novel model is designed named theAnchor-Intermediate Detector(AID), which contains two head networks, i.e., an anchor-based head and an anchor-free Corner-aware head. The corner-aware head is able to score the corners of each bounding box to facilitate the cou-pling between corner points. Extensive experiments on MSCOCO show that the proposed anchor-intermediate detec-tor respectively outperforms their baseline RetinaNet andGFL method by ∼2.4 and ∼1.2 AP on the MS COCO test-dev dataset without any bells and whistles.
