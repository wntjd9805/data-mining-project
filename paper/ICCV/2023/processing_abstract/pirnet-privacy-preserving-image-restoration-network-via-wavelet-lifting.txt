The cloud-based multimedia service becomes increas-ingly popular in the last decade, however, it poses a serious threat to the clientâ€™s privacy. To address this issue, many methods utilized image encryption as a defense mechanism.However, the encrypted images look quite different from the natural images, making them vulnerable to attackers.In this paper, we propose a novel method namely PIRNet, which operates privacy-preserving image restoration in the steganographic domain. Compared to existing methods, our method offers significant advantages in terms of invisibil-ity and security. Specifically, we first propose a waveletLifting-based Invertible Hiding (LIH) network to conceal the secret image into the stego image. Then, a Lifting-basedSecure Restoration (LSR) network is utilized to perform im-age restoration in the steganographic domain. Since the secret image remains hidden throughout the whole image restoration process, the privacy of clients can be largely en-sured. In addition, since the stego image looks visually the same as the cover image, the attackers can hardly discover it, which significantly improves the security. The experi-mental results on different datasets show the superiority of our PIRNet over the existing methods on various privacy-preserving image restoration tasks, including image denois-ing, deblurring and super-resolution.
