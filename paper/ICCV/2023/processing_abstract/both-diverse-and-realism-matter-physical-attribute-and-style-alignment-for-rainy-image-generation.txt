Although considerable progress has been made in image deraining under synthetic data, real rain removal is still a tough problem due to the huge domain gap between syn-thetic and real data. Besides, difficulties in collecting and labeling diverse real rain images hinder the progress of this field. Consequently, we attempt to promote real rain re-moval from rain image generation (RIG) perspective. Ex-isting RIG methods mainly focus on diversity but miss real-istic, or the realistic but neglect diversity of the generation.To solve this dilemma, we propose a physical alignment and controllable generation network (PCGNet) for diverse and realistic rain generation. Our key idea is to simultaneously utilize the controllability of attributes from synthetic and the realism of appearance from real data. Specifically, we de-vise a unified framework to disentangle background, rain attributes, and appearance style from synthetic and real data. Then we collaboratively align the factors with a novel semi-supervised weight moving strategy for attribute, an ex-plicit distribution modeling method for real rain style. Fur-thermore, we pack these aligned factors into the generation model, achieving physical controllable mapping from the attributes to real rain with image-level and attribute-level consistency loss. Extensive experiments show that PCGNet can effectively generate appealing rainy results, which sig-nificantly improve the performance under synthetic and real scenes for all existing deraining methods.
