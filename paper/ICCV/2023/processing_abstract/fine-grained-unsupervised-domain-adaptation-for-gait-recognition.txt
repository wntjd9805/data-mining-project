Gait recognition has emerged as a promising technique for the long-range retrieval of pedestrians, providing nu-merous advantages such as accurate identification in chal-lenging conditions and non-intrusiveness, making it highly desirable for improving public safety and security. How-ever, the high cost of labeling datasets, which is a prereq-uisite for most existing fully supervised approaches, poses a significant obstacle to the development of gait recogni-tion. Recently, some unsupervised methods for gait recog-nition have shown promising results. However, these meth-ods mainly rely on a fine-tuning approach that does not sufficiently consider the relationship between source and target domains, leading to the catastrophic forgetting of source domain knowledge. This paper presents a novel per-spective that adjacent-view sequences exhibit overlapping views, which can be leveraged by the network to gradu-ally attain cross-view and cross-dressing capabilities with-out pre-training on the labeled source domain. Specifically, we propose a fine-grained Unsupervised Domain Adapta-tion (UDA) framework that iteratively alternates between two stages. The initial stage involves offline clustering, which transfers knowledge from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain and adaptively generates pseudo-labels according to the expressiveness of each part.Subsequently, the second stage encompasses online train-ing, which further achieves cross-dressing capabilities by continuously learning to distinguish numerous features of source and target domains. The effectiveness of the pro-posed method is demonstrated through extensive experi-ments conducted on widely-used public gait datasets.
