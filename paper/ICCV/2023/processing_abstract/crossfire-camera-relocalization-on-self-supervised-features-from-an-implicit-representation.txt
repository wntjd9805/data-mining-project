In this paper, we use them as an implicit map of a given scene and propose a camera relocalization algorithm tailored for this representation. The proposed method en-ables to compute in real-time the precise position of a de-vice using a single RGB camera, during its navigation. In contrast with previous work, we do not rely on pose regres-sion or photometric alignment but rather use dense local features obtained through volumetric rendering which are specialized on the scene with a self-supervised objective.As a result, our algorithm is more accurate than competi-tors, able to operate in dynamic outdoor environments with changing lightning conditions and can be readily integrated in any volumetric neural renderer.
