While the community of 3D point cloud generation has witnessed a big growth in recent years, there still lacks an effective way to enable intuitive user control in the gen-eration process, hence limiting the general utility of such methods. Since an intuitive way of decomposing a shape is through its parts, we propose to tackle the task of con-trollable part-based point cloud generation. We introduceDiffFacto, a novel probabilistic generative model that learns the distribution of shapes with part-level control. We pro-pose a factorization that models independent part style and part configuration distributions, and present a novel cross diffusion network that enables us to generate coherent and plausible shapes under our proposed factorization. Experi-ments show that our method is able to generate novel shapes with multiple axes of control. It achieves state-of-the-art part-level generation quality and generates plausible and coherent shape while enabling various downstream edit-ing applications such as shape interpolation, mixing, and transformation editing.
