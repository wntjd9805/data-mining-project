Domain adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) leverages a labeled domain (source) to learn an object detector gen-eralizing to a novel domain without annotation (target).Recent advances use a teacher-student framework, i.e., a student model is supervised by the pseudo labels from a teacher model. Though great success, they suffer from the limited number of pseudo boxes with incorrect predictions caused by the domain shift, misleading the student model to get sub-optimal results. To mitigate this problem, we pro-pose Masked Retraining Teacher-student framework (MRT) which leverages masked autoencoder and selective retrain-ing mechanism on detection transformer. Specifically, we present a customized design of masked autoencoder branch, masking the multi-scale feature maps of target images and reconstructing features by the encoder of the student model and an auxiliary decoder. This helps the student model cap-ture target domain characteristics and become a more data-efficient learner to gain knowledge from the limited number of pseudo boxes. Furthermore, we adopt selective retrain-ing mechanism, periodically re-initializing certain parts of the student parameters with masked autoencoder refined weights to allow the model to jump out of the local opti-mum biased to the incorrect pseudo labels. Experimental results on three DAOD benchmarks demonstrate the effec-tiveness of our method. Code can be found at https:// github.com/JeremyZhao1998/MRT-release.
