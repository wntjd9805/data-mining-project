Weakly-supervised action localization aims to recognize and localize action instancese in untrimmed videos with only video-level labels. Most existing models rely on multi-ple instance learning(MIL), where the predictions of unla-beled instances are supervised by classifying labeled bags.The MIL-based methods are relatively well studied with co-gent performance achieved on classification but not on lo-calization. Generally, they locate temporal regions by the video-level classification but overlook the temporal varia-tions of feature semantics. To address this problem, we pro-pose a novel attention-based hierarchically-structured la-tent model to learn the temporal variations of feature se-mantics. Specifically, our model entails two components, the first is an unsupervised change-points detection mod-ule that detects change-points by learning the latent repre-sentations of video features in a temporal hierarchy based on their rates of change, and the second is an attention-based classification model that selects the change-points of the foreground as the boundaries. To evaluate the effec-tiveness of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-v1.3. The experiments show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, and even achieves compa-rable performance with fully-supervised methods.
