In this work we introduce S-TREK, a novel local feature extractor that combines a deep keypoint detector, which is both translation and rotation equivariant by design, with a lightweight deep descriptor extractor. We train the S-TREK keypoint detector within a framework inspired by reinforce-ment learning, where we leverage a sequential procedure to maximize a reward directly related to keypoint repeatabil-ity. Our descriptor network is trained following a “detect, then describe” approach, where the descriptor loss is eval-uated only at those locations where keypoints have been selected by the already trained detector. Extensive experi-ments on multiple benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method, with S-TREK often outperforming other state-of-the-art methods in terms of repeatability and quality of the recovered poses, especially when dealing with in-plane rotations.
