Edge SetGraph convolutional networks (GCNs) are the most commonly used methods for skeleton-based action recog-nition and have achieved remarkable performance. Gen-erating adjacency matrices with semantically meaningful edges is particularly important for this task, but extract-ing such edges is challenging problem. To solve this, we propose a hierarchically decomposed graph convolu-tional network (HD-GCN) architecture with a novel hier-archically decomposed graph (HD-Graph). The proposedHD-GCN effectively decomposes every joint node into sev-eral sets to extract major structurally adjacent and distant edges, and uses them to construct an HD-Graph contain-ing those edges in the same semantic spaces of a human skeleton. In addition, we introduce an attention-guided hi-erarchy aggregation (A-HA) module to highlight the dom-inant hierarchical edge sets of the HD-Graph. Further-more, we apply a new six-way ensemble method, which uses only joint and bone stream without any motion stream.The proposed model is evaluated and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four large, popular datasets. Fi-nally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with various comparative experiments. Code is available at https://github.com/Jho-Yonsei/HD-GCN.
