Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims at seg-menting an object in a video following human instruction.Current state-of-the-art methods fall into an ofﬂine pattern, in which each clip independently interacts with text embed-ding for cross-modal understanding. They usually present that the ofﬂine pattern is necessary for RVOS, yet model limited temporal association within each clip. In this work, we break up the previous ofﬂine belief and propose a simple yet effective online model using explicit query propagation, named OnlineRefer. Speciﬁcally, our approach leverages target cues that gather semantic information and position prior to improve the accuracy and ease of referring pre-dictions for the current frame. Furthermore, we generalize our online model into a semi-online framework to be com-patible with video-based backbones. To show the effective-ness of our method, we evaluate it on four benchmarks, i.e.,Refer-Youtube-VOS, Refer-DAVIS17, A2D-Sentences, andJHMDB-Sentences. Without bells and whistles, our On-lineRefer with a Swin-L backbone achieves 63.5 J&F and 64.8 J&F on Refer-Youtube-VOS and Refer-DAVIS17, out-performing all other ofﬂine methods.
