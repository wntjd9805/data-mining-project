When taking images against strong light sources, the re-sulting images often contain heterogeneous ﬂare artifacts.These artifacts can importantly affect image visual quality and downstream computer vision tasks. While collecting real data pairs of ﬂare-corrupted/ﬂare-free images for train-ing ﬂare removal models is challenging, current methods utilize the direct-add approach to synthesize data. However, these methods do not consider automatic exposure and tone mapping in image signal processing pipeline (ISP), lead-ing to the limited generalization capability of deep models training using such data. Besides, existing methods struggle to handle multiple light sources due to the different sizes, shapes and illuminance of various light sources. In this paper, we propose a solution to improve the performance of lens ﬂare removal by revisiting the ISP and remodeling*Corresponding author: liangdong@nuaa.edu.cn the principle of automatic exposure in the synthesis pipeline and design a more reliable light sources recovery strategy.The new pipeline approaches realistic imaging by discrim-inating the local and global illumination through convex combination, avoiding global illumination shifting and local over-saturation. Our strategy for recovering multiple light sources convexly averages the input and output of the neu-ral network based on illuminance levels, thereby avoiding the need for a hard threshold in identifying light sources.We also contribute a new ﬂare removal testing dataset con-taining the ﬂare-corrupted images captured by ten types of consumer electronics. The dataset facilitates the veriﬁcation of the generalization capability of ﬂare removal methods.Extensive experiments show that our solution can effectively improve the performance of lens ﬂare removal and push the frontier toward more general situations.
