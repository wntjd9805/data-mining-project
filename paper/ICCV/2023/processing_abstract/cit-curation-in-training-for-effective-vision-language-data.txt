Large vision-language models are generally applicable to many downstream tasks, but come at an exorbitant train-ing cost that only large institutions can afford. This pa-per trades generality for efﬁciency and presents Curation in Training (CiT), a simple and efﬁcient vision-text learning algorithm that couples a data objective into training. CiT automatically yields quality data to speed-up contrastive image-text training and alleviates the need for an ofﬂine data ﬁltering pipeline, allowing broad data sources (includ-ing raw image-text pairs from the web). CiT contains two loops: an outer loop curating the training data and an inner loop consuming the curated training data. The text encoder connects the two loops. Given metadata for tasks of interest, e.g., class names, and a large pool of image-text pairs, CiT alternatively selects relevant training data from the pool by measuring the similarity of their text embeddings and em-beddings of the metadata. In our experiments, we observe that CiT can speed up training by over an order of magni-tude, especially if the raw data size is large.
