Unsupervised surface anomaly detection aims at dis-covering and localizing anomalous patterns using only anomaly-free training samples. Reconstruction-based mod-els are among the most popular and successful methods, which rely on the assumption that anomaly regions are more difficult to reconstruct. However, there are three major chal-lenges to the practical application of this approach: 1) the reconstruction quality needs to be further improved since it has a great impact on the final result, especially for images with structural changes; 2) it is observed that for many neu-ral networks, the anomalies can also be well reconstructed, which severely violates the underlying assumption; 3) since reconstruction is an ill-conditioned problem, a test instance may correspond to multiple normal patterns, but most cur-rent reconstruction-based methods have ignored this criti-cal fact. In this paper, we propose DiffAD, a method for unsupervised anomaly detection based on the latent diffu-sion model, inspired by its ability to generate high-quality and diverse images. We further propose noisy condition embedding and interpolated channels to address the afore-mentioned challenges in the general reconstruction-based pipeline. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challengingMVTec dataset, especially in localization accuracy.
