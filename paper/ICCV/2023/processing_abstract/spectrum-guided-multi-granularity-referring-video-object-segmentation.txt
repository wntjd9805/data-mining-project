(cid:3031) (a) Previous: decode-and-segment w/ decoded features (cid:1832)(cid:3049)(cid:3039)Current referring video object segmentation (R-VOS) techniques extract conditional kernels from encoded (low-resolution) vision-language features to segment the decoded high-resolution features. We discovered that this causes sig-niﬁcant feature drift, which the segmentation kernels strug-gle to perceive during the forward computation. This nega-tively affects the ability of segmentation kernels. To address the drift problem, we propose a Spectrum-guided Multi-granularity (SgMg) approach, which performs direct seg-mentation on the encoded features and employs visual de-tails to further optimize the masks.In addition, we pro-pose Spectrum-guided Cross-modal Fusion (SCF) to per-form intra-frame global interactions in the spectral domain for effective multimodal representation. Finally, we ex-tend SgMg to perform multi-object R-VOS, a new paradigm that enables simultaneous segmentation of multiple referred objects in a video. This not only makes R-VOS faster, but also more practical. Extensive experiments show thatSgMg achieves state-of-the-art performance on four video benchmark datasets, outperforming the nearest competitor by 2.8% points on Ref-YouTube-VOS. Our extended SgMg enables multi-object R-VOS, runs about 3× faster while maintaining satisfactory performance. Code is available at https://github.com/bo-miao/SgMg.
