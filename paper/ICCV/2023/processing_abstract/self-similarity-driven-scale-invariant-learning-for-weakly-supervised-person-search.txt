Weakly supervised person search aims to jointly de-tect and match persons with only bounding box annota-tions. Existing approaches typically focus on improving the features by exploring the relations of persons. How-ever, scale variation problem is a more severe obstacle and under-studied that a person often owns images with different scales (resolutions). For one thing, small-scale images contain less information of a person, thus affect-ing the accuracy of the generated pseudo labels. For an-other, different similarities between cross-scale images of a person increase the difficulty of matching.In this pa-per, we address it by proposing a novel one-step frame-work, named Self-similarity driven Scale-invariant Learn-ing (SSL). Scale invariance can be explored based on the self-similarity prior that it shows the same statistical prop-erties of an image at different scales. To this end, we intro-duce a Multi-scale Exemplar Branch to guide the network in concentrating on the foreground and learning scale-invariant features by hard exemplars mining. To enhance the discriminative power of the learned features, we fur-ther introduce a dynamic pseudo label prediction that pro-gressively seeks true labels for training. Experimental re-sults on two standard benchmarks, i.e., PRW and CUHK-SYSU datasets, demonstrate that the proposed method can solve scale variation problem effectively and perform favor-ably against state-of-the-art methods.
