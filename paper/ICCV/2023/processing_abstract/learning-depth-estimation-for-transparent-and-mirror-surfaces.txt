RGBBaseOursInferring the depth of transparent or mirror (ToM) sur-faces represents a hard challenge for either sensors, algo-rithms, or deep networks. We propose a simple pipeline for learning to estimate depth properly for such surfaces with neural networks, without requiring any ground-truth anno-tation. We unveil how to obtain reliable pseudo labels by in-painting ToM objects in images and processing them with a monocular depth estimation model. These labels can be used to fine-tune existing monocular or stereo networks, to let them learn how to deal with ToM surfaces. Experimental results on the Booster dataset show the dramatic improve-ments enabled by our remarkably simple proposal.
