Limited-Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) is a non-destructive 3D imaging technique used in a variety of appli-cations ranging from security to medicine. The limited angle coverage in LACT is often a dominant source of severe arti-facts in the reconstructed images, making it a challenging imaging inverse problem. Diffusion models are a recent class of deep generative models for synthesizing realistic images using image denoisers. In this work, we present DOLCE as the first framework for integrating conditionally-trained diffusion models and explicit physical measurement mod-els for solving imaging inverse problems. DOLCE achieves the SOTA performance in highly ill-posed LACT by alter-nating between the data-fidelity and sampling updates of a diffusion model conditioned on the transformed sinogram.We show through extensive experimentation that unlike ex-isting methods, DOLCE can synthesize high-quality and structurally coherent 3D volumes by using only 2D condi-tionally pre-trained diffusion models. We further show on several challenging real LACT datasets that the same pre-trained DOLCE model achieves the SOTA performance on drastically different types of images.
