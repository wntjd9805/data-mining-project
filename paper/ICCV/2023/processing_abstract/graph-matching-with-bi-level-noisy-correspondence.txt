In this paper, we study a novel and widely existing prob-lem in graph matching (GM), namely, Bi-level Noisy Cor-respondence (BNC), which refers to node-level noisy cor-respondence (NNC) and edge-level noisy correspondence (ENC). In brief, on the one hand, due to the poor recog-nizability and viewpoint differences between images, it is inevitable to inaccurately annotate some keypoints with off-set and confusion, leading to the mismatch between two associated nodes, i.e., NNC. On the other hand, the noisy node-to-node correspondence will further contaminate the edge-to-edge correspondence, thus leading to ENC. For theBNC challenge, we propose a novel method termed Con-trastive Matching with Momentum Distillation. Specifically, the proposed method is with a robust quadratic contrastive loss which enjoys the following merits: i) better exploring the node-to-node and edge-to-edge correlations through aGM customized quadratic contrastive learning paradigm; ii) adaptively penalizing the noisy assignments based on the confidence estimated by the momentum teacher. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show the robust-ness of our model compared with 12 competitive baselines.The code is available at https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/2023-ICCV-COMMON.
