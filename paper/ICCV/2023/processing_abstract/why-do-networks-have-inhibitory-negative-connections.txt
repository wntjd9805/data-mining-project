Why do brains have inhibitory connections? Why do deep networks have negative weights? We propose an an-swer from the perspective of representation capacity. We believe representing functions is the primary role of both (i) the brain in natural intelligence, and (ii) deep networks in artificial intelligence. Our answer to why there are in-hibitory/negative weights is: to learn more functions. We prove that, in the absence of negative weights, neural net-works with non-decreasing activation functions are not uni-versal approximators. While this may be an intuitive result to some, to the best of our knowledge, there is no formal theory, in either machine learning or neuroscience, that demonstrates why negative weights are crucial in the context of representation capacity. Further, we provide insights on the geometric properties of the representation space that non-negative deep networks cannot represent. We expect these insights will yield a deeper understanding of more so-phisticated inductive priors imposed on the distribution of weights that lead to more efficient biological and machine learning.
