Deep Image Prior (DIP) shows that some network ar-chitectures inherently tend towards generating smooth im-ages while resisting noise, a phenomenon known as spec-tral bias. Image denoising is a natural application of this property. Although denoising with DIP mitigates the need for large training sets, two often intertwined practical chal-lenges need to be overcome: architectural design and noise fitting. Existing methods either handcraft or search for suit-able architectures from a vast design space, due to the lim-ited understanding of how architectural choices affect the denoising outcome. In this study, we demonstrate from a frequency perspective that unlearnt upsampling is the main driving force behind the denoising phenomenon with DIP.This finding leads to straightforward strategies for identify-ing a suitable architecture for every image without labori-ous search. Extensive experiments show that the estimated architectures achieve superior denoising results than exist-ing methods with up to 95% fewer parameters. Thanks to this under-parameterization, the resulting architectures are less prone to noise-fitting1.
