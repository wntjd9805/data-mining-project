Medical image segmentation is a challenging task, par-ticularly due to inter- and intra-observer variability, even between medical experts.In this paper, we propose a novel model, called Probabilistic Inter-Observer and iNtra-Observer variation NetwOrk (Pionono). It captures the la-beling behavior of each rater with a multidimensional prob-ability distribution and integrates this information with the feature maps of the image to produce probabilistic segmen-tation predictions. The model is optimized by variational inference and can be trained end-to-end.It outperforms state-of-the-art models such as STAPLE, Probabilistic U-Net, and models based on confusion matrices. Additionally,Pionono predicts multiple coherent segmentation maps that mimic the raterâ€™s expert opinion, which provides additional valuable information for the diagnostic process. Experi-ments on real-world cancer segmentation datasets demon-strate the high accuracy and efficiency of Pionono, making it a powerful tool for medical image analysis.
