Transformer-based visual trackers have demonstrated signiﬁcant progress owing to their superior modeling ca-pabilities. However, existing trackers are hampered by low speed, limiting their applicability on devices with limited computational power. To alleviate this problem, we proposeHiT, a new family of efﬁcient tracking models that can run at high speed on different devices while retaining high per-formance. The central idea of HiT is the Bridge Module, which bridges the gap between modern lightweight trans-formers and the tracking framework. The Bridge Module in-corporates the high-level information of deep features into the shallow large-resolution features. In this way, it pro-duces better features for the tracking head. We also pro-pose a novel dual-image position encoding technique that simultaneously encodes the position information of both the search region and template images. The HiT model achieves promising speed with competitive performance.For instance, it runs at 61 frames per second (fps) on theNvidia Jetson AGX edge device. Furthermore, HiT attains 64.6% AUC on the LaSOT benchmark, surpassing all pre-vious efﬁcient trackers. Code and models are available at https://github.com/kangben258/HiT.
