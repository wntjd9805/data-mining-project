Current motion forecasting approaches typically train a deep end-to-end model from the source domain data, and then apply it directly to target subjects. Despite promis-ing results, they remain non-optimal, due to privacy con-siderations, the test person and his/her natural properties (e.g., behavioral trait) are typically unseen in training. In this case, the source pre-trained model has a low ability to adapt to these out-of-source characteristics, resulting in an unreliable prediction. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel helper-predictor test-time personalization approach (H/P-TTP), which allows for a generalizable representa-tion of out-of-source subjects to gain more realistic predic-tions. Concretely, the helper is preceded by explicit and im-plicit augmenters, where the former yields noisy sequences to improve robustness, while the latter is to generate novel-domain data with an adversarial learning paradigm. Then, the domain-generalizable learning is achieved where the helper can extract cross-subject invariant-knowledge to up-date the predictor. At test time, given a new person, the predictor is able to be further optimized to empower per-sonalized capabilities to the specific properties. Extensive experiments show that with H/P-TTP, the existing models are significantly improved for various unseen subjects. The project page is available at https://sites.google. com/view/hp-ttp.
