Although previous works on traffic scene understanding have achieved great success, most of them stop at a low-level perception stage, such as road segmentation and lane detection, and few concern high-level understanding.In this paper, we present Visual Traffic Knowledge Graph Gen-eration (VTKGG), a new task for in-depth traffic scene un-derstanding that tries to extract multiple kinds of informa-tion and integrate them into a knowledge graph. To achieve this goal, we first introduce a large dataset named CASIA-Tencent Road Scene dataset (RS10K) with comprehensive annotations to support related research. Secondly, we pro-pose a novel traffic scene parsing architecture containing a Hierarchical Graph ATtention network (HGAT) to ana-lyze the heterogeneous elements and their complicated re-lations in traffic scene images. By hierarchizing the hetero-geneous graph and equipping it with cross-level links, our approach exploits the correlation among various elements completely and acquires accurate relations. The experimen-tal results show that our method can effectively generate vi-sual traffic knowledge graphs and achieve state-of-the-art performance. The dataset RS10K is available at http://www.nlpr.ia.ac.cn/pal/RS10K.html.
