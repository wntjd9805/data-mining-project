This paper aims for high-performance offline LiDAR-based 3D object detection. We first observe that expe-rienced human annotators annotate objects from a track-centric perspective. They first label objects in a track with clear shapes, and then leverage the temporal coherence to infer the annotations of obscure objects. Drawing inspira-tion from this, we propose a high-performance offline de-tector in a track-centric perspective instead of the conven-tional object-centric perspective. Our method features a bidirectional tracking module and a track-centric learning module. Such design allows our detector to infer and re-fine a complete track once the object is detected at a cer-tain moment. We refer this characteristic to “onCe de-tecTed, neveR Lost” and name the proposed system CTRL.Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable perfor-mance of our method, surpassing the human-level annotat-ing accuracy and previous state-of-the-art methods in the highly competitive Waymo Open Dataset leaderboard with-out model ensemble.
