Domain adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a fully labeled source to a scarcely labeled or to-tally unlabeled target under domain shift. Recently, semi-supervised learning-based (SSL) techniques that leverage pseudo labeling have been increasingly used in DA. De-spite the competitive performance, these pseudo labeling methods rely heavily on the source domain to generate pseudo labels for the target domain and therefore still suffer considerably from source data bias. Moreover, class dis-tribution bias in the target domain is also often ignored in the pseudo label generation and thus leading to fur-ther deterioration of performance. In this paper, we pro-pose GeT that learns a non-bias target embedding distri-bution with high quality pseudo labels. Specifically, we formulate an online target generative classifier to induce the target distribution into distinctive Gaussian compo-nents weighted by their class priors to mitigate source data bias and enhance target class discriminability. We fur-ther propose a structure similarity regularization frame-work to alleviate target class distribution bias and further improve target class discriminability. Experimental results show that our proposed GeT is effective and achieves con-sistent improvements under various DA settings with and without class distribution bias.
