3D instance segmentation has recently garnered in-creased attention. Typical deep learning methods adopt point grouping schemes followed by hand-designed geo-metric clustering.Inspired by the success of transform-ers for various 3D tasks, newer hybrid approaches have utilized transformer decoders coupled with convolutional backbones that operate on voxelized scenes. However, due to the nature of sparse feature backbones, the extracted fea-tures provided to the transformer decoder are lacking in spatial understanding. Thus, such approaches often pre-dict spatially separate objects as single instances. To this end, we introduce a novel approach for 3D point clouds in-stance segmentation that addresses the challenge of gener-ating distinct instance masks for objects that share similar appearances but are spatially separated. Our method lever-ages spatial and semantic supervision with query refine-ment to improve the performance of hybrid 3D instance seg-mentation models. Specifically, we provide the transformer block with spatial features to facilitate differentiation be-tween similar object queries and incorporate semantic su-pervision to enhance prediction accuracy based on object class. Our proposed approach outperforms existing meth-ods on the validation sets of ScanNet V2 and ScanNet200 datasets, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task.
