Point-spread-function (PSF) engineering is a powerful computational imaging technique wherein a custom phase mask is integrated into an optical system to encode addi-tional information into captured images. Used in combi-nation with deep learning, such systems now offer state-of-the-art performance at monocular depth estimation, ex-tended depth-of-field imaging, lensless imaging, and other tasks. Inspired by recent advances in spatial light modula-tor (SLM) technology, this paper answers a natural ques-tion: Can one encode additional information and achieve superior performance by changing a phase mask dynam-ically over time? We first prove that the set of PSFs de-scribed by static phase masks is non-convex and that, as a result, time-averaged PSFs generated by dynamic phase masks are fundamentally more expressive. We then demon-strate, in simulation, that time-averaged dynamic (TiDy) phase masks can leverage this increased expressiveness to offer substantially improved monocular depth estimation and extended depth-of-field imaging performance.
