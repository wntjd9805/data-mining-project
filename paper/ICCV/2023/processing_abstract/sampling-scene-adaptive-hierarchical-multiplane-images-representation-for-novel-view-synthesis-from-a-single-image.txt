In this paper, we introduce SAMPLING, a Scene-adaptive HierarchicalMultiplane Images Representation for Novel View Synthe-sis from a Single Image based on improved multiplane im-ages (MPI). Observing that depth distribution varies sig-nificantly for unbounded outdoor scenes, we employ an adaptive-bins strategy for MPI to arrange planes in accor-dance with each scene image. To represent intricate ge-ometry and multi-scale details, we further introduce a hi-erarchical refinement branch, which results in high-quality synthesized novel views. Our method demonstrates consid-erable performance gains in synthesizing large-scale un-bounded outdoor scenes using a single image on the KITTI dataset and generalizes well to the unseen Tanks and Tem-*Work is done during the internship at Peking University.â€ Corresponding author.
