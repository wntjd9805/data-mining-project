We aim to address a significant but understudied problem in the anime industry, namely the inbetweening of cartoon line drawings. Inbetweening involves generating interme-diate frames between two black-and-white line drawings and is a time-consuming and expensive process that can benefit from automation. However, existing frame interpo-lation methods that rely on matching and warping whole raster images are unsuitable for line inbetweening and of-ten produce blurring artifacts that damage the intricate line structures. To preserve the precision and detail of the line drawings, we propose a new approach, AnimeInbet, which geometrizes raster line drawings into graphs of endpoints and reframes the inbetweening task as a graph fusion prob-lem with vertex repositioning. Our method can effectively capture the sparsity and unique structure of line drawings while preserving the details during inbetweening. This is made possible via our novel modules, i.e., vertex geomet-ric embedding, a vertex correspondence Transformer, an effective mechanism for vertex repositioning and a visibil-ity predictor. To train our method, we introduce Mixamo-Line240, a new dataset of line drawings with ground truth vectorization and matching labels. Our experiments demon-strate that AnimeInbet synthesizes high-quality, clean, and (cid:66) Corresponding author. âˆ—Work completed at UCLA. complete intermediate line drawings, outperforming existing methods quantitatively and qualitatively, especially in cases with large motions.
