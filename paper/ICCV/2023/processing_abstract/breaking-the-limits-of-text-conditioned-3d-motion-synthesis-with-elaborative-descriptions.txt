Given its wide applications, there is increasing focus on generating 3D human motions from textual descriptions.Differing from the majority of previous works, which regard actions as single entities and can only generate short se-quences for simple motions, we propose EMS, an elabora-tive motion synthesis model conditioned on detailed natu-ral language descriptions. It generates natural and smooth motion sequences for long and complicated actions by fac-torizing them into groups of atomic actions. Meanwhile, it understands atomic-action level attributes (e.g., motion direction, speed, and body parts) and enables users to gen-erate sequences of unseen complex actions from unique se-quences of known atomic actions with independent attribute settings and timings applied. We evaluate our method on the KIT Motion-Language and BABEL benchmarks, where it outperforms all previous state-of-the-art with noticeable margins.
