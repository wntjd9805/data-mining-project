Albeit the notable performance on in-domain test points, it is non-trivial for deep neural networks to attain satis-factory accuracy when deploying in the open world, where novel domains and object classes often occur. In this pa-per, we study a practical problem of Domain Generaliza-tion under Category Shift (DGCS), which aims to simulta-neously detect unknown-class samples and classify known-class samples in the target domains. Compared to prior DG works, we face two new challenges: 1) how to learn the con-cept of “unknown” during training with only source known-class samples, and 2) how to adapt the source-trained model to unseen environments for safe model deployment.To this end, we propose a novel Activate and Reject (ART) framework to reshape the model’s decision boundary to ac-commodate unknown classes and conduct post hoc modifi-cation to further discriminate known and unknown classes using unlabeled test data. Specifically, during training, we promote the response to the unknown by optimizing the un-known probability and then smoothing the overall output to mitigate the overconfidence issue. At test time, we in-troduce a step-wise online adaptation method that predicts the label by virtue of the cross-domain nearest neighbor and class prototype information without updating the net-work’s parameters or using threshold-based mechanisms.Experiments reveal that ART consistently improves the gen-eralization capability of deep networks on different vision tasks. For image classification, ART improves the H-score by 6.1% on average compared to the previous best method.For object detection and semantic segmentation, we estab-lish new benchmarks and achieve competitive performance.
