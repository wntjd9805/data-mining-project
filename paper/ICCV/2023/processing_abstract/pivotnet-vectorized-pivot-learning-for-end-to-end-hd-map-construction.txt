Vectorized high-definition map online construction has garnered considerable attention in the field of autonomous driving research. Most existing approaches model change-able map elements using a fixed number of points, or pre-dict local maps in a two-stage autoregressive manner, which may miss essential details and lead to error accumulation.Towards precise map element learning, we propose a sim-ple yet effective architecture named PivotNet, which adopts unified pivot-based map representations and is formulated as a direct set prediction paradigm. Concretely, we first propose a novel Point-to-Line Mask module to encode both the subordinate and geometrical point-line priors in the net-work. Then, a well-designed Pivot Dynamic Matching mod-ule is proposed to model the topology in dynamic point se-quences by introducing the concept of sequence matching.Furthermore, to supervise the position and topology of the vectorized point predictions, we propose a Dynamic Vec-torized Sequence loss. Extensive experiments and ablations show that PivotNet is remarkably superior to other SOTAs by 5.9 mAP at least. The code will be available soon.
