We introduce a Parametric Information Maximiza-tion (PIM) model for the Generalized Category Discov-ery (GCD) problem.Specifically, we propose a bi-level optimization formulation, which explores a param-eterized family of objective functions, each evaluating a information between the features and weighted mutual the latent labels, subject to supervision constraints from the labeled samples.Our formulation mitigates the class-balance bias encoded in standard information max-thereby handling effectively both imization approaches, short-tailed and long-tailed data sets. We report ex-tensive experiments and comparisons demonstrating that our PIM model consistently sets new state-of-the-art per-formances in GCD across six different datasets, more so when dealing with challenging fine-grained problems.Our code: https://github.com/ThalesGroup/ pim-generalized-category-discovery.
