As it is hard to calibrate single-view RGB images in the wild, existing 3D human mesh reconstruction (3DHMR) methods either use a constant large focal length or estimate one based on the background environment context, which can not tackle the problem of the torso, limb, hand or face distortion caused by perspective camera projection when the camera is close to the human body. The naive focal length assumptions can harm this task with the incorrectly formulated projection matrices. To solve this, we proposeZolly, the first 3DHMR method focusing on perspective-distorted images. Our approach begins with analysing the reason for perspective distortion, which we find is mainly caused by the relative location of the human body to the camera center. We propose a new camera model and a novel 2D representation, termed distortion image, which describes the 2D dense distortion scale of the human body.We then estimate the distance from distortion scale features rather than environment context features. Afterwards, We integrate the distortion feature with image features to re-construct the body mesh. To formulate the correct projec-*LYâ€  is the corresponding author. tion matrix and locate the human body position, we simul-taneously use perspective and weak-perspective projection loss. Since existing datasets could not handle this task, we propose the first synthetic dataset PDHuman and extend two real-world datasets tailored for this task, all contain-ing perspective-distorted human images. Extensive exper-iments show that Zolly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on both perspective-distorted datasets and the standard benchmark (3DPW). Code and dataset will be re-leased at https://wenjiawang0312.github.io/ projects/zolly/.
