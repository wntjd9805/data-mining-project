Heterogeneous image fusion (HIF) techniques aim to en-hance image quality by merging complementary informa-tion from images captured by different sensors. Among these algorithms, deep unfolding network (DUN)-based methods achieve promising performance but still suffer from two issues: they lack a degradation-resistant-oriented fu-sion model and struggle to adequately consider the struc-tural properties of DUNs, making them vulnerable to degra-dation scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Degradation-Resistant Unfolding Network (DeRUN) for the HIF task to generate high-quality fused images even in degradation sce-narios. Specifically, we introduce a novel HIF model for degradation resistance and derive its optimization proce-dures. Then, we incorporate the optimization unfolding process into the proposed DeRUN for end-to-end training.To ensure the robustness and efficiency of DeRUN, we em-ploy a joint constraint strategy and a lightweight partial weight sharing module. To train DeRUN, we further pro-pose a gradient direction-based entropy loss with power-ful texture representation capacity. Extensive experiments show that DeRUN significantly outperforms existing meth-ods on four HIF tasks, as well as downstream applications, with cheaper computational and memory costs.
