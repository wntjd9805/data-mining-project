Generating accurate pseudo-labels under the supervi-sion of image categories is a crucial step in Weakly Su-pervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS). In this work, we propose a Mat-Label pipeline that provides a fresh way to treat WSSS pseudo-labels generation as an image matting task. By taking a trimap as input which specifies the fore-ground, background and unknown regions, the image mat-ting task outputs an object mask with fine edges. The in-tuition behind our Mat-Label is that generating trimap is much easier than generating pseudo-labels directly under weakly supervised setting. Although current CAM-based methods are off-the-shelf solutions for generating a trimap, they suffer from cross-category and foreground-background pixel prediction confusion. To solve this problem, we de-velop a Double Decoupled Class Activation Map (D2CAM) for Mat-Label to generate a high-quality trimap. By draw-ing on the idea of metric learning, we explicitly model class activation map with category decoupling and foreground-background decoupling. We also design two simple yet ef-fective refinement constraints for D2CAM to stabilize opti-mization and eliminate non-exclusive activation. Extensive experiments validate that our Mat-Label achieves substan-tial and consistent performance gains compared to current state-of-the-art WSSS approaches.
