Recent progress in weakly supervised object detection is featured by a combination of multiple instance detection networks (MIDN) and ordinal online refinement. However, with only image-level annotation, MIDN inevitably assigns high scores to some unexpected region proposals when gen-erating pseudo labels. These inaccurate high-scoring re-gion proposals will mislead the training of subsequent re-finement modules and thus hamper the detection perfor-mance. In this work, we explore how to ameliorate the qual-ity of pseudo-labeling in MIDN. Formally, we devise Cyclic-Bootstrap Labeling (CBL), a novel weakly supervised ob-ject detection pipeline, which optimizes MIDN with rank information from a reliable teacher network. Specifically, we obtain this teacher network by introducing a weighted exponential moving average strategy to take advantage of various refinement modules. A novel class-specific rank-ing distillation algorithm is proposed to leverage the out-put of weighted ensembled teacher network for distillingMIDN with rank information. As a result, MIDN is guided to assign higher scores to accurate proposals among their neighboring ones, thus benefiting the subsequent pseudo la-beling. Extensive experiments on the prevalent PASCALVOC 2007 & 2012 and COCO datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our CBL framework.
