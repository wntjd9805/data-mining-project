https://github.com/SysCV/cascade-detr.Object localization in general environments is a fun-damental part of vision systems. While dominating on the COCO benchmark, recent Transformer-based detection methods are not competitive in diverse domains. Moreover, these methods still struggle to very accurately estimate the object bounding boxes in complex environments.We introduce Cascade-DETR for high-quality universal object detection. We jointly tackle the generalization to di-verse domains and localization accuracy by proposing theCascade Attention layer, which explicitly integrates object-centric information into the detection decoder by limiting the attention to the previous box prediction. To further enhance accuracy, we also revisit the scoring of queries.Instead of relying on classification scores, we predict the expected IoU of the query, leading to substantially more well-calibrated confidences. Lastly, we introduce a uni-versal object detection benchmark, UDB10, that contains 10 datasets from diverse domains. While also advanc-ing the state-of-the-art on COCO, Cascade-DETR substan-tially improves DETR-based detectors on all datasets inUDB10, even by over 10 mAP in some cases. The im-provements under stringent quality requirements are even more pronounced. Our code and pretrained models are at*Equal contribution.
