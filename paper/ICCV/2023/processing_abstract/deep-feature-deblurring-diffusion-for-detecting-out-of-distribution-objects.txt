To promote the safe application of detectors, a task of un-supervised out-of-distribution object detection (OOD-OD) is recently proposed, whose goal is to detect unseen OOD objects without accessing any auxiliary OOD data. For this task, the challenge mainly lies in how to only lever-age the known in-distribution (ID) data to detect OOD ob-jects accurately without affecting the detection of ID ob-jects, which can be framed as the diffusion problem for deep feature synthesis. Accordingly, such challenge could be addressed by the forward and reverse processes in the diffusion model. In this paper, we propose a new approach of Deep Feature Deblurring Diffusion (DFDD), consist-ing of forward blurring and reverse deblurring processes.Specifically, the forward process gradually performs Gaus-sian Blur on the extracted features, which is instrumen-tal in retaining sufficient input-relevant information. By this way, the forward process could synthesize virtual OOD features that are close to the classification boundary be-tween ID and OOD objects, which improves the perfor-mance of detecting OOD objects. During the reverse pro-cess, based on the blurred features, a dedicated deblurring model is designed to continually recover the lost details in the forward process. Both the deblurred features and orig-inal features are taken as the input for training, strength-ening the discrimination ability.In the experiments, our method is evaluated on OOD-OD, open-set object detec-tion, and incremental object detection. The significant per-formance gains over baselines demonstrate the superiori-ties of our method. The source code will be made available at: https://github.com/AmingWu/DFDD-OOD.
