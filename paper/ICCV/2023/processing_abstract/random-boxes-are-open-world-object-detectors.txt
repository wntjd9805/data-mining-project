We show that classifiers trained with random region pro-posals achieve state-of-the-art Open-world Object Detec-tion (OWOD): they can not only maintain the accuracy of the known objects (w/ training labels), but also con-siderably improve the recall of unknown ones (w/o train-ing labels).Specifically, we propose RandBox, a FastR-CNN based architecture trained on random proposals at each training iteration, surpassing existing Faster R-CNN and Transformer based OWOD. Its effectiveness stems from the following two benefits introduced by randomness.First, as the randomization is independent of the distribu-tion of the limited known objects, the random proposals become the instrumental variable that prevents the train-ing from being confounded by the known objects. Sec-ond, the unbiased training encourages more proposal ex-plorations by using our proposed matching score that does not penalize the random proposals whose predic-tion scores do not match the known objects. On two benchmarks: Pascal-VOC/MS-COCO and LVIS, Rand-Box significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art the ablations on ran-in all metrics. We also detail domization and loss designs.
