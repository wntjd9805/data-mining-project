Boundary localization is a challenging problem in Tem-poral Action Detection (TAD), in which there are two main issues. First, the submergence of movement feature, i.e. the movement information in a snippet is covered by the scene information. Second, the scale of action, that is, the propor-tion of action segments in the entire video, is considerably variable. In this work, we first design a Movement EnhanceModule (MEM) to highlight movement feature for better ac-tion location, and then, we propose a Scale Feature Pyra-mid Network (SFPN) to detect multi-scale actions in videos.For Movement Enhance Module, firstly, Movement FeatureExtractor (MFE) is designed to get the movement feature.Secondly, we propose a Multi-Relation Enhance Module (MREM) to grasp valuable information correlation both lo-cally and temporally. For Scale Feature Pyramid Network, we design a U-Shape Module to model different scale ac-tions, moreover, we design the training and inference strat-egy of different scales, ensuring that each pyramid layer is only responsible for actions at a specific scale. These two innovations are integrated as the Movement EnhanceNetwork (MENet), and extensive experiments conducted on two challenging benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness.MENet outperforms other representative TAD methods onActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS-14.
