Scale variation is a deep-rooted problem in object count-ing, which has not been effectively addressed by exist-ing scale-aware algorithms. An important factor is that they typically involve cooperative learning across multi-resolutions, which could be suboptimal for learning the most discriminative features from each scale. In this paper, we propose a novel method termed STEERER (SelecTivE inhERitance lEaRning) that addresses the issue of scale variations in object counting. STEERER selects the most suitable scale for patch objects to boost feature extrac-tion and only inherits discriminative features from lower to higher resolution progressively. The main insights ofSTEERER are a dedicated Feature Selection and Inher-itance Adaptor (FSIA), which selectively forwards scale-customized features at each scale, and a Masked Selec-tion and Inheritance Loss (MSIL) that helps to achieve high-quality density maps across all scales. Our exper-imental results on nine datasets with counting and local-ization tasks demonstrate the unprecedented scale general-ization ability of STEERER.
