Current closed-set instance segmentation models rely on pre-defined class labels for each mask during train-ing and evaluation, largely limiting their ability to detect novel objects. Open-world instance segmentation (OWIS) models address this challenge by detecting unknown ob-jects in a class-agnostic manner. However, previous OWIS approaches completely erase category information during training to keep the model’s ability to generalize to un-known objects.In this work, we propose a novel train-ing mechanism termed SegPrompt that uses category infor-mation to improve the model’s class-agnostic segmentation ability for both known and unknown categories. In addition, the previous OWIS training setting exposes the unknown classes to the training set and brings information leakage, which is unreasonable in the real world. Therefore, we pro-vide a new open-world benchmark closer to a real-world scenario by dividing the dataset classes into known-seen-unseen parts. For the first time, we focus on the model’s ability to discover objects that never appear in the training set images.Experiments show that SegPrompt can improve the over-all and unseen detection performance by 5.6% and 6.1% in AR on our new benchmark without affecting the infer-ence efficiency. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on existing cross-dataset transfer and strongly supervised settings, leading to 5.5% and 12.3% relative im-provement.
