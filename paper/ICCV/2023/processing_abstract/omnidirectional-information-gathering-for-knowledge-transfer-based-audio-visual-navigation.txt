Audio-visual navigation is an audio-targeted wayﬁnd-ing task where a robot agent is entailed to travel a never-before-seen 3D environment towards the sounding source.In this article, we present ORAN, an omnidirectional audio-visual navigator based on cross-task navigation skill trans-In particular, ORAN sharpens its two basic abilities fer. for a such challenging task, namely wayﬁnding and audio-visual information gathering. First, ORAN is trained with a conﬁdence-aware cross-task policy distillation (CCPD) strategy. CCPD transfers the fundamental, point-to-point wayﬁnding skill that is well trained on the large-scale Point-Goal task to ORAN, so as to help ORAN to better master audio-visual navigation with far fewer training samples.To improve the efﬁciency of knowledge transfer and ad-dress the domain gap, CCPD is made to be adaptive to the decision conﬁdence of the teacher policy. Second, ORAN is equipped with an omnidirectional information gathering (OIG) mechanism, i.e., gleaning visual-acoustic observa-tions from different directions before decision-making. As a result, ORAN yields more robust navigation behaviour. Tak-ing CCPD and OIG together, ORAN signiﬁcantly outper-forms previous competitors. After the model ensemble, we got 1st in Soundspaces Challenge 2022, improving SPL andSR by 53% and 35% relatively.
