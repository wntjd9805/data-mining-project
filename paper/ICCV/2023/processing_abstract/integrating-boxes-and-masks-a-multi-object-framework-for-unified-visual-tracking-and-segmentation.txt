Tracking any given object(s) spatially and temporally is a common purpose in Visual Object Tracking (VOT) andVideo Object Segmentation (VOS). Joint tracking and seg-mentation have been attempted in some studies but they of-ten lack full compatibility of both box and mask in initial-ization and prediction, and mainly focus on single-object scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper pro-poses a Multi-object Mask-box Integrated framework for unified Tracking and Segmentation, dubbed MITS. Firstly, the unified identification module is proposed to support both box and mask reference for initialization, where de-tailed object information is inferred from boxes or directly retained from masks. Additionally, a novel pinpoint box predictor is proposed for accurate multi-object box pre-diction, facilitating target-oriented representation learning.All target objects are processed simultaneously from encod-ing to propagation and decoding, as a unified pipeline forVOT and VOS. Experimental results show MITS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both VOT and VOS bench-marks. Notably, MITS surpasses the best prior VOT com-petitor by around 6% on the GOT-10k test set, and sig-nificantly improves the performance of box initialization on VOS benchmarks.
