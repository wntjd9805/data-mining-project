This paper addresses the problem of ranking pre-trained models for object detection and image classiﬁcation. Select-ing the best pre-trained model by ﬁne-tuning is an expensive and time-consuming task. Previous works have proposed transferability estimation based on features extracted by the pre-trained models. We argue that quantifying whether the target dataset is in-distribution (IND) or out-of-distribution (OOD) for the pre-trained model is an important factor in the transferability estimation. To this end, we proposeETran, an energy-based transferability assessment metric, which includes three scores: 1) energy score, 2) classiﬁca-tion score, and 3) regression score. We use energy-based models to determine whether the target dataset is OOD orIND for the pre-trained model.In contrast to the prior works, ETran is applicable to a wide range of tasks includ-ing classiﬁcation, regression, and object detection (classi-ﬁcation+regression). This is the ﬁrst work that proposes transferability estimation for object detection task. Our ex-tensive experiments on four benchmarks and two tasks show that ETran outperforms previous works on object detection and classiﬁcation benchmarks by an average of 21% and 12%, respectively, and achieves SOTA in transferability as-sessment.
