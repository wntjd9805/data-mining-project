The absolute depth values of surrounding environments provide crucial cues for various assistive technologies, such as localization, navigation, and 3D structure estimation.We propose that accurate depth estimated from panoramic images can serve as a powerful and light-weight input for a wide range of downstream tasks requiring 3D information.While panoramic images can easily capture the surround-ing context from commodity devices, the estimated depth shares the limitations of conventional image-based depth estimation; the performance deteriorates under large do-main shifts and the absolute values are still ambiguous to infer from 2D observations. By taking advantage of the holistic view, we mitigate such effects in a self-supervised way and fine-tune the network with geometric consistency during the test phase.Specifically, we construct a 3D point cloud from the current depth prediction and project the point cloud at various viewpoints or apply stretches on the current input image to generate synthetic panoramas.Then we minimize the discrepancy of the 3D structure esti-mated from synthetic images without collecting additional data. We empirically evaluate our method in robot navi-gation and map-free localization where our method shows large performance enhancements. Our calibration method can therefore widen the applicability under various exter-nal conditions, serving as a key component for practical panorama-based machine vision systems.
