We propose Social Diffusion, a novel method for short-term and long-term forecasting of the motion of multiple persons as well as their social interactions. Jointly fore-casting motions for multiple persons involved in social ac-tivities is inherently a challenging problem due to the inter-dependencies between individuals. In this work, we lever-age a diffusion model conditioned on motion histories and causal temporal convolutional networks to forecast indi-vidually and contextually plausible motions for all partic-ipants. The contextual plausibility is achieved via an order-invariant aggregation function. As a second contribution, we design a new evaluation protocol that measures the plau-sibility of social interactions which we evaluate on the Hag-gling dataset, which features a challenging social activity where people are actively taking turns to talk and switching their attention. We evaluate our approach on four datasets for multi-person forecasting where our approach outper-forms the state-of-the-art in terms of motion realism and contextual plausibility.
