This paper studies the problem of recovering cameras from a set of fundamental matrices. A set of fundamental matrices is said to be compatible if a set of cameras exists for which they are the fundamental matrices. We focus on the complete graph, where fundamental matrices for each pair of cameras are given. Previous work has established necessary and sufficient conditions for compatibility as rank and eigenvalue conditions on the n-view fundamental ma-trix obtained by concatenating the individual fundamental matrices. In this work, we show that the eigenvalue condi-tion is redundant in the generic and collinear cases. We pro-vide explicit homogeneous polynomials that describe neces-sary and sufficient conditions for compatibility in terms of the fundamental matrices and their epipoles. In this direc-tion, we find that quadruple-wise compatibility is enough to ensure global compatibility for any number of cameras. We demonstrate that for four cameras, compatibility is generi-cally described by triple-wise conditions and one additional equation involving all fundamental matrices.
