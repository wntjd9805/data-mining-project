Retouching images is an essential aspect of enhancing the visual appeal of photos. Although users often share common aesthetic preferences, their retouching methods may vary based on their individual preferences. Therefore, there is a need for white-box approaches that produce sat-isfying results and enable users to conveniently edit their images simultaneously. Recent white-box retouching meth-ods rely on cascaded global filters that provide image-level filter arguments but cannot perform fine-grained retouch-In contrast, colorists typically employ a divide-and-ing. conquer approach, performing a series of region-specific fine-grained enhancements when using traditional tools likeDavinci Resolve. We draw on this insight to develop a white-box framework for photo retouching using parallel region-specific filters, called RSFNet. Our model generates filter arguments (e.g., saturation, contrast, hue) and atten-tion maps of regions for each filter simultaneously. Instead of cascading filters, RSFNet employs linear summations of filters, allowing for a more diverse range of filter classes that can be trained more easily. Our experiments demon-strate that RSFNet achieves state-of-the-art results, offer-ing satisfying aesthetic appeal and increased user conve-nience for editable white-box retouching.
