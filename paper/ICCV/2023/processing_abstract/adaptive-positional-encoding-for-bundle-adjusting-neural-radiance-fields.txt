Neural Radiance Fields have shown great potential to synthesize novel views with only a few discrete image ob-servations of the world. However, the requirement of ac-curate camera parameters to learn scene representationsIn this paper, we present limits its further application. adaptive positional encoding (APE) for bundle-adjusting neural radiance fields to reconstruct the neural radiance fields from unknown camera poses (or even intrinsics). In-spired by Fourier series regression, we investigate its re-lationship with the positional encoding method and there-fore propose APE where all frequency bands are trainable.Furthermore, we introduce period-activated multilayer per-ceptrons (PMLPs) to construct the implicit network for the high-order scene representations and fine-grained gradi-ents during backpropagation. Experimental results on pub-lic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method with APE and PMLPs can outperform the state-of-the-art methods in accurate camera poses and high-fidelity view synthesis.
