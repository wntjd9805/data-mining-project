Most recent unsupervised person re-identification meth-ods maintain a cluster uni-proxy for contrastive learning.However, due to the intra-class variance and inter-class similarity, the cluster uni-proxy is prone to be biased and confused with similar classes, resulting in the learned fea-tures lacking intra-class compactness and inter-class sep-aration in the embedding space. To completely and ac-curately represent the information contained in a cluster and learn discriminative features, we propose to maintain discrepant cluster proxies and multi-instance proxies for a cluster. Each cluster proxy focuses on representing a part of the information, and several discrepant proxies collabo-rate to represent the entire cluster completely. As a com-plement to the overall representation, multi-instance prox-ies are used to accurately represent the fine-grained infor-mation contained in the instances of the cluster. Based on the proposed discrepant cluster proxies, we construct clus-ter contrastive loss to use the proxies as hard positive sam-ples to pull instances of a cluster closer and reduce intra-class variance. Meanwhile, instance contrastive loss is con-structed by global hard negative sample mining in multi-instance proxies to push away the truly indistinguishable classes and decrease inter-class similarity. Extensive exper-iments on Market-1501 and MSMT17 demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.
