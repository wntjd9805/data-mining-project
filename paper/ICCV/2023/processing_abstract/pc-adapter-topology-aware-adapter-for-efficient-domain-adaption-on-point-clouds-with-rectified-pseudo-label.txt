Understanding point clouds captured from the real-world is challenging due to shifts in data distribution caused by varying object scales, sensor angles, and self-occlusion. Prior works have addressed this issue by com-bining recent learning principles such as self-supervised learning, self-training, and adversarial training, which leads to significant computational overhead. Toward suc-cinct yet powerful domain adaptation for point clouds, we revisit the unique challenges of point cloud data under do-main shift scenarios and discover the importance of the global geometry of source data and trends of target pseudo-labels biased to the source label distribution. Motivated by our observations, we propose an adapter-guided do-main adaptation method, PC-Adapter, that preserves the global shape information of the source domain using an attention-based adapter, while learning the local charac-teristics of the target domain via another adapter equipped with graph convolution. Additionally, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling strategy resilient to the classifier bias by adjusting confidence scores using their class-wise confi-dence distributions to consider relative confidences. Our method demonstrates superiority over baselines on vari-ous domain shift settings in benchmark datasets - PointDA,GraspNetPC, and PointSegDA.
