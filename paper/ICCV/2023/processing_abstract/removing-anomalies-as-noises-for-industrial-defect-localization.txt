Unsupervised anomaly detection aims to train models with only anomaly-free images to detect and localize un-seen anomalies. Previous reconstruction-based methods have been limited by inaccurate reconstruction results. This work presents a denoising model to detect and localize the anomalies with a generative diffusion model. In particular, we introduce random noise to overwhelm the anomalous pixels and obtain pixel-wise precise anomaly scores from the intermediate denoising process. We find that the KL di-vergence of the diffusion model serves as a better anomaly score compared with the traditional RGB space score. Fur-thermore, we reconstruct the features from a pre-trained deep feature extractor as our feature level score to improve localization performance. Moreover, we propose a gradi-ent denoising process to smoothly transform an anomalous image into a normal one. Our denoising model outperforms the state-of-the-art reconstruction-based anomaly detection methods for precise anomaly localization and high-quality normal image reconstruction on the MVTec-AD benchmark.
