Mitochondria, as tiny structures within the cell, are of significant importance in studying cell functions for biolog-ical and clinical analysis. And exploring how to automat-ically segment mitochondria in electron microscopy (EM) images has attracted increasing attention. However, most of existing methods struggle to adapt to different scales and appearances of the input due to the inherent limita-tions of the traditional CNN architecture. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel adaptive template trans-former (ATFormer) for mitochondria segmentation. The proposed ATFormer model enjoys several merits. First, the designed structural template learning module can acquire appearance-adaptive templates of background, foreground and contour to sense the characteristics of different shapes of mitochondria. And we further adopt an optimal transport algorithm to enlarge the discrepancy among diverse tem-plates to activate corresponding regions fully. Second, we introduce a hierarchical attention learning mechanism to absorb multi-level information for templates to be adaptive scale-aware classifiers for dense prediction. Extensive ex-perimental results on three challenging benchmarks includ-ing MitoEM, Lucchi and NucMM-Z datasets demonstrate that our ATFormer performs favorably against state-of-the-art mitochondria segmentation methods.Figure 1. Comparison of the previous methods and our method. (a)Most existing methods use the traditional CNN architecture to ex-tract features, with a simple and weight-fixed classifier at the end of the network for per-voxel classification, resulting in incomplete or missing activation. (b) We propose a set of learnable vectors as adaptive templates of background, foreground and contour, which interact with multi-scale features to aggregate structure-aware in-formation. Then, these templates are used as appearance-adaptive scale-aware classifiers to generate more accurate activation for mi-tochondria of different scales.
