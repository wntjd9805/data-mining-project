Initialization 10th iterationRANSAC-based algorithms are the standard techniques for robust estimation in computer vision. These algorithms are iterative and computationally expensive; they alter-nate between random sampling of data, computing hypothe-ses, and running inlier counting. Many authors tried dif-ferent approaches to improve efficiency. One of the ma-jor improvements is having a guided sampling, letting theRANSAC cycle stop sooner. This paper presents a new adaptive sampling process for RANSAC. Previous methods either assume no prior information about the inlier/outlier classification of data points or use some previously com-In this paper, we derive puted scores in the sampling. a dynamic Bayesian network that updates individual data pointsâ€™ inlier scores while iterating RANSAC.

We took a pair from the HPatches dataset [2] and show the updated inlier probabilities of data points (feature matches with color code at the right) over iterations. In the first row, from left to right, we show the probabilities at the start and iteration 10.The second row shows iterations 100 and 1000. For visualization purposes, we show only 250 randomly chosen matches.
