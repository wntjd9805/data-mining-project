Frame I1Frame I2Optical flowCurrent adversarial attacks on motion estimation, or op-tical flow, optimize small per-pixel perturbations, which are unlikely to appear in the real world. In contrast, adverse weather conditions constitute a much more realistic threat scenario. Hence, in this work, we present a novel attack on motion estimation that exploits adversarially optimized par-ticles to mimic weather effects like snowflakes, rain streaks or fog clouds. At the core of our attack framework is a differentiable particle rendering system that integrates par-ticles (i) consistently over multiple time steps (ii) into the 3D space (iii) with a photo-realistic appearance. Through optimization, we obtain adversarial weather that signifi-cantly impacts the motion estimation. Surprisingly, meth-ods that previously showed good robustness towards small per-pixel perturbations are particularly vulnerable to ad-versarial weather. At the same time, augmenting the train-ing with non-optimized weather increases a methodâ€™s ro-bustness towards weather effects and improves generaliz-ability at almost no additional cost.
