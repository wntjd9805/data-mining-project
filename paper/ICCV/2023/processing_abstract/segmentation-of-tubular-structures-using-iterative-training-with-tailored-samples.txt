We propose a minimal path method to simultaneously compute segmentation masks and extract centerlines of tubular structures with line-topology. Minimal path meth-ods are commonly used for the segmentation of tubular structures in a wide variety of applications. Recent meth-ods use features extracted by CNNs, and often outperform methods using hand-tuned features. However, for CNN-based methods, the samples used for training may be gen-erated inappropriately, so that they can be very different from samples encountered during inference. We approach this discrepancy by introducing a novel iterative training scheme, which enables generating better training samples speciÔ¨Åcally tailored for the minimal path methods without changing existing annotations. In our method, segmenta-tion masks and centerlines are not determined after one an-other by post-processing, but obtained using the same steps.Our method requires only very few annotated training im-ages. Comparison with seven previous approaches on three public datasets, including satellite images and medical im-ages, shows that our method achieves state-of-the-art re-sults both for segmentation masks and centerlines.
