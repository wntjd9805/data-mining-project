We propose ∇-RANSAC, a generalized differentiableRANSAC that allows learning the entire randomized ro-bust estimation pipeline. The proposed approach enables the use of relaxation techniques for estimating the gradi-ents in the sampling distribution, which are then propa-gated through a differentiable solver. The trainable quality function marginalizes over the scores from all the models estimated within ∇-RANSAC to guide the network learn-ing accurate and useful inlier probabilities or to train fea-ture detection and matching networks. Our method directly maximizes the probability of drawing a good hypothesis, al-lowing us to learn better sampling distributions. We test∇-RANSAC on various real-world scenarios on fundamen-tal and essential matrix estimation, and 3D point cloud registration, outdoors and indoors, with handcrafted and learning-based features. It is superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy while running at a similar speed to its less accurate alternatives.
