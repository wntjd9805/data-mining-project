This paper addresses the problem of rolling shutter cor-rection in complex nonlinear and dynamic scenes with ex-treme occlusion. Existing methods suffer from two main drawbacks. Firstly, they face challenges in estimating the accurate correction field due to the uniform velocity as-sumption, leading to significant image correction errors under complex motion. Secondly, the drastic occlusion in dynamic scenes prevents current solutions from achiev-ing better image quality because of the inherent difficul-ties in aligning and aggregating multiple frames. To tackle these challenges, we model the curvilinear trajectory of pix-els analytically and propose a geometry-based QuadraticRolling Shutter (QRS) motion solver, which precisely esti-mates the high-order correction field of individual pixels.Besides, to reconstruct high-quality occlusion frames in dy-namic scenes, we present a 3D video architecture that effec-tively Aligns and Aggregates multi-frame context, namely,RSA2-Net. We evaluate our method across a broad range of cameras and video sequences, demonstrating its significant superiority. Specifically, our method surpasses the state-of-the-art by +4.98, +0.77, and +4.33 of PSNR on Carla-RS, Fastec-RS, and BS-RSC datasets, respectively.
