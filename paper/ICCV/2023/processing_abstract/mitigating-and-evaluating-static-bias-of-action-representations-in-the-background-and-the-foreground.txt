In video action recognition, shortcut static features can interfere with the learning of motion features, resulting in poor out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. The video background is clearly a source of static bias, but the video foreground, such as the clothing of the actor, can also pro-vide static bias. In this paper, we empirically verify the ex-istence of foreground static bias by creating test videos with conflicting signals from the static and moving portions of the video. To tackle this issue, we propose a simple yet ef-fective technique, StillMix, to learn robust action represen-tations. Specifically, StillMix identifies bias-inducing video frames using a 2D reference network and mixes them with videos for training, serving as effective bias suppression even when we cannot explicitly extract the source of bias within each video frame or enumerate types of bias. Fi-nally, to precisely evaluate static bias, we synthesize two new benchmarks, SCUBA for static cues in the background, and SCUFO for static cues in the foreground. With exten-sive experiments, we demonstrate that StillMix mitigates both types of static bias and improves video representa-tions for downstream applications.
