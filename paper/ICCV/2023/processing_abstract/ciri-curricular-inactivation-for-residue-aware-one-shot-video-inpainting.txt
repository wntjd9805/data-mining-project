Video inpainting aims at filling in missing regions of a video. However, when dealing with dynamic scenes with camera or object movements, annotating the inpainting target becomes laborious and impractical. In this paper, we resolve the one-shot video inpainting problem in which only one annotated first frame is provided. A naive solu-tion is to propagate the initial target to the other frames with techniques like object tracking. In this context, the main obstacles are the unreliable propagation and the par-tially inpainted artifacts due to the inaccurate mask. For the former problem, we propose curricular inactivation to replace the hard masking mechanism for indicating the in-painting target, which is robust to erroneous predictions in long-term video inpainting. For the latter, we explore the properties of inpainting residue and present an on-*Both authors contributed equally to this research.â€ Corresponding authors: Xuemiao Xu (xuemx@scut.edu.cn) andShengfeng He (shengfenghe@smu.edu.sg). line residue removal method in an iterative detect-and-refine manner. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate the quantitative and qualitative supe-riorities of our proposed method in one-shot video inpaint-ing. More importantly, our method is extremely flexible that can be integrated with arbitrary traditional inpaint-ing models, activating them to perform the reliable one-shot video inpainting task.
