Programs offer compactness and structure that makes them an attractive representation for visual data. We ex-plore how code rewriting can be used to improve systems for inferring programs from visual data. We first proposeSparse Intermittent Rewrite Injection (SIRI), a framework for unsupervised bootstrapped learning. SIRI sparsely ap-plies code rewrite operations over a dataset of training pro-grams, injecting the improved programs back into the train-ing set. We design a family of rewriters for visual pro-gramming domains: parameter optimization, code pruning, and code grafting. For three shape programming languages in 2D and 3D, we show that using SIRI with our family of rewriters improves performance: better reconstructions and faster convergence rates, compared with bootstrapped learning methods that do not use rewriters or use them naively. Finally, we demonstrate that our family of rewrit-ers can be effectively used at test time to improve the output of SIRI predictions. For 2D and 3D CSG, we outperform or match the reconstruction performance of recent domain-specific neural architectures, while producing more parsi-monious programs, that use significantly fewer primitives.
