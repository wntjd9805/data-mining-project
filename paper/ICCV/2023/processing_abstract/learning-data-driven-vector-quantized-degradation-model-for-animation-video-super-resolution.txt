Existing real-world video super-resolution (VSR) meth-ods focus on designing a general degradation pipeline for open-domain videos while ignoring data intrinsic charac-teristics which strongly limit their performance when ap-plying to some specific domains (e.g., animation videos). In this paper, we thoroughly explore the characteristics of an-imation videos and leverage the rich priors in real-world animation data for a more practical animation VSR model.In particular, we propose a multi-scale Vector-QuantizedDegradation model for animation video Super-Resolution (VQD-SR) to decompose the local details from global struc-tures and transfer the degradation priors in real-world animation videos to a learned vector-quantized codebook for degradation modeling. A rich-content Real AnimationLow-quality (RAL) video dataset is collected for extracting the priors. We further propose a data enhancement strat-egy for high-resolution (HR) training videos based on our observation that existing HR videos are mostly collected from the Web which contains conspicuous compression arti-facts. The proposed strategy is valid to lift the upper bound of animation VSR performance, regardless of the specificVSR model. Experimental results demonstrate the superi-ority of the proposed VQD-SR over state-of-the-art meth-ods, through extensive quantitative and qualitative evalua-tions of the latest animation video super-resolution bench-mark.
