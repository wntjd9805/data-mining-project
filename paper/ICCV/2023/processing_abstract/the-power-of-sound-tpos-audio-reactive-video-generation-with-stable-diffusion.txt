In recent years, video generation has become a promi-nent generative tool and has drawn signiﬁcant attention.However, there is little consideration in audio-to-video gen-eration, though audio contains unique qualities like tem-poral semantics and magnitude. Hence, we propose ThePower of Sound (TPoS) model to incorporate audio input that includes both changeable temporal semantics and mag-nitude. To generate video frames, TPoS utilizes a latent stable diffusion model with textual semantic information, which is then guided by the sequential audio embedding from our pretrained Audio Encoder. As a result, this method produces audio reactive video contents. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TPoS across various tasks and compare its results with current state-of-the-art techniques in the ﬁeld of audio-to-video generation.
