Object detection via inaccurate bounding boxes super-vision has boosted a broad interest due to the expensive high-quality annotation data or the occasional inevitabil-ity of low annotation quality (e.g. tiny objects). The previ-ous works usually utilize multiple instance learning (MIL), which highly depends on category information, to select and refine a low-quality box. Those methods suffer from object drift, group prediction and part domination prob-In this pa-lems without exploring spatial information. per, we heuristically propose a Spatial Self-Distillation based Object Detector (SSD-Det) to mine spatial informa-tion to refine the inaccurate box in a self-distillation fash-ion. SSD-Det utilizes a Spatial Position Self-Distillation (SPSD) module to exploit spatial information and an in-teractive structure to combine spatial information and cate-gory information, thus constructing a high-quality proposal bag. To further improve the selection procedure, a Spa-tial Identity Self-Distillation (SISD) module is introduced inSSD-Det to obtain spatial confidence to help select the best proposals. Experiments on MS-COCO and VOC datasets with noisy box annotation verify our methodâ€™s effective-ness and achieve state-of-the-art performance.
