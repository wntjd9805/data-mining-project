Light plays an important role in human well-being.However, most computer vision tasks treat pixels without considering their relationship to physical luminance. To ad-dress this shortcoming, we introduce the Laval PhotometricIndoor HDR Dataset, the first large-scale photometrically calibrated dataset of high dynamic range 360◦ panoramas.Our key contribution is the calibration of an existing, un-calibrated HDR Dataset. We do so by accurately captur-ing RAW bracketed exposures simultaneously with a profes-sional photometric measurement device (chroma meter) for multiple scenes across a variety of lighting conditions. Us-ing the resulting measurements, we establish the calibration coefficients to be applied to the HDR images. The resulting dataset is a rich representation of indoor scenes which dis-plays a wide range of illuminance and color, and varied types of light sources. We exploit the dataset to introduce three novel tasks, where: per-pixel luminance, per-pixel color and planar illuminance can be predicted from a single input image. Finally, we also capture another smaller pho-tometric dataset with a commercial 360◦ camera, to exper-iment on generalization across cameras. We are optimistic that the release of our datasets and associated code will spark interest in physically accurate light estimation within the community.
