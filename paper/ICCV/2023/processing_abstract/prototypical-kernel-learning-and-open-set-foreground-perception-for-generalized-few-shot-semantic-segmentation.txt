Generalized Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (GFSS) extends Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (FSS) to simul-taneously segment unseen classes and seen classes during evaluation. Previous works leverage additional branch or prototypical aggregation to eliminate the constrained set-ting of FSS. However, representation division and embed-ding prejudice, which heavily results in poor performance of GFSS, have not been synthetical considered. We address the aforementioned problems by jointing the prototypical kernel learning and open-set foreground perception. Specif-ically, a group of learnable kernels is proposed to perform segmentation with each kernel in charge of a stuff class.Then, we explore to merge the prototypical learning to the update of base-class kernels, which is consistent with the prototype knowledge aggregation of few-shot novel classes.In addition, a foreground contextual perception module co-operating with conditional bias based inference is adopted to perform class-agnostic as well as open-set foreground detection, thus to mitigate the embedding prejudice and pre-vent novel targets from being misclassified as background.Moreover, we also adjust our method to the Class Incremen-tal Few-shot Semantic Segmentation (CIFSS) which takes the knowledge of novel classes in a incremental stream. Ex-tensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i datasets demonstrate that our method performs better than previous state-of-the-art.
