This paper presents a novel approach to generating the 3D motion of a human interacting with a target object, with a focus on solving the challenge of synthesizing long-range and diverse motions, which could not be fulfilled by exist-ing auto-regressive models or path planning-based meth-ods. We propose a hierarchical generation framework to solve this challenge. Specifically, our framework first gen-erates a set of milestones and then synthesizes the motion along them. Therefore, the long-range motion generation could be reduced to synthesizing several short motion se-quences guided by milestones. The experiments on theNSM, COUCH, and SAMP datasets show that our approach outperforms previous methods by a large margin in both quality and diversity.
