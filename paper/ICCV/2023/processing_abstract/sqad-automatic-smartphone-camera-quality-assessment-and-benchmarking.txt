Smartphone photography is becoming increasingly pop-ular, but fitting high-performing camera systems within the given space limitations remains a challenge for manufactur-ers. As a result, powerful mobile camera systems are in high demand. Despite recent progress in computer vision, camera system quality assessment remains a tedious and manual process. In this paper, we present the Smartphone CameraQuality Assessment Dataset (SQAD), which includes natu-ral images captured by 29 devices. SQAD defines camera system quality based on six widely accepted criteria: res-olution, color accuracy, noise level, dynamic range, PointSpread Function, and aliasing. Built on thorough exami-nations in a controlled laboratory environment, SQAD pro-vides objective metrics for quality assessment, overcoming previous subjective opinion scores. Moreover, we intro-duce the task of automatic camera quality assessment and train deep learning-based models on the collected data to perform a precise quality prediction for arbitrary photos.The dataset, codes and pre-trained models are released at https://github.com/aiff22/SQAD.
