Despite the proven significance of hyperspectral images (HSIs) in performing various computer vision tasks, its po-tential is adversely affected by the low-resolution (LR) prop-erty in the spatial domain, resulting from multiple physical factors. Inspired by recent advancements in deep generative models, we propose an HSI Super-resolution (SR) approach with Conditional Diffusion Models (HSR-Diff) that merges a high-resolution (HR) multispectral image (MSI) with the corresponding LR-HSI. HSR-Diff generates an HR-HSI via repeated refinement, in which the HR-HSI is initialized with pure Gaussian noise and iteratively refined. At each iter-ation, the noise is removed with a Conditional DenoisingTransformer (CDFormer) that is trained on denoising at dif-ferent noise levels, conditioned on the hierarchical feature maps of HR-MSI and LR-HSI. In addition, a progressive learning strategy is employed to exploit the global informa-tion of full-resolution images. Systematic experiments have been conducted on four public datasets, demonstrating thatHSR-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
