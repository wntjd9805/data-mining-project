We show that crowd counting can be viewed as a decom-posable point querying process. This formulation enables arbitrary points as input and jointly reasons whether the points are crowd and where they locate. The querying pro-cessing, however, raises an underlying problem on the num-ber of necessary querying points. Too few imply underesti-mation; too many increase computational overhead. To ad-dress this dilemma, we introduce a decomposable structure, i.e., the point-query quadtree, and propose a new counting model, termed Point quEry Transformer (PET). PET im-plements decomposable point querying via data-dependent quadtree splitting, where each querying point could split into four new points when necessary, thus enabling dy-namic processing of sparse and dense regions. Such a querying process yields an intuitive, universal modeling of crowd as both the input and output are interpretable and steerable. We demonstrate the applications of PET on a number of crowd-related tasks, including fully-supervised crowd counting and localization, partial annotation learn-ing, and point annotation refinement, and also report state-of-the-art performance. For the first time, we show that a single counting model can address multiple crowd-related tasks across different learning paradigms. Code is avail-able at https://github.com/cxliu0/PET.
