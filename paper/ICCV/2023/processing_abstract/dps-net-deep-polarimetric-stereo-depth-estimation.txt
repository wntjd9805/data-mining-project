Stereo depth estimation usually struggles to deal with textureless scenes for both traditional and learning-based methods due to the inherent dependence on image corre-spondence matching. In this paper, we propose a novel neu-ral network, i.e., DPS-Net, to exploit both the prior geo-metric knowledge and polarimetric information for depth estimation with two polarimetric stereo images. Specifi-cally, we construct both RGB and polarization correlation volumes to fully leverage the multi-domain similarity be-tween polarimetric stereo images. Since inherent ambigu-ities exist in the polarization images, we introduce the iso-depth cost explicitly into the network to solve these ambi-guities. Moreover, we design a cascaded dual-GRU archi-tecture to recurrently update the disparity and effectively fuse both the multi-domain correlation features and the iso-depth cost. Besides, we present new synthetic and real po-larimetric stereo datasets for evaluation. Experimental re-sults demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art stereo depth estimation methods.
