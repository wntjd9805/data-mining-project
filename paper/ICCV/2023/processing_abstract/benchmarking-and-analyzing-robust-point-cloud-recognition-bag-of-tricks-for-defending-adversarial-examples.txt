Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) for 3D point cloud recog-nition are vulnerable to adversarial examples, threaten-ing their practical deployment. Despite the many research endeavors have been made to tackle this issue in recent years, the diversity of adversarial examples on 3D point clouds makes them more challenging to defend against than those on 2D images. For examples, attackers can generate adversarial examples by adding, shifting, or re-moving points. Consequently, existing defense strategies are hard to counter unseen point cloud adversarial exam-ples.In this paper, we first establish a comprehensive, and rigorous point cloud adversarial robustness bench-mark to evaluate adversarial robustness, which can pro-vide a detailed understanding of the effects of the defense and attack methods. We then collect existing defense tricks in point cloud adversarial defenses and then perform ex-tensive and systematic experiments to identify an effec-tive combination of these tricks. Furthermore, we pro-pose a hybrid training augmentation methods that con-sider various types of point cloud adversarial examples to adversarial training, significantly improving the adversar-ial robustness. By combining these tricks, we construct a more robust defense framework achieving an average accuracy of 83.45% against various attacks, demonstrat-ing its capability to enabling robust learners.
