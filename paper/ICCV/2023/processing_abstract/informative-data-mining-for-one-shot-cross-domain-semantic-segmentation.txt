Contemporary domain adaptation offers a practical so-lution for achieving cross-domain transfer of semantic seg-mentation between labelled source data and unlabeled tar-get data. These solutions have gained significant pop-ularity; however, they require the model to be retrained when the test environment changes. This can result in unbearable costs in certain applications due to the time-consuming training process and concerns regarding data privacy. One-shot domain adaptation methods attempt to overcome these challenges by transferring the pre-trained source model to the target domain using only one target data. Despite this, the referring style transfer module still faces issues with computation cost and over-fitting prob-lems. To address this problem, we propose a novel frame-work called Informative Data Mining (IDM) that enables efficient one-shot domain adaptation for semantic segmen-tation. Specifically, IDM provides an uncertainty-based se-lection criterion to identify the most informative samples, which facilitates quick adaptation and reduces redundant training. We then perform a model adaptation method using these selected samples, which includes patch-wise mixing and prototype-based information maximization to update the model. This approach effectively enhances adaptation and mitigates the overfitting problem. In general, we pro-vide empirical evidence of the effectiveness and efficiency of IDM. Our approach outperforms existing methods and achieves a new state-of-the-art one-shot performance of 56.7%/55.4% on the GTA5/SYNTHIA to Cityscapes adap-tation tasks, respectively. The code will be released at https://github.com/yxiwang/IDM .
