Single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection aims at separating small targets from clutter backgrounds on infrared images. Recently, deep learning based meth-ods have achieved promising performance on SIRST de-tection, but at the cost of a large amount of training data with expensive pixel-level annotations. To reduce the an-notation burden, we propose the ﬁrst method to achieveSIRST detection with single-point supervision. The core idea of this work is to recover the per-pixel mask of each target from the given single point label by using clustering approaches, which looks simple but is indeed challenging since targets are always insalient and accompanied with background clutters. To handle this issue, we introduce ran-domness to the clustering process by adding noise to the input images, and then obtain much more reliable pseudo masks by averaging the clustered results. Thanks to this“Monte Carlo” clustering approach, our method can ac-curately recover pseudo masks and thus turn arbitrary ful-ly supervised SIRST detection networks into weakly super-vised ones with only single point annotation. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate that our method can be ap-plied to existing SIRST detection networks to achieve com-parable performance with their fully-supervised counter-parts, which reveals that single-point supervision is strong enough for SIRST detection.
