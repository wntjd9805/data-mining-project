In this paper, we propose a novel network, SVDFormer, to tackle two specific challenges in point cloud completion: understanding faithful global shapes from incomplete point clouds and generating high-accuracy local structures. Cur-rent methods either perceive shape patterns using only 3D coordinates or import extra images with well-calibrated in-trinsic parameters to guide the geometry estimation of the missing parts. However, these approaches do not always fully leverage the cross-modal self-structures available for accurate and high-quality point cloud completion. To this end, we first design a Self-view Fusion Network that lever-ages multiple-view depth image information to observe in-complete self-shape and generate a compact global shape.â€ Co-corresponding authorsTo reveal highly detailed structures, we then introduce a re-finement module, called Self-structure Dual-generator, in which we incorporate learned shape priors and geomet-ric self-similarities for producing new points. By perceiv-ing the incompleteness of each point, the dual-path de-sign disentangles refinement strategies conditioned on the structural type of each point. SVDFormer absorbs the wis-dom of self-structures, avoiding any additional paired in-formation such as color images with precisely calibrated camera intrinsic parameters. Comprehensive experiments indicate that our method achieves state-of-the-art perfor-mance on widely-used benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/czvvd/SVDFormer.
