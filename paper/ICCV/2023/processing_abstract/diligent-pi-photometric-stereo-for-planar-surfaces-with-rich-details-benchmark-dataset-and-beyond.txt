Photometric stereo aims to recover detailed surface shapes from images captured under varying illuminations.However, existing real-world datasets primarily focus on evaluating photometric stereo for general non-Lambertian reflectances and feature bulgy shapes that have a cer-tain height. As shape detail recovery is the key strength of photometric stereo over other 3D reconstruction tech-niques, and the near-planar surfaces widely exist in cul-tural relics and manufacturing workpieces, we present a new real-world dataset DiLiGenT-Î  containing 30 near-planar scenes with rich surface details. This dataset en-ables us to evaluate recent photometric stereo methods specifically for their ability to estimate shape details un-der diverse materials and to identify open problems such as near-planar surface normal estimation from uncalibrated photometric stereo and surface detail recovery for translu-cent materials. To inspire future research, this dataset will open soruced at https://photometricstereo. github.io/diligentpi.html.
