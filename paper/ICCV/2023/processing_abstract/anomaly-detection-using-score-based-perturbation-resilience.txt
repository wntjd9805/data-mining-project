Unsupervised anomaly detection is widely studied in in-dustrial applications where anomalous data is difficult to obtain. In particular, reconstruction-based anomaly detec-tion can be a feasible solution if there is no option to use external knowledge, such as extra datasets or pre-trained models. However, reconstruction-based methods have lim-ited utility due to poor detection performance. A score-based model, also known as a denoising diffusion model, recently has shown a high sample quality in the gener-ation task.In this paper, we propose a novel unsuper-vised anomaly detection method leveraging the score-based model. The proposed method shows promising performance without requiring external knowledge. The score, a gradi-ent of the log-likelihood, has a property that is available for anomaly detection. The samples on the data manifold can be restored instantly by the score, even if they are ran-domly perturbed. We call this score-based perturbation re-silience. On the other hand, the samples that deviate from the manifold cannot be restored in the same way. The vari-ation of resilience depending on the sample position can be an indicator to discriminate anomalies. We derive this statement from a geometric perspective. Our method shows superior performance on three benchmark datasets for in-dustrial anomaly detection. Specifically, on MVTec AD, we achieve image-level AUROC of 97.7% and pixel-level AU-ROC of 97.4% outperforming previous works that do not use external knowledge.
