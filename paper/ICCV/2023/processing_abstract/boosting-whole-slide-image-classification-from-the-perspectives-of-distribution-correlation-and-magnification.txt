Bag-based multiple instance learning (MIL) methods have become the mainstream for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classiﬁcation. However, there are still three important is-sues that have not been fully addressed: (1) positive bags with a low positive instance ratio are prone to the inﬂuence of a large number of negative instances; (2) the correla-tion between local and global features of pathology images has not been fully modeled; and (3) there is a lack of ef-fective information interaction between different magniﬁca-In this paper, we propose MILBooster, a powerful tions. dual-scale multi-stage MIL framework to address these is-sues from the perspectives of distribution, correlation, and magniﬁcation. Speciﬁcally, to address issue (1), we pro-pose a plug-and-play bag ﬁlter that effectively increases the positive instance ratio of positive bags. For issue (2), we propose a novel window-based Transformer architec-ture called PiceBlock to model the correlation between lo-cal and global features of pathology images. For issue (3), we propose a dual-branch architecture to process dif-ferent magniﬁcations and design an information interac-tion module called Scale Mixer for efﬁcient information interaction between them. We conducted extensive exper-iments on four clinical WSI classiﬁcation tasks using three datasets. MILBooster achieved new state-of-the-art per-formance on all these tasks.
