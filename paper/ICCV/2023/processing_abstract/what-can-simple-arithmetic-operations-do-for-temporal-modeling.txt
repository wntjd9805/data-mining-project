Temporal modeling plays a crucial role in understand-ing video content. To tackle this problem, previous studies built complicated temporal relations through time sequence thanks to the development of computationally powerful de-vices. In this work, we explore the potential of four sim-ple arithmetic operations for temporal modeling. Specifi-cally, we first capture auxiliary temporal cues by comput-ing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division be-tween pairs of extracted frame features. Then, we extract corresponding features from these cues to benefit the orig-inal temporal-irrespective domain. We term such a simple pipeline as an Arithmetic Temporal Module (ATM), which operates on the stem of a visual backbone with a plug-and-play style. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the instantiation of ATMs and demonstrate that this mod-ule provides powerful temporal modeling capability at a low computational cost. Moreover, the ATM is compatible with both CNNs- and ViTs-based architectures. Our results show that ATM achieves superior performance over sev-eral popular video benchmarks. Specifically, on Something-Something V1, V2 and Kinetics-400, we reach top-1 accu-racy of 65.6%, 74.6%, and 89.4% respectively. The code is available at https://github.com/whwu95/ATM .
