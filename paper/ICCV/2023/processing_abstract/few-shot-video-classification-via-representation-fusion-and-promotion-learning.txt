Recent few-shot video classification (FSVC) works achieve promising performance by capturing similarity across support and query samples with different temporal alignment strategies or learning discriminative features viaTransformer block within each episode. However, they ig-nore two important issues: a) It is difficult to capture rich intrinsic action semantics from a limited number of sup-port instances within each task. b) Redundant or irrelevant frames in videos easily weaken the positive influence of dis-criminative frames. To address these two issues, this pa-per proposes a novel Representation Fusion and PromotionLearning (RFPL) mechanism with two sub-modules: meta-action learning (MAL) and reinforced image representation (RIR). Concretely, during training stage, we perform online learning for seeking a task-shared meta-action bank to en-rich task-specific action representation by injecting global knowledge. Besides, we exploit reinforcement learning to obtain the importance of each frame and refine the repre-sentation. This operation maximizes the contribution of dis-criminative frames to further capture the similarity of sup-port and query samples from the same category. Our RFPL framework is highly flexible that it can be integrated with many existing FSVC methods. Extensive experiments show that RFPL significantly enhances the performance of exist-ing FSVC models when integrated with them.
