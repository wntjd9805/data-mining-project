Text-driven localized editing of 3D objects is particu-larly difficult as locally mixing the original 3D object with the intended new object and style effects without distort-ing the objectâ€™s form is not a straightforward process. To address this issue, we propose a novel NeRF-based model,Blending-NeRF, which consists of two NeRF networks: pre-trained NeRF and editable NeRF. Additionally, we intro-duce new blending operations that allow Blending-NeRF to properly edit target regions which are localized by text. By using a pretrained vision-language aligned model, CLIP, we guide Blending-NeRF to add new objects with varying colors and densities, modify textures, and remove parts of the original object. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Blending-NeRF produces naturally and locally edited 3D objects from various text prompts.
