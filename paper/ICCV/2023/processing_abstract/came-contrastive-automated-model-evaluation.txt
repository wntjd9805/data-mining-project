The Automated Model Evaluation (AutoEval) framework entertains the possibility of evaluating a trained machine learning model without resorting to a labeled testing set.Despite the promise and some decent results, the existingAutoEval methods heavily rely on computing distribution shifts between the unlabelled testing set and the training set.We believe this reliance on the training set becomes another obstacle in shipping this technology to real-world ML de-velopment. In this work, we propose Contrastive AutomaticModel Evaluation (CAME), a novel AutoEval framework that is rid of involving training set in the loop. The core idea of CAME bases on a theoretical analysis which bonds the model performance with a contrastive loss. Further, with extensive empirical validation, we manage to set up a pre-dictable relationship between the two, simply by deducing on the unlabeled/unseen testing set. The resulting frame-work CAME establishes a new SOTA results for AutoEval by surpassing prior work significantly. 1
