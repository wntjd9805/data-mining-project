In this paper, we propose PETRv2, a uniﬁed frame-work for 3D perception from multi-view images. Based onPETR [25], PETRv2 explores the effectiveness of temporal modeling, which utilizes the temporal information of previ-ous frames to boost 3D object detection. More speciﬁcally, we extend the 3D position embedding (3D PE) in PETR for temporal modeling. The 3D PE achieves the temporal alignment on object position of different frames. To support for multi-task learning (e.g., BEV segmentation and 3D lane detection), PETRv2 provides a simple yet effective solution by introducing task-speciﬁc queries, which are initialized under different spaces. PETRv2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D object detection, BEV segmentation and 3D lane detection. Detailed robustness analysis is also con-ducted on PETR framework.
