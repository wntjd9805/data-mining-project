When applying a pre-trained 2D-to-3D human pose lift-ing model to a target unseen dataset, large performance degradation is commonly encountered due to domain shift issues. We observe that the degradation is caused by two factors: 1) the large distribution gap over global positions of poses between the source and target datasets due to vari-ant camera parameters and settings, and 2) the deficient di-versity of local structures of poses in training. To this end, we combine global adaptation and local generalization inPoseDA, a simple yet effective framework of unsupervised domain adaptation for 3D human pose estimation. Specif-ically, global adaptation aims to align global positions of poses from the source domain to the target domain with a proposed global position alignment (GPA) module. And lo-cal generalization is designed to enhance the diversity of 2D-3D pose mapping with a local pose augmentation (LPA) module. These modules bring significant performance im-provement without introducing additional learnable param-eters.In addition, we propose local pose augmentation (LPA) to enhance the diversity of 3D poses following an adversarial training scheme consisting of 1) a augmenta-tion generator that generates the parameters of pre-defined pose transformations and 2) an anchor discriminator to en-sure the reality and quality of the augmented data. Our ap-proach can be applicable to almost all 2D-3D lifting mod-els. PoseDA achieves 61.3 mm of MPJPE on MPI-INF-3DHP under a cross-dataset evaluation setup, improving upon the previous state-of-the-art method by 10.2%.
