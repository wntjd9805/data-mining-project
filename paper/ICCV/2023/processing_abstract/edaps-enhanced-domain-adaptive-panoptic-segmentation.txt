With autonomous industries on the rise, domain adapta-tion of the visual perception stack is an important research direction due to the cost savings promise. Much prior art was dedicated to domain-adaptive semantic segmentation in the synthetic-to-real context. Despite being a crucial out-put of the perception stack, panoptic segmentation has been largely overlooked by the domain adaptation community.Therefore, we revisit well-performing domain adaptation strategies from other fields, adapt them to panoptic segmen-tation, and show that they can effectively enhance panoptic domain adaptation. Further, we study the panoptic network design and propose a novel architecture (EDAPS) designed explicitly for domain-adaptive panoptic segmentation.It uses a shared, domain-robust transformer encoder to facil-itate the joint adaptation of semantic and instance features, but task-specific decoders tailored for the specific require-ments of both domain-adaptive semantic and instance seg-mentation. As a result, the performance gap seen in chal-lenging panoptic benchmarks is substantially narrowed.EDAPS significantly improves the state-of-the-art perfor-mance for panoptic segmentation UDA by a large margin of 20% on SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes and even 72% on the more challenging SYNTHIA-to-Mapillary Vistas. The implemen-tation is available at https://github.com/susaha/edaps.
