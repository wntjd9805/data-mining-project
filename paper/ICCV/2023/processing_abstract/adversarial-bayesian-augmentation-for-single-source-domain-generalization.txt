Generalizing to unseen image domains is a challenging problem primarily due to the lack of diverse training data, inaccessible target data, and the large domain shift that may exist in many real-world settings. As such data augmenta-tion is a critical component of domain generalization meth-ods that seek to address this problem. We present Adversar-ial Bayesian Augmentation (ABA), a novel algorithm that learns to generate image augmentations in the challenging single-source domain generalization setting. ABA draws on the strengths of adversarial learning and Bayesian neural networks to guide the generation of diverse data augmen-tations â€“ these synthesized image domains aid the classi-fier in generalizing to unseen domains. We demonstrate the strength of ABA on several types of domain shift includ-ing style shift, subpopulation shift, and shift in the medi-cal imaging setting. ABA outperforms all previous state-of-the-art methods, including pre-specified augmentations, pixel-based and convolutional-based augmentations. Code: https://github.com/shengcheng/ABA.
