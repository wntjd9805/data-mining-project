In recent years, discriminative self-supervised methods have made significant strides in advancing various visual tasks. The central idea of learning a data encoder that is robust to data distortions/augmentations is straightforward yet highly effective. Although many studies have demon-strated the empirical success of various learning methods, the resulting learned representations can exhibit instability and hinder downstream performance. In this study, we an-alyze discriminative self-supervised methods from a causal perspective to explain these unstable behaviors and propose solutions to overcome them. Our approach draws inspi-ration from prior works that empirically demonstrate the ability of discriminative self-supervised methods to demix ground truth causal sources to some extent. Unlike pre-vious work on causality-empowered representation learn-ing, we do not apply our solutions during the training pro-cess but rather during the inference process to improve time efficiency. Through experiments on both controlled image datasets and realistic image datasets, we show that our pro-posed solutions, which involve tempering a linear transfor-mation with controlled synthetic data, are effective in ad-dressing these issues.
