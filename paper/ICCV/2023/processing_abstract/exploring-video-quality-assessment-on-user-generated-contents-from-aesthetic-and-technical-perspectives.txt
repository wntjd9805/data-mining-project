Which video has better quality?The rapid increase in user-generated content (UGC) videos calls for the development of effective video qual-ity assessment (VQA) algorithms. However, the objective of the UGC-VQA problem is still ambiguous and can be viewed from two perspectives: the technical perspective, measuring the perception of distortions; and the aesthetic perspective, which relates to preference and recommenda-tion on contents. To understand how these two perspectives affect overall subjective opinions in UGC-VQA, we con-duct a large-scale subjective study to collect human quality opinions on the overall quality of videos as well as percep-tions from aesthetic and technical perspectives. The col-lected Disentangled Video Quality Database (DIVIDE-3k) conﬁrms that human quality opinions on UGC videos are universally and inevitably affected by both aesthetic andIn light of this, we propose the technical perspectives.Disentangled Objective Video Quality Evaluator (DOVER) to learn the quality of UGC videos based on the two per-spectives. The DOVER proves state-of-the-art performance in UGC-VQA under very high efﬁciency. With perspective opinions in DIVIDE-3k, we further propose DOVER++, theﬁrst approach to provide reliable clear-cut quality evalua-tions from a single aesthetic or technical perspective.
