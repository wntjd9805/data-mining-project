An authentic face restoration system is becoming in-creasingly demanding in many computer vision appli-cations, e.g., image enhancement, video communication, and taking portrait. Most of the advanced face restora-tion models can recover high-quality faces from low-quality ones but usually fail to faithfully generate realis-tic and high-frequency details that are favored by users.To achieve authentic restoration, we propose IDM, anIteratively learned face restoration system based on denois-ing Diffusion Models (DDMs). We deﬁne the criterion of an authentic face restoration system, and argue that denoising diffusion models are naturally endowed with this property from two aspects: intrinsic iterative reﬁnement and extrin-sic iterative enhancement. Intrinsic learning can preserve the content well and gradually reﬁne the high-quality de-tails, while extrinsic enhancement helps clean the data and improve the restoration task one step further. We demon-strate superior performance on blind face restoration tasks.Beyond restoration, we ﬁnd the authentically cleaned data by the proposed restoration system is also helpful to im-age generation tasks in terms of training stabilization and sample quality. Without modifying the models, we achieve better quality than state-of-the-art on FFHQ and ImageNet generation using either GANs or diffusion models.
