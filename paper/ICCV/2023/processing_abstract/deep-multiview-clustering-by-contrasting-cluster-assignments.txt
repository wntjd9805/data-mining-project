Multiview clustering (MVC) aims to reveal the underly-ing structure of multiview data by categorizing data sam-ples into clusters. Deep learning-based methods exhibit strong feature learning capabilities on large-scale datasets.For most existing deep MVC methods, exploring the invari-ant representations of multiple views is still an intractable problem. In this paper, we propose a cross-view contrastive learning (CVCL) method that learns view-invariant rep-resentations and produces clustering results by contrast-ing the cluster assignments among multiple views. Specif-ically, we first employ deep autoencoders to extract view-dependent features in the pretraining stage. Then, a cluster-level CVCL strategy is presented to explore consistent se-mantic label information among the multiple views in the fine-tuning stage. Thus, the proposed CVCL method is able to produce more discriminative cluster assignments by virtue of this learning strategy. Moreover, we provide a the-oretical analysis of soft cluster assignment alignment. The extensive experimental results obtained on several datasets demonstrate that the proposed CVCL method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.
