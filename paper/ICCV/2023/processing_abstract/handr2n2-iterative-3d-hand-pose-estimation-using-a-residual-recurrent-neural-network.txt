3D hand pose estimation is a critical task in various human-computer interaction applications. Numerous deep learning based estimation models in this domain have been actively explored. However, the existing models follow a non-recurrent scheme and thus require complex architec-tures or redundant parameters in order to achieve accept-able model capacity. To tackle this limitation, this paper proposes HandR2N2, a compact neural network that itera-tively regresses the hand pose using a novel residual recur-rent unit. The recurrent design allows recursive exploita-tion of partial layers to gradually optimize previously esti-mated joint locations.In addition, we exploit graph rea-soning to capture kinematic dependencies between joints for better performance. Experimental results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing meth-ods on three hand pose benchmark datasets in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
