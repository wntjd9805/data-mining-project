We address the problem of aligning real-world 3D data of garments, which benefits many applications such as tex-ture learning, physical parameter estimation, generative modeling of garments, etc. Existing extrinsic methods typi-cally perform non-rigid iterative closest point and struggle to align details due to incorrect closest matches and rigid-ity constraints. While intrinsic methods based on functional maps can produce high-quality correspondences, they work under isometric assumptions and become unreliable for garment deformations which are highly non-isometric. To achieve wrinkle-level as well as texture-level alignment, we present a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage method that lever-ages intrinsic manifold properties with two neural defor-mation fields, in the 3D space and the intrinsic space, re-spectively. The coarse stage performs a 3D fitting, where we leverage intrinsic manifold properties to define a man-ifold deformation field. The coarse fitting then induces a functional map that produces an alignment of intrin-sic embeddings. We further refine the intrinsic alignment with a second neural deformation field for higher accu-racy. We evaluate our method with our captured garment dataset, GarmCap. The method achieves accurate wrinkle-level and texture-level alignment and works for difficult garment types such as long coats.
