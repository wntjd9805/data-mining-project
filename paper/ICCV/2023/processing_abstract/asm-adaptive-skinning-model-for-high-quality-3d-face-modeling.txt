The research fields of parametric face model and 3D face reconstruction have been extensively studied. How-ever, a critical question remains unanswered: how to tai-lor the face model for specific reconstruction settings. We argue that reconstruction with multi-view uncalibrated im-ages demands a new model with stronger capacity. Our study shifts attention from data-dependent 3D MorphableModels (3DMM) to an understudied human-designed skin-ning model. We propose Adaptive Skinning Model (ASM), which redefines the skinning model with more compact and fully tunable parameters. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ASM achieves significantly improved capacity than 3DMM, with the additional advantage of model size and easy implementation for new topology. We achieve state-of-the-art performance with ASM for multi-view reconstruction on the Florence MICC Coop bench-mark. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates the impor-tance of a high-capacity model for fully exploiting abun-dant information from multi-view input in reconstruction.Furthermore, our model with physical-semantic parameters can be directly utilized for real-world applications, such as in-game avatar creation. As a result, our work opens up new research direction for parametric face model and facil-itates future research on multi-view reconstruction.
