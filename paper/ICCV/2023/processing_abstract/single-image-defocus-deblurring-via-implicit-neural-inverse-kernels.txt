Single image defocus deblurring (SIDD) is a challeng-ing task due to the spatially-varying nature of defocus blur, characterized by per-pixel point spread functions (PSFs).Existing deep-learning-based methods for SIDD are limited by either over-ﬁtting due to the lack of model constraints or under-parametrization that restricts their applicability to real-world images. To address the limitations, this pa-per proposes an interpretable approach that explicitly pre-dicts inverse kernels with structural regularization. Moti-vated by the observation that defocus PSFs within an im-age often have similar shapes but different sizes, we repre-sent the inverse kernels linearly over a multi-scale dictio-nary parameterized by implicit neural representations. We predict the corresponding representation coefﬁcients via a duplex scale-recurrent neural network that jointly performsﬁne-to-coarse and coarse-to-ﬁne estimations. Extensive ex-periments demonstrate that our approach achieves excellent performance using a lightweight model.
