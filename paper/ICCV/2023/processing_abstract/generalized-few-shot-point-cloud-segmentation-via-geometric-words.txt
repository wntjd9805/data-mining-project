Existing fully-supervised point cloud segmentation meth-ods suffer in the dynamic testing environment with emerg-ing new classes. Few-shot point cloud segmentation algo-rithms address this problem by learning to adapt to new classes at the sacrifice of segmentation accuracy for the base classes, which severely impedes its practicality. This largely motivates us to present the first attempt at a more practical paradigm of generalized few-shot point cloud seg-mentation, which requires the model to generalize to new categories with only a few support point clouds and si-multaneously retain the capability to segment base classes.We propose the geometric words to represent geometric components shared between the base and novel classes, and incorporate them into a novel geometric-aware seman-tic representation to facilitate better generalization to the new classes without forgetting the old ones. Moreover, we introduce geometric prototypes to guide the segmentation with geometric prior knowledge. Extensive experiments onS3DIS and ScanNet consistently illustrate the superior per-formance of our method over baseline methods. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Pixie8888/GFS-3DSeg_GWs.
