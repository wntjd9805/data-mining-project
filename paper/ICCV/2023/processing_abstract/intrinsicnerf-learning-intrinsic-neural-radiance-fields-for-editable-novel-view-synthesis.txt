Existing inverse rendering combined with neural ren-dering methods can only perform editable novel view syn-thesis on object-specific scenes, while we present intrinsic neural radiance fields, dubbed IntrinsicNeRF, which intro-duce intrinsic decomposition into the NeRF-based neural rendering method and can extend its application to room-scale scenes. Since intrinsic decomposition is a funda-mentally under-constrained inverse problem, we propose a novel distance-aware point sampling and adaptive re-flectance iterative clustering optimization method, which enables IntrinsicNeRF with traditional intrinsic decompo-sition constraints to be trained in an unsupervised manner, resulting in multi-view consistent intrinsic decomposition results. To cope with the problem that different adjacent instances of similar reflectance in a scene are incorrectly clustered together, we further propose a hierarchical clus-tering method with coarse-to-fine optimization to obtain a fast hierarchical indexing representation. It supports com-pelling real-time augmented applications such as recolor-ing and illumination variation. Extensive experiments and editing samples on both object-specific/room-scale scenes∗indicates equal contribution.† indicates corresponding author. and synthetic/real-word data demonstrate that we can ob-tain consistent intrinsic decomposition results and high-fidelity novel view synthesis even for challenging sequences.
