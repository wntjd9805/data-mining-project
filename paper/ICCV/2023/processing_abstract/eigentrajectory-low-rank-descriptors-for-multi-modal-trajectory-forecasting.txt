Capturing high-dimensional social interactions and feasi-ble futures is essential for predicting trajectories. To address this complex nature, several attempts have been devoted to reducing the dimensionality of the output variables via parametric curve fitting such as the B´ezier curve and B-spline function. However, these functions, which originate in computer graphics fields, are not suitable to account for so-cially acceptable human dynamics. In this paper, we presentEigenTrajectory (ET), a trajectory prediction approach that uses a novel trajectory descriptor to form a compact space, known here as ET space, in place of Euclidean space, for representing pedestrian movements. We first reduce the com-plexity of the trajectory descriptor via a low-rank approxi-mation. We transform the pedestrians’ history paths into ourET space represented by spatio-temporal principle compo-nents, and feed them into off-the-shelf trajectory forecasting models. The inputs and outputs of the models as well as social interactions are all gathered and aggregated in the corresponding ET space. Lastly, we propose a trajectory anchor-based refinement method to cover all possible futures in the proposed ET space. Extensive experiments demon-strate that our EigenTrajectory predictor can significantly improve both the prediction accuracy and reliability of ex-isting trajectory forecasting models on public benchmarks, indicating that the proposed descriptor is suited to represent pedestrian behaviors.
