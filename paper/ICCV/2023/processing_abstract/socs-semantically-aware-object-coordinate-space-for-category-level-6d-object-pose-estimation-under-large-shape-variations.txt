Most learning-based approaches to category-level 6D pose estimation are design around normalized object coor-dinate space (NOCS). While being successful, NOCS-based methods become inaccurate and less robust when handling objects of a category containing significant intra-category shape variations. This is because the object coordinates induced by global and rigid alignment of objects are se-mantically incoherent, making the coordinate regression hard to learn and generalize. We propose Semantically-aware Object Coordinate Space (SOCS) built by warping-and-aligning the objects guided by a sparse set of keypoints with semantically meaningful correspondence. SOCS is se-mantically coherent: Any point on the surface of a object can be mapped to a semantically meaningful location inSOCS, allowing for accurate pose and size estimation under large shape variations. To learn effective coordinate regres-sion to SOCS, we propose a novel multi-scale coordinate-based attention network. Evaluations demonstrate that our method is easy to train, well-generalizing for large intra-category shape variations and robust to inter-object occlu-sions.
