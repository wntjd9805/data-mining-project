3D reconstruction techniques have widely been used for digital documentation of archaeological fragments. How-ever, efficient digital capture of fragments remains as a chal-lenge.In this work, we aim to develop a portable, high-throughput, and accurate reconstruction system for efficient digitization of fragments excavated in archaeological sites.To realize high-throughput digitization of large numbers of objects, an effective strategy is to perform scanning and reconstruction in batches. However, effective batch-based scanning and reconstruction face two key challenges: 1) how to correlate partial scans of the same object from mul-tiple batch scans, and 2) how to register and reconstruct complete models from partial scans that exhibit only small overlaps. To tackle these two challenges, we develop a new batch-based matching algorithm that pairs the front and back sides of the fragments, and a new Bilateral BoundaryICP algorithm that can register partial scans sharing very narrow overlapping regions. Extensive validation in labs and testing in excavation sites demonstrate that these de-signs enable efficient batch-based scanning for fragments.We show that such a batch-based scanning and reconstruc-tion pipeline can have immediate applications on digitizing sherds in archaeological excavations.
