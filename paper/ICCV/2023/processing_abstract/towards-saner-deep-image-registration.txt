With recent advances in computing hardware and surges of deep-learning architectures, learning-based deep image registration methods have surpassed their traditional coun-terparts, in terms of metric performance and inference time.However, these methods focus on improving performance measurements such as Dice, resulting in less attention given to model behaviors that are equally desirable for registra-tions, especially for medical imaging. This paper investi-gates these behaviors for popular learning-based deep reg-istrations under a sanity-checking microscope. We ﬁnd that most existing registrations suffer from low inverse consis-tency and nondiscrimination of identical pairs due to overly optimized image similarities. To rectify these behaviors, we propose a novel regularization-based sanity-enforcer method that imposes two sanity checks on the deep model to reduce its inverse consistency errors and increase its dis-criminative power simultaneously. Moreover, we derive a set of theoretical guarantees for our sanity-checked image registration method, with experimental results supporting our theoretical ﬁndings and their effectiveness in increasing the sanity of models without sacriﬁcing any performance.
