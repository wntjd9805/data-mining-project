Single-photon sensors measure light signals at the finest possible resolution â€” individual photons. These sensors in-troduce two major challenges in the form of strong Poisson noise and extremely large data acquisition rates, which are also inherited by downstream computer vision tasks. Pre-vious work has largely focused on solving the image recon-struction problem first and then using off-the-shelf methods for downstream tasks, but the most general solutions that account for motion are costly and not scalable to large data volumes produced by single-photon sensors.This work forgoes the image reconstruction problem. In-stead, we demonstrate computationally light-weight phase-based algorithms for the tasks of edge detection and motion estimation. These methods directly process the raw single-photon data as a 3D volume with a bank of velocity-tuned filters, achieving speed-ups of more than two orders of mag-nitude compared to explicit reconstruction-based methods. https://wisionlab.com/Project webpage: project/eulerian-single-photon-vision/
