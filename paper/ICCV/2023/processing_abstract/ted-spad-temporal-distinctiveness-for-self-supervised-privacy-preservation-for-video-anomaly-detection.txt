Video anomaly detection (VAD) without human monitor-ing is a complex computer vision task that can have a pos-itive impact on society if implemented successfully. While recent advances have made significant progress in solving this task, most existing approaches overlook a critical real-world concern: privacy. With the increasing popularity of artificial intelligence technologies, it becomes crucial to im-plement proper AI ethics into their development. Privacy leakage in VAD allows models to pick up and amplify un-necessary biases related to peopleâ€™s personal information, which may lead to undesirable decision making. In this pa-per, we propose TeD-SPAD, a privacy-aware video anomaly detection framework that destroys visual private informa-In particular, we pro-tion in a self-supervised manner. pose the use of a temporally-distinct triplet loss to promote temporally discriminative features, which complements cur-rent weakly-supervised VAD methods. Using TeD-SPAD, we achieve a positive trade-off between privacy protection and utility anomaly detection performance on three pop-ular weakly supervised VAD datasets: UCF-Crime, XD-Violence, and ShanghaiTech. Our proposed anonymization model reduces private attribute prediction by 32.25% while only reducing frame-level ROC AUC on the UCF-Crime anomaly detection dataset by 3.69%.
