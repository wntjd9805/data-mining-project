There have been many image denoisers using deep neu-ral networks, which outperform conventional model-based methods by large margins. Recently, self-supervised meth-ods have attracted attention because constructing a large real noise dataset for supervised training is an enormous burden. The most representative self-supervised denois-ers are based on blind-spot networks, which exclude the receptive field’s center pixel. However, excluding any in-put pixel is abandoning some information, especially when the input pixel at the corresponding output position is ex-cluded. In addition, a standard blind-spot network fails to reduce real camera noise due to the pixel-wise correlation of noise, though it successfully removes independently dis-tributed synthetic noise. Hence, to realize a more practi-cal denoiser, we propose a novel self-supervised training framework that can remove real noise. For this, we de-rive the theoretic upper bound of a supervised loss where the network is guided by the downsampled blinded output.Also, we design a conditional blind-spot network (C-BSN), which selectively controls the blindness of the network to use the center pixel information. Furthermore, we exploit a random subsampler to decorrelate noise spatially, making the C-BSN free of visual artifacts that were often seen in downsample-based methods. Extensive experiments show that the proposed C-BSN achieves state-of-the-art perfor-mance on real-world datasets as a self-supervised denoiser and shows qualitatively pleasing results without any post-processing or refinement.
