Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) approaches learn the un-derlying 3D representation of a scene and generate photo-realistic novel views with high fidelity. However, most pro-posed settings concentrate on modelling a single object or a single level of a scene. However, in the real world, we may capture a scene at multiple levels, resulting in a lay-ered capture. For example, tourists usually capture a mon-umentâ€™s exterior structure before capturing the inner struc-ture. Modelling such scenes in 3D with seamless switch-ing between levels can drastically improve immersive ex-periences. However, most existing techniques struggle in modelling such scenes. We propose Strata-NeRF, a single neural radiance field that implicitly captures a scene with multiple levels. Strata-NeRF achieves this by conditioning the NeRFs on Vector Quantized (VQ) latent representations which allow sudden changes in scene structure. We evalu-ate the effectiveness of our approach in multi-layered syn-thetic dataset comprising diverse scenes and then further validate its generalization on the real-world RealEstate10K dataset. We find that Strata-NeRF effectively captures stratified scenes, minimizes artifacts, and synthesizes high-fidelity views compared to existing approaches. https://ankitatiisc.github.io/Strata-NeRF/
