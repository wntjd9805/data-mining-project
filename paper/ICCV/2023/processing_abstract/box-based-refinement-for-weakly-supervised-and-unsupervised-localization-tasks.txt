It has been established that training a box-based de-tector network can enhance the localization performance of weakly supervised and unsupervised methods. More-over, we extend this understanding by demonstrating that these detectors can be utilized to improve the original net-work, paving the way for further advancements. To ac-complish this, we train the detectors on top of the net-work output instead of the image data and apply suit-able loss backpropagation. Our findings reveal a signif-icant improvement in phrase grounding for the “what is where by looking” task, as well as various methods of unsupervised object discovery.
