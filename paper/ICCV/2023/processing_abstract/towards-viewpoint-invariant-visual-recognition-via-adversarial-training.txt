Visual recognition models are not invariant to viewpoint changes in the 3D world, as different viewing directions can dramatically affect the predictions given the same object.Compared to 2D transformations, the exploration of 3D viewpoint invariance deserves more attention for its greater practical significance. Motivated by the success of ad-versarial training in promoting model robustness, we pro-pose Viewpoint-Invariant Adversarial Training (VIAT) to improve viewpoint robustness of common image classifiers.By regarding viewpoint transformation as an attack, VIAT is formulated as a minimax optimization problem, where the inner maximization characterizes diverse adversarial view-points by learning a Gaussian mixture distribution based on a new attack GMVFool, while the outer minimization trains a viewpoint-invariant classifier by minimizing the ex-pected loss over the worst-case adversarial viewpoint dis-tributions. To further improve the generalization perfor-mance, a distribution sharing strategy is introduced lever-aging the transferability of adversarial viewpoints across objects. Experiments validate the effectiveness of VIAT in improving the viewpoint robustness of various image clas-sifiers based on the diversity of adversarial viewpoints gen-erated by GMVFool.
