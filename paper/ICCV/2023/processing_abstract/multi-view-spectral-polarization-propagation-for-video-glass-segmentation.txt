In this paper, we present the first polarization-guided video glass segmentation propagation solution (PGVS-Net) that can robustly and coherently propagate glass segmen-tation in RGB-P video sequences. By leveraging spatio-temporal polarization and color information, our method combines multi-view polarization cues and thus can alle-viate the view dependence of single-input intensity vari-ations on glass objects. We demonstrate that our model can outperform glass segmentation on RGB-only video se-quences as well as produce more robust segmentation than per-frame RGB-P single-image segmentation methods. To train and validate PGVS-Net, we introduce a novel RGB-PGlass Video dataset (PGV-117) containing 117 video se-quences of scenes captured with different types of camera paths, lighting conditions, dynamics, and glass types.
