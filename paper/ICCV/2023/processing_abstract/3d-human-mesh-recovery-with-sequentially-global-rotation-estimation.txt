Model-based 3D human mesh recovery aims to recon-struct a 3D human body mesh by estimating its parame-ters from monocular RGB images. Most of recent works adopt the Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) model to regress relative rotations for each body joint along the kine-matics chain. This pipeline needs to transform each rel-ative rotation matrix into a global rotation matrix to ar-ticulate the canonical mesh, and suffers from accumulated errors along the kinematics chain. This paper proposes to directly estimate the global rotation of each joint to avoid error accumulation and pursue better accuracy. The pro-posed Sequentially Global Rotation Estimation (SGRE) di-rectly predicts the global rotation matrix of each joint on the kinematics chain. SGRE features a residual learning module to leverage complementary features and previously predicted rotations of parent joints to guide the estimation of subsequent child joints. Thanks to this global estimation pipeline and residual learning module, SGRE alleviates er-ror accumulation and produces more accurate 3D human mesh. It can be flexibly integrated into existing regression-based methods and achieves superior performance on vari-ous benchmarks. For example, it improves the latest method 3DCrowdNet by 3.3 mm MPJPE and 5.0 mm PVE on 3DPW dataset and 3.0 AP on COCO dataset, respectivelyâ€ .
