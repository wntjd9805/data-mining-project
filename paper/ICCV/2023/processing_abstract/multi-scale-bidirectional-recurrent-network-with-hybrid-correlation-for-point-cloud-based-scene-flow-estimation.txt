Scene flow estimation provides the fundamental motion perception of a dynamic scene, which is of practical im-portance in many computer vision applications.In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bidirectional recur-rent architecture that iteratively optimizes the coarse-to-fine scene flow estimation. In each resolution scale of es-timation, a novel bidirectional gated recurrent unit is pro-posed to bidirectionally and iteratively augment point fea-tures and produce progressively optimized scene flow. The optimization of each iteration is integrated with the hy-brid correlation that captures not only local correlation but also semantic correlation for more accurate estima-tion. Experimental results indicate that our proposed archi-tecture significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches on both FlyingThings3D and KITTI bench-marks while maintaining superior time efficiency.
