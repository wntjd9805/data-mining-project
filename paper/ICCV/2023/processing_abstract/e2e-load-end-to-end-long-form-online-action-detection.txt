Recently, feature-based methods for Online Action De-tection (OAD) have been gaining traction. However, these methods are constrained by their fixed backbone de-sign, which fails to leverage the potential benefits of a trainable backbone.This paper introduces an end-to-end learning network that revises these approaches, in-corporating a backbone network design that improves ef-fectiveness and efficiency. Our proposed model utilizes a shared initial spatial model for all frames and maintains an extended sequence cache, which enables low-cost in-ference. We promote an asymmetric spatiotemporal model that caters to long-form and short-form modeling. Ad-ditionally, we propose an innovative and efficient infer-ence mechanism that accelerates extensive spatiotempo-ral exploration. Through comprehensive ablation studies and experiments, we validate the performance and effi-ciency of our proposed method. Remarkably, we achieve an end-to-end learning OAD of 17.3 (+12.6) FPS with 72.4% (+1.2%), 90.3% (+0.7%), and 48.1% (+26.0%) mAP on THMOUSâ€™14, TVSeries, and HDD, respectively.The source code is available at https://github. com/sqiangcao99/E2E-LOAD.
