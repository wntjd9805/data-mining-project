Secret message 00100110…Novel viewsExtracted message 00100110…Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have the potential to be a major representation of media. Since training a NeRF has never been an easy task, the protection of its modelIn this paper, by analyz-copyright should be a priority. ing the pros and cons of possible copyright protection solu-tions, we propose to protect the copyright of NeRF models by replacing the original color representation in NeRF with a watermarked color representation. Then, a distortion-resistant rendering scheme is designed to guarantee robust message extraction in 2D renderings of NeRF. Our pro-posed method can directly protect the copyright of NeRF models while maintaining high rendering quality and bit ac-curacy when compared among optional solutions.
