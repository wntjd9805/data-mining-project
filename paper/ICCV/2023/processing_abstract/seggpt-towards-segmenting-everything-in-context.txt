We present SegGPT, a generalist model for segmenting ev-erything in context. We unify various segmentation tasks into a generalist in-context learning framework that accommo-dates different kinds of segmentation data by transforming them into the same format of images. The training of Seg-GPT is formulated as an in-context coloring problem with random color mapping for each data sample. The objec-tive is to accomplish diverse tasks according to the context, rather than relying on specific colors. After training, Seg-GPT can perform arbitrary segmentation tasks in images*Equal contribution.

SegGPT is evaluated on a broad range of tasks, including few-shot semantic segmenta-tion, video object segmentation, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. Our results show strong capabilities in segmenting in-domain and out-of-domain targets, either qualitatively or quantitatively.
