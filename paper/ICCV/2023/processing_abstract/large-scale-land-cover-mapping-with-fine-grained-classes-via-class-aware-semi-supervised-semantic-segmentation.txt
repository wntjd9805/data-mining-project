Semi-supervised learning has attracted increasing atten-tion in the large-scale land cover mapping task. How-ever, existing methods overlook the potential to alleviate the class imbalance problem by selecting a suitable set of un-labeled data. Besides, in class-imbalanced scenarios, ex-isting pseudo-labeling methods mostly only pick confident samples, failing to exploit the hard samples during train-ing. To tackle these issues, we propose a unified Class-Aware Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation framework.The proposed framework consists of three key components.To construct a better semi-supervised learning dataset, we propose a class-aware unlabeled data selection method that is more balanced towards the minority classes. Based on the built dataset with improved class balance, we propose a Class-Balanced Cross Entropy loss, jointly considering the annotation bias and the class bias to re-weight the loss in both sample and class levels to alleviate the class im-balance problem. Moreover, we propose the Class Cen-ter Contrast method to jointly utilize the labeled and un-labeled data. Specifically, we decompose the feature em-bedding space using the ground truth and pseudo-labels, and employ the embedding centers for hard and easy sam-ples of each class per image in the contrast loss to exploit the hard samples during training. Compared with state-of-the-art class-balanced pseudo-labeling methods, the pro-posed method improves the mean accuracy and mIoU by 4.28% and 1.70%, respectively, on the large-scale Sentinel-2 dataset with 24 land cover classes.
