Unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) with the aid of pseudo labeling techniques has emerged as a crucial ap-proach for domain-adaptive 3D object detection. While ef-fective, existing DA methods suffer from a substantial drop in performance when applied to a multi-class training set-ting, due to the co-existence of low-quality pseudo labels and class imbalance issues. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing a novel ReDB framework tailored for learning to detect all classes at once. Our approach produces Reliable, Diverse, and class-Balanced pseudo 3D boxes to iteratively guide the self-training on a distribu-tionally different target domain. To alleviate disruptions caused by the environmental discrepancy (e.g., beam num-bers), the proposed cross-domain examination (CDE) as-sesses the correctness of pseudo labels by copy-pasting tar-get instances into a source environment and measuring the prediction consistency. To reduce computational overhead and mitigate the object shift (e.g., scales and point densi-ties), we design an overlapped boxes counting (OBC) metric that allows to uniformly downsample pseudo-labeled ob-jects across different geometric characteristics. To confront the issue of inter-class imbalance, we progressively aug-ment the target point clouds with a class-balanced set of pseudo-labeled target instances and source objects, which boosts recognition accuracies on both frequently appearing and rare classes. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets using both voxel-based (i.e., SECOND) and point-based 3D detectors (i.e., PointRCNN) demonstrate that our proposed ReDB approach outperforms existing 3D domain adaptation methods by a large margin, improving 23.15% mAP on the nuScenes â†’ KITTI task.
