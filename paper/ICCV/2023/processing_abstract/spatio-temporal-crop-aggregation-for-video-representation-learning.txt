We propose Spatio-temporal Crop Aggregation for video representation LEarning (SCALE), a novel method that en-joys high scalability at both training and inference time.Our model builds long-range video features by learning from sets of video clip-level features extracted with a pre-trained backbone. To train the model, we propose a self-supervised objective consisting of masked clip feature pre-dictions. We apply sparsity to both the input, by extracting a random set of video clips, and to the loss function, by only reconstructing the sparse inputs. Moreover, we use di-mensionality reduction by working in the latent space of a pre-trained backbone applied to single video clips. These techniques make our method not only extremely efficient to train but also highly effective in transfer learning. We demonstrate that our video representation yields state-of-the-art performance with linear, nonlinear, and k-NN prob-ing on common action classification and video understand-ing datasets.
