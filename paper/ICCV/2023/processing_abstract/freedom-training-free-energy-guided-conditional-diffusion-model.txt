Recently, conditional diffusion models have gained pop-ularity in numerous applications due to their exceptional generation ability. However, many existing methods are training-required. They need to train a time-dependent clas-sifier or a condition-dependent score estimator, which in-creases the cost of constructing conditional diffusion mod-els and is inconvenient to transfer across different condi-tions. Some current works aim to overcome this limita-tion by proposing training-free solutions, but most can only be applied to a specific category of tasks and not to more general conditions.In this work, we propose a training-Free conditional Diffusion Model (FreeDoM) used for var-ious conditions. Specifically, we leverage off-the-shelf pre-trained networks, such as a face detection model, to con-struct time-independent energy functions, which guide the generation process without requiring training. Further-more, because the construction of the energy function is very flexible and adaptable to various conditions, our pro-posed FreeDoM has a broader range of applications than existing training-free methods. FreeDoM is advantageous in its simplicity, effectiveness, and low cost. Experiments demonstrate that FreeDoM is effective for various condi-tions and suitable for diffusion models of diverse data do-mains, including image and latent code domains.
