Multi-view image generation attracts particular atten-tion these days due to its promising 3D-related applications, e.g., image viewpoint editing. Most existing methods fol-low a paradigm where a 3D representation is first synthe-sized, and then rendered into 2D images to ensure photo-consistency across viewpoints. However, such explicit bias for photo-consistency sacrifices photo-realism, causing ge-ometry artifacts and loss of fine-scale details when these methods are applied to edit real images. To address this issue, we propose ray conditioning, a geometry-free alter-native that relaxes the photo-consistency constraint. Our method generates multi-view images by conditioning a 2DGAN on a light field prior. With explicit viewpoint control, state-of-the-art photo-realism and identity consistency, our method is particularly suited for the viewpoint editing task.
