Deep learning methods have shown remarkable per-formance in image denoising, particularly when trained on large-scale paired datasets. However, acquiring such paired datasets for real-world scenarios poses a significant challenge. Although unsupervised approaches based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) offer a promising solution for denoising without paired datasets, they are dif-ficult in surpassing the performance limitations of conven-tional GAN-based unsupervised frameworks without signif-icantly modifying existing structures or increasing the com-putational complexity of denoisers. To address this prob-lem, we propose a self-collaboration (SC) strategy for mul-tiple denoisers. This strategy can achieve significant perfor-mance improvement without increasing the inference com-plexity of the GAN-based denoising framework. Its basic idea is to iteratively replace the previous less powerful de-noiser in the filter-guided noise extraction module with the current powerful denoiser. This process generates better synthetic clean-noisy image pairs, leading to a more pow-erful denoiser for the next iteration. In addition, we pro-pose a baseline method that includes parallel generative adversarial branches with complementary “self-synthesis” and “unpaired-synthesis” constraints. This baseline en-sures the stability and effectiveness of the training net-work. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art unsupervised methods. https://github.com/linxin0/SCPGabNet
