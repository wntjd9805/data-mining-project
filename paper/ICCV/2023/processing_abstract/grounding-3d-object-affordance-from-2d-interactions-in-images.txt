Grounding 3D object affordance seeks to locate objects’“action possibilities” regions in the 3D space, which serves as a link between perception and operation for embodied agents. Existing studies primarily focus on connecting vi-sual affordances with geometry structures, e.g., relying on annotations to declare interactive regions of interest on the object and establishing a mapping between the regions and affordances. However, the essence of learning object af-fordance is to understand how to use it, and the manner that detaches interactions is limited in generalization. Nor-mally, humans possess the ability to perceive object affor-dances in the physical world through demonstration images or videos. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel task set-ting: grounding 3D object affordance from 2D interactions in images, which faces the challenge of anticipating affor-dance through interactions of different sources. To address this problem, we devise a novel Interaction-driven 3D Affor-dance Grounding Network (IAG), which aligns the region feature of objects from different sources and models the in-teractive contexts for 3D object affordance grounding. Be-sides, we collect a Point-Image Affordance Dataset (PIAD) to support the proposed task. Comprehensive experiments on PIAD demonstrate the reliability of the proposed task and the superiority of our method. The project is available at https://github.com/yyvhang/IAGNet.
