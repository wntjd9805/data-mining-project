Single-CameraDense 3D reconstruction and ego-motion estimation are key challenges in autonomous driving and robotics. Com-pared to the complex, multi-modal systems deployed today, multi-camera systems provide a simpler, low-cost alterna-tive. However, camera-based 3D reconstruction of com-plex dynamic scenes has proven extremely difficult, as ex-isting solutions often produce incomplete or incoherent re-sults. We propose R3D3, a multi-camera system for dense 3D reconstruction and ego-motion estimation. Our ap-proach iterates between geometric estimation that exploits spatial-temporal information from multiple cameras, and monocular depth refinement. We integrate multi-camera feature correlation and dense bundle adjustment operators that yield robust geometric depth and pose estimates. To improve reconstruction where geometric depth is unreli-able, e.g. for moving objects or low-textured regions, we introduce learnable scene priors via a depth refinement net-work. We show that this design enables a dense, consistent 3D reconstruction of challenging, dynamic outdoor envi-ronments. Consequently, we achieve state-of-the-art dense depth prediction on the DDAD and NuScenes benchmarks.
