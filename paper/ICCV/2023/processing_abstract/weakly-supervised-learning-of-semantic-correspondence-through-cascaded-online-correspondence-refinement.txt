Caltech-UCSD Birds [Technical Report 2010]CUB describes fine-grained bird species.PF-PASCAL & PF-WILLOW [TPAMI 2017]PFs describe 20 classes of common object.In this paper, we develop a weakly supervised learning algorithm to learn robust semantic correspondences from large-scale datasets with only image-level labels. Following the spirit of multiple instance learning (MIL), we decom-pose the weakly supervised correspondence learning prob-lem into three stages: image-level matching, region-level matching, and pixel-level matching. We propose a novel cascaded online correspondence reﬁnement algorithm to integrate MIL and the correspondence ﬁltering and reﬁne-ment procedure into a single deep network and train this network end-to-end with only image-level supervision, i.e., without point-to-point matching information. During the correspondence learning process, pixel-to-pixel matching pairs inferred from weak supervision are propagated, ﬁl-tered, and enhanced through masked correspondence vot-ing and calibration. Besides, we design a correspondence consistency check algorithm to select images with discrim-inative key points to generate pseudo-labels for classical matching algorithms. Finally, we ﬁlter out about 110,000 images from the ImageNet ILSVRC training set to for-mulate a new dataset, called SC-ImageNet. Experiments on several popular benchmarks indicate that pre-training on SC-ImageNet can improve the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms efﬁciently.
