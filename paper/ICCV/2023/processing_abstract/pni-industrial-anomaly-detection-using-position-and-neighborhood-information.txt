Because anomalous samples cannot be used for train-ing, many anomaly detection and localization methods use pre-trained networks and non-parametric modeling to esti-mate encoded feature distribution. However, these meth-ods neglect the impact of position and neighborhood in-formation on the distribution of normal features. To over-come this, we propose a new algorithm, PNI, which es-timates the normal distribution using conditional proba-bility given neighborhood features, modeled with a multi-layer perceptron network. Moreover, position informa-tion is utilized by creating a histogram of representative features at each position.Instead of simply resizing the anomaly map, the proposed method employs an additional refine network trained on synthetic anomaly images to bet-ter interpolate and account for the shape and edge of the input image. We conducted experiments on the MVTecAD benchmark dataset and achieved state-of-the-art per-formance, with 99.56% and 98.98% AUROC scores in anomaly detection and localization, respectively.
