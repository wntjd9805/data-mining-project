Creating graphic layouts is a fundamental step in graphic designs. In this work, we present a novel generative model named LayoutDiffusion for automatic layout genera-tion. As layout is typically represented as a sequence of dis-crete tokens, LayoutDiffusion models layout generation as a discrete denoising diffusion process. It learns to reverse a mild forward process, in which layouts become increasingly chaotic with the growth of forward steps and layouts in the neighboring steps do not differ too much. Designing such a mild forward process is however very challenging as lay-out has both categorical attributes and ordinal attributes.To tackle the challenge, we summarize three critical factors for achieving a mild forward process for the layout, i.e., le-gality, coordinate proximity and type disruption. Based on the factors, we propose a block-wise transition matrix cou-pled with a piece-wise linear noise schedule. Experiments on RICO and PubLayNet datasets show that LayoutDiffu-sion outperforms state-of-the-art approaches significantly. it enables two conditional layout generationMoreover, tasks in a plug-and-play manner without re-training and achieves better performance than existing methods.
