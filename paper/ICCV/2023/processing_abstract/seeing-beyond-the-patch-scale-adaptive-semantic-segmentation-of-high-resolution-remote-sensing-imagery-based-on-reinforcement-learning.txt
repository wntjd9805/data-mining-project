In remote sensing imagery analysis, patch-based meth-ods have limitations in capturing information beyond theThis shortcoming poses a significant sliding window. challenge in processing complex and variable geo-objects, which results in semantic inconsistency in segmentation re-sults. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic scale perception framework, named GeoAgent, which adap-tively captures appropriate scale context information out-side the image patch based on the different geo-objects. InGeoAgent, each image patch’s states are represented by a global thumbnail and a location mask. The global thumb-nail provides context beyond the patch, and the location mask guides the perceived spatial relationships. The scale-selection actions are performed through a Scale ControlAgent (SCA). A feature indexing module is proposed to en-hance the ability of the agent to distinguish the current im-age patch’s location. The action switches the patch scale and context branch of a dual-branch segmentation network that extracts and fuses the features of multi-scale patches.The GeoAgent adjusts the network parameters to perform the appropriate scale-selection action based on the reward received for the selected scale. The experimental results, using two publicly available datasets and our newly con-structed dataset WUSU, demonstrate that GeoAgent out-performs previous segmentation methods, particularly for large-scale mapping applications.
