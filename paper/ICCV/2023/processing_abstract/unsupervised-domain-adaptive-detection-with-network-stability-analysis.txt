Domain adaptive detection aims to improve the general-ity of a detector, learned from the labeled source domain, on the unlabeled target domain. In this work, drawing inspi-ration from the concept of stability from the control theory that a robust system requires to remain consistent both ex-ternally and internally regardless of disturbances, we pro-pose a novel framework that achieves unsupervised domain adaptive detection through stability analysis. In specific, we treat discrepancies between images and regions from differ-ent domains as disturbances, and introduce a novel simple but effective Network Stability Analysis (NSA) framework that considers various disturbances for domain adaptation.Particularly, we explore three types of perturbations includ-ing heavy and light image-level disturbances and instance-level disturbance. For each type, NSA performs external consistency analysis on the outputs from raw and perturbed images and/or internal consistency analysis on their fea-tures, using teacher-student models. By integrating NSA into Faster R-CNN, we immediately achieve state-of-the-art results. In particular, we set a new record of 52.7% mAP on Cityscapes-to-FoggyCityscapes, showing the potential ofNSA for domain adaptive detection.It is worth noticing, our NSA is designed for general purpose, and thus applica-ble to one-stage detection model (e.g., FCOS) besides the adopted one, as shown by experiments.
