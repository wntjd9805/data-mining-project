Curvilinear object segmentation is critical for many ap-plications. However, manually annotating curvilinear ob-jects is very time-consuming and error-prone, yielding in-sufficiently available annotated datasets for existing super-vised methods and domain adaptation methods. This pa-per proposes a self-supervised curvilinear object segmen-tation method (FreeCOS) that learns robust and distinc-tive features from fractals and unlabeled images. The key contributions include a novel Fractal-FDA synthesis (FFS) module and a geometric information alignment (GIA) ap-proach. FFS generates curvilinear structures based on the parametric Fractal L-system and integrates the generated structures into unlabeled images to obtain synthetic train-ing images via Fourier Domain Adaptation. GIA reduces the intensity differences between the synthetic and unla-beled images by comparing the intensity order of a given pixel to the values of its nearby neighbors. Such image alignment can explicitly remove the dependency on abso-lute intensity values and enhance the inherent geometric characteristics which are common in both synthetic and real images. In addition, GIA aligns features of synthetic and real images via the prediction space adaptation loss (PSAL) and the curvilinear mask contrastive loss (CMCL).Extensive experimental results on four public datasets, i.e.,XCAD, DRIVE, STARE and CrackTree demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised meth-ods, self-supervised methods and traditional methods by a large margin.
