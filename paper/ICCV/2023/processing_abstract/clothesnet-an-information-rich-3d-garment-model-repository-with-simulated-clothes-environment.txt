We present ClothesNet: a large-scale dataset of 3D clothes objects with information-rich annotations. Our dataset consists of around 4400 models covering 11 cat-egories annotated with clothes features, boundary lines, and keypoints.ClothesNet can be used to facili-tate a variety of computer vision and robot interaction tasks. Using our dataset, we establish benchmark tasks for clothes perception, including classification, bound-ary line segmentation, and keypoint detection, and de-velop simulated clothes environments for robotic interac-tion tasks, including rearranging, folding, hanging, and dressing. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our Clothes-NetSupplemental materi-als and dataset are available on our project webpage at https://sites.google.com/view/clothesnet. in real-world experiments.
