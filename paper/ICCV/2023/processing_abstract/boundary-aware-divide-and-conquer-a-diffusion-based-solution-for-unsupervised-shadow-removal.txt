Recent deep learning methods have achieved superior results in shadow removal. However, most of these su-pervised methods rely on training over a huge amount of shadow and shadow-free image pairs, which require labo-rious annotations and may end up with poor model gen-eralization. Shadows, in fact, only form partial degrada-tion in images, while their non-shadow regions provide rich structural information potentially for unsupervised learn-ing.In this paper, we propose a novel diffusion-based solution for unsupervised shadow removal, which sepa-rately modeling the shadow, non-shadow, and their bound-ary regions. We employ a pretrained unconditional diffu-sion model fused with non-corrupted information to gen-erate the natural shadow-free image. While the diffusion model can restore the clear structure in the boundary re-gion by utilizing its adjacent non-corrupted contextual in-formation, it fails to address the inner shadow area due to the isolation of the non-corrupted contexts. Thus we further propose a Shadow-Invariant Intrinsic Decomposition mod-ule to exploit the underlying reflectance in the shadow re-gion to maintain structural consistency during the diffusive sampling. Extensive experiments on the publicly available shadow removal datasets show that the proposed method achieves a significant improvement compared to existing unsupervised methods, and even is comparable with some existing supervised methods.
