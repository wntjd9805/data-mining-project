OriginalCycleGANCyEDARCFNGANHEDNGANImage retrieval methods based on CNN descriptors rely on metric learning from a large number of diverse exam-ples of positive and negative image pairs. Domains, such as night-time images, with limited availability and variability of training data suffer from poor retrieval performance even with methods performing well on standard benchmarks. We propose to train a GAN-based synthetic-image generator, translating available day-time image examples into night images. Such a generator is used in metric learning as a form of augmentation, supplying training data to the scarce domain. Various types of generators are evaluated and an-alyzed. We contribute with a novel light-weight GAN archi-tecture that enforces the consistency between the original and translated image through edge consistency. The pro-posed architecture also allows a simultaneous training of an edge detector that operates on both night and day images.To further increase the variability in the training examples and to maximize the generalization of the trained model, we propose a novel method of diverse anchor mining.The proposed method improves over the state-of-the-art results on a standard Tokyo 24/7 day-night retrieval bench-mark while preserving the performance on Oxford and Paris datasets. This is achieved without the need of training im-age pairs of matching day and night images. The source code is available at https://github.com/mohwald/gandtr.
