This paper presents one of the ﬁrst learning-based NeRF 3D instance segmentation pipelines, dubbed as InstanceNeural Radiance Field, or Instance-NeRF. Taking a NeRF pretrained from multi-view RGB images as input, Instance-NeRF can learn 3D instance segmentation of a given scene, represented as an instance ﬁeld component of the NeRF model. To this end, we adopt a 3D proposal-based mask prediction network on the sampled volumetric features fromNeRF, which generates discrete 3D instance masks. The coarse 3D mask prediction is then projected to image space to match 2D segmentation masks from different views gen-erated by existing panoptic segmentation models, which are used to supervise the training of the instance ﬁeld. No-tably, beyond generating consistent 2D segmentation maps from novel views, Instance-NeRF can query instance infor-mation at any 3D point, which greatly enhances NeRF ob-ject segmentation and manipulation. Our method is also one of the ﬁrst to achieve such results in pure inference.Experimented on synthetic and real-world NeRF datasets with complex indoor scenes, Instance-NeRF surpasses pre-vious NeRF segmentation works and competitive 2D seg-mentation methods in segmentation performance on un-seen views.
