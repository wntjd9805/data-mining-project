Cross-View Geo-Localisation is still a challenging task where additional modules, specific pre-processing or zoom-ing strategies are necessary to determine accurate posi-tions of images. Since different views have different ge-ometries, pre-processing like polar transformation helps to merge them. However, this results in distorted images which then have to be rectified. Adding hard negatives to the training batch could improve the overall performance but with the default loss functions in geo-localisation it is dif-ficult to include them. In this work, we present a simpli-fied but effective architecture based on contrastive learn-ing with symmetric InfoNCE loss that outperforms current state-of-the-art results. Our framework consists of a nar-row training pipeline that eliminates the need of using ag-gregation modules, avoids further pre-processing steps and even increases the capacity of generalisation of the model to unknown regions. We introduce two types of sampling strategies for hard negatives. The first explicitly exploits ge-ographically neighboring locations to provide a good start-ing point. The second leverages the visual similarity be-tween the image embeddings in order to mine hard negative samples. Our work shows excellent performance on com-mon cross-view datasets like CVUSA, CVACT, University-1652 and VIGOR. A comparison between cross-area and same-area settings demonstrate the good generalisation ca-pability of our model.Figure 1: Our two sampling strategies. The first is based on the geographical distance between the satellite images. The second uses the cosine similarity between the street-view and satellite view embeddings to find hard negatives within a margin.
