InputOutputImagesRecognizing objects from sparse and noisy events be-comes extremely difﬁcult when paired images and cate-gory labels do not exist.In this paper, we study label-free event-based object recognition where category labels and paired images are not available. To this end, we pro-pose a joint formulation of object recognition and image reconstruction in a complementary manner. Our methodﬁrst reconstructs images from events and performs ob-ject recognition through Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), enabling better recognition through a rich context of images. Since the category information is es-sential in reconstructing images, we propose category-guided attraction loss and category-agnostic repulsion loss to bridge the textual features of predicted categories and the visual features of reconstructed images using CLIP.Moreover, we introduce a reliable data sampling strategy and local-global reconstruction consistency to boost joint learning of two tasks. To enhance the accuracy of pre-diction and quality of reconstruction, we also propose a prototype-based approach using unpaired images. Exten-sive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method and its extensibility for zero-shot object recognition. Our project code is available at https://github.com/Chohoonhee/Ev-LaFOR.
