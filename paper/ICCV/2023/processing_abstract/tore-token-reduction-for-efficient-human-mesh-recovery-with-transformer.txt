In this paper, we introduce a set of simple yet effec-tive TOken REduction (TORE) strategies for Transformer-based Human Mesh Recovery from monocular images. Cur-rent SOTA performance is achieved by Transformer-based structures. However, they suffer from high model complex-ity and computation cost caused by redundant tokens. We propose token reduction strategies based on two important aspects, i.e., the 3D geometry structure and 2D image fea-ture, where we hierarchically recover the mesh geometry with priors from body structure and conduct token cluster-ing to pass fewer but more discriminative image feature to-kens to the Transformer. Our method massively reduces the number of tokens involved in high-complexity interactions in the Transformer. This leads to a significantly reduced computational cost while still achieving competitive or even higher accuracy in shape recovery. Extensive experiments across a wide range of benchmarks validate the superior ef-fectiveness of the proposed method. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our method on hand mesh recovery.Visit our project page at https://frank-zy-dou. github.io/projects/Tore/index.html.
