Real-world single image denoising is crucial and practi-cal in computer vision. Bayesian inversions combined with score priors now have proven effective for single image de-noising but are limited to white Gaussian noise. Moreover, applying existing score-based methods for real-world de-noising requires not only the explicit train of score priors on the target domain but also the careful design of sampling procedures for posterior inference, which is complicated and impractical. To address these limitations, we propose a score priors-guided deep variational inference, namelyScoreDVI, for practical real-world denoising. By consid-ering the deep variational image posterior with a Gaussian form, score priors are extracted based on easily accessi-ble minimum MSE Non-i.i.d Gaussian denoisers and varia-tional samples, which in turn facilitate optimizing the varia-tional image posterior. Such a procedure adaptively applies cheap score priors to denoising. Additionally, we exploit a Non-i.i.d Gaussian mixture model and variational noise posterior to model the real-world noise. This scheme also enables the pixel-wise fusion of multiple image priors and variational image posteriors. Besides, we develop a noise-aware prior assignment strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight of image priors in the optimization. Our method outperforms other single image-based real-world denoising methods and achieves comparable performance to dataset-based unsupervised methods.
