Illumination planning in photometric stereo aims to find a balance between surface normal estimation accuracy and image capturing efficiency by selecting optimal light config-urations. It depends on factors such as the unknown shape and general reflectance of the target object, global illumina-tion, and the choice of photometric stereo backbones, which are too complex to be handled by existing methods based on handcrafted illumination planning rules. This paper pro-poses a learning-based illumination planning method that jointly considers these factors via integrating a neural net-work and a generalized image formation model. As it is impractical to supervise illumination planning due to the enormous search space for ground truth light configura-tions, we formulate illumination planning using reinforce-ment learning, which explores the light space in a photomet-ric stereo-aware and reward-driven manner. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that pho-tometric stereo under the 20-light configurations from our method is comparable to, or even surpasses that of using lights from all available directions.
