We present the first active learning tool for fine-grained 3D part labeling, a problem which challenges even the most advanced deep learning (DL) methods due to the signifi-cant structural variations among the intricate parts. For the same reason, the necessary effort to annotate training data is tremendous, motivating approaches to minimize human involvement. Our labeling tool iteratively verifies or mod-ifies part labels predicted by a deep neural network, with human feedback continually improving the network predic-tion. To effectively reduce human efforts, we develop two novel features in our tool, hierarchical and symmetry-aware active labeling. Our human-in-the-loop approach, coinedHAL3D, achieves close to error-free fine-grained annota-tions on any test set with pre-defined hierarchical part la-bels, with 80% time-saving over manual effort. We will re-lease the finely labeled models to serve the community.
