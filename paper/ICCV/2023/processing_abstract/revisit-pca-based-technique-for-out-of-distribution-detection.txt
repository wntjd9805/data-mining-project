Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a desired ability to ensure the reliability and safety of intelligent systems. A scoring function is often designed to measure the degree of any new data being an OOD sample. While most designed scoring functions are based on a single source of informa-tion (e.g., the classifierâ€™s output, logits, or feature vector), recent studies demonstrate that fusion of multiple sources may help better detect OOD data. In this study, after de-tailed analysis of the issue in OOD detection by the con-ventional principal component analysis (PCA), we propose fusing a simple regularized PCA-based reconstruction er-ror with other source of scoring function to further improveOOD detection performance. In particular, when combined with a strong energy score-based OOD method, the reg-ularized reconstruction error helps achieve new state-of-the-art OOD detection results on multiple standard bench-marks. The code is available at https://github.com/SYSU-MIA-GROUP/pca-based-out-of-distribution-detection.
