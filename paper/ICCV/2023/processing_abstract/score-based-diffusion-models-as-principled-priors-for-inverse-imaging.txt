Priors are essential for reconstructing images from noisy and/or incomplete measurements. The choice of the prior determines both the quality and uncertainty of recovered images. We propose turning score-based diffusion models into principled image priors (“score-based priors”) for an-alyzing a posterior of images given measurements. Previ-ously, probabilistic priors were limited to handcrafted reg-ularizers and simple distributions. In this work, we empir-ically validate the theoretically-proven probability function of a score-based diffusion model. We show how to sam-ple from resulting posteriors by using this probability func-tion for variational inference. Our results, including exper-iments on denoising, deblurring, and interferometric imag-ing, suggest that score-based priors enable principled in-ference with a sophisticated, data-driven image prior.
