Recent deep learning-based optical flow estimators have exhibited impressive performance in generating local flows between consecutive frames. However, the estimation of long-range flows between distant frames, particularly un-der complex object deformation and large motion occlu-sion, remains a challenging task. One promising solution is to accumulate local flows explicitly or implicitly to ob-tain the desired long-range flow. Nevertheless, the accumu-lation errors and flow misalignment can hinder the effec-tiveness of this approach. This paper proposes a novel re-current framework called AccFlow, which recursively back-ward accumulates local flows using a deformable module called as AccPlus. In addition, an adaptive blending mod-ule is designed along with AccPlus to alleviate the occlusion effect by backward accumulation and rectify the accumula-tion error. Notably, we demonstrate the superiority of back-ward accumulation over conventional forward accumula-tion, which to the best of our knowledge has not been explic-itly established before. To train and evaluate the proposedAccFlow, we have constructed a large-scale high-quality dataset named CVO, which provides ground-truth optical flow labels between adjacent and distant frames. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of AccFlow in han-dling long-range optical flow estimation. Codes are avail-able at https://github.com/mulns/AccFlow.
