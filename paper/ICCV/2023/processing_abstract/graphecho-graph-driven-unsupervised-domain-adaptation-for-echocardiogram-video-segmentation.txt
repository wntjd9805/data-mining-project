Echocardiogram video segmentation plays an important role in cardiac disease diagnosis. This paper studies the unsupervised domain adaption (UDA) for echocardiogram video segmentation, where the goal is to generalize the model trained on the source domain to other unlabelled target domains. Existing UDA segmentation methods are not suitable for this task because they do not model lo-cal information and the cyclical consistency of heartbeat.In this paper, we introduce a newly collected CardiacUDA dataset and a novel GraphEcho method for cardiac struc-ture segmentation. Our GraphEcho comprises two innova-tive modules, the Spatial-wise Cross-domain Graph Match-ing (SCGM) and the Temporal Cycle Consistency (TCC) module, which utilize prior knowledge of echocardiogram videos, i.e., consistent cardiac structure across patients and centers and the heartbeat cyclical consistency, respec-tively. These two modules can better align global and lo-cal features from source and target domains, leading to improved UDA segmentation results. Experimental results showed that our GraphEcho outperforms existing state-of-the-art UDA segmentation methods. Our collected dataset and code will be publicly released upon acceptance. This work will lay a new and solid cornerstone for cardiac structure segmentation from echocardiogram videos. Code and dataset are available at : https://github.com/xmed-lab/GraphEcho
