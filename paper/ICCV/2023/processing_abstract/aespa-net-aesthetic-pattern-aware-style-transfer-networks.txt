To deliver the artistic expression of the target style, re-cent studies exploit the attention mechanism owing to its ability to map the local patches of the style image to the corresponding patches of the content image. However, be-cause of the low semantic correspondence between arbi-trary content and artworks, the attention module repeatedly abuses speciﬁc local patches from the style image, result-ing in disharmonious and evident repetitive artifacts. To overcome this limitation and accomplish impeccable artis-tic style transfer, we focus on enhancing the attention mech-anism and capturing the rhythm of patterns that organize the style. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely pattern repeatability, that quantiﬁes the repetition of pat-terns in the style image. Based on the pattern repeatabil-ity, we propose Aesthetic Pattern-Aware style transfer Net-works (AesPA-Net) that discover the sweet spot of local and global style expressions. In addition, we propose a novel self-supervisory task to encourage the attention mechanism* Corresponding author (cid:2) First author email to learn precise and meaningful semantic correspondence.Lastly, we introduce the patch-wise style loss to transfer the elaborate rhythm of local patterns. Through qualita-tive and quantitative evaluations, we verify the reliability of the proposed pattern repeatability that aligns with human perception, and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework. All codes and pre-trained weights are available at Kibeom-Hong/AesPA-Net.
