To represent the biological variability of clinical neu-roimaging populations, it is vital to be able to combine data across scanners and studies. However, different MRI scan-ners produce images with different characteristics, resulting in a domain shift known as the ‘harmonisation problem’.Additionally, neuroimaging data is inherently personal in nature, leading to data privacy concerns when sharing the data. To overcome these barriers, we propose an Unsu-pervised Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) method,SFHarmony. Through modelling the imaging features as aGaussian Mixture Model and minimising an adapted Bhat-tacharyya distance between the source and target features, we can create a model that performs well for the target data whilst having a shared feature representation across the data domains, without needing access to the source data for adaptation or target labels. We demonstrate the performance of our method on simulated and real domain shifts, showing that the approach is applicable to classi-fication, segmentation and regression tasks, requiring no changes to the algorithm. Our method outperforms ex-isting SFDA approaches across a range of realistic data scenarios, demonstrating the potential utility of our ap-proach for MRI harmonisation and general SFDA prob-lems.
