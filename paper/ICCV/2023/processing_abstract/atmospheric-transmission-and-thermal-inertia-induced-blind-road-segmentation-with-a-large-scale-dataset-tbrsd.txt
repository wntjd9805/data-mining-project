Computer vision-based walking assistants are prominen-t tools for aiding visually impaired people in navigation.Blind road segmentation is a key element in these walking assistant systems. However, most walking assistant systems rely on visual light images, which is dangerous in weak illu-mination environments such as darkness or fog. To address this issue and enhance the safety of vision-based walking assistant systems, we developed a thermal infrared blind road segmentation neural network (TINN). In contrast to conventional segmentation techniques that primarily con-centrate on enhancing feature extraction and perception, our approach is geared towards preserving the inherent radiation characteristics within the thermal imaging pro-cess.Initially, we modelled two critical factors in ther-mal infrared imaging - thermal light atmospheric trans-mission and thermal inertia effect. Subsequently, we use an encoder-decoder architecture to fuse the feathers ex-tracted by the two modules. Additionally, to train the net-work and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we constructed a large-scale thermal infrared blind road segmentation dataset named TBRSD consists 5180 pixel-level manual annotations. The experimental results demon-strate that our method outperforms existing techniques and achieves state-of-the-art performance in thermal blind road segmentation, as validated on benchmark thermal infrared semantic segmentation datasets such as MFNet and SO-DA. The dataset and our code are both publicly available in https://github.com/chenjzBUAA/TBRSD or http://xzbai.buaa.edu.cn/datasets.html.
