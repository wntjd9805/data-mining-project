Although existing stereo matching models have achieved continuous improvement, they often face issues related to trustworthiness due to the absence of uncertainty estima-tion. Additionally, effectively leveraging multi-scale and multi-view knowledge of stereo pairs remains unexplored.In this paper, we introduce the Evidential Local-globalFusion (ELF) framework for stereo matching, which en-dows both uncertainty estimation and confidence-aware fu-sion with trustworthy heads.Instead of predicting the disparity map alone, our model estimates an evidential-based disparity considering both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. With the normal inverse-Gamma distribu-tion as a bridge, the proposed framework realizes intra evidential fusion of multi-level predictions and inter evi-dential fusion between cost-volume-based and transformer-based stereo matching. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed framework exploits multi-view informa-tion effectively and achieves state-of-the-art overall per-formance both on accuracy and cross-domain generaliza-tion.
