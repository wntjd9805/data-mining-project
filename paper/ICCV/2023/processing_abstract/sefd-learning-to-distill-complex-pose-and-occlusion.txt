This paper addresses the problem of three-dimensional (3D) human mesh estimation in complex poses and oc-cluded situations.Although many improvements have been made in 3D human mesh estimation using the two-dimensional (2D) pose with occlusion between humans, occlusion from complex poses and other objects remains a consistent problem. Therefore, we propose the novelSkinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) Edge Feature Dis-tillation (SEFD) that demonstrates robustness to complex poses and occlusions, without increasing the number of pa-rameters compared to the baseline model. The model gen-erates an SMPL overlapping edge similar to the ground truth that contains target person boundary and occlusion information, performing subsequent feature distillation in a simple edge map. We also perform experiments on var-ious benchmarks and exhibit fidelity both qualitatively and quantitatively. Extensive experiments prove that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 2.8% in MPJPE and 1.9% in MPVPE on a benchmark 3DPW dataset in the presence of domain gap. Also, our method is superior in 3DPW-OCC, 3DPW-PC, RH-Dataset, OCHuman, Crowd-Pose, and LSP dataset in which occlusion, complex pose, and domain gap exist.
