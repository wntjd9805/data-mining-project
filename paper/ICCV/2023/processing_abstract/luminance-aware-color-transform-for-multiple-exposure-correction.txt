Images captured with irregular exposures inevitably present unsatisfactory visual effects, such as distorted hue and color tone. However, most recent studies mainly fo-cus on underexposure correction, which limits their ap-plicability to real-world scenarios where exposure levels vary. Furthermore, some works to tackle multiple expo-sure rely on the encoder-decoder architecture, resulting in losses of details in input images during down-sampling and up-sampling processes. With this regard, a novel cor-rection algorithm for multiple exposure, called luminance-aware color transform (LACT), is proposed in this study.First, we reason the relative exposure condition between images to obtain luminance features based on a luminance comparison module. Next, we encode the set of transfor-mation functions from the luminance features, which en-able complex color transformations for both overexposure and underexposure images. Finally, we project the trans-formed representation onto RGB color space to produce exposure correction results. Extensive experiments demon-strate that the proposed LACT yields new state-of-the-arts on two multiple exposure datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/whdgusdl48/LACT.
