This paper proposes a new method to infer keypoints from arbitrary object categories in practical scenarios where point cloud data (PCD) are noisy, down-sampled and arbitrarily rotated. Our proposed model adheres i) keypoints inference is to the following principles: fully unsupervised (no annotation given), ii) keypoints position error should be low and resilient to PCD per-turbations (robustness), iii) keypoints should not change their indexes for the intra-class objects (semantic coher-ence), iv) keypoints should be close to or proximal toPCD surface (compactness). We achieve these desider-ata by proposing a new self-supervised training strategy for keypoints estimation that does not assume any a priori knowledge of the object class, and a model ar-chitecture with coupled auxiliary losses that promotes the desired keypoints properties. We compare the key-points estimated by the proposed approach with those of the state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches. The experiments show that our approach outperforms by es-timating keypoints with improved coverage (+9.41%) while being semantically consistent (+4.66%) that best characterize the objectâ€™s 3D shape for downstream tasks.Code and data are available at: https://github.com/IIT-PAVIS/SC3K
