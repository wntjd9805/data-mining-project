Facial sketch synthesis (FSS) aims to generate a vivid sketch portrait from a given facial photo. Existing FSS methods merely rely on 2D representations of facial seman-tic or appearance. However, professional human artists usually use outlines or shadings to covey 3D geometry.Thus facial 3D geometry (e.g. depth map) is extremely im-portant for FSS. Besides, different artists may use diverse drawing techniques and create multiple styles of sketches; but the style is globally consistent in a sketch.Inspired by such observations, in this paper, we propose a novelHuman-Inspired Dynamic Adaptation (HIDA) method. Spe-cially, we propose to dynamically modulate neuron acti-vations based on a joint consideration of both facial 3D geometry and 2D appearance, as well as globally consis-tent style control. Besides, we use deformable convolutions at coarse-scales to align deep features, for generating ab-stract and distinct outlines. Experiments show that HIDA can generate high-quality sketches in multiple styles, and significantly outperforms previous methods, over a large range of challenging faces. Besides, HIDA allows pre-cise style control of the synthesized sketch, and general-izes well to natural scenes and other artistic styles.
