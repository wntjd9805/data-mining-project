Robust estimation is a crucial and still challenging task, which involves estimating model parameters in noisy envi-ronments. Although conventional sampling consensus-based algorithms sample several times to achieve robustness, these algorithms cannot use data features and historical informa-tion effectively. In this paper, we propose RLSAC, a novelReinforcement Learning enhanced SAmple Consensus frame-work for end-to-end robust estimation. RLSAC employs a graph neural network to utilize both data and memory fea-tures to guide exploring directions for sampling the next minimum set. The feedback of downstream tasks serves as the reward for unsupervised training. Therefore, RL-SAC can avoid differentiating to learn the features and the feedback of downstream tasks for end-to-end robust esti-mation. In addition, RLSAC integrates a state transition module that encodes both data and memory features. Our experimental results demonstrate that RLSAC can learn from features to gradually explore a better hypothesis. Through analysis, it is apparent that RLSAC can be easily trans-ferred to other sampling consensus-based robust estimation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, RLSAC is also the first method that uses reinforcement learning to sample consen-sus for end-to-end robust estimation.
