the claimed operating domain,Although complex-valued convolutional neural networks (iCNNs) have existed for a while, they lack proper complex-valued image inputs and loss functions.In addition, all their operations are not complex-valued as they have both complex-valued convolutional layers and real-valued fully-connected layers. As a result, they lack an end-to-endﬂow of complex-valued information, making them incon-sistent w.r.t. i.e., com-plex numbers. Considering these inconsistencies, we pro-pose a complex-valued color model and loss function and turn fully-connected layers into convolutional lay-ers. All these contributions culminate in what we callFCCNs (Fully Complex-valued Convolutional Networks), which take complex-valued images as inputs, perform only complex-valued operations, and have a complex-valued loss function. Thus, our proposed FCCNs have an end-to-end ﬂow of complex-valued information, which lacks in existing iCNNs. Our extensive experiments on ﬁve image classiﬁcation benchmark datasets show that FCCNs consis-tently perform better than existing iCNNs. Code is available at https://github.com/saurabhya/FCCNs.
