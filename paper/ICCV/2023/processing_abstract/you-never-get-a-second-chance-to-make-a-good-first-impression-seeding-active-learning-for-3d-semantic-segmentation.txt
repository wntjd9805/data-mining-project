Core-SetReDALWe propose SeedAL, a method to seed active learning for efficient annotation of 3D point clouds for semantic seg-mentation. Active Learning (AL) iteratively selects rele-vant data fractions to annotate within a given budget, but requires a first fraction of the dataset (a ’seed’) to be al-ready annotated to estimate the benefit of annotating other data fractions. We first show that the choice of the seed can significantly affect the performance of many AL meth-ods. We then propose a method for automatically con-structing a seed that will ensure good performance for AL.Assuming that images of the point clouds are available, which is common, our method relies on powerful unsuper-vised image features to measure the diversity of the point clouds. It selects the point clouds for the seed by optimiz-ing the diversity under an annotation budget, which can be done by solving a linear optimization problem. Our exper-iments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach com-pared to random seeding and existing methods on both theS3DIS and SemanticKitti datasets.
