Rotated object detection aims to identify and locate ob-In this sce-jects in images with arbitrary orientation. nario, the oriented directions of objects vary consider-ably across different images, while multiple orientations of objects exist within an image. This intrinsic charac-teristic makes it challenging for standard backbone net-works to extract high-quality features of these arbitrar-ily orientated objects. In this paper, we present AdaptiveRotated Convolution (ARC) module to handle the afore-In our ARC module, the convo-mentioned challenges. lution kernels rotate adaptively to extract object features with varying orientations in different images, and an effi-cient conditional computation mechanism is introduced to accommodate the large orientation variations of objects within an image. The two designs work seamlessly in ro-tated object detection problem. Moreover, ARC can con-veniently serve as a plug-and-play module in various vi-sion backbones to boost their representation ability to de-tect oriented objects accurately. Experiments on commonly used benchmarks (DOTA and HRSC2016) demonstrate that equipped with our proposed ARC module in the backbone network, the performance of multiple popular oriented ob-ject detectors is significantly improved (e.g. +3.03% mAP on Rotated RetinaNet and +4.16% on CFA). Combined with the highly competitive method Oriented R-CNN, the pro-posed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DOTA dataset with 81.77% mAP.
