Geometric frameworks for analyzing curves are com-mon in applications as they focus on invariant features and provide visually satisfying solutions to standard problems such as computing invariant distances, averaging curves, or registering curves. We show that for any smooth curve in Rd, d > 1, the generalized curvatures associated with the Frenet-Serret equation can be used to define a Rieman-nian geometry that takes into account all the geometric fea-tures of the shape. This geometry is based on a Square RootCurvature Transform that extends the square root-velocity transform for Euclidean curves (in any dimensions) and provides likely geodesics that avoid artefacts encountered by representations using only first-order geometric infor-mation. Our analysis is supported by simulated data and is especially relevant for analyzing human motions. We con-sider trajectories acquired from sign language, and show the interest of considering curvature and also torsion in their analysis, both being physically meaningful.
