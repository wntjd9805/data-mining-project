Forecasting future trajectories of agents in complex traf-fic scenes requires reliable and efficient predictions for all agents in the scene. However, existing methods for trajec-tory prediction are either inefficient or sacrifice accuracy.To address this challenge, we propose ADAPT, a novel ap-proach for jointly predicting the trajectories of all agents in the scene with dynamic weight learning. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both single-agent and multi-agent settings on the Argoverse and Interaction datasets, with a fraction of their computational overhead.We attribute the improvement in our performance: first, to the adaptive head augmenting the model capacity without increasing the model size; second, to our design choices in the endpoint-conditioned prediction, reinforced by gradient stopping. Our analyses show that ADAPT can focus on each agent with adaptive prediction, allowing for accurate pre-dictions efficiently. https:// KUIS-AI.github.io/ adapt
