In this work, we introduce CC3D, a conditional genera-tive model that synthesizes complex 3D scenes conditioned on 2D semantic scene layouts, trained using single-view im-ages. Different from most existing 3D GANs that limit their applicability to aligned single objects, we focus on generat-ing complex scenes with multiple objects, by modeling the compositional nature of 3D scenes. By devising a 2D layout-based approach for 3D synthesis and implementing a new 3D ﬁeld representation with a stronger geometric inductive bias, we have created a 3D GAN that is both efﬁcient and of high quality, while allowing for a more controllable genera-tion process. Our evaluations on synthetic 3D-FRONT and real-world KITTI-360 datasets demonstrate that our model generates scenes of improved visual and geometric quality in comparison to previous works.
