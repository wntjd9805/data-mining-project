Weird, unusual, and uncanny images pique the curios-ity of observers because they challenge commonsense. For example, an image released during the 2022 world cup de-picts the famous soccer stars Lionel Messi and CristianoRonaldo playing chess, which playfully violates our expec-tation that their competition should occur on the football field.1 Humans can easily recognize and interpret these un-conventional images, but can AI models do the same? We introduce WHOOPS!, a new dataset and benchmark for vi-sual commonsense. The dataset is comprised of purpose-fully commonsense-defying images created by designers us-ing publicly-available image generation tools like Midjour-ney. We consider several tasks posed over the dataset. In addition to image captioning, cross-modal matching, and visual question answering, we introduce a difficult explana-tion generation task, where models must identify and ex-plain why a given image is unusual. Our results show that state-of-the-art models such as GPT3 and BLIP2 still lag behind human performance on WHOOPS!. We hope our dataset will inspire the development of AI models with stronger visual commonsense reasoning abilities. 2
