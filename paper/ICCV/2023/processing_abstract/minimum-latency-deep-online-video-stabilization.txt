We present a novel camera path optimization framework for the task of online video stabilization. Typically, a sta-bilization pipeline consists of three steps: motion estimat-ing, path smoothing, and novel view rendering. Most pre-vious methods concentrate on motion estimation, proposing various global or local motion models.In contrast, path optimization receives relatively less attention, especially in the important online setting, where no future frames are available. In this work, we adopt recent off-the-shelf high-quality deep motion models for motion estimation to re-cover the camera trajectory and focus on the latter two steps. Our network takes a short 2D camera path in a sliding window as input and outputs the stabilizing warp field of the last frame in the window, which warps the com-ing frame to its stabilized position. A hybrid loss is well-defined to constrain the spatial and temporal consistency.In addition, we build a motion dataset that contains stable and unstable motion pairs for the training. Extensive ex-periments demonstrate that our approach significantly out-performs state-of-the-art online methods both qualitatively and quantitatively and achieves comparable performance to offline methods.
