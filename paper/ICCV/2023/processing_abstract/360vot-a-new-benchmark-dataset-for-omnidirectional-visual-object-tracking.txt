360◦ images can provide an omnidirectional field of view which is important for stable and long-term scene percep-tion. In this paper, we explore 360◦ images for visual ob-ject tracking and perceive new challenges caused by large distortion, stitching artifacts, and other unique attributes of 360◦ images. To alleviate these problems, we take ad-vantage of novel representations of target localization, i.e., bounding field-of-view, and then introduce a general 360 tracking framework that can adopt typical trackers for om-nidirectional tracking. More importantly, we propose a new large-scale omnidirectional tracking benchmark dataset, 360VOT, in order to facilitate future research. 360VOT con-tains 120 sequences with up to 113K high-resolution frames in equirectangular projection. The tracking targets cover 32 categories in diverse scenarios. Moreover, we provide 4 types of unbiased ground truth, including (rotated) bound-ing boxes and (rotated) bounding field-of-views, as well as new metrics tailored for 360◦ images which allow for the accurate evaluation of omnidirectional tracking perfor-mance. Finally, we extensively evaluated 20 state-of-the-art visual trackers and provided a new baseline for future com-parisons. Homepage: https://360vot.hkustvgd.com
