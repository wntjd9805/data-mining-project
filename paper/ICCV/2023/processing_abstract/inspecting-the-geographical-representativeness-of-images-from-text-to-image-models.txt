Recent progress in generative models has resulted in models that produce both realistic as well as relevant im-ages for most textual inputs. These models are being used to generate millions of images everyday, and hold the po-tential to drastically impact areas such as generative art, digital marketing and data augmentation. Given their out-sized impact, it is important to ensure that the generated content reflects the artifacts and surroundings across the globe, rather than over-representing certain parts of the world. In this paper, we measure the geographical repre-sentativeness of common nouns (e.g., a house) generated through DALL·E 2 and Stable Diffusion models using a crowdsourced study comprising 540 participants across 27 countries. For deliberately underspecified inputs without country names, the generated images most reflect the sur-roundings of the United States followed by India, and the top generations rarely reflect surroundings from all other countries (average score less than 3 out of 5). Specifying the country names in the input increases the representativeness by 1.44 points on average on a 5 − point Likert scale forDALL·E 2 and 0.75 for Stable Diffusion, however, the over-all scores for many countries still remain low, highlighting the need for future models to be more geographically inclu-sive. Lastly, we examine the feasibility of quantifying the geographical representativeness of generated images with-out conducting user studies.1
