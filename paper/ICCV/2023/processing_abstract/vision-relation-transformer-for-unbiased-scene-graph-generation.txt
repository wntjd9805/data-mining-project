Recent years have seen a growing interest in SceneGraph Generation (SGG), a comprehensive visual scene understanding task that aims to predict entity relationships using a relation encoder-decoder pipeline stacked on top of an object encoder-decoder backbone. Unfortunately, cur-rent SGG methods suffer from an information loss regarding the entities’ local-level cues during the relation encoding process. To mitigate this, we introduce the Vision rElationTransfOrmer (VETO), consisting of a novel local-level en-tity relation encoder. We further observe that many existingSGG methods claim to be unbiased, but are still biased to-wards either head or tail classes. To overcome this bias, we introduce a Mutually Exclusive ExperT (MEET) learning strategy that captures important relation features without bias towards head or tail classes. Experimental results on the VG and GQA datasets demonstrate that VETO + MEET boosts the predictive performance by up to 47% over the state of the art while being ∼ 10× smaller.1
