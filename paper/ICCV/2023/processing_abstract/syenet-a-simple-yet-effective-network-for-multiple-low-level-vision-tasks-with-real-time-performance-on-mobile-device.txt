With the rapid development of AI hardware accelerators, applying deep learning-based algorithms to solve various low-level vision tasks on mobile devices has gradually be-come possible. However, two main problems still need to be solved: task-speciﬁc algorithms make it difﬁcult to inte-grate them into a single neural network architecture, and large amounts of parameters make it difﬁcult to achieve real-time inference. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel network, SYENet, with only 6K parameters, to han-dle multiple low-level vision tasks on mobile devices in a real-time manner. The SYENet consists of two asymmet-rical branches with simple building blocks. To effectively connect the results by asymmetrical branches, a QuadraticConnection Unit(QCU) is proposed. Furthermore, to im-prove performance, a new Outlier-Aware Loss is proposed to process the image. The proposed method proves its su-perior performance with the best PSNR as compared with other networks in real-time applications such as Image Sig-nal Processing(ISP), Low-Light Enhancement(LLE), andSuper-Resolution(SR) with 2K60FPS throughput on Qual-comm 8 Gen 1 mobile SoC(System-on-Chip). Particularly, for ISP task, SYENet got the highest score in MAI 2022Learned Smartphone ISP challenge.
