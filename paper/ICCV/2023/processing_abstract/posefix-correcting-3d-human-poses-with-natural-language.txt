Automatically producing instructions to modify oneâ€™s posture could open the door to endless applications, such as personalized coaching and in-home physical therapy. Tack-ling the reverse problem (i.e., refining a 3D pose based on some natural language feedback) could help for as-sisted 3D character animation or robot teaching, for in-stance. Although a few recent works explore the connec-tions between natural language and 3D human pose, none focus on describing 3D body pose differences. In this pa-per, we tackle the problem of correcting 3D human poses with natural language. To this end, we introduce the Pose-Fix dataset, which consists of several thousand paired 3D poses and their corresponding text feedback, that describe how the source pose needs to be modified to obtain the tar-get pose. We demonstrate the potential of this dataset on two tasks: (1) text-based pose editing, that aims at gener-ating corrected 3D body poses given a query pose and a text modifier; and (2) correctional text generation, where instructions are generated based on the differences be-tween two body poses. The dataset and the code are avail-able at https://europe.naverlabs.com/research/ computer-vision/posefix/.
