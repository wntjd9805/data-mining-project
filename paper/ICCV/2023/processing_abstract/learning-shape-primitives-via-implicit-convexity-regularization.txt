Shape primitives decomposition has been an important and long-standing task in 3D shape analysis. Prior arts heavily rely on 3D point clouds or voxel data for shape primitives extraction, which are less practical in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes to learn shape primitives from multi-view images by introducing implicit surface ren-dering. It is challenging since implicit shapes have a high degree of freedom, which violates the simplicity property of shape primitives.In this work, a novel regularization term named Implicit Convexity Regularization (ICR) im-posed on implicit primitive learning is proposed to tackle this problem. We start with the convexity definition of gen-eral 3D shapes, and then derive the equivalent expression for implicit shapes represented by signed distance functions (SDFs). Further, instead of directly constraining the out-put SDF values which cause unstable optimization, we al-ternatively impose constraint on second order directional derivatives on line segments inside the shapes, which proves to be a tighter condition for 3D convexity. Implicit primi-tives constrained by the proposed ICR are combined into a whole object via softmax-weighted-sum operation over all primitive SDFs. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our method is able to decompose ob-jects into simple and reasonable shape primitives without the need of segmentation labels or 3D data.
