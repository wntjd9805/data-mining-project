Domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to adapt a model trained on labeled source domain to unlabeled tar-get domain. Self-training shows competitive potential in this ﬁeld. Existing methods along this stream mainly focus on selecting reliable predictions on target data as pseudo-labels for category learning, while ignoring the useful re-lations between pixels for relation learning. In this paper, we propose a pseudo-relation learning framework, RelationTeacher (RTea), which can exploitable pixel relations to ef-ﬁciently use unreliable pixels and learn generalized repre-sentations. In this framework, we build reasonable pseudo-relations on local grids and fuse them with low-level rela-tions in the image space, which are motivated by the reli-able local relations prior and available low-level relations prior. Then, we design a pseudo-relation learning strat-egy and optimize the class probability to meet the relation consistency by ﬁnding the optimal sub-graph division. In this way, the model’s certainty and consistency of predic-tion are enhanced on the target domain, and the cross-domain inadaptation is further eliminated. Extensive ex-periments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code will be available at https://github.com/DZhaoXd/RTea.
