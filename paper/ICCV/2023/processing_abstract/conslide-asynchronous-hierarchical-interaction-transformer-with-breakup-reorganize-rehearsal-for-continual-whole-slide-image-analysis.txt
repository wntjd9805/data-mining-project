Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has become increas-ingly important in the medical imaging community, en-abling automated and objective diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic-response prediction. However, in clinical prac-tice, the ever-evolving environment hamper the utility ofWSI analysis models. In this paper, we propose the FIRST continual learning framework for WSI analysis, namedConSlide, to tackle the challenges of enormous image size, utilization of hierarchical structure, and catastrophic for-getting by progressive model updating on multiple sequen-tial datasets. Our framework contains three key compo-nents. The Hierarchical Interaction Transformer (HIT) is proposed to model and utilize the hierarchical structural knowledge of WSI. The Breakup-Reorganize (BuRo) re-hearsal method is developed for WSI data replay with ef-ficient region storing buffer and WSI reorganizing opera-tion. The asynchronous updating mechanism is devised to encourage the network to learn generic and specific knowl-edge respectively during the replay stage, based on a nested cross-scale similarity learning (CSSL) module. We eval-uated the proposed ConSlide on four public WSI datasets from TCGA projects. It performs best over other state-of-the-art methods with a fair WSI-based continual learning setting and achieves a better trade-off of the overall perfor-mance and forgetting on previous tasks.
