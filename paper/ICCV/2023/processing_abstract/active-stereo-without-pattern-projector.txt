This paper proposes a novel framework integrating the principles of active stereo in standard passive camera sys-tems without a physical pattern projector. We virtually project a pattern over the left and right images according to the sparse measurements obtained from a depth sensor.Any such devices can be seamlessly plugged into our frame-work, allowing for the deployment of a virtual active stereo setup in any possible environment, overcoming the limita-tion of pattern projectors, such as limited working range or environmental conditions. Experiments on indoor/outdoor datasets, featuring both long and close-range, support the seamless effectiveness of our approach, boosting the accu-racy of both stereo algorithms and deep networks.
