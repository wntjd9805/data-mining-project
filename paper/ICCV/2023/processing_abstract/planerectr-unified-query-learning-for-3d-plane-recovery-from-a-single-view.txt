3D plane recovery from a single image can usually be divided into several subtasks of plane detection, segmen-tation, parameter estimation and possibly depth estima-tion. Previous works tend to solve it by either extend-ing the RCNN-based segmentation network or the dense pixel embedding-based clustering framework. However, none of them tried to integrate above related subtasks into a unified framework but treated them separately and se-quentially, which we suspect is potentially a main source of performance limitation for existing approaches. Moti-vated by this finding and the success of query-based learn-ing in enriching reasoning among semantic entities, in this paper, we propose PlaneRecTR, a Transformer-based ar-chitecture, which for the first time unifies all subtasks re-lated to single-view plane recovery with a single compact model. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed unified learning achieves mutual benefits across subtasks, obtaining a new state-of-the-art performance on public ScanNet and NYUv2-Plane datasets.
