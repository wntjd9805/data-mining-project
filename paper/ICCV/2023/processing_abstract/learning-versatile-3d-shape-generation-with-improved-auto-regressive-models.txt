Auto-Regressive (AR) models have achieved impressive results in 2D image generation by modeling joint distribu-tions in the grid space. While this approach has been ex-tended to the 3D domain for powerful shape generation, it still has two limitations: expensive computations on vol-umetric grids and ambiguous auto-regressive order along grid dimensions. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Improved Auto-regressive Model (ImAM) for 3D shape generation, which applies discrete representation learning*Equal contributionâ€ Corresponding author based on a latent vector instead of volumetric grids. Our approach not only reduces computational costs but also pre-serves essential geometric details by learning the joint dis-tribution in a more tractable order. Moreover, thanks to the simplicity of our model architecture, we can naturally extend it from unconditional to conditional generation by concatenating various conditioning inputs, such as point clouds, categories, images, and texts. Extensive experi-ments demonstrate that ImAM can synthesize diverse and faithful shapes of multiple categories, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
