This paper proposes an efficient multi-camera to Bird’s-Eye-View (BEV) view transformation method for 3D per-ception, dubbed MatrixVT. Existing view transformers ei-ther suffer from poor efficiency or rely on device-specific operators, hindering the broad application of BEV mod-els. In contrast, our method generates BEV features effi-ciently with only convolutions and matrix multiplications (MatMul). Specifically, we propose describing the BEV fea-ture as the MatMul of image feature and a sparse FeatureTransporting Matrix (FTM). A Prime Extraction module is then introduced to compress the dimension of image fea-tures and reduce FTM’s sparsity. Moreover, we propose theRing & Ray Decomposition to replace the FTM with two matrices and reformulate our pipeline to reduce calcula-tion further. Compared to existing methods, MatrixVT en-joys a faster speed and less memory footprint while remain-ing deploy-friendly. Extensive experiments on nuScenes andWaymo benchmarks demonstrate that our method is highly efficient but obtains results on par with the SOTA method in object detection and map segmentation tasks.
