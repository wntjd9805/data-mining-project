We tackle the challenging task of unsupervised object lo-calization in this work. Recently, transformers trained with self-supervised learning have been shown to exhibit object localization properties without being trained for this task.In this work, we present Multiple Object localization withSelf-supervised Transformers (MOST) that uses features of transformers trained using self-supervised learning to lo-calize multiple objects in real world images. MOST ana-lyzes the similarity maps of the features using box counting; a fractal analysis tool to identify tokens lying on foreground patches. The identified tokens are then clustered together, and tokens of each cluster are used to generate bounding boxes on foreground regions. Unlike recent state-of-the-art object localization methods, MOST can localize mul-tiple objects per image and outperforms SOTA algorithms on several object localization and discovery benchmarks onPASCAL-VOC 07, 12 and COCO20k datasets. Additionally, we show that MOST can be used for self-supervised pre-training of object detectors, and yields consistent improve-ments on fully, semi-supervised object detection and unsu-pervised region proposal generation.Our project is publicly available at rssaketh.github.io/most.
