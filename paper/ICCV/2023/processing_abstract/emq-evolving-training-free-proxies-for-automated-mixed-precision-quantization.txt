Mixed-Precision Quantization (MQ) can achieve a com-petitive accuracy-complexity trade-off for models. Con-training-based search methods require time-ventional consuming candidate training to search optimized per-layer bit-width configurations in MQ. Recently, some training-free approaches have presented various MQ proxies and significantly improve search efficiency. However, the cor-relation between these proxies and quantization accuracy is poorly understood. To address the gap, we first build theMQ-Bench-101, which involves different bit configurations and quantization results. Then, we observe that the exist-ing training-free proxies perform weak correlations on theMQ-Bench-101. To efficiently seek superior proxies, we de-velop an automatic search of proxies framework for MQ via evolving algorithms. In particular, we devise an elaborate search space involving the existing proxies and perform an evolution search to discover the best correlated MQ proxy.We proposed a diversity-prompting selection strategy and compatibility screening protocol to avoid premature con-vergence and improve search efficiency.In this way, ourEvolving proxies for Mixed-precision Quantization (EMQ) framework allows the auto-generation of proxies without heavy tuning and expert knowledge. Extensive experiments on ImageNet with various ResNet and MobileNet families demonstrate that our EMQ obtains superior performance than state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods at a signifi-cantly reduced cost. The code will be released.
