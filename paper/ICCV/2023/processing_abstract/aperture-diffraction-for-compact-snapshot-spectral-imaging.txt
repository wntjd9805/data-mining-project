We demonstrate a compact, cost-effective snapshot spec-tral imaging system named Aperture Diffraction ImagingSpectrometer (ADIS), which consists only of an imaging lens with an ultra-thin orthogonal aperture mask and a mo-saic ﬁlter sensor, requiring no additional physical footprint compared to common RGB cameras. Then we introduce a new optical design that each point in the object space is multiplexed to discrete encoding locations on the mo-saic ﬁlter sensor by diffraction-based spatial-spectral pro-jection engineering generated from the orthogonal mask.The orthogonal projection is uniformly accepted to ob-tain a weakly calibration-dependent data form to enhance modulation robustness. Meanwhile, the Cascade Shift-Shufﬂe Spectral Transformer (CSST) with strong percep-tion of the diffraction degeneration is designed to solve a sparsity-constrained inverse problem, realizing the volume reconstruction from 2D measurements with Large amount of aliasing. Our system is evaluated by elaborating the imaging optical theory and reconstruction algorithm with demonstrating the experimental imaging under a single ex-posure. Ultimately, we achieve the sub-super-pixel spatial resolution and high spectral resolution imaging. The code will be available at: https://github.com/Krito-ex/CSST.
