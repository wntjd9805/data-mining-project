We address a challenging lifelong few-shot image gen-eration task for the first time.In this situation, a gener-ative model learns a sequence of tasks using only a few samples per task. Consequently, the learned model encoun-ters both catastrophic forgetting and overfitting problems at a time. Existing studies on lifelong GANs have pro-posed modulation-based methods to prevent catastrophic forgetting. However, they require considerable additional parameters and cannot generate high-fidelity and diverse images from limited data. On the other hand, the existing few-shot GANs suffer from severe catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks. To alleviate these issues, we propose a framework called Lifelong Few-Shot GAN (LFS-GAN) that can generate high-quality and diverse images in lifelong few-shot image generation task. Our proposed framework learns each task using an efficient task-specific modulator - Learnable Factorized Tensor (LeFT). LeFT is rank-constrained and has a rich representation ability due to its unique reconstruction technique. Furthermore, we propose a novel mode seeking loss to improve the diversity of our model in low-data circumstances. Extensive experi-ments demonstrate that the proposed LFS-GAN can gener-ate high-fidelity and diverse images without any forgetting and mode collapse in various domains, achieving state-of-the-art in lifelong few-shot image generation task. Surpris-ingly, we find that our LFS-GAN even outperforms the ex-isting few-shot GANs in the few-shot image generation task.The code is available at Github.
