Line segments are powerful features complementary to points. They offer structural cues, robust to drastic view-point and illumination changes, and can be present even in texture-less areas. However, describing and matching them is more challenging compared to points due to partial oc-clusions, lack of texture, or repetitiveness. This paper intro-duces a new matching paradigm, where points, lines, and their descriptors are uniﬁed into a single wireframe struc-ture. We propose GlueStick, a deep matching Graph Neu-ral Network (GNN) that takes two wireframes from differ-ent images and leverages the connectivity information be-In addition to tween nodes to better glue them together. the increased efﬁciency brought by the joint matching, we also demonstrate a large boost of performance when lever-aging the complementary nature of these two features in a single architecture. We show that our matching strat-egy outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches indepen-dently matching line segments and points for a wide vari-ety of datasets and tasks.
