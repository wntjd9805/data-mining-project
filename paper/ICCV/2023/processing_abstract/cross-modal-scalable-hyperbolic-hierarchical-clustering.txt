Hierarchical clustering is a natural approach to discover ontologies from data. Yet, existing approaches are ham-pered by their inability to scale to large datasets and the dis-crete encoding of the hierarchy. We introduce scalable Hy-perbolic Hierarchical Clustering (sHHC) which overcomes these limitations by learning continuous hierarchies in hy-perbolic space. Our hierarchical clustering is of high qual-ity and can be obtained in a fraction of the runtime.Additionally, we demonstrate the strength of sHHC on a downstream cross-modal self-supervision task. By us-ing the discovered hierarchies from sound and vision to construct continuous hierarchical pseudo-labels we can ef-ficiently optimize a network for activity recognition and obtain competitive performance compared to recent self-supervised learning models. Our findings demonstrate the strength of Hyperbolic Hierarchical Clustering and its po-tential for Self-Supervised Learning.
