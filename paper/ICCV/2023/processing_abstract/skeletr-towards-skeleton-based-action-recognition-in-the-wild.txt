We present SkeleTR, a new framework for skeleton-basedIn contrast to prior work, which fo-action recognition. cuses mainly on controlled environments, we target more general scenarios that typically involve a variable number of people and various forms of interaction between people.It first mod-SkeleTR works with a two-stage paradigm. els the intra-person skeleton dynamics for each skeleton sequence with graph convolutions, and then uses stackedTransformer encoders to capture person interactions that are important for action recognition in general scenarios.To mitigate the negative impact of inaccurate skeleton as-sociations, SkeleTR takes relative short skeleton sequences as input and increases the number of sequences. As a uni-fied solution, SkeleTR can be directly applied to multiple skeleton-based action tasks, including video-level action classification, instance-level action detection, and group-level activity recognition. It also enables transfer learning and joint training across different action tasks and datasets, which result in performance improvement. When evaluated on various skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks,SkeleTR achieves the state-of-the-art performance.
