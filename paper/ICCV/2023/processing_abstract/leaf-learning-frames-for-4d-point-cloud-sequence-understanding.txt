We focus on learning descriptive geometry and motion features from 4D point cloud sequences in this work. Exist-ing works usually develop generic 4D learning tools with-out leveraging the prior that a 4D sequence comes from a single 3D scene with local dynamics. Based on this obser-vation, we propose to learn region-wise coordinate frames that transform together with the underlying geometry. With such frames, we can factorize geometry and motion to fa-cilitate a feature-space geometric reconstruction for more effective 4D learning. To learn such region frames, we de-velop a rotation equivariant network with a frame stabiliza-tion strategy. To leverage such frames for better spatial-temporal feature learning, we develop a frame-guided 4D learning scheme. Experiments show that this approach sig-niÔ¨Åcantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on a wide range of 4D understanding benchmarks.
