Image compression techniques typically focus on com-pressing rectangular images for human consumption, how-ever, resulting in transmitting redundant content for down-stream applications. To overcome this limitation, some pre-vious works propose to semantically structure the bitstream, which can meet specific application requirements by selec-tive transmission and reconstruction. Nevertheless, they di-vide the input image into multiple rectangular regions ac-cording to semantics and ignore avoiding information in-teraction among them, causing waste of bitrate and dis-torted reconstruction of region boundaries. In this paper, we propose to decouple an image into multiple groups with irregular shapes based on a customized group mask and compress them independently. Our group mask describes the image at a finer granularity, enabling significant bi-trate saving by reducing the transmission of redundant con-tent. Moreover, to ensure the fidelity of selective reconstruc-tion, this paper proposes the concept of group-independent transform that maintain the independence among distinct groups. And we instantiate it by the proposed Group-Independent Swin-Block (GI Swin-Block). Experimental results demonstrate that our framework structures the bit-stream with negligible cost, and exhibits superior perfor-mance on both visual quality and intelligent task support-ing.
