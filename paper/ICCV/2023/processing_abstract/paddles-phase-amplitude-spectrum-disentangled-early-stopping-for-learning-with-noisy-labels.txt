Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are powerful in learning patterns of different vision tasks, but they are sen-sitive to label noise and may overfit to noisy labels during training. The early stopping strategy averts updating CNNs during the early training phase and is widely employed in the presence of noisy labels. Motivated by biological find-ings that the amplitude spectrum (AS) and phase spectrum (PS) in the frequency domain play different roles in the an-imalâ€™s vision system, we observe that PS, which captures more semantic information, can increase the robustness ofCNNs to label noise, more so than AS can. We thus pro-pose early stops at different times for AS and PS by disen-tangling the features of some layer(s) into AS and PS us-ing Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) during training. Our proposed Phase-AmplituDe DisentangLed Early Stopping (PADDLES) method is shown to be effective on both syn-thetic and real-world label-noise datasets. PADDLES out-performs other early stopping methods and obtains state-of-the-art performance.
