Category-level 6DoF object pose estimation intends to estimate the rotation, translation, and size of unseen ob-jects. Many previous works use point clouds as a pre-learned shape prior to overcome intra-category variabil-ity. The shape prior is deformed to reconstruct instances’ point clouds in canonical space and to build dense 3D-3D correspondences between the observed and reconstructed point clouds. However, the pre-learned shape prior is not jointly optimized with estimation networks, and they are trained with a surrogate objective. We propose a novel 6D pose estimation network, named Query6DoF, based on a series of category-specific sparse queries that represent the prior shape. Each query represents a shape compo-nent, and these queries are learnable embeddings that can be optimized together with the estimation network accord-ing to the point cloud reconstruction loss, the normalized object coordinate loss, and the 6d pose estimation loss.Query6DoF adopts a deformation-and-matching paradigm with attention, where the queries dynamically extract fea-tures from regions of interest using the attention mechanism and then directly regress results. Furthermore, Query6DoF reduces computation overhead through the sparseness of the queries and the incorporation of a lightweight global in-formation injection block. With the aforementioned design,Query6DoF achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) pose estima-tion performance on the NOCS datasets.
