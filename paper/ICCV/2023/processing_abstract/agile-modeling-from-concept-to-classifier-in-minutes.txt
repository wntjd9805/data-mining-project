The application of computer vision methods to nuanced, subjective concepts is growing. While crowdsourcing has served the vision community well for most objective tasks (such as labeling a “zebra”), it now falters on tasks where there is substantial subjectivity in the concept (such as iden-tifying “gourmet tuna”). However, empowering any user to develop a classiﬁer for their concept is technically difﬁ-cult: users are neither machine learning experts nor have the patience to label thousands of examples. In reaction, we introduce the problem of Agile Modeling: the process of turning any subjective visual concept into a computer vi-sion model through real-time user-in-the-loop interactions.We instantiate an Agile Modeling prototype for image clas-siﬁcation and show through a user study (N=14) that users can create classiﬁers with minimal effort in under 30 min-utes. We compare this user driven process with the tradi-tional crowdsourcing paradigm and ﬁnd that the crowd’s notion often differs from that of the user’s, especially as the concepts become more subjective. Finally, we scale our ex-periments with simulations of users training classiﬁers forImageNet21k categories to further demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the approach.
