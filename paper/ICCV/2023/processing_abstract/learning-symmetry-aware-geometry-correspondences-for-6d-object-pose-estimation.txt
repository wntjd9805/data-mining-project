Current 6D pose estimation methods focus on handling objects that are previously trained, which limits their ap-plications in real dynamic world. To this end, we pro-pose a geometry correspondence-based framework, termedGCPose, to estimate 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects without any re-training. Specifically, the proposed method draws the idea from point cloud registration and resorts to object-agnostic geometry features to establish the 3D-3D correspondences between the object-scene point cloud and object-model point cloud. Then the 6D pose param-eters are solved by a least-squares fitting algorithm. Tak-ing the symmetry properties of objects into consideration, we design a symmetry-aware matching loss to facilitate the learning of dense point-wise geometry features and im-prove the performance considerably. Moreover, we intro-duce an online training data generation with special data augmentation and normalization to empower the network to learn diverse geometry prior. With training on syn-thetic objects from ShapeNet, our method outperforms pre-vious approaches for unseen object pose estimation by a large margin on T-LESS, LINEMOD, Occluded-LINEMOD, and TUD-L datasets.
