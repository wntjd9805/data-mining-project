Test on known lightnessLightness adaptation is vital to the success of image processing to avoid unexpected visual deterioration, which covers multiple aspects, e.g., low-light image enhancement, image retouching, and inverse tone mapping. Existing methods typically work well on their trained lightness con-ditions but perform poorly in unknown ones due to their limited generalization ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel generalized lightness adaptation algo-rithm that extends conventional normalization techniques through a channel ﬁltering design, dubbed Channel Selec-tive Normalization (CSNorm). The proposed CSNorm pur-posely normalizes the statistics of lightness-relevant chan-nels and keeps other channels unchanged, so as to im-prove feature generalization and discrimination. To opti-mize CSNorm, we propose an alternating training strategy that effectively identiﬁes lightness-relevant channels. The model equipped with our CSNorm only needs to be trained on one lightness condition and can be well generalized to unknown lightness conditions. Experimental results on mul-tiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness ofCSNorm in enhancing the generalization ability for the ex-isting lightness adaptation methods.
