Recent methods on privacy-preserving image-based lo-calization use a random line parameterization to protect the privacy of query images and database maps. The lift-ing of points to lines effectively drops one of the two ge-ometric constraints traditionally used with point-to-point correspondences in structure-based localization. This leads to a significant loss of accuracy for the privacy-preserving methods. In this paper, we overcome this limitation by de-vising a coordinate permutation scheme that allows for re-covering the original point positions during pose estima-tion. The recovered points provide the full 2D geomet-ric constraints and enable us to close the gap between privacy-preserving and traditional methods in terms of ac-curacy. Another limitation of random line methods is their vulnerability to density based 3D line cloud inversion at-tacks. Our method not only provides better accuracy than the original random line based approach but also provides stronger privacy guarantees against these recently pro-posed attacks. Extensive experiments on standard bench-mark datasets demonstrate these improvements consistently across both scenarios of protecting the privacy of query im-ages as well as the database map.
