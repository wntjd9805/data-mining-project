Existing offboard 3D detectors always follow a modular pipeline design to take advantage of unlimited sequential point clouds. We have found that the full potential of off-board 3D detectors is not explored mainly due to two rea-sons: (1) the onboard multi-object tracker cannot gener-ate sufficient complete object trajectories, and (2) the mo-tion state of objects poses an inevitable challenge for the object-centric refining stage in leveraging the long-term temporal context representation. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel paradigm of offboard 3D object detec-tion, named DetZero. Concretely, an offline tracker cou-pled with a multi-frame detector is proposed to focus on the completeness of generated object tracks. An attention-mechanism refining module is proposed to strengthen con-textual information interaction across long-term sequential point clouds for object refining with decomposed regression methods. Extensive experiments on Waymo Open Dataset show our DetZero outperforms all state-of-the-art onboard and offboard 3D detection methods. Notably, DetZero ranks 1st place on Waymo 3D object detection leaderboard1 with 85.15 mAPH (L2) detection performance. Further experi-ments validate the application of taking the place of human labels with such high-quality results. Our empirical study leads to rethinking conventions and interesting findings that can guide future research on offboard 3D object detection.*Work performed during internship at Shanghai Artificial IntelligenceLaboratory.Figure 1. We compare several SOTA methods proposed along the timeline on the Waymo 3D detection leaderboard. Our DetZero obtains the best performance with a remarkable margin on Vehi-cle. We mark the number of input point cloud frames below each method. Please refer to Table 1 for a detailed comparison.
