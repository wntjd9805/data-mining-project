Learning how to navigate among humans in an occluded and spatially constrained indoor environment, is a key abil-ity required to embodied agents to be integrated into our so-ciety. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end architecture that exploits Proximity-Aware Tasks (referred as to Risk andProximity Compass) to inject into a reinforcement learning navigation policy the ability to infer common-sense social behaviours. To this end, our tasks exploit the notion of im-mediate and future dangers of collision. Furthermore, we propose an evaluation protocol specifically designed for theSocial Navigation Task in simulated environments. This is done to capture fine-grained features and characteristics of the policy by analyzing the minimal unit of human-robot spatial interaction, called Encounter. We validate our ap-proach on Gibson4+ and Habitat-Matterport3D datasets.
