Glaucoma is the number one cause of irreversible blind-ness globally. A major challenge for accurate glaucoma detection and progression forecasting is the bottleneck of limited labeled patients with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D retinal imaging data of optical coherence tomogra-phy (OCT). To address the data scarcity issue, this pa-per proposes two solutions. First, we develop a novel generalization-reinforced semi-supervised learning (SSL) model called pseudo supervisor to optimally utilize unla-beled data. Compared with SOTA models, the proposed pseudo supervisor optimizes the policy of predicting pseudo labels with unlabeled samples to improve empirical gener-alization. Our pseudo supervisor model is evaluated with two clinical tasks consisting of glaucoma detection and pro-gression forecasting. The progression forecasting task is evaluated both unimodally and multimodally. Our pseudo supervisor model demonstrates superior performance thanSOTA SSL comparison models. Moreover, our model also achieves the best results on the publicly available LAG fun-dus dataset. Second, we introduce the Harvard GlaucomaDetection and Progression (Harvard-GDP) Dataset, a mul-timodal multitask dataset that includes data from 1,000 pa-tients with OCT imaging data, as well as labels for glau-coma detection and progression. This is the largest glau-coma detection dataset with 3D OCT imaging data and theÔ¨Årst glaucoma progression forecasting dataset that is pub-licly available. Detailed sex and racial analysis are pro-vided, which can be used by interested researchers for fair-ness learning studies. Our released dataset is benchmarked with several SOTA supervised CNN and transformer deep learning models. The dataset and code are made publicly available via https://ophai.hms.harvard.edu/ datasets/harvard-gdp1000.
