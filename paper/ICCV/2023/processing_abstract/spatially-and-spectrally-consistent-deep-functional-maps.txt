Furthermore, we identify the dis-crepancy that spectrally consistent maps are not necessar-ily spatially, or point-wise, consistent. In light of this, we present a novel design of unsupervised Deep FunctionalMaps, which effectively enforces the harmony of learned maps under the spectral and the point-wise representa-tion. By taking advantage of cycle consistency, our frame-work produces state-of-the-art results in mapping shapes even under significant distortions. Beyond that, by in-dependently estimating maps in both spectral and spatial domains, our method naturally alleviates over-fitting in network training, yielding superior generalization perfor-mance and accuracy within an array of challenging tests for both near-isometric and non-isometric datasets.
