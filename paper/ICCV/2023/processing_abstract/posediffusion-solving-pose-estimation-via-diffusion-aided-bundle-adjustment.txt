Camera pose estimation is a long-standing computer vi-sion problem that to date often relies on classical meth-ods, such as handcrafted keypoint matching, RANSAC and bundle adjustment. In this paper, we propose to formulate the Structure from Motion (SfM) problem inside a proba-bilistic diffusion framework, modelling the conditional dis-tribution of camera poses given input images. This novel view of an old problem has several advantages. (i) The na-ture of the diffusion framework mirrors the iterative proce-dure of bundle adjustment. (ii) The formulation allows a seamless integration of geometric constraints from epipo-(iii) It excels in typically difficult scenar-lar geometry.

We demonstrate that our methodPoseDiffusion significantly improves over the classic SfM pipelines and the learned approaches on two real-world datasets. Finally, it is observed that our method can gener-alize across datasets without further training. Project page: https://posediffusion.github.io/
