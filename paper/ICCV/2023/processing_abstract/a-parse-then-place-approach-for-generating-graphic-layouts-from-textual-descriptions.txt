Creating layouts is a fundamental step in graphic de-sign. In this work, we propose to use text as the guidance to create graphic layouts, i.e., Text-to-Layout, aiming to lower the design barriers. Text-to-Layout is a challeng-ing task, because it needs to consider the implicit, com-bined, and incomplete layout constraints from text, each of which has not been studied in previous work. To address this, we present a two-stage approach, named parse-then-place. The approach introduces an intermediate representa-tion (IR) between text and layout to represent diverse layout constraints. With IR, Text-to-Layout is decomposed into a parse stage and a place stage. The parse stage takes a tex-tual description as input and generates an IR, in which the implicit constraints from the text are transformed into ex-plicit ones. The place stage generates layouts based on theIR. To model combined and incomplete constraints, we use a Transformer-based layout generation model and carefully design a way to represent constraints and layouts as se-quences. Besides, we adopt the pretrain-then-finetune strat-egy to boost the performance of the layout generation model with large-scale unlabeled layouts. To evaluate our ap-proach, we construct two Text-to-Layout datasets and con-duct experiments on them. Quantitative results, qualitative analysis, and user studies demonstrate our approachâ€™s ef-fectiveness.
