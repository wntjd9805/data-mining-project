Humans can watch a continuous video stream and ef-fortlessly perform continual acquisition and transfer of new knowledge with minimal supervision yet retaining previously learnt experiences.In contrast, existing con-tinual learning (CL) methods require fully annotated la-bels to effectively learn from individual frames in a video stream. Here, we examine a more realistic and challenging problemâ€”Label-Efficient Online Continual Object Detec-tion (LEOCOD) in streaming video. We propose a plug-and-play module, Efficient-CLS, that can be easily inserted into and consistently improve existing CL algorithms for object detection in video streams with reduced data anno-tation costs and model retraining time. We show that our method has achieved significant improvement with minimal forgetting across all supervision levels on two challeng-ing CL benchmarks for streaming real-world videos. Re-markably, with only 25% annotated video frames, our pro-posed method still outperforms the state-of-the-art CL mod-els trained with 100% annotations on all video frames. The data and source code will be publicly available at https://github.com/showlab/Efficient-CLS.
