Hyperspectral Image (HSI) reconstruction has made gratifying progress with the deep unfolding framework by formulating the problem into a data module and a prior module. Nevertheless, existing methods still face the prob-lem of insufficient matching with HSI data. The issues lie in three aspects: 1) fixed gradient descent step in the data module while the degradation of HSI is agnostic in the pixel-level. 2) inadequate prior module for 3D HSI cube. 3) stage interaction ignoring the differences in fea-tures at different stages. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a Pixel Adaptive Deep Unfolding Trans-former (PADUT) for HSI reconstruction. In the data mod-ule, a pixel adaptive descent step is employed to focus on pixel-level agnostic degradation. In the prior module, we introduce the Non-local Spectral Transformer (NST) to em-phasize the 3D characteristics of HSI for recovering. More-over, inspired by the diverse expression of features in dif-ferent stages and depths, the stage interaction is improved by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Experimental re-sults on both simulated and real scenes exhibit the supe-rior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art HSI reconstruction methods.
