Existing open vocabulary object detection (OVD) works expand the object detector toward open categories by re-placing the classifier with the category text embeddings and optimizing the region-text alignment on data of the base cat-egories. However, both the class-agnostic proposal gen-erator and the classifier are biased to the seen classes as demonstrated by the gaps of objectness and accuracy as-sessment between base and novel classes.In this paper, an open corpus, composed of a set of external object con-cepts and clustered to several centroids, is introduced to im-prove the generalization ability in the detector. We propose the generalized objectness assessment (GOAT) in the pro-posal generator based on the visual-text alignment, where the similarities of visual feature to the cluster centroids are summarized as the objectness. This simple heuristic eval-uates objectness with concepts in open corpus and is thus generalized to open categories. We further propose cate-gory expanding (CE) with open corpus in two training tasks, which enables the detector to perceive more categories in the feature space and get more reasonable optimization di-rection. For the classification task, we introduce an open corpus classifier by reconstructing original classifier with similar words in text space. For the image-caption align-ment task, the open corpus centroids are incorporated to en-large the negative samples in the contrastive loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GOAT and CE, which greatly improve the performance on novel classes and get new state-of-the-art on the OVD benchmarks.
