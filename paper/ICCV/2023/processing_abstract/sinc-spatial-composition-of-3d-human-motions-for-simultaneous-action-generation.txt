{raise the arms, squat}{walk forward, raise the arms}Our goal is to synthesize 3D human motions given textual in-puts describing simultaneous actions, for example ‘waving hand’ while ‘walking’ at the same time. We refer to generating such simultaneous movements as performing spatial compositions.In contrast to temporal compositions that seek to transition from one action to another, spatial compositing requires understand-ing which body parts are involved in which action, to be able to move them simultaneously. Motivated by the observation that the correspondence between actions and body parts is encoded in powerful language models, we extract this knowledge by prompting GPT-3 with text such as “what are the body parts involved in the action <action name>?”, while also providing the parts list and few-shot examples. Given this action-part mapping, we combine body parts from two motions together and establish the first automated method to spatially compose two actions. However, training data with compositional actions is always limited by the combinatorics. Hence, we further cre-ate synthetic data with this approach, and use it to train a new state-of-the-art text-to-motion generation model, called SINC (“SImultaneous actioN Compositions for 3D human motions”).In our experiments, we find that training with such GPT-guided synthetic data improves spatial composition generation over baselines. Our code is publicly available at sinc.is.tue.mpg.de.  {wave with the left hand,  kick with the right foot}{squat, wave with the right hand}{put hands on the waist,  move torso left}{put hands on the waist,  lean forwards}{put hands on the waist,  move torso right}{sit down,  drink from a cup}{sit down,  eat with both hands}{sit down,  stretch with both arms}Figure 1. Goal: We demonstrate the task of spatial compositions in human motion synthesis. We generate 3D motions for a pair of actions, defined by a pair of textual descriptions. Here, we provide six sample input-output illustrations from our model. For example, we input the and generate‘put hands on the waist’, ‘move torso left’ set of actions}{ one motion that simultaneously performs both.
