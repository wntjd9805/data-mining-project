Baseline CarChallenging CarWe present SHIFT3D, a differentiable pipeline for gen-erating 3D shapes that are structurally plausible yet chal-lenging to 3D object detectors. In safety-critical applica-tions like autonomous driving, discovering such novel chal-lenging objects can offer insight into unknown vulnerabili-ties of 3D detectors. By representing objects with a signed distanced function (SDF), we show that gradient error sig-nals allow us to smoothly deform the shape or pose of a 3D object in order to confuse a downstream 3D detector.Importantly, the objects generated by SHIFT3D physically differ from the baseline object yet retain a semantically rec-ognizable shape. Our approach provides interpretable fail-ure modes for modern 3D object detectors, and can aid in preemptive discovery of potential safety risks within 3D per-ception systems before these risks become critical failures.
