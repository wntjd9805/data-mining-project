We propose MAMo, a novel memory and attention frame-work for monocular video depth estimation. MAMo can augment and improve any single-image depth estimation networks into video depth estimation models, enabling them to take advantage of the temporal information to predict more accurate depth. In MAMo, we augment model with memory which aids the depth prediction as the model streams through the video. Specifically, the memory stores learned visual and displacement tokens of the previous time instances. This allows the depth network to cross-reference relevant features from the past when predicting depth on the current frame. We introduce a novel scheme to con-tinuously update the memory, optimizing it to keep tokens that correspond with both the past and the present visual information. We adopt attention-based approach to process memory features where we first learn the spatio-temporal relation among the resultant visual and displacement mem-ory tokens using self-attention module. Further, the output features of self-attention are aggregated with the current vi-sual features through cross-attention. The cross-attended features are finally given to a decoder to predict depth on the current frame. Through extensive experiments on several benchmarks, including KITTI, NYU-Depth V2, andDDAD, we show that MAMo consistently improves monoc-ular depth estimation networks and sets new state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy. Notably, our MAMo video depth esti-mation provides higher accuracy with lower latency, when comparing to SOTA cost-volume-based video depth models.
