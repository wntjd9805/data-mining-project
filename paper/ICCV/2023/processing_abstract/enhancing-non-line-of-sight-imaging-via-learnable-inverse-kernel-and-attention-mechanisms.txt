Recovering information from non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging is a computationally-intensive inverse problem.Most physics-based NLOS imaging methods address the complexity of this problem by assuming three-bounce re-flections and no self-occlusion. However, these assump-tions may break down for objects with large depth varia-tions, preventing physics-based algorithms from accurately reconstructing the details and high-frequency information.On the other hand, while learning-based methods can avoid these assumptions, they may struggle to reconstruct de-tails without specific designs due to the spectral bias of neural networks. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel approach that enhances physics-based NLOS imag-ing methods by introducing a learnable inverse kernel in the Fourier domain and using an attention mechanism to improve the neural network to learn high-frequency infor-mation. Our method is evaluated on publicly available and new synthetic datasets, demonstrating its commend-able performance compared to prior physics-based and learning-based methods, especially for objects with large depth variations. Moreover, our approach generalizes well to real data and can be applied to tasks such as classifica-tion and depth reconstruction. We will make our code and dataset publicly available:https://sci2020.github.io.
