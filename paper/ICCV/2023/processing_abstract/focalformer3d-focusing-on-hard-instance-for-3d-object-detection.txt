False negatives (FN) in 3D object detection, e.g., miss-ing predictions of pedestrians, vehicles, or other obsta-cles, can lead to potentially dangerous situations in au-tonomous driving. While being fatal, this issue is under-studied in many current 3D detection methods.In this work, we propose Hard Instance Probing (HIP), a gen-eral pipeline that identiﬁes FN in a multi-stage manner and guides the models to focus on excavating difﬁcult instances. For 3D object detection, we instantiate this method as FocalFormer3D, a simple yet effective detector that excels at excavating difﬁcult objects and improving prediction recall. FocalFormer3D features a multi-stage query generation to discover hard objects and a box-level transformer decoder to efﬁciently distinguish objects from massive object candidates. Experimental results on the nuScenes and Waymo datasets validate the superior perfor-mance of FocalFormer3D. The advantage leads to strong performance on both detection and tracking, in both Li-DAR and multi-modal settings. Notably, FocalFormer3D achieves a 70.5 mAP and 73.9 NDS on nuScenes detec-tion benchmark, while the nuScenes tracking benchmark shows 72.1 AMOTA, both ranking 1st place on the nuScenesLiDAR leaderboard.
