Scene Text Image Super-resolution (STISR) aims to re-cover high-resolution (HR) scene text images with visu-ally pleasant and readable text content from the given low-resolution (LR) input. Most existing works focus on recov-ering English texts, which have relatively simple charac-ter structures, while little work has been done on the more challenging Chinese texts with diverse and complex char-In this paper, we propose a real-world acter structures.Chinese-English benchmark dataset, namely Real-CE, for the task of STISR with the emphasis on restoring struc-turally complex Chinese characters. The benchmark pro-vides 1,935/783 real-world LR-HR text image pairs (con-tains 33,789 text lines in total) for training/testing in 2× and 4× zooming modes, complemented by detailed annota-tions, including detection boxes and text transcripts. More-over, we design an edge-aware learning method, which provides structural supervision in image and feature do-mains, to effectively reconstruct the dense structures of Chi-nese characters. We conduct experiments on the proposedReal-CE benchmark and evaluate the existing STISR mod-els with and without our edge-aware loss.
