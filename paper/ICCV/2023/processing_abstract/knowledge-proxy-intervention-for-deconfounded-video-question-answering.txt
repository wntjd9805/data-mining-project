Recently, Video Question-Answering (VideoQA) has drawn more and more attention from both the industry and the research community. Despite all the success achieved by recent works, dataset bias always harmfully misleads current methods focusing on spurious correlations in train-ing data. To analyze the effects of dataset bias, we frame the VideoQA pipeline into a causal graph, which shows the causalities among video, question, aligned feature be-tween video and question, answer, and underlying con-founder. Through the causal graph, we prove that the con-founder and the backdoor path lead to spurious causality.To tackle the challenge that the confounder in VideoQA is unobserved and non-enumerable in general, we pro-pose a model-agnostic framework called Knowledge ProxyIntervention (KPI), which introduces an extra knowledge proxy variable in the causal graph to cut the backdoor path and remove the effect of confounder. Our KPI frame-work exploits the front-door adjustment, which requires no prior knowledge about the confounder. The effectiveness of our KPI framework is corroborated by three baseline methods on Ô¨Åve benchmark datasets, including MSVD-QA,MSRVTT-QA, TGIF-QA, NExT-QA, and Causal-VidQA.
