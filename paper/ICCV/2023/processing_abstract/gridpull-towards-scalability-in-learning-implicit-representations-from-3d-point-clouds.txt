Learning implicit representations has been a widely used solution for surface reconstruction from 3D point cloud-s. The latest methods infer a distance or occupancy ﬁeld by overﬁtting a neural network on a single point cloud.However, these methods suffer from a slow inference due to the slow convergence of neural networks and the exten-sive calculation of distances to surface points, which lim-its them to small scale points. To resolve the scalabili-ty issue in surface reconstruction, we propose GridPull to improve the efﬁciency of learning implicit representations from large scale point clouds. Our novelty lies in the fast inference of a discrete distance ﬁeld deﬁned on grids with-out using any neural components. To remedy the lack of continuousness brought by neural networks, we introduce a loss function to encourage continuous distances and con-sistent gradients in the ﬁeld during pulling queries onto the surface in grids near to the surface. We use unifor-m grids for a fast grid search to localize sampled queries, and organize surface points in a tree structure to speed up the calculation of distances to the surface. We do not re-ly on learning priors or normal supervision during opti-mization, and achieve superiority over the latest method-s in terms of complexity and accuracy. We evaluate our method on shape and scene benchmarks, and report numer-ical and visual comparisons with the latest methods to justi-fy our effectiveness and superiority.
