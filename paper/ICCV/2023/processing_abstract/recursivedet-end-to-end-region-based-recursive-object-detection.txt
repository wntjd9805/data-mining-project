End-to-end region-based object detectors like Sparse R-CNN usually have multiple cascade bounding box decod-ing stages, which reﬁne the current predictions according to their previous results. Model parameters within each stage are independent, evolving a huge cost.In this pa-per, we ﬁnd the general setting of decoding stages is actu-ally redundant. By simply sharing parameters and making a recursive decoder, the detector already obtains a signif-icant improvement. The recursive decoder can be further enhanced by positional encoding (PE) of the proposal box, which makes it aware of the exact locations and sizes of in-put bounding boxes, thus becoming adaptive to proposals from different stages during the recursion. Moreover, we also design centerness-based PE to distinguish the RoI fea-ture element and dynamic convolution kernels at different positions within the bounding box. To validate the effective-ness of the proposed method, we conduct intensive ablations and build the full model on three recent mainstream region-based detectors. The RecusiveDet is able to achieve obvious performance boosts with even fewer model parameters and slightly increased computation cost.

Comparison between end-to-end region-based detector and RecusiveDet. I is the input image feature. q and b are pro-posal feature and proposal box at input. c and b indicate the class and bounding box of the predictions at output. In RecursiveDet, we encode b into PE vector p. (a) Detectors like Sparse R-CNN,AdaMixer and DiffusionDet have cascade stages, which bring a huge amount of parameters. (b) Our proposed RecursiveDet sim-ply shares the decoder parameters and makes the structure recur-sive, which reduces the model size.
