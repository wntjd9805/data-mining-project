Predicting future trajectories of surrounding agents is essential for safety-critical autonomous driving. Most ex-isting work focuses on predicting marginal trajectories for each agent independently. However, it has rarely been ex-plored in predicting joint trajectories for interactive agents.In this work, we propose Bi-level Future Fusion (BiFF) to explicitly capture future interactions between interac-tive agents. Concretely, BiFF fuses the high-level future intentions followed by low-level future behaviors. Then the polyline-based coordinate is speciﬁcally designed for multi-agent prediction to ensure data efﬁciency, frame ro-bustness, and prediction accuracy. Experiments show thatBiFF achieves state-of-the-art performance on the interac-tive prediction benchmark of Waymo Open Motion Dataset.
