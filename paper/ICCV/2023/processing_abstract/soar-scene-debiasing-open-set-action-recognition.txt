Deep learning models have a risk of utilizing spurious clues to make predictions, such as recognizing actions based on the background scene. This issue can severely degrade the open-set action recognition performance when the testing samples have different scene distributions from the train-ing samples. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel method, called Scene-debiasing Open-set Action Recogni-tion (SOAR), which features an adversarial scene reconstruc-tion module and an adaptive adversarial scene classiﬁcation module. The former prevents the decoder from reconstruct-ing the video background given video features, and thus helps reduce the background information in feature learning.The latter aims to confuse scene type classiﬁcation given video features, with a speciﬁc emphasis on the action fore-ground, and helps to learn scene-invariant information. In addition, we design an experiment to quantify the scene bias.The results indicate that the current open-set action recog-nizers are biased toward the scene, and our proposed SOAR method better mitigates such bias. Furthermore, our exten-sive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and the ablation studies conﬁrm the effectiveness of our proposed modules.
