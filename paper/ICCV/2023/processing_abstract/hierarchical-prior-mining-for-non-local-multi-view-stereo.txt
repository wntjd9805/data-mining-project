As a fundamental problem in computer vision, multi-view stereo (MVS) aims at recovering the 3D geometry of a target from a set of 2D images. Recent advances in MVS have shown that it is important to perceive non-local struc-tured information for recovering geometry in low-textured areas. In this work, we propose a Hierarchical Prior Min-ing for Non-local Multi-View Stereo (HPM-MVS). The key characteristics are the following techniques that exploit non-local information to assist MVS: 1) A Non-local Ex-tensible Sampling Pattern (NESP), which is able to adap-tively change the size of sampled areas without becoming snared in locally optimal solutions. 2) A new approach to leverage non-local reliable points and construct a planar prior model based on K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), to obtain potential hypotheses for the regions where prior construc-tion is challenging. 3) A Hierarchical Prior Mining (HPM) framework, which is used to mine extensive non-local prior information at different scales to assist 3D model recov-ery, this strategy can achieve a considerable balance be-tween the reconstruction of details and low-textured areas.Experimental results on the ETH3D and Tanks & Temples have verified the superior performance and strong general-ization capability of our method.
