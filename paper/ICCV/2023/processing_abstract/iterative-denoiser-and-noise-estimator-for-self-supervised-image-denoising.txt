With the emergence of powerful deep learning tools, more and more effective deep denoisers have advanced the field of image denoising. However, the huge progress made by these learning-based methods severely relies on large-scale and high-quality noisy/clean training pairs, which limits the practicality in real-world scenarios. To overcome this, researchers have been exploring self-supervised ap-proaches that can denoise without paired data. However, the unavailable noise prior and inefficient feature extrac-tion take these methods away from high practicality and precision.In this paper, we propose a Denoise-Corrupt-Denoise pipeline (DCD-Net) for self-supervised image de-noising. Specifically, we design an iterative training strat-egy, which iteratively optimizes the denoiser and noise es-timator, and gradually approaches high denoising perfor-mances using only single noisy images without any noise prior. The proposed self-supervised image denoising frame-work provides very competitive results compared with state-of-the-art methods on widely used synthetic and real-world image denoising benchmarks.
