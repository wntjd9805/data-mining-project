The success of deep neural networks for pan-sharpening is commonly in a form of black box, lacking transparency and interpretability. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel model-driven deep unfolding framework with im-age reasoning prior tailored for the pan-sharpening task.Different from existing unfolding solutions that deliver the proximal operator networks as the uncertain and vague pri-ors, our framework is motivated by the content reasoning ability of masked autoencoders (MAE) with insightful de-signs. Specifically, the pre-trained MAE with spatial mask-ing strategy, acting as intrinsic reasoning prior, is embed-ded into unfolding architecture. Meanwhile, the pre-trainedMAE with spatial-spectral masking strategy is treated as the regularization term within loss function to constrain the spatial-spectral consistency. Such designs penetrate the image reasoning prior into deep unfolding networks while improving its interpretability and representation capabil-ity. The uniqueness of our framework is that the holis-tic learning process is explicitly integrated with the in-herent physical mechanism underlying the pan-sharpening task. Extensive experiments on multiple satellite datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over the exist-ing state-of-the-art approaches. Code will be released at https://manman1995.github.io/.
