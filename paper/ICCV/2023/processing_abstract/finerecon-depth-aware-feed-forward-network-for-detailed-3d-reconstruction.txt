Recent works on 3D reconstruction from posed im-ages [17, 23, 24] have demonstrated that direct inference of scene-level 3D geometry without test-time optimization is feasible using deep neural networks, showing remarkable promise and high efficiency. However, the reconstructed ge-ometry, typically represented as a 3D truncated signed dis-tance function (TSDF), is often coarse without fine geomet-ric details. To address this problem, we propose three effec-tive solutions for improving the fidelity of inference-based 3D reconstructions. We first present a resolution-agnosticTSDF supervision strategy to provide the network with a more accurate learning signal during training, avoiding the pitfalls of TSDF interpolation seen in previous work.We then introduce a depth guidance strategy using multi-view depth estimates to enhance the scene representation and recover more accurate surfaces. Finally, we develop a novel architecture for the final layers of the network, con-ditioning the output TSDF prediction on high-resolution image features in addition to coarse voxel features, en-abling sharper reconstruction of fine details. Our method,FineRecon1, produces smooth and highly accurate recon-structions, showing significant improvements across multi-ple depth and 3D reconstruction metrics.
