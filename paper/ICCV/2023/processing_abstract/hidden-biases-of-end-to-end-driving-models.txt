End-to-end driving systems have recently made rapid progress, in particular on CARLA. Independent of their ma-jor contribution, they introduce changes to minor system components. Consequently, the source of improvements is unclear. We identify two biases that recur in nearly all state-of-the-art methods and are critical for the observed progress on CARLA: (1) lateral recovery via a strong in-ductive bias towards target point following, and (2) longi-tudinal averaging of multimodal waypoint predictions for slowing down. We investigate the drawbacks of these bi-ases and identify principled alternatives. By incorporating our insights, we develop TF++, a simple end-to-end method that ranks first on the Longest6 and LAV benchmarks, gain-ing 11 driving score over the best prior work on Longest6.
