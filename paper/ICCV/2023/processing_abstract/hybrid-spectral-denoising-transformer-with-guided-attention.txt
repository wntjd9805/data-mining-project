In this paper, we present a Hybrid Spectral Denois-ing Transformer (HSDT) for hyperspectral image denois-ing. Challenges in adapting transformer for HSI arise from the capabilities to tackle existing limitations of CNN-based methods in capturing the global and local spatial-spectral correlations while maintaining efficiency and flexibility. To address these issues, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines the advantages of both models with a Spatial-Spectral Separable Convolution (S3Conv), Guided SpectralSelf-Attention (GSSA), and Self-Modulated Feed-ForwardNetwork (SM-FFN). Our S3Conv works as a lightweight al-ternative to 3D convolution, which extracts more spatial-spectral correlated features while keeping the flexibility to tackle HSIs with an arbitrary number of bands. These fea-tures are then adaptively processed by GSSA which per-forms 3D self-attention across the spectral bands, guided by a set of learnable queries that encode the spectral sig-natures. This not only enriches our model with power-ful capabilities for identifying global spectral correlations but also maintains linear complexity. Moreover, our SM-FFN proposes the self-modulation that intensifies the acti-vations of more informative regions, which further strength-ens the aggregated features. Extensive experiments are con-ducted on various datasets under both simulated and real-world noise, and it shows that our HSDT significantly out-performs the existing state-of-the-art methods while main-taining low computational overhead.
