VLN-CE is a recently released embodied task, where AI agents need to navigate a freely traversable environment to reach a distant target location, given language instructions.It poses great challenges due to the huge space of possible strategies. Driven by the belief that the ability to anticipate the consequences of future actions is crucial for the emer-gence of intelligent and interpretable planning behavior, we propose DREAMWALKER — a world model based VLN-CE agent. The world model is built to summarize the visual, to-pological, and dynamic properties of the complicated conti-nuous environment into a discrete, structured, and compact representation. DREAMWALKER can simulate and evaluate possible plans entirely in such internal abstract world, be-fore executing costly actions. As opposed to existing model-free VLN-CE agents simply making greedy decisions in the real world, which easily results in shortsighted behaviors,DREAMWALKER is able to make strategic planning through large amounts of “mental experiments.” Moreover, the ima-gined future scenarios reﬂect our agent’s intention, making its decision-making process more transparent. Extensive ex-periments and ablation studies on VLN-CE dataset conﬁrm the effectiveness of the proposed approach and outline fruit-ful directions for future work.
