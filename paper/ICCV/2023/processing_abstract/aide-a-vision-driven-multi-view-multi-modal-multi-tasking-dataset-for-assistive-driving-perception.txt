Driver distraction has become a significant cause of se-vere traffic accidents over the past decade. Despite the growing development of vision-driven driver monitoring systems, the lack of comprehensive perception datasets re-In this paper, we stricts road safety and traffic security.†These authors are second contributions.

AIDE facilitates holis-tic driver monitoring through three distinctive character-istics, including multi-view settings of driver and scene, multi-modal annotations of face, body, posture, and ges-ture, and four pragmatic task designs for driving under-standing. To thoroughly explore AIDE, we provide exper-imental benchmarks on three kinds of baseline frameworksvia extensive methods. Moreover, two fusion strategies are introduced to give new insights into learning effective multi-stream/modal representations. We also systematically in-vestigate the importance and rationality of the key com-ponents in AIDE and benchmarks. The project link is https://github.com/ydk122024/AIDE.
