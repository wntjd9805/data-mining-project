Multi-view hierarchical clustering (MCHC) plays a piv-otal role in comprehending the structures within multi-view data, which hinges on the skillful interaction between hier-archical feature learning and comprehensive representation learning across multiple views. However, existing methods often overlook this interplay due to the simple heuristic ag-glomerative strategies or the decoupling of multi-view rep-resentation learning and hierarchical modeling, thus lead-ing to insufficient representation learning. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel Multi-view Hierarchi-cal Clustering Network (MHCN) model by performing si-multaneous multi-view learning and hierarchy modeling.Specifically, to uncover efficient tree-like structures among all views, we derive multiple hyperbolic autoencoders with latent space mapped onto the PoincarÂ´e ball. Then, the cor-responding hyperbolic embeddings are further regularized to achieve the multi-view representation learning principles for both view-common and view-private information, and to ensure hyperbolic uniformity with a well-balanced hier-archy for better interpretability. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic multi-view datasets have demon-strated that our method can achieve state-of-the-art hierar-chical clustering performance, and empower the clustering results with good interpretability.
