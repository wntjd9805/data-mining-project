3D instance segmentation aims to predict a set of ob-ject instances in a scene and represent them as binary fore-ground masks with corresponding semantic labels. How-ever, object instances are diverse in shape and category, and point clouds are usually sparse, unordered, and irreg-ular, which leads to a query sampling dilemma. Besides, noise background queries interfere with proper scene per-ception and accurate instance segmentation. To address the above issues, we propose the Query Reﬁnement Trans-former termed QueryFormer. The key to our approach is to exploit a query initialization module to optimize the initial-ization process for the query distribution with a high cov-erage and low repetition rate. Additionally, we design an afﬁliated transformer decoder that suppresses the interfer-ence of noise background queries and helps the foreground queries focus on instance discriminative parts to predict ﬁ-nal segmentation results. Extensive experiments on Scan-NetV2 and S3DIS datasets show that our QueryFormer can surpass state-of-the-art 3D instance segmentation methods.
