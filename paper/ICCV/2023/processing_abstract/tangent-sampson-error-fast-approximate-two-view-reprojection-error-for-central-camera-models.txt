In this paper we introduce the Tangent Sampson error, which is a generalization of the classical Sampson error in two-view geometry that allows for arbitrary central cam-era models.It only requires local gradients of the dis-tortion map at the original correspondences (allowing for pre-computation) resulting in a negligible increase in com-putational cost when used in RANSAC or local refinement.The error effectively approximates the true-reprojection er-ror for a large variety of cameras, including extremely wide field-of-view lenses that cannot be undistorted to a single pinhole image. We show experimentally that the new er-ror outperforms competing approaches both when used for model scoring in RANSAC and for non-linear refinement of the relative camera pose. constrains the geometry via the epipolar constraint, (p2; 1)⊺E(p1; 1) = 0, (1) where E = [t]×R ∈ R3×3 is the essential matrix and the points p1, p2 are on the normalized image plane. This con-straint ensures that the 2D-2D correspondence can be ex-actly triangulated (i.e. with zero reprojection error) using the camera pair extracted from E. However when the mea-surement (p1, p2) is inexact, it is natural to measure how close this correspondence is to being consistent with a given epipolar geometry. This is for example used for determin-ing inlier matches during robust estimation, or as a loss to be minimized when refining an initial estimate of E.Under the assumption of i.i.d. Gaussian noise, the ML-estimate of the closest consistent correspondence, some-times called the gold-standard estimate in the literature[12], is found by minimizing the squared reprojection error,
