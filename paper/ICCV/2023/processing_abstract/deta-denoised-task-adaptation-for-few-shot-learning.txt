Test-time task adaptation in few-shot learning aims to adapt a pre-trained task-agnostic model for capturing task-speciﬁc knowledge of the test task, rely only on few-labeled support samples. Previous approaches generally focus on developing advanced algorithms to achieve the goal, while neglecting the inherent problems of the given support sam-ples. In fact, with only a handful of samples available, the adverse effect of either the image noise (a.k.a. X-noise) or the label noise (a.k.a. Y-noise) from support samples can be severely ampliﬁed. To address this challenge, in this work we propose DEnoised Task Adaptation (DETA), aﬁrst, uniﬁed image- and label-denoising framework orthog-onal to existing task adaptation approaches. Without ex-tra supervision, DETA ﬁlters out task-irrelevant, noisy rep-resentations by taking advantage of both global visual in-formation and local region details of support samples. On the challenging Meta-Dataset, DETA consistently improves the performance of a broad spectrum of baseline methods applied on various pre-trained models. Notably, by tack-ling the overlooked image noise in Meta-Dataset, DETA es-tablishes new state-of-the-art results. Code is released at https://github.com/JimZAI/DETA.
