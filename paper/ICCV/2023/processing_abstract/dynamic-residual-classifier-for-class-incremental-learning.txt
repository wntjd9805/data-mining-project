···Task t-1Task t···The rehearsal strategy is widely used to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem in class incremental learn-ing (CIL) by preserving limited exemplars from previous tasks. With imbalanced sample numbers between old and new classes, the classiﬁer learning can be biased. ExistingCIL methods exploit the long-tailed (LT) recognition tech-niques, e.g., the adjusted losses and the data re-sampling methods, to handle the data imbalance issue within each increment task. In this work, the dynamic nature of data imbalance in CIL is shown and a novel Dynamic Resid-ual Classiﬁer (DRC) is proposed to handle this challenging scenario. Speciﬁcally, DRC is built upon a recent advance residual classiﬁer with the branch layer merging to handle the model-growing problem. Moreover, DRC is compati-ble with different CIL pipelines and substantially improves them. Combining DRC with the model adaptation and fu-sion (MAF) pipeline, this method achieves state-of-the-art results on both the conventional CIL and the LT-CIL bench-marks. Extensive experiments are also conducted for a de-tailed analysis. The code is publicly available1.
