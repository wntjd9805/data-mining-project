This paper presents a novel object-centric contact rep-resentation ContactGen for hand-object interaction. TheContactGen comprises 3 components: a contact map indi-cates the contact location, a part map represents the contact hand part, and a direction map tells the contact direction within each part. Given an input object, we propose a con-ditional generative model to predict ContactGen and adopt model-based optimization to predict diverse and geomet-rically feasible grasps. Experimental results demonstrate our method can generate high-fidelity and diverse human grasps for various objects.
