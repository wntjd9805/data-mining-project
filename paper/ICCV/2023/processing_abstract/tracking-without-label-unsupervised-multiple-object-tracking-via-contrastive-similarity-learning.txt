Unsupervised learning is a challenging task due to the lack of labels. Multiple Object Tracking (MOT), which inevitably suffers from mutual object interference, occlu-sion, etc., is even more difficult without label supervision.In this paper, we explore the latent consistency of sam-ple features across video frames and propose an Unsu-pervised Contrastive Similarity Learning method, namedUCSL, including three contrast modules: self-contrast, cross-contrast, and ambiguity contrast. Specifically, i) self-contrast uses intra-frame direct and inter-frame indirect contrast to obtain discriminative representations by maxi-mizing self-similarity. ii) Cross-contrast aligns cross- and continuous-frame matching results, mitigating the persis-tent negative effect caused by object occlusion. And iii) am-biguity contrast matches ambiguous objects with each other to further increase the certainty of subsequent object associ-ation through an implicit manner. On existing benchmarks, our method outperforms the existing unsupervised methods using only limited help from ReID head, and even provides higher accuracy than lots of fully supervised methods.
