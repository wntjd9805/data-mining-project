Recent advances in deep learning have significantly im-proved the performance of various computer vision appli-cations. However, discovering novel categories in an in-cremental learning scenario remains a challenging problem due to the lack of prior knowledge about the number and na-ture of new categories. Existing methods for novel category discovery are limited by their reliance on labeled datasets and prior knowledge about the number of novel categories and the proportion of novel samples in the batch. To ad-dress the limitations and more accurately reflect real-world scenarios, in this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised class incremental learning approach for discovering novel categories on unlabeled sets without prior knowledge. The proposed method fine-tunes the feature extractor and proxy anchors on labeled sets, then splits samples into old and novel categories and clusters on the unlabeled dataset. Fur-thermore, the proxy anchors-based exemplar generates rep-resentative category vectors to mitigate catastrophic forget-ting. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on fine-grained datasets under real-world scenarios.
