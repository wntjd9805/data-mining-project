Neural radiance fields (NeRF) and its subsequent vari-ants have led to remarkable progress in neural render-ing. While most of recent neural rendering works focus on objects and small-scale scenes, developing neural ren-dering methods for city-scale scenes is of great potential in many real-world applications. However, this line of re-search is impeded by the absence of a comprehensive and high-quality dataset, yet collecting such a dataset over real city-scale scenes is costly, sensitive, and technically infeasi-ble. To this end, we build a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for city-scale neural render-ing researches. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 City Sam-ple project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect aerial and street city views, accompanied by ground-truth camera poses and a range of additional data modalities. Flexible controls on environmental factors like light, weather, human and car crowd are also available in our pipeline, support-ing the need of various tasks covering city-scale neural ren-dering and beyond. The resulting pilot dataset, MatrixCity, contains 67k aerial images and 452k street images from two city maps of total size 28km2. On top of MatrixCity, a thor-ough benchmark is also conducted, which not only reveals unique challenges of the task of city-scale neural render-ing, but also highlights potential improvements for future works. The dataset and code will be publicly available at the project page: https://city-super.github.io/matrixcity/.
