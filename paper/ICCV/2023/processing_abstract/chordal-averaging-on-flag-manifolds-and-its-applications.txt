This paper presents a new, provably-convergent algo-rithm for computing the flag-mean and flag-median of a set of points on a flag manifold under the chordal metric. The flag manifold is a mathematical space consisting of flags, which are sequences of nested subspaces of a vector space that increase in dimension. The flag manifold is a superset of a wide range of known matrix spaces, including Stiefel and Grassmanians, making it a general object that is useful in a wide variety computer vision problems.To tackle the challenge of computing first order flag statistics, we first transform the problem into one that in-volves auxiliary variables constrained to the Stiefel mani-fold. The Stiefel manifold is a space of orthogonal frames, and leveraging the numerical stability and efficiency ofStiefel-manifold optimization enables us to compute the flag-mean effectively. Through a series of experiments, we show the competence of our method in Grassmann and ro-tation averaging, as well as principal component analysis.
