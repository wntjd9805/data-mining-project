We introduce PointOdyssey, a large-scale synthetic dataset, and data generation framework, for the train-ing and evaluation of long-term fine-grained tracking al-gorithms. Our goal is to advance the state-of-the-art by placing emphasis on long videos with naturalistic motion.Toward the goal of naturalism, we animate deformable characters using real-world motion capture data, we build 3D scenes to match the motion capture environments, and we render camera viewpoints using trajectories mined via structure-from-motion on real videos. We create combinato-rial diversity by randomizing character appearance, motion profiles, materials, lighting, 3D assets, and atmospheric ef-fects. Our dataset currently includes 104 videos, averaging 2,000 frames long, with orders of magnitude more corre-spondence annotations than prior work. We show that exist-ing methods can be trained from scratch in our dataset and outperform the published variants. Finally, we introduce modifications to the PIPs point tracking method, greatly widening its temporal receptive field, which improves its performance on PointOdyssey as well as on two real-world benchmarks.
