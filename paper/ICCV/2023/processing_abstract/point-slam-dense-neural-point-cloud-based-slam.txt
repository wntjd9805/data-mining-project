NICE-SLAM [79]Point-SLAM (ours)We propose a dense neural simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approach for monocular RGBD in-put which anchors the features of a neural scene repre-sentation in a point cloud that is iteratively generated in an input-dependent data-driven manner. We demonstrate that both tracking and mapping can be performed with the same point-based neural scene representation by minimiz-ing an RGBD-based re-rendering loss. In contrast to recent dense neural SLAM methods which anchor the scene fea-tures in a sparse grid, our point-based approach allows dy-namically adapting the anchor point density to the informa-tion density of the input. This strategy reduces runtime and memory usage in regions with fewer details and dedicates higher point density to resolve fine details. Our approach performs either better or competitive to existing dense neu-ral RGBD SLAM methods in tracking, mapping and ren-dering accuracy on the Replica, TUM-RGBD and Scan-Net datasets.
