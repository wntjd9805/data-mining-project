Estimating the depths of equirectangular (i.e., 360◦) im-ages (EIs) is challenging given the distorted 180◦ × 360◦ﬁeld-of-view, which is hard to be addressed via convolu-tional neural network (CNN). Although a transformer with global attention achieves signiﬁcant improvements overCNN for EI depth estimation task, it is computationally inefﬁcient, which raises the need for transformer with lo-cal attention. However, to apply local attention success-fully for EIs, a speciﬁc strategy, which addresses distorted equirectangular geometry and limited receptive ﬁeld simul-taneously, is required. Prior works have only cared either of them, resulting in unsatisfactory depths occasionally.In this paper, we propose an equirectangular geometry-biased transformer termed EGformer. While limiting the computational cost and the number of network parame-ters, EGformer enables the extraction of the equirectangu-lar geometry-aware local attention with a large receptiveﬁeld. To achieve this, we actively utilize the equirectangular geometry as the bias for the local attention instead of strug-gling to reduce the distortion of EIs. As compared to the most recent EI depth estimation studies, the proposed ap-proach yields the best depth outcomes overall with the low-est computational cost and the fewest parameters, demon-strating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
