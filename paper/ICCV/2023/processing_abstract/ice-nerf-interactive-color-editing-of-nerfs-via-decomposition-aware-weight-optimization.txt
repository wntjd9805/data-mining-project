Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have gained consider-able attention for their high-quality results in 3D scene re-construction and rendering. Recently, there have been ac-tive studies on various tasks such as novel view synthesis and scene editing. However, editing NeRFs is challenging as accurately decomposing the desired area of 3D space and ensuring the consistency of edited results from differ-ent angles is difﬁcult. In this paper, we propose ICE-NeRF, an Interactive Color Editing framework that performs color editing by taking a pre-trained NeRF and a rough user mask as input. Our proposed method performs the entire color editing process in only under a minute using a partial ﬁne-tuning approach. To perform effective color editing, we ad-dress two issues: (1) the entanglement of the implicit repre-sentation that causes unwanted color changes in undesired areas when learning weights, and (2) the loss of multi-view consistency when ﬁne-tuning for a single or a few views.To address these issues, we introduce two techniques: Acti-vation Field-based Regularization (AFR) and Single-maskMulti-view Rendering (SMR). The AFR performs weight regularization during ﬁne-tuning based on the assumption that not all weights have an equal impact on the desired area. The SMR maps the 2D mask to 3D space through inverse projection and renders it from other views to gen-erate multi-view masks. ICE-NeRF not only enables well-decomposed, multi-view consistent color editing but also signiﬁcantly reduces processing time compared to existing methods.
