Multi-Camera Multi-Object Tracking (MC-MOT) uti-lizes information from multiple views to better handle prob-lems with occlusion and crowded scenes. Recently, the use of graph-based approaches to solve tracking problems has become very popular. However, many current graph-based methods do not effectively utilize information regard-ing spatial and temporal consistency. Instead, they rely on single-camera trackers as input, which are prone to frag-mentation and ID switch errors.In this paper, we pro-pose a novel reconfigurable graph model that first asso-ciates all detected objects across cameras spatially before reconfiguring it into a temporal graph for Temporal Asso-ciation. This two-stage association approach enables us to extract robust spatial and temporal-aware features and address the problem with fragmented tracklets. Further-more, our model is designed for online tracking, making it suitable for real-world applications. Experimental re-sults show that the proposed graph model is able to ex-tract more discriminating features for object tracking, and our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several public datasets.
