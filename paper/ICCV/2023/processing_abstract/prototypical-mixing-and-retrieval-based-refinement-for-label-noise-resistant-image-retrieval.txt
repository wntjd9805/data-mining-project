Label noise is pervasive in real-world applications, which influences the optimization of neural network mod-els. This paper investigates a realistic but understudied problem of image retrieval under label noise, which could lead to severe overfitting or memorization of noisy samples during optimization. Moreover, identifying noisy samples correctly is still a challenging problem for retrieval mod-els.In this paper, we propose a novel approach calledPrototypical Mixing and Retrieval-based Refinement (TI-TAN) for label noise-resistant image retrieval, which cor-rects label noise and mitigates the effects of the memoriza-tion simultaneously. Specifically, we first characterize nu-merous prototypes with Gaussian distributions in the hidden space, which would direct the Mixing procedure in provid-ing synthesized samples. These samples are fed into a sim-ilarity learning framework with varying emphasis based on the prototypical structure to learn semantics with reduced overfitting. In addition, we retrieve comparable samples for each prototype from simple to complex, which refine noisy samples in an accurate and class-balanced manner. Com-prehensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demon-strate the superiority of our proposed TITAN compared with various competing baselines.
