(a) Original (b) Reference (c) 2D method (d) OursImage blending aims to combine multiple images seam-lessly. It remains challenging for existing 2D-based methods, especially when input images are misaligned due to differ-ences in 3D camera poses and object shapes. To tackle these issues, we propose a 3D-aware blending method using gen-erative Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), including two key components: 3D-aware alignment and 3D-aware blending.For 3D-aware alignment, we ﬁrst estimate the camera pose of the reference image with respect to generative NeRFs and then perform pose alignment for objects. To further lever-age 3D information of the generative NeRF, we propose 3D-aware blending that utilizes volume density and blends on the NeRF’s latent space, rather than raw pixel space.Collectively, our method outperforms existing 2D baselines, as validated by extensive quantitative and qualitative evalu-ations with FFHQ and AFHQ-Cat. d e n g i l a y l h g u oR d e n g i l a s iM
