The dynamics of biomolecules are crucial for our under-standing of their functioning in living systems. However, current 3D imaging techniques, such as cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM), require freezing the sample, which limits the observation of their conformational changes in real time. The innovative liquid-phase electron microscopy (liquid-phase EM) technique allows molecules to be placed in the native liquid environment, providing a unique oppor-tunity to observe their dynamics. In this paper, we proposeTEMPOR, a Temporal Electron MicroscoPy Object Recon-struction algorithm for liquid-phase EM that leverages an implicit neural representation (INR) and a dynamical varia-tional auto-encoder (DVAE) to recover time series of molec-ular structures. We demonstrate its advantages in recover-ing different motion dynamics from two simulated datasets, 7bcq & Cas9. To our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to directly recover 3D structures of a temporally-varying particle from liquid-phase EM movies. It provides a promising new approach for studying moleculesâ€™ 3D dy-namics in structural biology.
