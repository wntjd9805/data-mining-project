2D-to-3D human pose lifting is fundamental for 3D hu-man pose estimation (HPE), for which graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have proven inherently suitable for mod-eling the human skeletal topology. However, the currentGCN-based 3D HPE methods update the node features by aggregating their neighborsâ€™ information without consid-ering the interaction of joints in different joint synergies.Although some studies have proposed importing limb in-formation to learn the movement patterns, the latent syn-ergies among joints, such as maintaining balance are sel-dom investigated. We propose the Hop-wise GraphFormer with Intragroup Joint Refinement (HopFIR) architecture to tackle the 3D HPE problem. HopFIR mainly consists of a novel hop-wise GraphFormer (HGF) module and an in-tragroup joint refinement (IJR) module. The HGF module groups the joints by k-hop neighbors and applies a hop-wise transformer-like attention mechanism to these groups to discover latent joint synergies. The IJR module lever-ages the prior limb information for peripheral joint refine-ment. Extensive experimental results show that HopFIR outperforms the SOTA methods by a large margin, with a mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) on the Human3.6M dataset of 32.67 mm. We also demonstrate that the state-of-the-art GCN-based methods can benefit from the proposed hop-wise attention mechanism with a significant improve-ment in performance: SemGCN [42] and MGCN [49] are improved by 8.9% and 4.5%, respectively.
