This paper investigates data-free class-incremental learn-ing (DFCIL) for hand gesture recognition from 3D skele-ton sequences.In this class-incremental learning (CIL) setting, while incrementally registering the new classes, we do not have access to the training samples (i.e. data-free) of the already known classes due to privacy. Ex-isting DFCIL methods primarily focus on various forms of knowledge distillation for model inversion to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Unlike SOTA methods, we delve deeper into the choice of the best samples for inversion.Inspired by the well-grounded theory of max-margin clas-siﬁcation, we ﬁnd that the best samples tend to lie close to the approximate decision boundary within a reasonable margin. To this end, we propose BOAT-MI – a simple and effective boundary-aware prototypical sampling mechanism for model inversion for DFCIL. Our sampling scheme out-performs SOTA methods signiﬁcantly on two 3D skeleton gesture datasets, the publicly available SHREC 2017, andEgoGesture3D – which we extract from a publicly avail-able RGBD dataset. Both our codebase and the EgoGes-ture3D skeleton dataset are publicly available: https://github.com/humansensinglab/dfcil-hgr.
