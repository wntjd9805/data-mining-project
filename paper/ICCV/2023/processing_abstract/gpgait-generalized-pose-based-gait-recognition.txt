Recent works on pose-based gait recognition have demonstrated the potential of using such simple informa-tion to achieve results comparable to silhouette-based meth-ods. However, the generalization ability of pose-based methods on different datasets is undesirably inferior to that of silhouette-based ones, which has received little at-tention but hinders the application of these methods in real-world scenarios. To improve the generalization abil-ity of pose-based methods across datasets, we propose aGeneralized Pose-based Gait recognition (GPGait) frame-work. First, a Human-Oriented Transformation (HOT) and a series of Human-Oriented Descriptors (HOD) are pro-posed to obtain a unified pose representation with discrim-inative multi-features. Then, given the slight variations in the unified representation after HOT and HOD, it be-comes crucial for the network to extract local-global rela-tionships between the keypoints. To this end, a Part-AwareGraph Convolutional Network (PAGCN) is proposed to en-able efficient graph partition and local-global spatial fea-ture extraction. Experiments on four public gait recognition datasets, CASIA-B, OUMVLP-Pose, Gait3D and GREW, show that our model demonstrates better and more stable cross-domain capabilities compared to existing skeleton-based methods, achieving comparable recognition results to silhouette-based ones.
