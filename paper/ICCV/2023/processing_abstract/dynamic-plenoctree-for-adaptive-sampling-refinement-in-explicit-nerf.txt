operations octreesThe explicit neural radiance ﬁeld (NeRF) has gained considerable interest for its efﬁcient training and fast in-ference capabilities, making it a promising direction such as virtual reality and gaming.In particular, PlenOctree (POT) [43], an explicit hierarchical multi-scale octree rep-resentation, has emerged as a structural and inﬂuential framework. However, POT’s ﬁxed structure for direct op-timization is sub-optimal as the scene complexity evolves continuously with updates to cached color and density, ne-cessitating reﬁning the sampling distribution to capture sig-nal complexity accordingly. To address this issue, we pro-pose the dynamic PlenOctree (DOT), which adaptively re-ﬁnes the sample distribution to adjust to changing scene complexity. Speciﬁcally, DOT proposes a concise yet novel hierarchical feature fusion strategy during the iterative ren-dering process. Firstly, it identiﬁes the regions of inter-est through training signals to ensure adaptive and efﬁ-cient reﬁnement. Next, rather than directly ﬁltering out valueless nodes, DOT introduces the sampling and prun-ing operations for octrees to aggregate features, enabling rapid parameter learning. Compared with POT, our DOT outperforms it by enhancing visual quality, reducing over 55.15/68.84% parameters, and providing 1.7/1.9 times FPS for NeRF-synthetic and Tanks & Temples, respectively.
