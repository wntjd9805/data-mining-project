In monocular depth estimation, uncertainty estimation approaches mainly target the data uncertainty introduced by image noise. In contrast to prior work, we address the uncertainty due to lack of knowledge, which is relevant for the detection of data not represented by the training distri-bution, the so-called out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Mo-tivated by anomaly detection, we propose to detect OOD images from an encoder-decoder depth estimation model based on the reconstruction error. Given the features ex-tracted with the fixed depth encoder, we train an image de-coder for image reconstruction using only in-distribution data. Consequently, OOD images result in a high recon-struction error, which we use to distinguish between in-and out-of-distribution samples. We built our experiments on the standard NYU Depth V2 and KITTI benchmarks as in-distribution data. Our post hoc method performs aston-ishingly well on different models and outperforms existing uncertainty estimation approaches without modifying the trained encoder-decoder depth estimation model.
