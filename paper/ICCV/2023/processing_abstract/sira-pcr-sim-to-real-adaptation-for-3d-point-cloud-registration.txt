Point cloud registration is essential for many applica-tions. However, existing real datasets require extremely tedious and costly annotations, yet may not provide accu-rate camera poses. For the synthetic datasets, they are mainly object- level, so the trained models may not gen-eralize well to real scenes. We design SIRA- PCR, a new approach to 3D point cloud registration. First, we build a synthetic scene- level 3D registration dataset, specifically designed with physically- based and random strategies to arrange diverse objects. Second, we account for varia-tions in different sensing mechanisms and layout place-ments, then formulate a sim- to- real adaptation framework with an adaptive re- sample module to simulate patterns in real point clouds. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that explores sim- to- real adaptation for point cloud registration. Extensive experiments show the SOTA per-formance of SIRA- PCR on widely- used indoor and out-door datasets. The code and dataset will be released on https://github.com/Chen- Suyi/SIRA_Pytorch.
