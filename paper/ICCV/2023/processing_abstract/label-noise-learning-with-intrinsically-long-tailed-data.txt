In this case,Label noise is one of the key factors that lead to the poor generalization of deep learning models. Existing label-noise learning methods usually assume that the ground-truth classes of the training data are balanced. How-ever, the real-world data is often imbalanced, leading to the inconsistency between observed and intrinsic class dis-tribution with label noises. it is hard to distinguish clean samples from noisy samples on the in-trinsic tail classes with the unknown intrinsic class dis-tribution.In this paper, we propose a learning frame-work for label-noise learning with intrinsically long-tailed data. Specifically, we propose two-stage bi-dimensional sample selection (TABASCO) to better separate clean sam-ples from noisy samples, especially for the tail classes.TABASCO consists of two new separation metrics that com-plement each other to compensate for the limitation of us-ing a single metric in sample separation. Extensive exper-iments on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github. com/Wakings/TABASCO.
