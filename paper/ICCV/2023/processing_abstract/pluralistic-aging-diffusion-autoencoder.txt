Face aging is an ill-posed problem because multiple plausible aging patterns may correspond to a given input.Most existing methods often produce one deterministic esti-mation. This paper proposes a novel CLIP-driven Pluralis-tic Aging Diffusion Autoencoder (PADA) to enhance the di-versity of aging patterns. First, we employ diffusion models to generate diverse low-level aging details via a sequential denoising reverse process. Second, we present ProbabilisticAging Embedding (PAE) to capture diverse high-level aging patterns, which represents age information as probabilis-tic distributions in the common CLIP latent space. A text-â‹†Corresponding author guided KL-divergence loss is designed to guide this learn-ing. Our method can achieve pluralistic face aging condi-tioned on open-world aging texts and arbitrary unseen face images. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demon-strate that our method can generate more diverse and high-quality plausible aging results.
