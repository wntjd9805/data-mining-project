FSS (Few-shot segmentation) aims to segment a target class using a small number of labeled images (support set).To extract information relevant to the target class, a dom-inant approach in best performing FSS methods removes background features using a support mask. We observe that this feature excision through a limiting support mask in-troduces an information bottleneck in several challengingFSS cases, e.g., for small targets and/or inaccurate target boundaries. To this end, we present a novel method (MSI), which maximizes the support-set information by exploit-ing two complementary sources of features to generate su-per correlation maps. We validate the effectiveness of our approach by instantiating it into three recent and strongFSS methods. Experimental results on several publicly available FSS benchmarks show that our proposed method consistently improves performance by visible margins and leads to faster convergence.
