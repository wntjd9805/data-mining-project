Modeling and designing urban building layouts is of sig-nificant interest in computer vision, computer graphics, and urban applications. A building layout consists of a set of buildings in city blocks defined by a network of roads. We observe that building layouts are discrete structures, con-sisting of multiple rows of buildings of various shapes, and are amenable to skeletonization for mapping arbitrary city block shapes to a canonical form. Hence, we propose a fully automatic approach to building layout generation us-ing graph attention networks. Our method generates real-istic urban layouts given arbitrary road networks, and en-ables conditional generation based on learned priors. Our results, including user study, demonstrate superior perfor-mance as compared to prior layout generation networks, support arbitrary city block and varying building shapes as demonstrated by generating layouts for 28 large cities.
