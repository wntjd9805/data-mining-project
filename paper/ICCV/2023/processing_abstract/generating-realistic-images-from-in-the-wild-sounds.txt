Representing wild sounds as images is an important but challenging task due to the lack of paired datasets between sound and images and the signiÔ¨Åcant differences in the characteristics of these two modalities. Previous studies have focused on generating images from sound in limited categories or music. In this paper, we propose a novel ap-proach to generate images from in-the-wild sounds. First, we convert sound into text using audio captioning. Sec-ond, we propose audio attention and sentence attention to represent the rich characteristics of sound and visualize the sound. Lastly, we propose a direct sound optimiza-tion with CLIPscore and AudioCLIP and generate images with a diffusion-based model. In experiments, it shows that our model is able to generate high quality images from wild sounds and outperforms baselines in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on wild audio datasets.
