Wide-scale use of visual surveillance in public spaces puts individual privacy at stake while increasing resource consumption (energy, bandwidth, and computation). Neu-romorphic vision sensors (event-cameras) have been re-cently considered a valid solution to the privacy issue be-cause they do not capture detailed RGB visual information of the subjects in the scene. However, recent deep learn-ing architectures have been able to reconstruct images from event cameras with high fidelity, reintroducing a potential threat to privacy for event-based vision applications.In this paper, we aim to anonymize event-streams to protect the identity of human subjects against such image recon-struction attacks. To achieve this, we propose an end-to-end network architecture jointly optimized for the twofold ob-jective of preserving privacy and performing a downstream task such as person ReId. Our network learns to scramble events, enforcing the degradation of images recovered from the privacy attacker. In this work, we also bring to the com-munity the first ever event-based person ReId dataset gath-ered to evaluate the performance of our approach. We val-idate our approach with extensive experiments and report results on the synthetic event data simulated from the pub-licly available SoftBio dataset and our proposed Event-ReId dataset.
