This paper explores Deployment Authorization (DPA) as a means of restricting the generalization capabilities of vision models on certain domains to protect intellectual property. Nevertheless, the current advancements in DPA are predominantly confined to fully supervised settings. Such settings require the accessibility of annotated images from any unauthorized domain, rendering the DPA approaches impractical for real-world applications due to its exorbitant costs.To address this issue, we propose Source-Only Deploy-ment Authorization (SDPA), which assumes that only autho-rized domains are accessible during training phases, and the model’s performance on unauthorized domains must be suppressed in inference stages. Drawing inspiration from dis-tributional robust statistics, we present a lightweight method called Domain-Specified Optimization (DSO) for SDPA that degrades the model’s generalization over a divergence ball.DSO comes with theoretical guarantees on the convergence property and its authorization performance. As a comple-mentary of SDPA, we also propose Target-Combined De-ployment Authorization (TPDA), where unauthorized do-mains are partially accessible, and simplify the DSO method to a perturbation operation on the pseudo predictions, re-ferred to as Target-Dependent Domain-Specified Optimiza-tion (TDSO). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our pro-posed DSO and TDSO methods through extensive experi-ments on six image benchmarks, achieving dominant perfor-mance on both SDPA and TDPA settings.*Indicates equal contribution.Figure 1: Our domain specified optimization is designed for maximizing the risk over unauthorized domains (e.g.,PU1 and PU2 as framed yellow triangles) close to the au-thorized domain Ps, and minimizing the risk on PS as the centroid (risk quantifies the consistency between the learn-ing model and the domain). Besides, unauthorized domains far away from the authorized domain (e.g., PU3 and PU4 as framed blue squares) are not considered, as the model trained on PS naturally generalizes poorly on them.
