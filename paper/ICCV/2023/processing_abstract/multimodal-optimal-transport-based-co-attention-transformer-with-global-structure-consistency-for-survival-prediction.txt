Survival prediction is a complicated ordinal regression task that aims to predict the ranking risk of death, which generally benefits from the integration of histology and ge-nomic data. Despite the progress in joint learning from pathology and genomics, existing methods still suffer from challenging issues: 1) Due to the large size of patholog-ical images, it is difficult to effectively represent the gi-gapixel whole slide images (WSIs). 2) Interactions within tumor microenvironment (TME) in histology are essential for survival analysis. Although current approaches attempt to model these interactions via co-attention between histol-ogy and genomic data, they focus on only dense local simi-larity across modalities, which fails to capture global con-sistency between potential structures, i.e. TME-related in-teractions of histology and co-expression of genomic data.To address these challenges, we propose a Multimodal Opti-mal Transport-based Co-Attention Transformer framework with global structure consistency, in which optimal trans-port (OT) is applied to match patches of a WSI and genes embeddings for selecting informative patches to represent the gigapixel WSI. More importantly, OT-based co-attention provides a global awareness to effectively capture struc-tural interactions within TME for survival prediction. To overcome high computational complexity of OT, we propose a robust and efficient implementation over micro-batch ofWSI patches by approximating the original OT with unbal-anced mini-batch OT. Extensive experiments show the supe-riority of our method on five benchmark datasets compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The code is released1.
