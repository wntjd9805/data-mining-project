Much of the critical information in patent docu-ments and scientiﬁc articles is contained in ﬁgures, depict-ing the molecule structures. However, automatically pars-ing the exact chemical structure is a formidable challenge, due to the amount of detailed information, the diversity of drawing styles, and the need for training data. In this work, we introduce MolGrapher to recognize chemical structures visually. First, a deep keypoint detector detects the atoms.Second, we treat all candidate atoms and bonds as nodes and put them in a graph. This construct allows a natural graph representation of the molecule. Last, we classify atom and bond nodes in the graph with a Graph Neural Network.To address the lack of real training data, we propose a syn-thetic data generation pipeline producing diverse and real-istic results. In addition, we introduce a large-scale bench-mark of annotated real molecule images, USPTO-30K, to spur research on this critical topic. Extensive experiments on ﬁve datasets show that our approach signiﬁcantly out-performs classical and learning-based methods in most set-tings. Code, models, and datasets are available 1.
