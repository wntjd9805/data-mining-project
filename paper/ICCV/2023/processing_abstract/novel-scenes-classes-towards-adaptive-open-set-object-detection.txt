Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) transfers an object detector to a novel domain free of labels. How-ever, in the real world, besides encountering novel scenes, novel domains always contain novel-class objects de facto, which are ignored in existing research. Thus, we formu-late and study a more practical setting, Adaptive Open-setObject Detection (AOOD), considering both novel scenes and classes. Directly combing off-the-shelled cross-domain and open-set approaches is sub-optimal since their low-order dependence, e.g., the confidence score, is insuffi-cient for the AOOD with two dimensions of novel infor-mation. To address this, we propose a novel StructuredMotif Matching (SOMA) framework for AOOD, which mod-els the high-order relation with motifs, i.e., statistically sig-nificant subgraphs, and formulates AOOD solution as motif matching to learn with high-order patterns. In a nutshell,SOMA consists of Structure-aware Novel-class Learning (SNL) and Structure-aware Transfer Learning (STL). As for SNL, we establish an instance-oriented graph to cap-ture the class-independent object feature hidden in dif-ferent base classes. Then, a high-order metric is pro-posed to match the most significant motif as high-order patterns, serving for motif-guided novel-class learning. InSTL, we set up a semantic-oriented graph to model the class-dependent relation across domains, and match un-labelled objects with high-order motifs to align the cross-domain distribution with structural awareness. Exten-sive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SOMA achieves state-of-the-art performance. Codes are available at https://github.com/CityU-AIM-Group/SOMA.
