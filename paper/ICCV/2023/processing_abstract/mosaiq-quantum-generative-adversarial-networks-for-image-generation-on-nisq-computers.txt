Opportunity Gap for Quantum GANs.Quantum machine learning and vision have come to the fore recently, with hardware advances enabling rapid ad-vancement in the capabilities of quantum machines. Re-cently, quantum image generation has been explored with many potential advantages over non-quantum techniques; however, previous techniques have suffered from poor qual-ity and robustness. To address these problems, we introduceMosaiQ a high-quality quantum image generation GAN framework that can be executed on todayâ€™s Near-term In-termediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers.
