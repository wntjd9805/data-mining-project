Safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehi-cles and social robots require fast computation and ac-curate probability density estimation on trajectory predic-tion. To address both requirements, this paper presents a new normalizing flow-based trajectory prediction model named FlowChain. FlowChain is a stack of conditional continuously-indexed flows (CIFs) that are expressive and allow analytical probability density computation. This an-alytical computation is faster than the generative models that need additional approximations such as kernel den-sity estimation. Moreover, FlowChain is more accurate than the Gaussian mixture-based models due to fewer as-sumptions on the estimated density. FlowChain also al-lows a rapid update of estimated probability densities. This update is achieved by adopting the newest observed posi-tion and reusing the flow transformations and its log-det-jacobians that represent the motion trend. This update is completed in less than one millisecond because this reuse greatly omits the computational cost. Experimental re-sults showed our FlowChain achieved state-of-the-art tra-jectory prediction accuracy compared to previous meth-ods. Furthermore, our FlowChain demonstrated superior-ity in the accuracy and speed of density estimation. Our code is available at https://github.com/meaten/FlowChain-ICCV2023.
