Single-view depth estimation can be remarkably effec-tive if there is enough ground-truth depth data for su-there are scenarios, espe-pervised training. However, cially in medicine in the case of endoscopies, where such data cannot be obtained.In such cases, multi-view self-supervision and synthetic-to-real transfer serve as alterna-tive approaches, however, with a considerable performance reduction in comparison to supervised case.Instead, we propose a single-view self-supervised method that achieves a performance similar to the supervised case.In some medical devices, such as endoscopes, the camera and light sources are co-located at a small distance from the target surfaces. Thus, we can exploit that, for any given albedo and surface orientation, pixel brightness is inversely pro-portional to the square of the distance to the surface, pro-viding a strong single-view self-supervisory signal. In our experiments, our self-supervised models deliver accuracies comparable to those of fully supervised ones, while being applicable without depth ground-truth data.
