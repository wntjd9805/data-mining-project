Motion forecasting is an important component in au-tonomous driving systems. One of the most challenging problems in motion forecasting is interactive trajectory pre-diction, whose goal is to jointly forecasts the future trajec-tories of interacting agents. To this end, we present a large-scale interactive trajectory prediction dataset named INT2 for INTeractive trajectory prediction at INTersections.INT2 includes 612,000 scenes, each lasting 1 minute, con-taining up to 10,200 hours of data. The agent trajectories∗ Work done while at AIR, THU.† Corresponding author.Sponsored by Baidu Inc. through Apollo-AIR Joint Research Center. are auto-labeled by a high-performance offline temporal de-tection and fusion algorithm, whose quality is further in-spected by human judges. Vectorized semantic maps and traffic light information are also included in INT2. Addi-tionally, the dataset poses an interesting domain mismatch challenge. For each intersection, we treat rush-hour and non-rush-hour segments as different domains. We bench-mark the best open-sourced interactive trajectory predic-tion method on INT2 and Waymo Open Motion, under in-domain and cross-domain settings. The dataset, code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/AIR-DISCOVER/INT2.
