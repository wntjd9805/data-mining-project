A hierarchical backbone is the de-facto architecture for current methods.Recently, the plain, non-hierarchical Vision Transformer (ViT) has emerged as a competitive backbone for dense pre-diction tasks. This design allows the original ViT to be a foundation model that can be ﬁnetuned for downstream tasks without redesigning a hierarchical backbone for pretrain-ing. Although this design is simple and has been proven eﬀective, it has not yet been explored for interactive image segmentation. To ﬁll this gap, we propose SimpleClick, the ﬁrst interactive segmentation method that leverages a plain backbone. Based on the plain backbone, we intro-duce a symmetric patch embedding layer that encodes clicks into the backbone with minor modiﬁcations to the back-bone itself. With the plain backbone pretrained as a masked autoencoder (MAE), SimpleClick achieves state-of-the-art performance. Remarkably, our method achieves 4.15NoC@90 on SBD, improving 21.8% over the previous best result. Extensive evaluation on medical images demon-strates the generalizability of our method. We provide a de-tailed computational analysis, highlighting the suitability of our method as a practical annotation tool.
