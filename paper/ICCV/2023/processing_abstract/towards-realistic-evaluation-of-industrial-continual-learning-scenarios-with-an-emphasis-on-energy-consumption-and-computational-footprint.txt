PODNetPOD-AANetDERJoint (CJT)FOSTERIncremental Learning (IL) aims to develop MachineLearning (ML) models that can learn from continuous streams of data and mitigate catastrophic forgetting. We analyse the current state-of-the-art Class-IL implementa-tions and demonstrate why the current body of research tends to be one-dimensional, with an excessive focus on ac-curacy metrics. A realistic evaluation of Continual Learn-ing methods should also emphasise energy consumption and overall computational load for a comprehensive un-derstanding. This paper addresses research gaps between current IL research and industrial project environments, including varying incremental tasks and the introduction of Joint Training in tandem with IL. We introduce InVar-100 (Industrial Objects in Varied Contexts), a novel dataset meant to simulate the visual environments in industrial se-tups and perform various experiments for IL. Additionally, we incorporate explainability (using class activations) to interpret the model predictions. Our approach, RECIL (Real-World Scenarios and Energy Efficiency Considera-tions for Class Incremental Learning) provides meaningful insights about the applicability of IL approaches in practi-cal use cases. The overarching aim is to bring the Incre-mental Learning and Green AI fields together and encour-age the application of CIL methods in real-world scenarios.Code and dataset are available.
