Learning from label proportions (LLP) is a promising weakly supervised learning problem. In LLP, a set of in-stances (bag) has label proportions, but no instance-level labels are given. LLP aims to train an instance-level classi-fier by using the label proportions of the bag. In this paper, we propose a bag-level data augmentation method for LLP called MixBag, based on the key observation from our pre-liminary experiments; that the instance-level classification accuracy improves as the number of labeled bags increases even though the total number of instances is fixed. We also propose a confidence interval loss designed based on sta-tistical theory to use the augmented bags effectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to pro-pose bag-level data augmentation for LLP. The advantage of MixBag is that it can be applied to instance-level data augmentation techniques and any LLP method that uses the proportion loss. Experimental results demonstrate this ad-vantage and the effectiveness of our method.
