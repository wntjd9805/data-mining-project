Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are known to exhibit poor generalization performance under distribu-tion shifts. Their generalization have been studied ex-tensively, and one line of work approaches the problem from a frequency-centric perspective. These studies high-light the fact that humans and CNNs might focus on differ-ent frequency components of an image. First, inspired by these observations, we propose a simple yet effective data augmentation method HybridAugment that reduces the re-liance of CNNs on high-frequency components, and thus improves their robustness while keeping their clean accu-racy high. Second, we propose HybridAugment++, which is a hierarchical augmentation method that attempts to unify various frequency-spectrum augmentations. HybridAug-ment++ builds on HybridAugment, and also reduces the re-liance of CNNs on the amplitude component of images, and promotes phase information instead. This unification re-sults in competitive to or better than state-of-the-art results on clean accuracy (CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet), corrup-tion benchmarks (ImageNet-C, CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR-100-C), adversarial robustness on CIFAR-10 and out-of-distribution detection on various datasets. HybridAugment and HybridAugment++ are implemented in a few lines of code, does not require extra data, ensemble models or ad-ditional networks 1.
