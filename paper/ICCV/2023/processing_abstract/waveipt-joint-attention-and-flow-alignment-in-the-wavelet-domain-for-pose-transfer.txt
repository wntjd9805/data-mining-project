Human pose transfer aims to synthesis a new image of the source person in a target pose. Among the various ex-isting methods, attention and flow have emerged as two of the most popular and effective approaches. Attention ex-cels at preserving the semantic structure of the source im-age, which is more reflected in the low-frequency domain.Contrastively, flow is better at retaining fine-grained tex-ture details in the high-frequency domain. To leverage the advantages of both attention and flow simultaneously, this paper proposes Wavelet-aware Image-based Pose Transfer (WaveIPT) as a novel approach to fuse the attention and flow in the wavelet domain. To improve the fusion effect and avoid interference from irrelevant information across dif-ferent frequencies, WaveIPT first applies Intra-scale LocalCorrelation (ILC) to adaptively fuse attention and flow in the same scale according to their strengths in low and high-frequency domains. Subsequently, WaveIPT employs Inter-scale Feature Interaction (IFI) to explore inter-scale fre-quency features, facilitating effective information transfer across different scales. Furthermore, we introduce Progres-sive Flow Regularization (PFR), an effective method that al-leviates the challenges of flow estimation under large pose differences. The experiments on the DeepFashion dataset demonstrate that WaveIPT achieves a new state-of-the-art in terms of both FID and LPIPS, with improvements of 4.97% and 3.89%, respectively.
