Multi-object tracking (MOT) at low frame rates can re-duce computational, storage and power overhead to bet-ter meet the constraints of edge devices. Many existingMOT methods suffer from significant performance degra-dation in low-frame-rate videos due to significant location and appearance changes between adjacent frames. To this end, we propose to explore collaborative tracking learn-ing (ColTrack) for frame-rate-insensitive MOT in a query-based end-to-end manner. Multiple historical queries of the same target jointly track it with richer temporal de-scriptions. Meanwhile, we insert an information refine-ment module between every two temporal blocking de-coders to better fuse temporal clues and refine features.Moreover, a tracking object consistency loss is proposed to guide the interaction between historical queries. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that in high-frame-rate videos, ColTrack obtains higher performance than state-of-the-art methods on large-scale datasets Dancetrack andBDD100K, and outperforms the existing end-to-end meth-ods on MOT17. More importantly, ColTrack has a sig-nificant advantage over state-of-the-art methods in low-frame-rate videos, which allows it to obtain faster pro-cessing speeds by reducing frame-rate requirements while maintaining higher performance.
