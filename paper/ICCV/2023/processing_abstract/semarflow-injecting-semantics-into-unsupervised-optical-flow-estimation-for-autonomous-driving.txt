Unsupervised optical flow estimation is especially hard near occlusions and motion boundaries and in low-texture regions. We show that additional information such as semantics and domain knowledge can help better con-strain this problem. We introduce SemARFlow, an un-supervised optical flow network designed for autonomous driving data that takes estimated semantic segmentation masks as additional inputs. This additional information is injected into the encoder and into a learned upsam-pler that refines the flow output.In addition, a simple yet effective semantic augmentation module provides self-supervision when learning flow and its boundaries for ve-hicles, poles, and sky. Together, these injections of se-mantic information improve the KITTI-2015 optical flow test error rate from 11.80% to 8.38%. We also show vis-ible improvements around object boundaries as well as a greater ability to generalize across datasets.
