Robust point cloud classification is crucial for real-world applications, as consumer-type 3D sensors often yield partial and noisy data, degraded by various artifacts.In this work we propose a general ensemble framework, based on partial point cloud sampling. Each ensemble member is exposed to only partial input data. Three sam-pling strategies are used jointly, two local ones, based on patches and curves, and a global one of random sampling.We demonstrate the robustness of our method to various local and global degradations. We show that our frame-work significantly improves the robustness of top classifica-tion netowrks by a large margin. Our experimental setting uses the recently introduced ModelNet-C database by Ren et al.[24], where we reach SOTA both on unaugmented and on augmented data. Our unaugmented mean CorruptionError (mCE) is 0.64 (current SOTA is 0.86) and 0.50 for augmented data (current SOTA is 0.57). We analyze and explain these remarkable results through diversity analy-sis. Our code is availabe at: https://github.com/ yossilevii100/EPiC (a) Random (b) Patch (c) CurveFigure 1: EPiC concept. Three sampling mechanism are used in our ensemble: Random captures global informa-tion, Patch holds full local resolution, and Curve is more exploratory in nature. Blue - anchor point, Red - sam-pled points. We show and explain why such ensembles are highly robust to various corruptions.
