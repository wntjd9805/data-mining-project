In recent years, significant progress has been made in video instance segmentation (VIS), with many offline and online methods achieving state-of-the-art performance.While offline methods have the advantage of producing tem-porally consistent predictions, they are not suitable for real-time scenarios. Conversely, online methods are more prac-tical, but maintaining temporal consistency remains a chal-In this paper, we propose a novel online lenging task. method for video instance segmentation, called TCOVIS, which fully exploits the temporal information in a video clip.The core of our method consists of a global instance as-signment strategy and a spatio-temporal enhancement mod-ule, which improve the temporal consistency of the fea-tures from two aspects. Specifically, we perform global op-timal matching between the predictions and ground truth across the whole video clip, and supervise the model with the global optimal objective. We also capture the spatial feature and aggregate it with the semantic feature between frames, thus realizing the spatio-temporal enhancement. We evaluate our method on four widely adopted VIS bench-marks, namely YouTube-VIS 2019/2021/2022 and OVIS, and achieve state-of-the-art performance on all benchmarks without bells-and-whistles. For instance, on YouTube-VIS 2021, TCOVIS achieves 49.5 AP and 61.3 AP with ResNet-50 and Swin-L backbones, respectively. Code is available at https://github.com/jun-long-li/TCOVIS.
