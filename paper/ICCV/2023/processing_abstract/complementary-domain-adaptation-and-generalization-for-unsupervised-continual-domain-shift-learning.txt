Continual domain shift poses a significant challenge in real-world applications, particularly in situations where la-beled data is not available for new domains. The challenge of acquiring knowledge in this problem setting is referred to as unsupervised continual domain shift learning. Exist-ing methods for domain adaptation and generalization have limitations in addressing this issue, as they focus either on adapting to a specific domain or generalizing to unseen do-mains, but not both.In this paper, we propose Comple-mentary Domain Adaptation and Generalization (CoDAG), a simple yet effective learning framework that combines domain adaptation and generalization in a complementary manner to achieve three major goals of unsupervised con-tinual domain shift learning: adapting to a current do-main, generalizing to unseen domains, and preventing for-getting of previously seen domains. Our approach is model-agnostic, meaning that it is compatible with any existing do-main adaptation and generalization algorithms. We evalu-ate CoDAG on several benchmark datasets and demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models in all datasets and evaluation metrics, highlighting its effective-ness and robustness in handling unsupervised continual do-main shift learning.
