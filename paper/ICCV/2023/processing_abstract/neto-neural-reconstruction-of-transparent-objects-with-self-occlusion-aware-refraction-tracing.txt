We present a novel method called NeTO, for captur-ing the 3D geometry of solid transparent objects from 2D images via volume rendering. Reconstructing transpar-ent objects is a very challenging task, which is ill-suited for general-purpose reconstruction techniques due to the specular light transport phenomena. Although existing refraction-tracing-based methods, designed especially for this task, achieve impressive results, they still suffer from unstable optimization and loss of fine details since the ex-plicit surface representation they adopted is difficult to be optimized, and the self-occlusion problem is ignored forIn this paper, we propose to leverage refraction-tracing. implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) as surface rep-resentation and optimize the SDF field via volume render-ing with a self-occlusion aware refractive ray tracing. The implicit representation enables our method to be capable of reconstructing high-quality reconstruction even with a limited set of views, and the self-occlusion aware strat-egy makes it possible for our method to accurately recon-struct the self-occluded regions. Experiments show that our method achieves faithful reconstruction results and outper-forms prior works by a large margin.
