Understanding and analyzing animal behavior is in-creasingly essential to protect endangered animal species.However, the application of advanced computer vision tech-niques in this regard is minimal, which boils down to lack-ing large and diverse datasets for training deep models. To break the deadlock, we present LoTE-Animal, a large-scale endangered animal dataset collected over 12 years, to fos-ter the application of deep learning in rare species conser-vation. The collected data contains vast variations such as ecological seasons, weather conditions, periods, view-points, and habitat scenes. So far, we retrieved at least 500K videos and 1.2 million images. Specifically, we se-lected and annotated 11 endangered animals for behavior understanding, including 10K video sequences for the ac-tion recognition task, 28K images for object detection, in-stance segmentation, and pose estimation tasks.In addi-tion, we gathered 7K web images of the same species as source domain data for the domain adaptation task. We provide evaluation results of representative vision under-standing approaches and cross-domain experiments. LoTE-Animal dataset would facilitate the community to research more advanced machine learning models and explore new tasks to aid endangered animal conservation. Our dataset will be released with the paper. Our dataset can be found at https://LoTE-Animal.github.io
