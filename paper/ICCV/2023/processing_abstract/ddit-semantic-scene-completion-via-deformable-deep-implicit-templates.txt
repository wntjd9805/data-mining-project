Scene reconstructions are often incomplete due to occlu-sions and limited viewpoints. There have been efforts to use semantic information for scene completion. However, the completed shapes may be rough and imprecise since re-spective methods rely on 3D convolution and/or lack effec-tive shape constraints. To overcome these limitations, we propose a semantic scene completion method based on de-formable deep implicit templates (DDIT). Speciﬁcally, we complete each segmented instance in a scene by deform-ing a template with a latent code. Such a template is ex-pressed by a deep implicit function in the canonical frame.It abstracts the shape prior of a category, and thus can pro-vide constraints on the overall shape of an instance. La-tent code controls the deformation of template to guaranteeﬁne details of an instance. For code prediction, we design a neural network that leverages both intra- and inter-instance information. We also introduce an algorithm to transform instances between the world and canonical frames based on geometric constraints and a hierarchical tree. To fur-ther improve accuracy, we jointly optimize the latent code and transformation by enforcing the zero-valued isosurface constraint. In addition, we establish a new dataset to solve different problems of existing datasets. Experiments showed that our DDIT outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.
