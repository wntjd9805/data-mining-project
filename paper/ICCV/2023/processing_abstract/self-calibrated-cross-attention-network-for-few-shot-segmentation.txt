The key to the success of few-shot segmentation (FSS) lies in how to effectively utilize support samples. Most solu-tions compress support foreground (FG) features into pro-totypes, but lose some spatial details. Instead, others use cross attention to fuse query features with uncompressed support FG. Query FG could be fused with support FG, however, query background (BG) cannot ﬁnd matched BG features in support FG, yet inevitably integrates dissimilar features. Besides, as both query FG and BG are combined with support FG, they get entangled, thereby leading to in-effective segmentation. To cope with these issues, we de-sign a self-calibrated cross attention (SCCA) block. For efﬁcient patch-based attention, query and support features are ﬁrstly split into patches. Then, we design a patch align-ment module to align each query patch with its most sim-ilar support patch for better cross attention. Speciﬁcally,SCCA takes a query patch as Q, and groups the patches from the same query image and the aligned patches from the support image as K&V .In this way, the query BG features are fused with matched BG features (from query patches), and thus the aforementioned issues will be mit-igated. Moreover, when calculating SCCA, we design a scaled-cosine mechanism to better utilize the support fea-tures for similarity calculation. Extensive experiments con-ducted on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i demonstrate the su-periority of our model, e.g., the mIoU score under 5-shot setting on COCO-20i is 5.6%+ better than previous state-of-the-arts.
