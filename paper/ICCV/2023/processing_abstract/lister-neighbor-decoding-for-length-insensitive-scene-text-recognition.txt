The diversity in length constitutes a significant charac-teristic of text. Due to the long-tail distribution of text lengths, most existing methods for scene text recognition (STR) only work well on short or seen-length text, lack-ing the capability of recognizing longer text or perform-ing length extrapolation. This is a crucial issue, since the lengths of the text to be recognized are usually not given in advance in real-world applications, but it has not been ad-equately investigated in previous works. Therefore, we pro-pose in this paper a method called Length-Insensitive SceneTExt Recognizer (LISTER), which remedies the limitation regarding the robustness to various text lengths. Specifi-cally, a Neighbor Decoder is proposed to obtain accurate character attention maps with the assistance of a novel neighbor matrix regardless of the text lengths. Besides, aFeature Enhancement Module is devised to model the long-range dependency with low computation cost, which is able to perform iterations with the neighbor decoder to enhance the feature map progressively. To the best of our knowl-edge, we are the first to achieve effective length-insensitive scene text recognition. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LISTER algorithm exhibits obvious supe-riority on long text recognition and the ability for length ex-trapolation, while comparing favourably with the previous state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks for STR (mainly short text)1.
