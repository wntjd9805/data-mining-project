In this paper, we revisit the limitations of anchor-based lane detection methods, which have predominantly focused on fixed anchors that stem from the edges of the image, dis-regarding their versatility and quality. To overcome the inflexibility of anchors, we decompose them into learning the heat map of starting points and their associated di-rections. This decomposition removes the limitations on the starting point of anchors, making our algorithm adapt-able to different lane types in various datasets. To en-hance the quality of anchors, we introduce the Large Ker-nel Attention (LKA) for Feature Pyramid Network (FPN).This significantly increases the receptive field, which is cru-cial in capturing the sufficient context as lane lines typ-ically run throughout the entire image. We have named our proposed system the Anchor Decomposition Network (ADNet). Additionally, we propose the General Lane IoU (GLIoU) loss, which significantly improves the performance of ADNet in complex scenarios. Experimental results on three widely used lane detection benchmarks, VIL-100, CU-Lane, and TuSimple, demonstrate that our approach outper-forms the state-of-the-art methods on VIL-100 and exhibits competitive accuracy on CULane and TuSimple. Code and models will be released on https://github.com/Sephirex-X/ADNet.
