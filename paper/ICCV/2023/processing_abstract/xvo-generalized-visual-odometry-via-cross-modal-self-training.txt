We propose XVO, a semi-supervised learning method for training generalized monocular Visual Odometry (VO) models with robust off-the-self operation across diverse datasets and settings.In contrast to standard monocu-lar VO approaches which often study a known calibration within a single dataset, XVO efficiently learns to recover relative pose with real-world scale from visual scene se-mantics, i.e., without relying on any known camera param-eters. We optimize the motion estimation model via self-training from large amounts of unconstrained and hetero-geneous dash camera videos available on YouTube. Our key contribution is twofold. First, we empirically demon-strate the benefits of semi-supervised training for learn-ing a general-purpose direct VO regression network. Sec-ond, we demonstrate multi-modal supervision, including segmentation, flow, depth, and audio auxiliary prediction tasks, to facilitate generalized representations for the VO task. Specifically, we find audio prediction task to signifi-cantly enhance the semi-supervised learning process while alleviating noisy pseudo-labels, particularly in highly dy-namic and out-of-domain video data. Our proposed teacher network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the com-monly used KITTI benchmark despite no multi-frame opti-mization or knowledge of camera parameters. Combined with the proposed semi-supervised step, XVO demonstrates off-the-shelf knowledge transfer across diverse conditions on KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse without fine-tuning.
