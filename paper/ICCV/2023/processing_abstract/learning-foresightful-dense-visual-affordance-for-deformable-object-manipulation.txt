Understanding and manipulating deformable objects (e.g., ropes and fabrics) is an essential yet challenging task with broad applications. Difficulties come from com-plex states and dynamics, diverse configurations and high-dimensional action space of deformable objects. Besides, the manipulation tasks usually require multiple steps to ac-complish, and greedy policies may easily lead to local opti-mal states. Existing studies usually tackle this problem us-ing reinforcement learning or imitating expert demonstra-tions, with limitations in modeling complex states or requir-In this paper, we study ing hand-crafted expert policies. deformable object manipulation using dense visual affor-dance, with generalization towards diverse states, and pro-pose a novel kind of foresightful dense affordance, which avoids local optima by estimating statesâ€™ values for long-term manipulation. We propose a framework for learning this representation, with novel designs such as multi-stage stable learning and efficient self-supervised data collection without experts. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed foresightful dense affordance. Project page: https://hyperplane-lab.github.io/DeformableAffordance
