We tackle the problem of estimating a Manhattan frame, i.e. three orthogonal vanishing points, and the unknown fo-cal length of the camera, leveraging a prior vertical direc-tion. The direction can come from an Inertial MeasurementUnit that is a standard component of recent consumer de-vices, e.g., smartphones. We provide an exhaustive analysis of minimal line configurations and derive two new 2-line solvers, one of which does not suffer from singularities af-fecting existing solvers. Additionally, we design a new non-minimal method, running on an arbitrary number of lines, to boost the performance in local optimization. Combining all solvers in a hybrid robust estimator, our method achieves increased accuracy even with a rough prior. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior accuracy of our method compared to the state of the art, while having comparable runtimes. We further demonstrate the applicability of our solvers for relative rotation estima-tion. The code is available at https://github.com/ cvg/VP-Estimation-with-Prior-Gravity.
