Naturally controllable human-scene interaction (HSI) generation has an important role in various fields, such asVR/AR content creation and human-centered AI. However, existing methods are unnatural and unintuitive in their con-trollability, which heavily limits their application in prac-tice. Therefore, we focus on a challenging task of natu-rally and controllably generating realistic and diverse HSIs from textual descriptions. From human cognition, the ideal generative model should correctly reason about spatial re-lationships and interactive actions. To that end, we pro-pose Narrator, a novel relationship reasoning-based gen-*Corresponding author erative approach using a conditional variation autoencoder for naturally controllable generation given a 3D scene and a textual description. Also, we model global and local spa-tial relationships in a 3D scene and a textual description respectively based on the scene graph, and introduce a part-level action mechanism to represent interactions as atomic body part states. In particular, benefiting from our relation-ship reasoning, we further propose a simple yet effective multi-human generation strategy, which is the first explo-ration for controllable multi-human scene interaction gen-eration. Our extensive experiments and perceptual studies show that Narrator can controllably generate diverse inter-actions and significantly outperform existing works.
