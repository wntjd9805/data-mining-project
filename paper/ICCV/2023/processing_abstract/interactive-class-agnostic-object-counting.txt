Our framework consists of two main compo-nents: a user-friendly visualizer to gather feedback and an efﬁcient mechanism to incorporate it.In each itera-tion, we produce a density map to show the current pre-diction result, and we segment it into non-overlapping re-gions with an easily veriﬁable number of objects. The user can provide feedback by selecting a region with obvious counting errors and specifying the range for the estimated number of objects within it. To improve the counting re-sult, we develop a novel adaptation loss to force the vi-sual counter to output the predicted count within the user-speciﬁed range. For effective and efﬁcient adaptation, we propose a reﬁnement module that can be used with any density-based visual counter, and only the parameters in the reﬁnement module will be updated during adaptation.Our experiments on two challenging class-agnostic object counting benchmarks, FSCD-LVIS and FSC-147, show that our method can reduce the mean absolute error of multi-ple state-of-the-art visual counters by roughly 30% to 40% with minimal user input.
