Decomposing a single mixed image into individual im-age layers is the common crux of a classical category of tasks in image restoration. Several uniﬁed frameworks have been proposed that can handle different types of degrada-tion in superimposed image decomposition. However, there are always undesired structural distortions in the separated images when dealing with complicated degradation pat-terns.In this paper, we propose a uniﬁed framework for superimposed image decomposition that can cope with in-tricate degradation patterns adaptively. Considering the different mixing patterns between the layers, we introduce a degeneration representation in the latent space to mine the intrinsic relationship between the superimposed im-age and the degeneration pattern. Moreover, by extracting structure-guided knowledge from the superimposed image, we further propose structural guidance reﬁnement to avoid confusing content caused by structure distortion. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method remark-ably outperforms other popular image separation frame-works. The method also achieves competitive results on re-lated applications including image deraining, image reﬂec-tion removal, and image shadow removal, which validates the generalization of the framework.
