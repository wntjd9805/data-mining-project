For homography estimation, we propose GeometrizedTransformer (GeoFormer), a new detector-free feature matching method. Current detector-free methods, e.g.LoFTR, lack an effective mean to accurately localize small and thus computationally feasible regions for cross-attention diffusion. We resolve the challenge with an ex-tremely simple idea: using the classical RANSAC geome-try for attentive region search. Given coarse matches byLoFTR, a homography is obtained with ease. Such a ho-mography allows us to compute cross-attention in a fo-cused manner, where key/value sets required by Transform-ers can be reduced to small fix-sized regions rather than an entire image. Local features can thus be enhanced by standard Transformers. We integrate GeoFormer into the LoFTR framework. By minimizing a multi-scale cross-entropy based matching loss on auto-generated training data, the network is trained in a fully self-supervised man-ner. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple real-world datasets covering natural images, heavily manipu-lated pictures and retinal images. The proposed method compares favorably against the state-of-the-art.
