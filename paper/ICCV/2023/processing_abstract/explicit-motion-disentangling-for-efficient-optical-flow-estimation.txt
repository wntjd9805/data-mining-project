In this paper, we propose a novel framework for opti-cal flow estimation that achieves a good balance between performance and efficiency. Our approach involves disen-tangling global motion learning from local flow estimation, treating global matching and local refinement as separate stages. We offer two key insights: First, the multi-scale 4D cost-volume based recurrent flow decoder is computa-tionally expensive and unnecessary for handling small dis-placement. With the separation, we can utilize lightweight methods for both parts and maintain similar performance.Second, a dense and robust global matching is essential for both flow initialization as well as stable and fast con-vergence for the refinement stage. Towards this end, we introduce EMD-Flow, a framework that explicitly sepa-rates global motion estimation from the recurrent refine-ment stage. We propose two novel modules: Multi-scaleMotion Aggregation (MMA) and Confidence-induced FlowPropagation (CFP). These modules leverage cross-scale matching prior and self-contained confidence maps to han-dle the ambiguities of dense matching in a global manner, generating a dense initial flow. Additionally, a lightweight decoding module is followed to handle small displacements, resulting in an efficient yet robust flow estimation frame-work. We further conduct comprehensive experiments on standard optical flow benchmarks with the proposed frame-work, and the experimental results demonstrate its superior balance between performance and runtime.
