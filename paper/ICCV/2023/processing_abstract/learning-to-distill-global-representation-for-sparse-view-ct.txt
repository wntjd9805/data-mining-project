Sparse-view computed tomography (CT)—using a small number of projections for tomographic reconstruction— enables much lower radiation dose to patients and accel-erated data acquisition. The reconstructed images, how-ever, suffer from strong artifacts, greatly limiting their di-agnostic value. Current trends for sparse-view CT turn to the raw data for better information recovery. The re-sultant dual-domain methods, nonetheless, suffer from sec-ondary artifacts, especially in ultra-sparse view scenar-ios, and their generalization to other scanners/protocols is greatly limited. A crucial question arises: have the image post-processing methods reached the limit? Our answer is not yet.In this paper, we stick to image post-processing methods due to great flexibility and propose global rep-resentation(GloRe) distillation framework for sparse-viewCT, termed GloReDi. First, we propose to learn GloRe with Fourier convolution, so each element in GloRe has an image-wide receptive field. Second, unlike methods that only use the full-view images for supervision, we propose to distill GloRe from intermediate-view reconstructed images that are readily available but not explored in previous lit-erature. The success of GloRe distillation is attributed to two key components: representation directional distillation to align the GloRe directions, and band-pass-specific con-trastive distillation to gain clinically important details. Ex-tensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the pro-posed GloReDi over the state-of-the-art methods, including dual-domain ones.
