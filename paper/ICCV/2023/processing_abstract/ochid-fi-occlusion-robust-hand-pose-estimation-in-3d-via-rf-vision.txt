Hand Pose Estimation (HPE) is crucial to many appli-cations, but conventional cameras-based CM-HPE meth-ods are completely subject to Line-of-Sight (LoS), as cam-eras cannot capture occluded objects.In this paper, we propose to exploit Radio-Frequency-Vision (RF-vision) ca-pable of bypassing obstacles for achieving occluded HPE, and we introduce OCHID-Fi as the first RF-HPE method with 3D pose estimation capability. OCHID-Fi employs wideband RF sensors widely available on smart devices (e.g., iPhones) to probe 3D human hand pose and extract their skeletons behind obstacles. To overcome the chal-lenge in labeling RF imaging given its human incompre-hensible nature, OCHID-Fi employs a cross-modality and cross-domain training process. It uses a pre-trained CM-HPE network and a synchronized CM/RF dataset, to guide the training of its complex-valued RF-HPE network underLoS conditions. It further transfers knowledge learned from labeled LoS domain to unlabeled occluded domain via ad-versarial learning, enabling OCHID-Fi to generalize to un-seen occluded scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of OCHID-Fi: it achieves comparable accu-racy to CM-HPE under normal conditions while maintain-ing such accuracy even in occluded scenarios, with empiri-cal evidence for its generalizability to new domains.
