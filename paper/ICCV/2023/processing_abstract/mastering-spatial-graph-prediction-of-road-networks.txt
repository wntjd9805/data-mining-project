Accurately predicting road networks from satellite im-ages requires a global understanding of the network topol-ogy. We propose to capture such high-level information by introducing a graph-based framework that given a par-tially generated graph, sequentially adds new edges. To deal with misalignment between the model predictions and the intended purpose, and to optimize over complex, non-continuous metrics of interest, we adopt a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that nominates modifications that maximize a cumulative reward. As opposed to standard su-pervised techniques that tend to be more restricted to com-monly used surrogate losses, our framework yields more power and flexibility to encode problem-dependent knowl-edge. Empirical results on several benchmark datasets demonstrate enhanced performance and increased high-level reasoning about the graph topology when using a tree-based search. We further demonstrate the superiority of our approach in handling examples with substantial occlusion and additionally provide evidence that our predictions bet-ter match the statistical properties of the ground dataset.
