ImagesSegmentation DetectionOursCracks are usually curve-like structures that are the fo-cus of many computer-vision applications (e.g., road safety inspection and surface inspection of the industrial facili-ties). The existing pixel-based crack segmentation meth-ods rely on time-consuming and costly pixel-level annota-tions. And the object-based crack detection methods exploit the horizontal box to detect the crack without considering crack orientation, resulting in scale variation and intra-class variation. Considering this, we provide a new per-spective for crack detection that models the cracks as a se-ries of sub-cracks with the corresponding orientation. How-ever, the vanilla adaptation of the existing oriented object detection methods to the crack detection tasks will result in limited performance, due to the boundary discontinuity is-In this sue and the ambiguities in sub-crack orientation. paper, we propose a ﬁrst-of-its-kind oriented sub-crack de-tector, dubbed as CrackDet, which is derived from a novel piecewise angle deﬁnition, to ease the boundary disconti-nuity problem. And then, we propose a multi-branch an-gle regression loss for learning sub-crack orientation and variance together. Since there are no related benchmarks, we construct three fully annotated datasets, namely, ORC,ONPP, and OCCSD, which involve various cracks in road pavement and industrial facilities. Experiments show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art crack detectors.
