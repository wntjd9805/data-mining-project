Many weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods employ the class activation map (CAM) to gen-erate the initial segmentation results. However, CAM of-ten fails to distinguish the foreground from its co-occurred background (e.g., train and railroad), resulting in inaccu-rate activation from the background. Previous endeavors address this co-occurrence issue by introducing external su-In this paper, we present a pervision and human priors.False Positive Rectiﬁcation (FPR) approach to tackle the co-occurrence problem by leveraging the false positives ofCAM. Based on the observation that the CAM-activated re-gions of absent classes contain class-speciﬁc co-occurred background cues, we collect these false positives and utilize them to guide the training of CAM network by proposing a region-level contrast loss and a pixel-level rectiﬁcation loss. Without introducing any external supervision and hu-man priors, the proposed FPR effectively suppresses wrong activations from the background objects. Extensive exper-iments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 demonstrate that FPR brings signiﬁcant improvements for off-the-shelf methods and achieves state-of-the-art perfor-mance.
