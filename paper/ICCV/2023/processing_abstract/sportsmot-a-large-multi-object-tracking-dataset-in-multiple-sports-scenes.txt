Multi-object tracking (MOT) in sports scenes plays a critical role in gathering players statistics, supporting fur-ther applications, such as automatic tactical analysis. Yet existing MOT benchmarks cast little attention on this do-main.In this work, we present a new large-scale multi-object tracking dataset in multiple sports scenes, coined as SportsMOT, where all players on the court are sup-posed to be tracked.It consists of 240 video sequences, over 150K frames (almost 15× MOT17) and over 1.6M bounding boxes (3× MOT17) collected from 3 sports cat-egories, including basketball, volleyball and football. Our dataset is characterized with two key properties: 1) fast and variable-speed motion and 2) similar yet distinguish-able appearance. We expect SportsMOT to encourage theMOT trackers to promote in both motion-based associa-tion and appearance-based association. We benchmark several state-of-the-art trackers and reveal the key chal-lenge of SportsMOT lies in object association. To alleviate the issue, we further propose a new multi-object tracking framework, termed as MixSort, introducing a MixFormer-like structure as an auxiliary association model to pre-vailing tracking-by-detection trackers. By integrating the customized appearance-based association with the original motion-based association, MixSort achieves state-of-the-art performance on SportsMOT and MOT17. Based on Mix-Sort, we give an in-depth analysis and provide some pro-found insights into SportsMOT.
