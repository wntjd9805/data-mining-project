Registration of distant outdoor LiDAR point clouds is crucial to extending the 3D vision of collaborative au-tonomous vehicles, and yet is challenging due to small overlapping area and a huge disparity between observed point densities. In this paper, we propose Group-wise Con-trastive Learning (GCL) scheme to extract density-invariant geometric features to register distant outdoor LiDAR point clouds. We mark through theoretical analysis and exper-iments that, contrastive positives should be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), in order to train density-invariant feature extractors. We propose upon the conclu-sion a simple yet effective training scheme to force the fea-ture of multiple point clouds in the same spatial location (referred to as positive groups) to be similar, which natu-rally avoids the sampling bias introduced by a pair of point* Corresponding author clouds to conform with the i.i.d. principle. The resulting fully-convolutional feature extractor is more powerful and density-invariant than state-of-the-art methods, improving the registration recall of distant scenarios on KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks by 40.9% and 26.9%, respectively.Code is available at https://github.com/liuQuan98/GCL.
