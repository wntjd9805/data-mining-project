Anomaly segmentation is a critical task for driving ap-plications, and it is approached traditionally as a per-pixel classification problem. However, reasoning individ-ually about each pixel without considering their contex-tual semantics results in high uncertainty around the ob-jectsâ€™ boundaries and numerous false positives. We pro-pose a paradigm change by shifting from a per-pixel classi-fication to a mask classification. Our mask-based method,Mask2Anomaly, demonstrates the feasibility of integrating an anomaly detection method in a mask-classification ar-chitecture. Mask2Anomaly includes several technical nov-elties that are designed to improve the detection of anoma-lies in masks: i) a global masked attention module to focus individually on the foreground and background regions; ii) a mask contrastive learning that maximizes the margin be-tween an anomaly and known classes; and iii) a mask re-finement solution to reduce false positives. Mask2Anomaly achieves new state-of-the-art results across a range of benchmarks, both in the per-pixel and component-level evaluations. In particular, Mask2Anomaly reduces the av-erage false positives rate by 60% w.r.t. the previous state-of-the-art.
