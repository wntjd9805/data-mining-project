Garments are important and pervasive in daily life.However, visual analysis on them for pose estimation is challenging because it requires recovering the complete configurations of garments, which is difficult, if not impos-sible, to annotate in the real world. In this work, we pro-pose a recording system, GarmentTwin, which can track garment poses in dynamic settings such as manipulation.GarmentTwin first collects garment models and RGB-D ma-nipulation videos from the real world and then replays the manipulation process using physics-based animation. This way, we can obtain deformed garments with poses coarsely aligned with real-world observations. Finally, we adopt an optimization-based approach to fit the pose with real-world observations. We verify the fitting results quantita-tively and qualitatively. With GarmentTwin, we construct a large-scale dataset named ClothPose, which consists of 30K RGB-D frames from 2400 video clips on 600 garments of 10 categories. We benchmark two tasks on the proposedClothPose: non-rigid reconstruction and pose estimation.The experiments show that previous baseline methods strug-gle with highly large non-rigid deformation of manipulated garments. Therefore, we hope that the recording system and the dataset can facilitate research on pose estimation tasks on non-rigid objects. Datasets, models, and codes will be made publicly available.
