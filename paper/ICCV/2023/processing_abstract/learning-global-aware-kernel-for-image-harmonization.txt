Image harmonization aims to solve the visual inconsis-tency problem in composited images by adaptively adjust-ing the foreground pixels with the background as references.Existing methods employ local color transformation or re-gion matching between foreground and background, which neglects powerful proximity prior and independently distin-guishes fore-/back-ground as a whole part for harmoniza-tion. As a result, they still show a limited performance across varied foreground objects and scenes. To address this issue, we propose a novel Global-aware Kernel Net-work (GKNet) to harmonize local regions with comprehen-sive consideration of long-distance background references.Specifically, GKNet includes two parts, i.e., harmony ker-nel prediction and harmony kernel modulation branches.The former includes a Long-distance Reference Extractor (LRE) to obtain long-distance context and Kernel Predic-tion Blocks (KPB) to predict multi-level harmony kernels by fusing global information with local features. To achieve this goal, a novel Selective Correlation Fusion (SCF) mod-ule is proposed to better select relevant long-distance back-ground references for local harmonization. The latter em-ploys the predicted kernels to harmonize foreground re-gions with local and global awareness. Abundant experi-ments demonstrate the superiority of our method for image harmonization over state-of-the-art methods, e.g., achiev-ing 39.53dB PSNR that surpasses the best counterpart by+0.78dB ↑; decreasing fMSE/MSE by 11.5%↓/6.7%↓ com-pared with the SoTA method.
