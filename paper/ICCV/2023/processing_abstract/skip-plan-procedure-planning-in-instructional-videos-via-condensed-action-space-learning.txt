In this paper, we propose Skip-Plan, a condensed action space learning method for procedure planning in instruc-tional videos. Current procedure planning methods all stick to the state-action pair prediction at every timestep and gen-erate actions adjacently. Although it coincides with human intuition, such a methodology consistently struggles with high-dimensional state supervision and error accumulation on action sequences.In this work, we abstract the pro-cedure planning problem as a mathematical chain model.By skipping uncertain nodes and edges in action chains, we transfer long and complex sequence functions into short but reliable ones in two ways. First, we skip all the inter-mediate state supervision and only focus on action predic-tions. Second, we decompose relatively long chains into multiple short sub-chains by skipping unreliable intermedi-ate actions. By this means, our model explores all sorts of reliable sub-relations within an action sequence in the con-densed action space. Extensive experiments show Skip-Plan achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CrossTask andCOIN benchmarks for procedure planning.
