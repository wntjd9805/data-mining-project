Human readers or radiologists routinely perform full-body multi-organ multi-disease detection and diagnosis in clinical practice, while most medical AI systems are built to focus on single organs with a narrow list of a few dis-eases. This might severely limit AIâ€™s clinical adoption. A certain number of AI models need to be assembled non-trivially to match the diagnostic process of a human read-ing a CT scan. In this paper, we construct a Unified Tu-mor Transformer (CancerUniT) model to jointly detect tu-mor existence & location and diagnose tumor characteris-tics for eight major cancers in CT scans. CancerUniT is a query-based Mask Transformer model with the output of multi-tumor prediction. We decouple the object queries into organ queries, tumor detection queries and tumor diagno-sis queries, and further establish hierarchical relationships among the three groups. This clinically-inspired architec-ture effectively assists inter- and intra-organ representation learning of tumors and facilitates the resolution of these complex, anatomically related multi-organ cancer image reading tasks. CancerUniT is trained end-to-end using a curated large-scale CT images of 10,042 patients includ-ing eight major types of cancers and occurring non-cancer tumors (all are pathology-confirmed with 3D tumor masks annotated by radiologists). On the test set of 631 patients,CancerUniT has demonstrated strong performance under a set of clinically relevant evaluation metrics, substantially outperforming both multi-disease methods and an assem-bly of eight single-organ expert models in tumor detection,*Correspondence to Jieneng Chen (jienengchen01@gmail.com),Liu (yingda.xia@alibaba-inc.com),Zaiyi andXiaYingda (zyliu@163.com)Figure 1.
