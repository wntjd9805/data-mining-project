For improving image composition and aesthetic qual-ity, most existing methods modulate the captured images by striking out redundant content near the image borders.However, such image cropping methods are limited in the range of image views. Some methods have been suggested to extrapolate the images and predict cropping boxes from the extrapolated image. Nonetheless, the synthesized ex-trapolated regions may be included in the cropped image, making the image composition result not real and poten-tially with degraded image quality. In this paper, we circum-vent this issue by presenting a joint framework for both un-bounded recommendation of camera view and image com-position (i.e., UNIC). In this way, the cropped image is a sub-image of the image acquired by the predicted camera view, and thus can be guaranteed to be real and consis-tent in image quality. Specifically, our framework takes the current camera preview frame as input and provides a rec-ommendation for view adjustment, which contains opera-tions unlimited by the image borders, such as zooming in or out and camera movement. To improve the prediction accuracy of view adjustment prediction, we further extend the field of view by feature extrapolation. After one or sev-eral times of view adjustments, our method converges and results in both a camera view and a bounding box showing the image composition recommendation. Extensive experi-ments are conducted on the datasets constructed upon ex-isting image cropping datasets, showing the effectiveness of our UNIC in unbounded recommendation of camera view and image composition.
