Efficient ObjectGoal navigation (ObjectNav) in novel environments requires an understanding of the spatial and semantic regularities in environment layouts. In this work, we present a straightforward method for learning these regularities by predicting the locations of unobserved ob-jects from incomplete semantic maps. Our method differs from previous prediction-based navigation methods, such as frontier potential prediction or egocentric map comple-tion, by directly predicting unseen targets while leveraging the global context from all previously explored areas. Our prediction model is lightweight and can be trained in a su-pervised manner using a relatively small amount of pas-sively collected data. Once trained, the model can be incor-porated into a modular pipeline for ObjectNav without the need for any reinforcement learning. We validate the effec-tiveness of our method on the HM3D and MP3D ObjectNav datasets. We find that it achieves the state-of-the-art on both datasets, despite not using any additional data for training.Code is available at https:// ajzhai.github.io/ PEANUT.
