The goal of Online Domain Adaptation for semantic seg-mentation is to handle unforeseeable domain changes that occur during deployment, like sudden weather events. How-ever, the high computational costs associated with brute-force adaptation make this paradigm unfeasible for real-world applications. In this paper we propose HAMLET, aHardware-Aware Modular Least Expensive Training frame-work for real-time domain adaptation. Our approach in-cludes a hardware-aware back-propagation orchestration agent (HAMT) and a dedicated domain-shift detector that enables active control over when and how the model is adapted (LT). Thanks to these advancements, our approach is capable of performing semantic segmentation while si-multaneously adapting at more than 29FPS on a single consumer-grade GPU. Our frameworkâ€™s encouraging ac-curacy and speed trade-off is demonstrated on OnDA andSHIFT benchmarks through experimental results.
