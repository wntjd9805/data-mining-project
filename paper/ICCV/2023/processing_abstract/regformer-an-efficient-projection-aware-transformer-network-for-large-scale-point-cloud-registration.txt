Although point cloud registration has achieved remark-able advances in object-level and indoor scenes, large-scale registration methods are rarely explored. Challenges mainly arise from the huge point number, complex distri-bution, and outliers of outdoor LiDAR scans.In addi-tion, most existing registration works generally adopt a two-stage paradigm: They first find correspondences by extract-ing discriminative local features and then leverage estima-tors (eg. RANSAC) to filter outliers, which are highly de-pendent on well-designed descriptors and post-processing choices. To address these problems, we propose an end-to-end transformer network (RegFormer) for large-scale point cloud alignment without any further post-processing.Specifically, a projection-aware hierarchical transformer is proposed to capture long-range dependencies and filter out-liers by extracting point features globally. Our transformer has linear complexity, which guarantees high efficiency even for large-scale scenes. Furthermore, to effectively re-duce mismatches, a bijective association transformer is de-signed for regressing the initial transformation. Extensive experiments on KITTI and NuScenes datasets demonstrate that our RegFormer achieves competitive performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
