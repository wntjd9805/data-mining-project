We propose an algorithm, 4DRegSDF, for the spacetime surface regularization to improve the fidelity of neural ren-dering and reconstruction in dynamic scenes. The key idea is to impose local rigidity on the deformable Signed Dis-tance Function (SDF) for temporal coherency. Our ap-proach works by (1) sampling points on the deformed sur-face by taking gradient steps toward the steepest direc-tion along SDF, (2) extracting differential surface geom-etry, such as tangent plane or curvature, at each sample, and (3) adjusting the local rigidity at different timestamps.This enables our dynamic surface regularization to align 4D spacetime geometry via 3D canonical space more ac-curately. Experiments demonstrate that our 4DRegSDF achieves state-of-the-art performance in both reconstruc-tion and rendering quality over synthetic and real-world datasets. https://4dregsdf.github.io/
