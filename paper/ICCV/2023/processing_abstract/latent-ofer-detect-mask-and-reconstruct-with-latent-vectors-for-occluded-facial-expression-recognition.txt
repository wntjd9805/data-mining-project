Most research on facial expression recognition (FER) is conducted in highly controlled environments, but its perfor-mance is often unacceptable when applied to real-world sit-uations. This is because when unexpected objects occlude the face, the FER network faces difficulties extracting fa-cial features and accurately predicting facial expressions.Therefore, occluded FER (OFER) is a challenging problem.Previous studies on occlusion-aware FER have typically re-quired fully annotated facial images for training. However, collecting facial images with various occlusions and expres-sion annotations is time-consuming and expensive. Latent-OFER, the proposed method, can detect occlusions, restore occluded parts of the face as if they were unoccluded, and recognize them, improving FER accuracy. This approach involves three steps: First, the vision transformer (ViT)-based occlusion patch detector masks the occluded position by training only latent vectors from the unoccluded patches using the support vector data description algorithm. Sec-ond, the hybrid reconstruction network generates the mask-ing position as a complete image using the ViT and convolu-tional neural network (CNN). Last, the expression-relevant latent vector extractor retrieves and uses expression-related information from all latent vectors by applying a CNN-based class activation map. This mechanism has a sig-nificant advantage in preventing performance degradation from occlusion by unseen objects. The experimental results on several databases demonstrate the superiority of the pro-posed method over state-of-the-art methods. This code is available at https://github.com/leeisack/Latent-OFER.
