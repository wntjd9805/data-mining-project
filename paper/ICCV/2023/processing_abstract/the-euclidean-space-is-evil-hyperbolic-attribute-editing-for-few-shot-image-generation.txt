Few-shot image generation is a challenging task since it aims to generate diverse new images for an unseen cat-egory with only a few images. Existing methods suffer from the trade-off between the quality and diversity of gen-erated images. To tackle this problem, we propose Hy-perbolic Attribute Editing (HAE), a simple yet effective method. Unlike other methods that work in Euclidean space, HAE captures the hierarchy among images using data from seen categories in hyperbolic space. Given a well-trained HAE, images of unseen categories can be gen-erated by moving the latent code of a given image toward any meaningful directions in the PoincarÂ´e disk with a fix-ing radius. Most importantly, the hyperbolic space allows us to control the semantic diversity of the generated im-ages by setting different radii in the disk. Extensive exper-iments and visualizations demonstrate that HAE is capable of not only generating images with promising quality and diversity using limited data but achieving a highly control-lable and interpretable editing process.
