In incremental learning, replaying stored samples from previous tasks together with current task samples is one of the most efficient approaches to address catastrophic for-getting. However, unlike incremental classification, image replay has not been successfully applied to incremental ob-ject detection (IOD). In this paper, we identify the over-looked problem of foreground shift as the main reason for this. Foreground shift only occurs when replaying images of previous tasks and refers to the fact that their background might contain foreground objects of the current task. To overcome this problem, a novel and efficient Augmented BoxReplay (ABR) method is developed that only stores and re-plays foreground objects and thereby circumvents the fore-ground shift problem. In addition, we propose an innova-tive Attentive RoI Distillation loss that uses spatial atten-tion from region-of-interest (RoI) features to constrain cur-rent model to focus on the most important information from old model. ABR significantly reduces forgetting of previous classes while maintaining high plasticity in current classes.Moreover, it considerably reduces the storage requirements when compared to standard image replay. Comprehensive experiments on Pascal-VOC and COCO datasets support the state-of-the-art performance of our model 1.
