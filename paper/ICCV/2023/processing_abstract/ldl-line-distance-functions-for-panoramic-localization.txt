We introduce LDL, a fast and robust algorithm that localizes a panorama to a 3D map using line segments.LDL focuses on the sparse structural information of lines in the scene, which is robust to illumination changes and can potentially enable efficient computation. While pre-vious line-based localization approaches tend to sacrifice accuracy or computation time, our method effectively ob-serves the holistic distribution of lines within panoramic images and 3D maps. Specifically, LDL matches the dis-tribution of lines with 2D and 3D line distance functions, which are further decomposed along principal directions of lines to increase the expressiveness. The distance functions provide coarse pose estimates by comparing the distribu-tional information, where the poses are further optimized using conventional local feature matching. As our pipeline solely leverages line geometry and local features, it does not require costly additional training of line-specific features or correspondence matching. Nevertheless, our method demonstrates robust performance on challenging scenar-ios including object layout changes, illumination shifts, and large-scale scenes, while exhibiting fast pose search termi-nating within a matter of milliseconds. We thus expect our method to serve as a practical solution for line-based local-ization, and complement the well-established point-based paradigm.
