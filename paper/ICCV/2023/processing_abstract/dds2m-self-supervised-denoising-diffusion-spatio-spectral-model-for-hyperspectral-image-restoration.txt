Diffusion models have recently received a surge of inter-est due to their impressive performance for image restora-tion, especially in terms of noise robustness. However, exist-ing diffusion-based methods are trained on a large amount of training data and perform very well in-distribution, but can be quite susceptible to distribution shift. This is es-pecially inappropriate for data-starved hyperspectral im-age (HSI) restoration. To tackle this problem, this work puts forth a self-supervised diffusion model for HSI restora-tion, namely Denoising Diffusion Spatio-Spectral Model (DDS2M), which works by inferring the parameters of the proposed Variational Spatio-Spectral Module (VS2M) dur-ing the reverse diffusion process, solely using the degradedHSI without any extra training data.In VS2M, a varia-tional inference-based loss function is customized to en-able the untrained spatial and spectral networks to learn the posterior distribution, which serves as the transitions of the sampling chain to help reverse the diffusion process.Beneﬁting from its self-supervised nature and the diffusion process, DDS2M enjoys stronger generalization ability to various HSIs compared to existing diffusion-based methods and superior robustness to noise compared to existing HSI restoration methods. Extensive experiments on HSI denois-ing, noisy HSI completion and super-resolution on a vari-ety of HSIs demonstrate DDS2M’s superiority over the ex-isting task-speciﬁc state-of-the-arts.
