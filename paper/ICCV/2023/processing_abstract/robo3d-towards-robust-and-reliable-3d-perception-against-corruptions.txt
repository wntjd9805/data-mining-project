The robustness of 3D perception systems under natu-ral corruptions from environments and sensors is pivotal for safety-critical applications. Existing large-scale 3D perception datasets often contain data that are meticu-lously cleaned. Such configurations, however, cannot reflect the reliability of perception models during the deployment stage. In this work, we present Robo3D, the first compre-hensive benchmark heading toward probing the robustness of 3D detectors and segmentors under out-of-distribution scenarios against natural corruptions that occur in real-world environments. Specifically, we consider eight corrup-tion types stemming from severe weather conditions, exter-nal disturbances, and internal sensor failure. We uncover that, although promising results have been progressively achieved on standard benchmarks, state-of-the-art 3D per-ception models are at risk of being vulnerable to corrup-tions. We draw key observations on the use of data represen-tations, augmentation schemes, and training strategies, that could severely affect the modelâ€™s performance. To pursue better robustness, we propose a density-insensitive training framework along with a simple flexible voxelization strat-egy to enhance the model resiliency. We hope our bench-mark and approach could inspire future research in design-ing more robust and reliable 3D perception models. Our robustness benchmark suite is publicly available1.
