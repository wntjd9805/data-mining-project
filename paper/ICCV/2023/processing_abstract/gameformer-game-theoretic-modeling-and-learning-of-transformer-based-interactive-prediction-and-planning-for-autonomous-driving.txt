Autonomous vehicles operating in complex real-world environments require accurate predictions of interactive be-haviors between trafﬁc participants. This paper tackles the interaction prediction problem by formulating it with hierarchical game theory and proposing the GameFormer model for its implementation. The model incorporates aTransformer encoder, which effectively models the relation-ships between scene elements, alongside a novel hierarchi-cal Transformer decoder structure. At each decoding level, the decoder utilizes the prediction outcomes from the previ-ous level, in addition to the shared environmental context, to iteratively reﬁne the interaction process. Moreover, we propose a learning process that regulates an agent’s be-havior at the current level to respond to other agents’ be-haviors from the preceding level. Through comprehensive experiments on large-scale real-world driving datasets, we demonstrate the state-of-the-art accuracy of our model on the Waymo interaction prediction task. Additionally, we val-idate the model’s capacity to jointly reason about the mo-tion plan of the ego agent and the behaviors of multiple agents in both open-loop and closed-loop planning tests, outperforming various baseline methods. Furthermore, we evaluate the efﬁcacy of our model on the nuPlan planning benchmark, where it achieves leading performance. Project website: https://mczhi.github.io/GameFormer/
