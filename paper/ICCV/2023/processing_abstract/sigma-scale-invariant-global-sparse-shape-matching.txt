We propose a novel mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation for generating precise sparse correspondences for highly non-rigid shapes. To this end, we introduce a projected Laplace-Beltrami operator (PLBO) which com-bines intrinsic and extrinsic geometric information to mea-sure the deformation quality induced by predicted corre-spondences. We integrate the PLBO, together with an orientation-aware regulariser, into a novel MIP formula-tion that can be solved to global optimality for many prac-tical problems.In contrast to previous methods, our ap-proach is provably invariant to rigid transformations and global scaling, initialisation-free, has optimality guaran-tees, and scales to high resolution meshes with (empiri-cally observed) linear time. We show state-of-the-art re-sults for sparse non-rigid matching on several challenging 3D datasets, including data with inconsistent meshing, as well as applications in mesh-to-point-cloud matching.
