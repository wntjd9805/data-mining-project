Medical imaging analysis plays a critical role in the di-agnosis and treatment of various medical conditions. This paper focuses on chest X-ray images and their correspond-It presents a new model that ing radiological reports. learns a joint X-ray image & report representation. The model is based on a novel alignment scheme between the visual data and the text, which takes into account both lo-cal and global information. Furthermore, the model in-tegrates domain-specific information of two typesâ€”lateral images and the consistent visual structure of chest images.Our representation is shown to benefit three types of re-text-image retrieval, class-based retrieval, trieval tasks: and phrase-grounding.
