Recently proposed LaMa [25] introduce Fast FourierConvolution (FFC) [4] into image inpainting. FFC empow-ers the fully convolutional network to have a global recep-tive ﬁeld in its early layers, and have the ability to produce robust repeating texture. However, LaMa has difﬁculty in generating clear and sharp complex content. In this paper, we analyze the fundamental ﬂaws of using FFC in image inpainting, which are 1) spectrum shifting, 2) unexpected spatial activation, and 3) limited frequency receptive ﬁeld.Such ﬂaws make FFC-based inpainting framework difﬁcult in generating complicated texture and performing faithful reconstruction. Based on the above analysis, we propose a novel Unbiased Fast Fourier Convolution (UFFC) module.UFFC is constructed by modifying the vanilla FFC mod-ule with 1) range transform and inverse transform, 2) abso-lute position embedding, 3) dynamic skip connection, and 4) adaptive clip, to overcome the above ﬂaws. UFFC cap-tures frequency information efﬁciently and realize recon-struction without introducing additional artifacts, achiev-ing better inpainting results and more efﬁcient training.

Extensive ex-periments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods in both texture-capturing ability and expres-siveness.
