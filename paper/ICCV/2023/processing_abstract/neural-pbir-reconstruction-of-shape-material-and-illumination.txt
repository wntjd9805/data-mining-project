Reconstructing the shape and spatially varying sur-face appearances of a physical-world object as well as its surrounding illumination based on 2D images (e.g., pho-tographs) of the object has been a long-standing problem in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we intro-duce an accurate and highly efﬁcient object reconstruction pipeline combining neural based object reconstruction and physics-based inverse rendering (PBIR). Our pipeline ﬁrstly leverages a neural SDF based shape reconstruction to pro-duce high-quality but potentially imperfect object shape.Then, we introduce a neural material and lighting distil-lation stage to achieve high-quality predictions for mate-rial and illumination. In the last stage, initialized by the neural predictions, we perform PBIR to reﬁne the initial results and obtain the ﬁnal high-quality reconstruction of object shape, material, and illumination. Experimental re-sults demonstrate our pipeline signiﬁcantly outperforms ex-isting methods quality-wise and performance-wise. Code: https://neural-pbir.github.io/
