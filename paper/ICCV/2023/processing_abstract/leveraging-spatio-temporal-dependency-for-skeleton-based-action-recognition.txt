Skeleton-based action recognition has attracted consid-erable attention due to its compact representation of the human bodyâ€™s skeletal sructure. Many recent methods have achieved remarkable performance using graph con-volutional networks (GCNs) and convolutional neural net-works (CNNs), which extract spatial and temporal fea-tures, respectively. Although spatial and temporal depen-dencies in the human skeleton have been explored sep-arately, spatio-temporal dependency is rarely considered.In this paper, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Curve Net-work (STC-Net) to effectively leverage the spatio-temporal dependency of the human skeleton. Our proposed net-work consists of two novel elements: 1) The Spatio-Temporal Curve (STC) module; and 2) Dilated Kernels for Graph Convolution (DK-GC). The STC module dynam-ically adjusts the receptive field by identifying meaning-ful node connections between every adjacent frame and generating spatio-temporal curves based on the identified node connections, providing an adaptive spatio-temporal coverage.In addition, we propose DK-GC to consider long-range dependencies, which results in a large recep-tive field without any additional parameters by applying an extended kernel to the given adjacency matrices of the graph. Our STC-Net combines these two modules and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/Jho-Yonsei/STC-Net.
