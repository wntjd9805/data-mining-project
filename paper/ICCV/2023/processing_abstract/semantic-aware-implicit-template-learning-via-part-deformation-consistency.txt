Learning implicit templates as neural fields has recently shown impressive performance in unsupervised shape cor-respondence. Despite the success, we observe current ap-proaches, which solely rely on geometric information, often learn suboptimal deformation across generic object shapes,In this paper, we which have high structural variability. highlight the importance of part deformation consistency and propose a semantic-aware implicit template learning framework to enable semantically plausible deformation.By leveraging semantic prior from a self-supervised fea-ture extractor, we suggest local conditioning with novel semantic-aware deformation code and deformation consis-tency regularizations regarding part deformation, global deformation, and global scaling. Our extensive experi-ments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over baselines in various tasks: keypoint transfer, part la-bel transfer, and texture transfer. More interestingly, our framework shows a larger performance gain under more challenging settings. We also provide qualitative analyses to validate the effectiveness of semantic-aware deformation.The code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/PDC.
