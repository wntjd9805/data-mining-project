While 3D body reconstruction methods have made re-markable progress recently, it remains difﬁcult to acquire the sufﬁciently accurate and numerous 3D supervisions re-quired for training.In this paper, we propose KNOWN, a framework that effectively utilizes body KNOWledge and uNcertainty modeling to compensate for insufﬁcient 3D supervisions. KNOWN exploits a comprehensive set of generic body constraints derived from well-established body knowledge. These generic constraints precisely and explicitly characterize the reconstruction plausibility and enable 3D reconstruction models to be trained without any 3D data. Moreover, existing methods typically use im-ages from multiple datasets during training, which can result in data noise (e.g., inconsistent joint annotation) and data imbalance (e.g., minority images representing un-usual poses or captured from challenging camera views).KNOWN solves these problems through a novel probabilis-tic framework that models both aleatoric and epistemic un-certainty. Aleatoric uncertainty is encoded in a robust Neg-ative Log-Likelihood (NLL) training loss, while epistemic uncertainty is used to guide model reﬁnement. Experi-ments demonstrate that KNOWN’s body reconstruction out-performs prior weakly-supervised approaches, particularly on the challenging minority images.
