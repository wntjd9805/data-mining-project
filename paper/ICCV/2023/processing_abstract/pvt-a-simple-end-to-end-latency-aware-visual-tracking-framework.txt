Offline vs Online-based Tracking EvaluationVisual object tracking is essential to intelligent robots.Most existing approaches have ignored the online latency that can cause severe performance degradation during real-world processing. Especially for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), where robust tracking is more challenging and on-board computation is limited, the latency issue can be fatal.In this work, we present a simple framework for end-to-end latency-aware tracking, i.e., end-to-end predictive visual tracking (PVT++). Unlike existing solutions that naively append Kalman Filters after trackers, PVT++ can be jointly optimized, so that it takes not only motion information but can also leverage the rich visual knowledge in most pre-trained tracker models for robust prediction. Besides, to bridge the training-evaluation domain gap, we propose a relative motion factor, empowering PVT++ to generalize to the challenging and complex UAV tracking scenes. These careful designs have made the small-capacity lightweightPVT++ a widely effective solution. Additionally, this work presents an extended latency-aware evaluation benchmark for assessing an any-speed tracker in the online setting.Empirical results on a robotic platform from the aerial per-spective show that PVT++ can achieve significant perfor-mance gain on various trackers and exhibit higher accu-racy than prior solutions, largely mitigating the degrada-tion brought by latency.
