Cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure is vi-tal to enhancing the safety of autonomous driving. Two significant and contradictory challenges now stand in the collaborative perception: fusion accuracy and communica-tion bandwidth. Previous intermediate fusion methods that transmit features balance the accuracy and bandwidth com-pared with early fusion and late fusion, but usually have problems with feature alignment and domain gaps, and the bandwidth usage still falls short of the industrial applica-tion standard to our best knowledge.In this paper, we propose TransIFF, an instance-level feature fusion framework with transformers that can effec-tively reduce bandwidth usage. Furthermore, it can align the domain gaps between vehicle and infrastructure fea-tures, and improve the robustness of feature fusion, lead-ing to a high cooperative perception accuracy. TransIFF is composed of three components: a vehicle-side network, an infrastructure-side network, and a vehicle-infrastructure fu-sion network. Initially, the vehicle-side and infrastructure-side networks independently generate instance-level fea-tures. Subsequently, the infrastructure-side instance-level features are transmitted to the vehicles, significantly reduc-ing the communication bandwidth usage. Finally, in the vehicle-infrastructure fusion network, Cross-Domain Adap-tation (CDA) module is designed to align the feature do-mains, followed by Feature Magnet (FM) module which can adaptively fuse the instance features and achieve a ro-bust feature fusion. TransIFF yields state-of-the-art perfor-mance on the widely used real-world vehicle-infrastructure cooperative benchmark DAIR-V2X, achieving 59.62% AP with only 212 bytes bandwidth consumption.
