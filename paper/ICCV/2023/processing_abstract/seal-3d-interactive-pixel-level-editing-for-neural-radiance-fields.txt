With the popularity of implicit neural representations, or neural radiance fields (NeRF), there is a pressing need for editing methods to interact with the implicit 3D mod-els for tasks like post-processing reconstructed scenes and 3D content creation. While previous works have exploredNeRF editing from various perspectives, they are restricted in editing flexibility, quality, and speed, failing to offer di-rect editing response and instant preview. The key chal-lenge is to conceive a locally editable neural representa-tion that can directly reflect the editing instructions and up-date instantly. To bridge the gap, we propose a new interac-tive editing method and system for implicit representations, called Seal-3D 1 , which allows users to edit NeRF models in a pixel-level and free manner with a wide range of NeRF-∗Equal contribution.†Corresponding author.Project page: https://windingwind.github.io/seal-3d/ 1“Seal” derived from the name of rubber stamp in Adobe Photoshop. like backbone and preview the editing effects instantly. To achieve the effects, the challenges are addressed by our pro-posed proxy function mapping the editing instructions to the original space of NeRF models in the teacher model and a two-stage training strategy for the student model with local pretraining and global finetuning. A NeRF editing system is built to showcase various editing types. Our system can achieve compelling editing effects with an interactive speed of about 1 second.
