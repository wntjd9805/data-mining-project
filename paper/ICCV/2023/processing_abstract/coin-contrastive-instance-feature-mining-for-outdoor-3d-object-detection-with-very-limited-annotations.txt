Recently, 3D object detection with sparse annotations has received great attention. However, current detectors usually perform poorly under very limited annotations. To address this problem, we propose a novel Contrastive In-stance feature mining method, named CoIn. To better identify indistinguishable features learned through limited supervision, we design a Multi-Class contrastive learn-ing module (MCcont) to enhance feature discrimination.Meanwhile, we propose a feature-level pseudo-label mining framework consisting of an instance feature mining module (InF-Mining) and a Labeled-to-Pseudo contrastive learn-ing module (LPcont). These two modules exploit latent in-stances in feature space to supervise the training of detec-tors with limited annotations. Extensive experiments withKITTI dataset, Waymo open dataset, and nuScenes dataset show that under limited annotations, our method greatly improves the performance of baseline detectors: Center-Point, Voxel-RCNN, and CasA. Combining CoIn with an iterative training strategy, we propose a CoIn++ pipeline, which requires only 2% annotations in the KITTI dataset to achieve performance comparable to the fully supervised methods.
