Pedestrian trajectory prediction is an essential link to understanding human behavior. Recent work achieves state-of-the-art performance gained from hand-designed post-processing, e.g., clustering. However, this post-processing suffers from expensive inference time and ne-glects the probability that the predicted trajectory disturbs downstream safety decisions.In this paper, we presentTrajectory Unified TRansformer, called TUTR, which uni-fies the trajectory prediction components, social interac-tion, and multimodal trajectory prediction, into a trans-former encoder-decoder architecture to effectively remove the need for post-processing. Specifically, TUTR parses the relationships across various motion modes using an explicit global prediction and an implicit mode-level transformer encoder. Then, TUTR attends to the social interactions with neighbors by a social-level transformer decoder. Finally, a dual prediction forecasts diverse trajectories and corre-sponding probabilities in parallel without post-processing.TUTR achieves state-of-the-art accuracy performance and improvements in inference speed of about 10× - 40× com-pared to previous well-tuned state-of-the-art methods using post-processing.
