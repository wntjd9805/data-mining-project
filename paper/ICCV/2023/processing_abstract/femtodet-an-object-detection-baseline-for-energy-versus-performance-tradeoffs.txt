Efficient detectors for edge devices are often optimized for parameters or speed count metrics, which remain in weak correlation with the energy of detectors. However, some vision applications of convolutional neural networks, such as always-on surveillance cameras, are critical for en-ergy constraints. This paper aims to serve as a baseline by designing detectors to reach tradeoffs between energy and performance from two perspectives: 1) We extensively analyze various CNNs to identify low-energy architectures, including selecting activation functions, convolutions oper-ators, and feature fusion structures on necks. These under-appreciated details in past work seriously affect the energy consumption of detectors; 2) To break through the dilem-matic energy-performance problem, we propose a balanced detector driven by energy using discovered low-energy com-In addition to the novel con-ponents named FemtoDet. struction, we improve FemtoDet by considering convolu-tions and training strategy optimizations. Specifically, we develop a new instance boundary enhancement (IBE) mod-ule for convolution optimization to overcome the contradic-tion between the limited capacity of CNNs and detection tasks in diverse spatial representations, and propose a re-cursive warm-restart (RecWR) for optimizing training strat-egy to escape the sub-optimization of light-weight detectors by considering the data shift produced in popular augmen-tations. As a result, FemtoDet with only 68.77k parameters achieves a competitive score of 46.3 AP50 on PASCAL VOC and 1.11 W & 64.47 FPS on Qualcomm Snapdragon 865CPU platforms. Extensive experiments on COCO and TJU-DHD datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves competitive results in diverse scenes.
