Current state-of-the-art semi-supervised semantic seg-mentation (SSSS) methods typically adopt pseudo labeling and consistency regularization between multiple learners with different perturbations. Although the performance is desirable, many issues remain: (1) supervisions from a sin-gle learner tend to be noisy which causes unreliable con-sistency regularization (2) existing pixel-wise confidence-score-based reliability measurement causes potential er-ror accumulation as the training proceeds. In this paper, we propose a novel SSSS framework, called CFCG, which combines cross-fusion and contour guidance supervision to tackle these issues. Concretely, we adopt both image-level and feature-level perturbations to expand feature distribu-tion thus pushing the potential limits of consistency regular-ization. Then, two particular modules are proposed to en-able effective semi-supervised learning under heavy coher-ent perturbations. Firstly, Cross-Fusion Supervision (CFS) mechanism leverages multiple learners to enhance the qual-ity of pseudo labels. Secondly, we introduce an adaptive contour guidance module (ACGM) to effectively identify un-reliable spatial regions in pseudo labels. Finally, our pro-posed CFCG achieves gains of mIoU +1.40%, +0.89% with a single learner and +1.85%, +1.33% by fusion inference on PASCAL VOC 2012 and on Cityscapes respectively un-der 1/8 protocols, clearly surpassing previous methods and reaching the state-of-the-art.
