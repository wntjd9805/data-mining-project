We present NeRF-Det, a novel method for indoor 3D de-tection with posed RGB images as input. Unlike existing indoor 3D detection methods that struggle to model scene geometry, our method makes novel use of NeRF in an end-to-end manner to explicitly estimate 3D geometry, thereby improving 3D detection performance. Specifically, to avoid the significant extra latency associated with per-scene opti-mization of NeRF, we introduce sufficient geometry priors to enhance the generalizability of NeRF-MLP. Further-more, we subtly connect the detection and NeRF branches through a shared MLP, enabling an efficient adaptation ofNeRF to detection and yielding geometry-aware volumetric representations for 3D detection. Our method outperforms state-of-the-arts by 3.9 mAP and 3.1 mAP on the ScanNet and ARKITScenes benchmarks, respectively. We provide extensive analysis to shed light on how NeRF-Det works.This work was done when Chenfeng was an intern at Meta.âˆ—Corresponding author.As a result of our joint-training design, NeRF-Det is able to generalize well to unseen scenes for object detection, view synthesis, and depth estimation tasks without requiring per-scene optimization.
