Chamfer distance (CD) is a standard metric to measure the shape dissimilarity between point clouds in point cloud completion, as well as a loss function for (deep) learning.However, it is well known that CD is vulnerable to out-In liers, leading to the drift towards suboptimal models. contrast to the literature where most works address such issues in Euclidean space, we propose an extremely sim-ple yet powerful metric for point cloud completion, namelyHyperbolic Chamfer Distance (HyperCD), that computesCD in hyperbolic space.In backpropagation, HyperCD consistently assigns higher weights to the matched point pairs with smaller Euclidean distances. In this way, good point matches are likely to be preserved while bad matches can be updated gradually, leading to better completion re-sults. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark datasets, i.e. PCN, ShapeNet-55, and ShapeNet-34, and show from visualization that HyperCD can signif-icantly improve the surface smoothness.
