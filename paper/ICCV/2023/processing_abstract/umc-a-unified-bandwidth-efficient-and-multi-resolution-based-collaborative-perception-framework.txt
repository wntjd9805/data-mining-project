Multi-agent collaborative perception (MCP) has re-cently attracted much attention. It includes three key pro-cesses: communication for sharing, collaboration for inte-gration, and reconstruction for different downstream tasks.Existing methods pursue designing the collaboration pro-ignoring their intrinsic interactions and re-cess alone, sulting in suboptimal performance.In contrast, we aim to propose a Unified Collaborative perception framework named UMC, optimizing the communication, collabora-tion, and reconstruction processes with the Multi-resolution technique. The communication introduces a novel train-able multi-resolution and selective-region (MRSR) mecha-nism, achieving higher quality and lower bandwidth. Then, a graph-based collaboration is proposed, conducting on each resolution to adapt the MRSR. Finally, the reconstruc-tion integrates the multi-resolution collaborative features for downstream tasks. Since the general metric can not re-flect the performance enhancement brought by MCP sys-tematically, we introduce a brand-new evaluation metric that evaluates the MCP from different perspectives. To ver-ify our algorithm, we conducted experiments on the V2X-Sim and OPV2V datasets. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments prove that the proposed UMC outperforms the state-of-the-art collaborative perception approaches.
