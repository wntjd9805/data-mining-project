Positive-unlabeled learning (PU learning) in hyperspec-tral remote sensing imagery (HSI) is aimed at learning a bi-nary classifier from positive and unlabeled data, which has broad prospects in various earth vision applications. How-ever, when PU learning meets limited labeled HSI, the un-labeled data may dominate the optimization process, which makes the neural networks overfit the unlabeled data. In this paper, a Taylor variational loss is proposed for HSIPU learning, which reduces the weight of the gradient of the unlabeled data by Taylor series expansion to enable the network to find a balance between overfitting and underfit-ting. In addition, the self-calibrated optimization strategy is designed to stabilize the training process. Experiments on 7 benchmark datasets (21 tasks in total) validate the ef-fectiveness of the proposed method. Code is at: https://github.com/Hengwei-Zhao96/T-HOneCls.
