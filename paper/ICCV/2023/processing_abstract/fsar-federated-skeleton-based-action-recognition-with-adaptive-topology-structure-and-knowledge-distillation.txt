Existing skeleton-based action recognition methods typ-ically follow a centralized learning paradigm, which can pose privacy concerns when exposing human-relatedFederated Learning (FL) has attracted much videos. attention due to its outstanding advantages in privacy-preserving. However, directly applying FL approaches to skeleton videos suffers from unstable training. In this pa-per, we investigate and discover that the heterogeneous hu-man topology graph structure is the crucial factor hinder-ing training stability. To address this limitation, we pio-neer a novel Federated Skeleton-based Action Recognition (FSAR) paradigm, which enables the construction of a globally generalized model without accessing local sensi-tive data. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Topol-ogy Structure (ATS), separating generalization and person-alization by learning a domain-invariant topology shared across clients and a domain-specific topology decoupled from global model aggregation. Furthermore, we exploreMulti-grain Knowledge Distillation (MKD) to mitigate the discrepancy between clients and server caused by distinct updating patterns through aligning shallow block-wise mo-tion features. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that FSAR outperforms state-of-the-art FL-based methods while inherently protecting privacy.
