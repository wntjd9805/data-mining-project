Multi-label image classification refers to assigning a set of labels for an image. One of the main challenges of this task is how to effectively capture the correlation among la-bels. Existing studies on this issue mostly rely on the sta-tistical label co-occurrence or semantic similarity of la-bels. However, an important fact is ignored that the co-occurrence of labels is closely related with image scenes (indoor, outdoor, etc.), which is a vital characteristic in multi-label image classification.In this paper, a novel scene-aware label graph learning framework is proposed, which is capable of learning visual representations for la-bels while fully perceiving their co-occurrence relationships under variable scenes. Specifically, our framework is able to detect scene categories of images without relying on manual annotations, and keeps track of the co-occurring labels by maintaining a global co-occurrence matrix for each scene category throughout the whole training phase.These scene-independent co-occurrence matrices are fur-ther employed to guide the interactions among label repre-sentations in a graph propagation manner towards accurate label prediction. Extensive experiments on public bench-marks demonstrate the superiority of our framework.
