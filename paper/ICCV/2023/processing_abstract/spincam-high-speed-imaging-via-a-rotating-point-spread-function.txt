TimeTimeTimeHigh-speed cameras are an indispensable tool used for the slow-motion analysis of scenes. However, the fixed bandwidth of any imaging system quickly becomes a bot-tleneck, resulting in a fundamental trade-off between the camera’s spatial and temporal resolutions. In recent years, compressive high-speed imaging systems have been pro-posed to circumvent these issues by optically encoding the signal and using a reconstruction procedure to recover a video. Our work proposes a novel approach for com-pressive high-speed imaging based on temporally coding the camera’s point-spread function (PSF). By mechanically spinning a diffraction grating in front of a camera, the sen-sor integrates an image blurred by a PSF that continuously rotates over time. We also propose a deconvolution-based reconstruction algorithm to reconstruct videos from these measurements. Our method achieves superior light effi-ciency and handles a wider scene class than prior meth-ods. Also, our mechanical design yields flexible temporal resolution that can be easily increased, potentially allow-ing capture at 192 kHz—far higher than prior works. We demonstrate a prototype for various applications, including motion capture and particle image velocimetry (PIV).
