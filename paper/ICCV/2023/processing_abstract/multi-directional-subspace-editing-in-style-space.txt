our model with respect to those measures1.This paper describes a new technique for finding disen-tangled semantic directions in the latent space of StyleGAN.Our method identifies meaningful orthogonal subspaces that allow editing of one human face attribute, while min-imizing undesired changes in other attributes. Our model is capable of editing a single attribute in multiple direc-tions, resulting in a range of possible generated images. We compare our scheme with three state-of-the-art models and show that our method outperforms them in terms of face editing and disentanglement capabilities. Additionally, we suggest quantitative measures for evaluating attribute sep-aration and disentanglement, and exhibit the superiority of
