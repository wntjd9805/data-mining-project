Recently, GAN has successfully contributed to mak-ing single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods produce more realistic images. However, natural images have com-plex distribution in the real world, and a single classi-fier in the discriminator may not have enough capacity to classify real and fake samples, making the precedingSR network generate unpleasing noise and artifacts. To solve the problem, we propose a novel content-aware lo-cal GAN framework, CAL-GAN, which processes a large and complicated distribution of real-world images by di-viding them into smaller subsets based on similar contents.Our mixture of classifiers (MoC) design allocates differ-ent super-resolved patches to corresponding expert clas-sifiers. Additionally, we introduce novel routing and or-thogonality loss terms so that different classifiers can han-dle various contents and learn separable features. By feeding similar distributions into the corresponding spe-cialized classifiers, CAL-GAN enhances the representa-tion power of existing super-resolution models, achiev-ing state-of-the-art perceptual performance on standard benchmarks and real-world images without modifying the generator-side architecture.
