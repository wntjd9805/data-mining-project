Facial expression recognition (FER) remains a challeng-ing task due to the ambiguity of expressions. The derived noisy labels significantly harm the performance in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we present a newFER model named Landmark-Aware Net (LA-Net), which leverages facial landmarks to mitigate the impact of label noise from two perspectives. Firstly, LA-Net uses land-mark information to suppress the uncertainty in expression space and constructs the label distribution of each sam-ple by neighborhood aggregation, which in turn improves the quality of training supervision. Secondly, the model in-corporates landmark information into expression represen-tations using the devised expression-landmark contrastive loss. The enhanced expression feature extractor can be less susceptible to label noise. Our method can be integrated with any deep neural network for better training supervi-sion without introducing extra inference costs. We conduct extensive experiments on both in-the-wild datasets and syn-thetic noisy datasets and demonstrate that LA-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance.
