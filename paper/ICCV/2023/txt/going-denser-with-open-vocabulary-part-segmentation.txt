Introduction
Object detection has been expanded from a limited num-ber of categories to open vocabulary. Moving forward, a complete intelligent vision system requires understanding more fine-grained object descriptions, object parts. In this paper, we propose a detector with the ability to predict both open-vocabulary objects and their part segmentation. This ability comes from two designs. First, we train the detector on the joint of part-level, object-level and image-level data to build the multi-granularity alignment between language and image. Second, we parse the novel object into its parts by its dense semantic correspondence with the base object.
These two designs enable the detector to largely benefit from various data sources and foundation models. In open-vocabulary part segmentation experiments, our method out-performs the baseline by 3.3∼7.3 mAP in cross-dataset gen-eralization on PartImageNet, and improves the baseline by 7.3 novel AP50 in cross-category generalization on Pascal
Part. Finally, we train a detector that generalizes to a wide range of part segmentation datasets while achieving better performance than dataset-specific training.
Recent advances in open-vocabulary object detec-tion [37,42,47,58,78,85,92,95] have made surprising devel-opment in enlarging the number of object categories from a pre-determined set by training datasets [17,26,49,71] to any object in the open world. This is a crucial step for the vision system to make effect in the real world. Towards the next step, for a deeper understanding to object structure, mobil-ity, functionality, and practical applications such as behav-ior analysis [61,68,82], robotics manipulation [5,19,60,88], image-editing [45, 70], only object-level perception is not sufficient, while the fine-grained recognition ability of part segmentation [9, 29, 67, 83] is necessary.
Since a part is the fine-grained version of an object, an intuitive idea is to directly apply existing open-vocabulary object detection methods [42, 47, 92, 95] to solve the part detection/segmentation task. However, as shown in Table 1, they do not show good generalization on part-level recog-nition. Although conceptually similar to open-vocabulary object detection, localizing and classifying the fine-grained object parts are essentially more challenging. This moti-Method

All models use their official codebases and model weights. Oracle is the method trained on Pascal Part training set. vates us to explore new designs to empower current object detectors with open-vocabulary part segmentation ability.
The model of open-vocabulary part segmentation is sup-posed to be able to segment the object not only on open cat-egory but also on open granularity. As shown in Figure 1, the [dog] can be parsed to the [head, torso, leg, tail], while in the finer granularity, the head of a dog can be further parsed to the [ear, eye, nose, etc.]. Anno-tating such fine-grained object part is extremely expensive.
Publicly available datasets of part segmentation are less rich and diverse than those of image classification and object de-tection datasets. Even though we collect three sources of part segmentation datasets, including Pascal Part [9], Par-tImageNet [29], and PACO [67], only a small number of objects part are accessible.
To expand the vocabulary of part categories, we first seek to utilize the large vocabulary object-level and image-level data, such as LVIS [26] and ImageNet [13], where object categories are known, but their part locations or part names are not. To enable part segmentation task benefit from them, our detector is based on the vision-language model [66], and trained on the joint of part-level, object-level and image-level data, where the classifier weight in the detector is re-In this placed to the text embedding of the class name. way, the model learns to align vision and language at multi-granularity level to help generalize the ability to parse the object into its parts from base objects to novel objects.
Though the multi-granularity alignment is established, the part-level alignment for novel objects is fragile since its supervision signal is absent. To further strengthen it, we propose to leverage the pre-trained foundation models [7] to parse the novel object into its parts as the annotations: 1) We find the nearest base object for each novel object by the similarity of their global features. 2) We build the dense semantic correspondence between the novel object and its corresponding base object by the similarity of their spatial features. 3) We parse the novel object into its parts in the way of the base object by the correspondence. The name of novel parts follows its corresponding base object. Accord-ing to this pipeline, we generate the parsed images and use them as part annotations of novel objects.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can significantly improve the open-vocabulary part segmen-tation performance. For cross-dataset generalization on
PartImageNet, our method outperforms the baseline by 3.3∼7.3 mAP. For cross-category generalization within
Pascal Part, our approach improves the baseline by 7.3 AP50 on novel parts. Finally, we train a detector with the joint data of LVIS, ImageNet, PACO, Pascal Part, PartImageNet, and parsed ImageNet. On three trained part segmentation datasets, it obtains better performance than their dataset-specific training. Meanwhile, part segmentation on a large range of objects in the open-world is achieved , as shown in
Figure 1.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
• We set up benchmarks and baseline models for open-vocabulary part segmentation in Pascal Part and PartIma-geNet datasets.
• We propose a parsing pipeline to enable part segmenta-tion to benefit from various data sources and expand the vocabulary of part categories.
• We train a detector with the ability of open-vocabulary object detection and part segmentation, achieving favor-able performance on a wide range of part segmentation datasets. 2.
