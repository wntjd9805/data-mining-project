Abstract
Semi-Supervised Temporal Action Localization (SS-TAL) aims to improve the generalization ability of action detec-tors with large-scale unlabeled videos. Albeit the recent advancement, one of the major challenges still remains: noisy pseudo labels hinder efficient learning on abundant unlabeled videos, embodied as location biases and category errors. In this paper, we dive deep into such an important but understudied dilemma. To this end, we propose a uni-fied framework, termed Noisy Pseudo-Label Learning, to handle both location biases and category errors. Specifi-cally, our method is featured with (1) Noisy Label Ranking to rank pseudo labels based on the semantic confidence and boundary reliability, (2) Noisy Label Filtering to address the class-imbalance problem of pseudo labels caused by category errors, (3) Noisy Label Learning to penalize in-consistent boundary predictions to achieve noise-tolerant learning for heavy location biases. As a result, our method could effectively handle the label noise problem and improve the utilization of a large amount of unlabeled videos. Ex-tensive experiments on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3 demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at github.com/kunnxia/NPL. 1.

Introduction
Temporal Action Localization (TAL) aims at detecting action instances of interest in an untrimmed video by locat-ing their temporal boundaries and recognizing their action categories. Most existing TAL methods rely on dense tem-poral annotations for the training videos. However, labeling human actions is very tedious and time-consuming. As a remedy, Semi-Supervised TAL (SS-TAL) requires only a few

The fewer labeled videos are available, the heavier the noise of the pseudo labels will be. labeled videos in conjunction with a large amount of unla-beled videos. It has attracted growing attention in academia and industry.
Existing SS-TAL methods [12, 37, 28] are based on con-sistency regularization or self-training. Consistency-based methods [12, 37] aim to generate consistent action pro-posals for the same video subject to different augmenta-tions, e.g., time warping [12] and temporal feature shift [37].
In contrast, the self-training-based method [28] achieves new state-of-the-art performance by alternating between pseudo-labeling and re-training. It focuses on designing a proposal-free framework to address proposal error propaga-tion from [12, 37] but neglects the important role of pseudo labels. Albeit its advancement, label noise still remains a core challenge, hindering efficient learning on abundant un-labeled videos. From Figure 1, we can observe that label noise commonly leads to two intractable issues, i.e., location bias and category error, which become worse as the amount of labeled videos decreases. As a result, noisy pseudo labels will significantly degrade the performance of SS-TAL.
In this paper, we propose a Noisy Pseudo-Label Learning (NPL) framework tailored for SS-TAL to combat detrimen-tal label noise. It follows the self-training paradigm that alternates between pseudo-labeling and model training. But unlike all previous self-training methods, our NPL includes three novel components, termed Noisy Label Ranking, Noisy
Label Filtering, and Noisy Label Learning, respectively, which alleviate the negative effects caused by location biases and category errors in a unified framework.
First, Noisy Label Ranking aims to rank and select high-quality pseudo labels based on both semantic confidence and boundary reliability. Classification scores have been widely used in self-training to measure the quality of pseudo labels, but they only reflect semantic confidence and fail to account for localization reliability. To close this gap, we explicitly model the localization reliability of a detected action in-stance in an unlabeled video as the variance of the boundary predictions from dense snippets within the action. We then introduce a new integrated metric of semantic confidence and boundary reliability to rank the pseudo labels.
Second, Noisy Label Filtering aims at addressing the class-imbalance problem in noisy pseudo labels. Owing to the category error, the class-imbalance problem occurs re-gardless of whether pseudo labels are sampled based on a confidence threshold or the number of samples. The model will be dominated by redundant noisy pseudo labels in train-ing, especially for the ones of category errors, and further harm its generalization ability. To address this issue, we in-troduce an adaptive filtering strategy to regularize the distri-bution of pseudo labels and adaptively assign class-balanced pseudo labels to unlabeled videos.
Last, Noisy Label Learning aims to improve the robust-ness of training to location bias. While noisy label ranking and filtering can improve the quality of sampled pseudo labels, location bias will not be removed completely. Train-ing on biased boundary labels hinders the convergence of the model and further impedes accurate action localiza-tion. To this end, we propose a noise-tolerant training algo-rithm based on an unsupervised temporal consistency loss, which penalizes inconsistent predictions from adjacent ac-tion frames.
The main contributions are summarized as follows:
• This paper introduces a Noisy Pseudo-Label Learn-ing (NPL) framework tailored for SS-TAL, which han-dles both the location bias and category error in a uni-fied framework. Extensive experiments conducted on
THUMOS14 [13] and ActivityNet v1.3 [2] demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
• We propose a Noisy Label Ranking method to rank and select high-quality pseudo labels based on a new integrated metric of semantic confidence and boundary reliability.
• We propose a Noisy Label Filtering method to tackle the largely ignored class-imbalance problem in pseudo labels based on a new adaptive filtering strategy.
• We introduce a Noisy Label Learning method, which adopts an unsupervised temporal consistency loss to penalize inconsistent predictions from adjacent frames for noise-tolerant learning. 2.
