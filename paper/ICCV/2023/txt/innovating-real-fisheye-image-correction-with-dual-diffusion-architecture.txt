Abstract
Fisheye image rectiﬁcation is hindered by synthetic mod-els producing poor results for real-world correction. To ad-dress this, we propose a Dual Diffusion Architecture (DDA) for ﬁsheye rectiﬁcation that offers better practicality. The
DDA leverages Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model-s (DDPMs) to gradually introduce bidirectional noise, al-lowing the synthesized and real images to develop into a consistent noise distribution. As a result, our network can perceive the distribution of unlabelled real ﬁsheye images without relying on a transfer network, thus improving the performance of real ﬁsheye correction. Additionally, we design an unsupervised one-pass network that generates a plausible new condition to strengthen guidance and address the non-negligible indeterminacy between the prior condi-tion and the target. It can signiﬁcantly affect the rectiﬁca-tion task, especially in cases where radial distortion causes signiﬁcant artifacts. This network can be regarded as an alternate scheme for fast producing reliable results without iterative inference. Compared to the state-of-the-art meth-ods, our approach achieves superior performance in both synthetic and real ﬁsheye image corrections. 1.

Introduction
Many applications [1][2][3] have signiﬁcant demands for large ﬁeld-of-view environment information. Therefore, the ﬁsheye camera is naturally taken into account. Howev-er, the images captured by ﬁsheye cameras have structure distortion, which can signiﬁcantly impact the performance of subsequent vision algorithms [4][5][6]. To retain the per-formance of downstream tasks, one can consider correct-ing distorted images or redesigning subsequent algorithms.
Many individuals prefer the simple former.
Most existing methods determined distortion parameter-s by identifying relevant features. Non-automatic calibra-tion methods [7][8][9][10] detect corners artiﬁcially using

Figure 1. Most CNNs and GANs need labels for training. Without corresponding labels, DDPMs can perceive the real ﬁsheye distri-bution during the training process by only supervising the noise. a checkerboard, while automatic methods [11][12] use an algorithm that recognizes distinctive curves automatical-ly. However, faulty detecting characteristics signiﬁcantly impact these methods. As a result, neural networks are utilized to extract features based on their stable proper-ties. [13][14][15][16] use deep regression models to predict distortion parameters.
[17][18][19] consider it simpler to transform the correction into an image-to-image generation solution. By learning the empirical distributions, they can obtain the corrected results directly. Despite deep learning methods achieving signiﬁcant advances in distortion correc-tion, their training heavily depends on synthetic datasets. It leads to poor performance on real-world ﬁsheye correction.
One potential reason for poor results is due to the lack of labels, the real ﬁsheye images cannot be used in train-ing. Most convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gen-erative adversarial networks (GANs) require paired images for training, as illustrated in Figure 1. However, denois-ing diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can be trained by supervising noise, which enables them to perceive the distribution of real ﬁsheye images during training without requiring corresponding labels. Therefore, we utilize D-DPMs [20][21] to explore real-world distortion correction and design a dual diffusion architecture (DDA) to handle the two available datasets. One part of our dual diffusion
architecture is a conditional diffusion module, which learns the fundamental distribution of distortion from paired syn-thetic datasets in a supervised manner. The other part is an unconditional diffusion module, which leverages an unsu-pervised manner to perceive unlabeled real ﬁsheye images during training. By gradually introducing noise in DDA, both synthetic and real ﬁsheye images can gradually devel-op into a consistent noise distribution, as demonstrated in
Figure 2. We can simultaneously train two modules by su-pervising the consistent noise. This approach eliminates the need for a speciﬁc network, like CycleGAN [22], to trans-form unlabeled real ﬁsheye images explicitly for supervi-sion. Our implicit transformation achieves good alignment for different datasets, allowing the knowledge learned from paired synthetic images to be utilized to enhance the per-ception of real ﬁsheye images. As a result, the correction performance of real ﬁsheye gains improvement. Due to the alignment in noise space, the trained model can be directly used for real ﬁsheye correction.
As ﬁsheye correction differs from other generation tasks, structural distortion causes notable disparities between the prior condition and target, which severely affects the gener-ation quality of DDPMs. Therefore, we design a one-pass network embedded in the conditional diffusion module. It reduces the disparities by pre-correcting ﬁsheye images, as illustrated in Figure 3. The corrected image can be used as a more plausible condition for DDPMs. Beneﬁting from the
DDA, our embedded one-pass network learns in an unsu-pervised manner. After training, the one-pass network can be independently employed to rectify ﬁsheye images with-out time-consuming inference.
Our contributions are summarized as follows:
• We propose a novel dual diffusion architecture that can simultaneously learn both synthetic and real image dis-tributions through noise-space equivalence, thus im-proving the performance of real ﬁsheye correction.
• To reduce the disparities between the prior condition and target, we design an unsupervised one-pass net-work to generate a plausible new condition. It can be used as an additional efﬁcient correction approach.
• Distinguishing from previous methods, our approach pioneers to leverage unlabeled real ﬁsheye images for training, achieving satisfactory results in both synthet-ic and real ﬁsheye correction. 2.
