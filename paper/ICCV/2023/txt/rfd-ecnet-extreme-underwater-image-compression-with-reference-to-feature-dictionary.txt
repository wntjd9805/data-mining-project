Abstract
Thriving underwater applications demand efficient ex-treme compression technology to realize the transmission of underwater images (UWIs) in very narrow underwater bandwidth. However, existing image compression meth-ods achieve inferior performance on UWIs because they do not consider the characteristics of UWIs: (1) Multifari-ous underwater styles of color shift and distance-dependent clarity, caused by the unique underwater physical imaging; (2) Massive redundancy between different UWIs, caused by the fact that different UWIs contain several common ocean objects, which have plenty of similarities in struc-tures and semantics. To remove redundancy among UWIs, we first construct an exhaustive underwater multi-scale fea-ture dictionary to provide coarse-to-fine reference features for UWI compression. Subsequently, an extreme UWI com-pression network with reference to the feature dictionary (RFD-ECNet)1 is creatively proposed, which utilizes feature match and reference feature variant to significantly remove redundancy among UWIs. To align the multifarious un-derwater styles and improve the accuracy of feature match, an underwater style normalized block (USNB) is proposed, which utilizes underwater physical priors extracted from the underwater physical imaging model to normalize the underwater styles of dictionary features toward the input.
Moreover, a reference feature variant module (RFVM) is de-signed to adaptively morph the reference features, improv-ing the similarity between the reference and input features.
Experimental results on four UWI datasets show that our
RFD-ECNet is the first work that achieves a significant BD-rate saving of 31% over the most advanced VVC. 1.

For example, mine search, nuclear-reactors detection, and underwater power inspection [1] are parts of homeland security operations. In addition, marine biology [2] and archaeology [3] are im-portant scientific research for ocean resource development.
Moreover, underwater entertainment [4] such as underwater live broadcasts is becoming greatly popular with the public.
In these underwater applications, images taken underwa-ter play an essential role. To be transmitted from the deep sea to the board or ground, underwater images (UWIs) must be compressed at extremely low bitrates due to the very narrow underwater wireless acoustic bandwidth of about 20 kbps [5]. However, existing image compression approaches severely degrade the pixel fidelity (e.g., MSE) of UWIs at extremely low bitrates (<0.1bpp), which greatly impairs the
broad application of UWIs. Hence, it is highly urgent to de-sign a more powerful extreme UWI compression algorithm.
Different from general images, UWIs present two unique underwater characteristics: (1) UWIs present multifarious underwater styles of color shift and distance-dependent clarity. This is because the underwater imaging process is quite different from that in the open air [6]. When light travels through water, it suffers from absorption and scatter-ing. Specifically, the blueish/greenish color shift is caused by the fact that the red light of the shortest wavelength is absorbed first, and then the green and blue light are fol-lowed [7]. In addition, light is scattered by the particles in water, which change the direction of light propagation [8], resulting in the spatially varying distance dependencies of clarity, i.e., the image clarity decreases as the distance to the objects increases. (2) Different UWIs contain some com-mon underwater objects at diverse morphologies and sizes. Due to the special underwater natural environment, there are some common underwater objects such as fish, corals, and rocks that widely exist in different UWIs in di-verse morphologies and sizes. Hence, there are plenty of similar representations between UWIs. As shown in Fig. 1 (b), although the UWIs are captured at different times and in various underwater scenes, they contain some same under-water objects such as water, corals, and rocks, which share plenty of similarities in textures, structures, and semantics.
Given the characteristics of UWIs, there are two main drawbacks for existing image compression methods [9–21]: (1) They only remove redundancy within an image and do not consider redundancy between UWIs. Conven-tional image compression codecs such as JPEG2000 [9],
BPG [10] and the latest VVC-intra [11] reduce the intra-redundancy through transform and intra-prediction. Re-cently, learnt image compression methods [12–18] have shown greater potential than conventional codecs. Based on variational autoencoder (VAE), [12] designs a hyper-prior model to remove the statistic redundancy within an image. After that, [13] proposes an autoregressive model to further remove the local context redundancy. However, all of them are limited to removing redundancy in only an im-age. (2) They utilize a unitary compression that cannot handle the multifarious underwater styles of color shift and distance-dependent clarity. It is reasonable to use the unitary compression for the general terrestrial images be-cause the colors (r, g, b) of terrestrial images are evenly dis-tributed [22] and the internal clarity is steady broadly. How-ever, it limits their performance on UWIs because the UWIs are full of multifarious color shift and distance-dependent clarity. To design an efficient extreme UWI compression method, it needs to both remove redundancy between UWIs and align the multifarious underwater styles.
Accordingly, we creatively propose to compress UWIs by referencing a dictionary to remove redundancy between
UWIs. First, we construct an exhaustive underwater multi-scale feature dictionary to provide from coarse to fine ref-erence information for the UWI compression. Specifically, the features in the dictionary are extracted from plenty of representative UWIs, which are strictly selected according to various underwater scenes, including different underwa-ter objects, water types, and water depths. As such, our dictionary could cover a wide range of underwater com-mon objects, assisting the UWI compression to fully re-move redundancy between UWIs. Subsequently, we design a novel extreme UWI compression network with reference to the underwater feature dictionary (RFD-ECNet), shown in Fig 2, where the features of input UWI are matched with the dictionary to select the reference features, and then the residuals between the input and reference features are com-pressed, significantly reducing the coding bits of UWIs.
Additionally, an underwater styles normalization block-based feature match (USN-FMM) is proposed to ensure that the match is not interfered by the multifarious under-water styles and focuses on selecting the references that have the most similar texture to the input. To be specific, the USNB utilizes the underwater physical priors (UPPs) extracted from the underwater imaging physical model [6] to normalize the underwater style of reference features to-wards that of the input. Moreover, to improve the similarity between the reference and input features, a reference feature variant module (RFVM) is designed to adaptively morph the reference features based on their dependency relevance to the input feature. Extensive experimental results show that our RFD-ECNet outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) compression methods. Overall, our main contributions are summarized as follows:
• We make the first attempt to remove the massive redun-dancy between UWIs, and the proposed dictionary-based compression network RFD-ECNet is the first work that achieves significantly better BD-rate/PSNR than the latest VVC and other learnt methods.
• We construct an exhaustive underwater feature dic-tionary from representative UWIs manually selected based on various underwater scenes, water types, and water depths. Besides, detailed analyses are conducted to verify the comprehensiveness and compactness of the dictionary.
• To eliminate the effect of underwater styles on feature match, we utilize the underwater physical priors to de-sign USNB to improve feature match accuracy. More-over, we design RFVM to adaptively morph the refer-ence features based on the dependency map, improv-ing their similarity. 2.
