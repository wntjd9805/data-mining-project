The wide-angle lens shows appealing applications in VR technologies, but it introduces severe radial distortion into its captured image. To recover the realistic scene, pre-vious works devote to rectifying the content of the wide-angle image. However, such a rectiﬁcation solution in-evitably distorts the image boundary, which changes re-lated geometric distributions and misleads the current vi-sion perception models. In this work, we explore construct-ing a win-win representation on both content and bound-ary by contributing a new learning model, i.e., Rectangling
Rectiﬁcation Network (RecRecNet). In particular, we pro-pose a thin-plate spline (TPS) module to formulate the non-linear and non-rigid transformation for rectangling images.
By learning the control points on the rectiﬁed image, our model can ﬂexibly warp the source structure to the target domain and achieves an end-to-end unsupervised deforma-tion. To relieve the complexity of structure approximation, we then inspire our RecRecNet to learn the gradual defor-mation rules with a DoF (Degree of Freedom)-based cur-riculum learning. By increasing the DoF in each curricu-lum stage, namely, from similarity transformation (4-DoF) to homography transformation (8-DoF), the network is ca-pable of investigating more detailed deformations, offer-ing fast convergence on the ﬁnal rectangling task. Exper-iments show the superiority of our solution over the com-pared methods on both quantitative and qualitative eval-uations. The code and dataset are available at https:

Introduction
The wide-angle lens has been widely applied in various applications such as computational imaging, virtual reality (VR), and autonomous driving, due to their larger ﬁeld of view (FoV) than conventional lenses [19, 12, 44, 27]. By (cid:87) (cid:72) (cid:49) (cid:70) (cid:72) (cid:53) (cid:70) (cid:72) (cid:53) (cid:44)(cid:81)(cid:73)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:70)(cid:72) (cid:57)(cid:76)(cid:86)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:51)(cid:72)(cid:85)(cid:70)(cid:72)(cid:83)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3) (cid:48)(cid:82)(cid:71)(cid:72)(cid:79) (cid:39)(cid:72)(cid:87)(cid:72)(cid:70)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3)(cid:68)(cid:81)(cid:71)(cid:3)(cid:54)(cid:72)(cid:74)(cid:80)(cid:72)(cid:81)(cid:87)(cid:68)(cid:87)(cid:76)(cid:82)(cid:81)(cid:3) (cid:53)(cid:72)(cid:86)(cid:88)(cid:79)(cid:87)(cid:86)
Figure 1. Existing rectiﬁcation methods devote to correcting the content of the wide-angle image, but they inevitably distort the im-age boundary. Such a deformed boundary can lead to dramatic per-formance degradation of the popular vision perception model [16].
By presenting RecRecNet, we can reach a win-win representation on both the undistorted content and regular boundary. The arrow marks our perception gain (e.g., the surfboard is rediscovered). employing a speciﬁc mapping, the wide-angle lens can pro-duce convex and non-rectilinear images rather than images with straight lines of perspective. However, this mapping mechanism violates the pinhole camera assumption, and the captured image suffers from severe radial distortions.
To eliminate the distortion induced by the wide-angle lens, the distortion rectiﬁcation algorithm is presented. For example, the traditional approaches calibrate the wide-angle lens using the calibration target (e.g., a checker-In board) [48, 19] and speciﬁc scene assumption [9, 2]. recent years, deep learning has brought new inspirations to this ﬁeld.
It helps to automatically rectify the radial distortion in wide-angle images based on learned seman-tic features. To pursue better performance, the recent works improve the learning framework through diverse fea-tures [46, 43], learning paradigm [26], calibration represen-tation [23, 29], and distortion prior [7, 25], etc.

We notice that the above distortion rectiﬁcation ap-proaches mainly focus on rectifying the image content. By shrinking the distorted image towards the principal center, the spatial distribution of all pixels has been rearranged and thus generates the rectiﬁed result. However, the image boundaries are inevitably distorted by this correction way, making the image exhibited with a visually narrow FoV and irregular shape. Moreover, we found such a deformed boundary can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the current mainstream vision perception models because most of them are trained on the dataset with rectangular images. As shown in Fig-ure 1, Mask R-CNN [16] is confused by the rectiﬁed im-age, leading to a missing segmentation and detection result near the boundary (the surfboard is neglected ). While some works [24] ﬁll the blank region beyond deformed bound-aries using outpainting strategy [35, 40], the generated con-tents are usually ﬁctitious and twist the original semantic characterization.
In this work, we explore a win-win rectiﬁcation rep-resentation for the wide-angle image on both content and boundary without introducing any extra semantic informa-tion [15, 32]. For this new representation, the distorted con-tent has been corrected while the image boundary keeps straight, as shown in Figure 1. To this end, we propose a Rectangling Rectiﬁcation Network (named RecRecNet).
Concretely, a thin-plate spline (TPS) motion module is pro-posed to formulate the non-linear and non-rigid transforma-tion for rectangling the rectiﬁed wide-angle image. It can
ﬂexibly warp the source structure to the target domain by learning the control points on the rectiﬁed image. The con-trol points are located at the whole distribution of an image, while Figure 1 only shows a part of the points for intuitive clariﬁcation.
Subsequently, we design a DoF-based curriculum learn-ing to further inspire our RecRecNet to grasp the progres-sive deformation rules, relieving the burden of complex structure approximation and initializing a better start point for training. The general paradigm of curriculum learn-ing [3] introduces a heuristic and purposeful strategy for training a learning model. The model can converge faster by gradually learning various samples or knowledge based on different stages in a curriculum, mimicking how humans and animals learn. In this regard, we increase the degree of freedom (DoF) of the devised stages/transformations from similarity transformation (4-DoF) to homography transfor-mation (8-DoF). Moreover, the procedure of our curriculum reveals a simple-to-complex order from the straight line, sloped line to curve for the image boundary. As a conse-quence, our RecRecNet can discover more geometric de-tails and converge faster on the ﬁnal rectangling stage.
While aiming for a win-win rectiﬁcation representation, we also provide an in-depth analysis of why the deformed boundary makes the perception deformed, i.e., why the de-formed image boundary can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the vi-sual perception models. We surprisingly found that the de-formed boundary can introduce new features on the original feature maps, which further forms new semantics or cause blind spots for non-salient features. And we demonstrate that this effect commonly exists in other research regions.
We conclude our major contributions as follows:
• We propose a Rectangling Rectiﬁcation Network (RecRecNet) for a win-win representation of the recti-ﬁed wide-angle image. To our knowledge, it has never been investigated in previous literature.
• A thin-plate spline (TPS) motion module is proposed to ﬂexibly formulate the non-linear and non-rigid rect-angling transformation. We also provide an in-depth analysis of why the deformed image boundary can sig-niﬁcantly inﬂuence the visual perception models.
• To grasp the progressive deformation rules and re-lieve the burden of complex structure approximation, a
DoF-based curriculum learning is designed to inspire our RecRecNet. 2.
