Abstract
Computer vision-based walking assistants are prominen-t tools for aiding visually impaired people in navigation.
Blind road segmentation is a key element in these walking assistant systems. However, most walking assistant systems rely on visual light images, which is dangerous in weak illu-mination environments such as darkness or fog. To address this issue and enhance the safety of vision-based walking assistant systems, we developed a thermal infrared blind road segmentation neural network (TINN). In contrast to conventional segmentation techniques that primarily con-centrate on enhancing feature extraction and perception, our approach is geared towards preserving the inherent radiation characteristics within the thermal imaging pro-cess.
Initially, we modelled two critical factors in ther-mal infrared imaging - thermal light atmospheric trans-mission and thermal inertia effect. Subsequently, we use an encoder-decoder architecture to fuse the feathers ex-tracted by the two modules. Additionally, to train the net-work and evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we constructed a large-scale thermal infrared blind road segmentation dataset named TBRSD consists 5180 pixel-level manual annotations. The experimental results demon-strate that our method outperforms existing techniques and achieves state-of-the-art performance in thermal blind road segmentation, as validated on benchmark thermal infrared semantic segmentation datasets such as MFNet and SO-DA. The dataset and our code are both publicly available in https://github.com/chenjzBUAA/TBRSD or http://xzbai.buaa.edu.cn/datasets.html. 1.

Figure 1. Thermal infrared imaging is inﬂuenced by two key fac-tors: atmospheric transmission and thermal inertia effect. All ob-jects with a temperature above absolute zero emit thermal infrared radiation, and the intensity of this radiation that is detected by the camera is affected by atmospheric transmission. Once the inci-dent radiation reaches the thermal microbolometer, the resulting intensity measurement is also affected by the thermal inertia ef-fect. Thus, we modeled the two effects and incorporated these models into our blind road segmentation method, which allows us to more accurately identify and segment thermal images of blind roads, even in challenging environmental conditions. had moderate to severe vision impairment. Between 1990 and 2020, the global number of people who were blind in-creased by 50.6%, while the number of individuals with moderate to severe vision impairment rose by 91.7%. Pro-jections indicate that by 2050, the number of blind individ-uals will increase to 51 million, and the number of people with moderate to severe vision impairment will rise to 474 million [3]. Individuals with visual impairments often ex-perience difﬁculty with navigation when engaging in social
activities and interactions due to the complex outdoor en-vironment. To help tackle this problem, a variety of sup-portive tools and assistants have been developed to promote outdoor navigation and enhance the use of technology for those with visual impairments [11].
Since the 1960s, walking assistants have been introduced to help people with mobility issues with tasks such as nav-igation and location. These assistants help individuals with visual impairments detect and locate obstacles around them through the use of sensors that perceive the surrounding en-vironment [4, 17, 39].
Visual assistance technology has spurred the develop-ment of various walking assistants to help mitigate the mo-bility obstacles of visually impaired individuals [14]. Vari-ous methods have been proposed to assist visually impaired individuals to walk on blind roads, such as visual guiding using image segmentation [1, 13, 12, 29, 26, 5, 19, 37].
Semantic segmentation methods can be utilized to seg-ment blind road. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great performance improvements in semantic segmentation [2, 6, 18, 28, 38]. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have recently emerged as a competitive alternative. ViT-s offer strong expressivity and long-distance information interaction with dynamic feature aggregation through self-attention operations [40, 34, 8, 7, 16]. Furthermore, datasets containing visual images with sidewalks have been intro-duced to offer assistance to individuals with visual impair-ments, exempliﬁed by projects like SideGuide and Mapil-lary Vistas [24, 22].
However, most semantic segmentation methods rely on visual images, which can be inadequate in weak illumina-tion environments like darkness or fog. Therefore, thermal infrared semantic segmentation has been proposed as a so-lution to this problem [15, 31, 21, 23, 35].
In spite of the extensive utilization of thermal infrared images across various applications, the inﬂuence stemming from the thermal imaging characteristics of objects and backgrounds has frequently been disregarded by prevailing processing techniques. The prevalent practice of interpret-ing thermal infrared images solely as grayscale images fails to comprehensively capture the intricate thermal nuances.
While conventional segmentation methodologies pre-dominantly center around reﬁning feature extraction and perception, the precision of these techniques is frequently compromised due to the introduction of information disor-der through the thermal imaging process. To address this limitation, we identify two pivotal factors signiﬁcantly im-pacting thermal infrared imaging - atmospheric transmis-sion and the thermal inertia effect - and incorporate them into the thermal infrared image processing pipeline.
Our speciﬁc proposition involves a network that capital-izes on these effects to enhance the efﬁcacy of blind road segmentation in thermal infrared imaging. As a result, our method outperforms in the domain of thermal infrared blind road segmentation, rectifying the limitations previously en-countered.
To summary, our main contributions are as follows:
• We model the two critical factors in thermal infrared imaging - atmospheric transmission and thermal iner-tia effect - and incorporate them into the segmentation task for the ﬁrst time. we present a thermal blind road segmentation network that effectively leverages these effects.
• We construct the ﬁrst public large-scale thermal in-frared blind road segmentation dataset, which contains 5180 images. All images are with pixel-level annota-tions. The dataset is publicly available.
• Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both our own thermal infrared blind road segmentation dataset TBRSD and the benchmark thermal infrared semantic segmentation datasets MFNet [10] and SO-DA [15]. 2.
