Abstract
Glaucoma is the number one cause of irreversible blind-ness globally. A major challenge for accurate glaucoma detection and progression forecasting is the bottleneck of limited labeled patients with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D retinal imaging data of optical coherence tomogra-phy (OCT). To address the data scarcity issue, this pa-per proposes two solutions. First, we develop a novel generalization-reinforced semi-supervised learning (SSL) model called pseudo supervisor to optimally utilize unla-beled data. Compared with SOTA models, the proposed pseudo supervisor optimizes the policy of predicting pseudo labels with unlabeled samples to improve empirical gener-alization. Our pseudo supervisor model is evaluated with two clinical tasks consisting of glaucoma detection and pro-gression forecasting. The progression forecasting task is evaluated both unimodally and multimodally. Our pseudo supervisor model demonstrates superior performance than
SOTA SSL comparison models. Moreover, our model also achieves the best results on the publicly available LAG fun-dus dataset. Second, we introduce the Harvard Glaucoma
Detection and Progression (Harvard-GDP) Dataset, a mul-timodal multitask dataset that includes data from 1,000 pa-tients with OCT imaging data, as well as labels for glau-coma detection and progression. This is the largest glau-coma detection dataset with 3D OCT imaging data and the
ﬁrst glaucoma progression forecasting dataset that is pub-licly available. Detailed sex and racial analysis are pro-vided, which can be used by interested researchers for fair-ness learning studies. Our released dataset is benchmarked with several SOTA supervised CNN and transformer deep learning models. The dataset and code are made publicly available via https://ophai.hms.harvard.edu/ datasets/harvard-gdp1000. 1.

Introduction
Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blind-ness globally caused by retinal nerve ﬁber layer (RNFL)

The global prevalence of glau-coma for the population between 40 and 80 years old is 3.54% [74]. Timely clinical treatment in the early stage of glaucoma can signiﬁcantly reduce the risk of further vi-sion loss [18, 17]. However, most commonly, glaucoma patients are not aware of their early VF loss until the VF loss becomes severe enough to impair their daily activities such as reading and driving due to the brain and fellow eye compensation[4, 19, 34, 50, 51, 30].
It is desirable to develop automated glaucoma screen tools to reduce societal disease burden [77]. The clini-cal diagnosis of glaucoma is a holistic decision primarily based on RNFL damage and VF loss assessment supple-mented with other patient clinical information and family disease history [29, 47]. The VF test is only available in the ophthalmology specialty. So existing automated screening tools are based on the idea of predicting glaucoma diag-nosis from evaluating RNFL damage using retinal images
[14, 57, 42, 5, 49, 37, 15, 35, 60, 81]. Before the massive clinical adoption of the 3D retinal imaging tool of optical coherence tomography (OCT) a decade ago [31, 12], 2D fundus photos were used to assess RNFL damage. There-fore, most prior glaucoma detection models are based on the 2D fundus photo [37, 57, 33, 14, 42, 1, 64, 15], which is not the state of the art (SOTA) clinical imaging modal-ity anymore. OCT has replaced fundus photos as the pri-mary imaging tool for glaucoma clinical care due to its superiority in measuring RNFL damage [48, 12]. There have been a number of recent works using OCT scans to automatically screen glaucoma with machine learning
[15, 60, 5, 35, 24, 80, 49]. Apart from glaucoma detection, a more clinically signiﬁcant task is progression forecasting using OCT scans [52, 16, 32, 28], which could inform clini-cians if they should treat the patient conservatively with eye drops or aggressively with invasive surgeries.
For both the glaucoma screening and progression fore-casting tasks, a signiﬁcant challenge is limited labeled pa-tients with the SOTA OCT measurements as the fundus photo is already outdated in clinical practice [15, 60, 5, 35, 24, 80, 49]. This problem with the lack of labeled patients is even more severe for progression forecasting, which re-quires longitudinal VF measurements to determine progres-sion outcomes [52, 16, 32]. Therefore, there is a strong need for developing novel semi-supervised learning mod-els to maximally utilize unlabeled patient data in clinics to improve glaucoma detection and progression forecast-ing. However, apart from several papers using standard semi-supervised learning methods for glaucoma detection
[20, 2, 23, 79, 84, 9], there has been no dedicated algo-rithm development for semi-supervised learning with its application in glaucoma. SOTA semi-supervised learning (SSL) approaches in computer vision are generally based on consistency learning [11, 68, 10, 73] or pseudo-labeling
[40, 61]. Unlike consistency learning, the pseudo-labeling approaches do not need domain knowledge to design the image augmentation strategy. While many prior works have endeavored to optimally select pseudo-labeled sam-ples to improve the classiﬁer training, the tasks of glau-coma detection and progression forecasting still have some unique challenges that might not be well tackled by existing pseudo-labeling SSL methods [61, 63, 13, 40, 56]. Figure 1 shows examples of RNFLT maps with high similarities but from different label groups. With such obscured group differences, existing pseudo-labeling SSL methods might not be able to provide sufﬁcient guidance to select correct pseudo-labeled samples to improve the classiﬁer training.
Furthermore, having high-quality public datasets with OCT scans for glaucoma detection and progression forecasting is equally important to enable more computer vision re-searchers to study this topic to push forward the ﬁeld,
In this study, we make two contributions: (1) devel-oping a generalization-reinforced semi-supervised learning model called pseudo supervisor to improve glaucoma detec-tion and progression forecasting. Speciﬁcally, our pseudo supervisor model will select pseudo-labeled samples via a policy net that optimizes generalization error with a vali-dation subset to update the classiﬁer. (2) releasing a pi-lot multitask and multimodal glaucoma dataset, called Har-vard Glaucoma Detection and Progression (Harvard-GDP)
Dataset, for computer vision researchers to study this topic.
In Table1, we have listed major public glaucoma datasets.
Most of them are fundus photo datasets, while there are two major OCT datasets previously published [24, 80]. In com-parison, our dataset has the largest patient numbers among all datasets with patient numbers available. In addition, our dataset is the ﬁrst and the only one with progression fore-casting task data, which is a way more clinically signiﬁcant

Web Download task than glaucoma detection itself. Compared with the other two OCT datasets, our dataset is superior in patient numbers (1,000 versus up to 300), task versatility (glau-coma detection and progression forecasting versus glau-coma detection only), and availableness of objective visual function tests (i.e. VF test). Furthermore, since our dataset is from the US population, the racial representation in our data is more diverse than the two OCT datasets [24, 80] and the large LAG dataset [38], which consists of mainly Asian patients. Therefore, our dataset can be potentially used for medical fairness learning studies, especially since we know
Black people have more than doubled glaucoma prevalence than other races, which is a signiﬁcant disparity [62, 25]. 2.
