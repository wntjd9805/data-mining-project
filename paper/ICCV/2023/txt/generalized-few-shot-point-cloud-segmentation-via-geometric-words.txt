Abstract
Existing fully-supervised point cloud segmentation meth-ods suffer in the dynamic testing environment with emerg-ing new classes. Few-shot point cloud segmentation algo-rithms address this problem by learning to adapt to new classes at the sacrifice of segmentation accuracy for the base classes, which severely impedes its practicality. This largely motivates us to present the first attempt at a more practical paradigm of generalized few-shot point cloud seg-mentation, which requires the model to generalize to new categories with only a few support point clouds and si-multaneously retain the capability to segment base classes.
We propose the geometric words to represent geometric components shared between the base and novel classes, and incorporate them into a novel geometric-aware seman-tic representation to facilitate better generalization to the new classes without forgetting the old ones. Moreover, we introduce geometric prototypes to guide the segmentation with geometric prior knowledge. Extensive experiments on
S3DIS and ScanNet consistently illustrate the superior per-formance of our method over baseline methods. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Pixie8888/

Introduction
Point cloud segmentation aims at predicting the cate-gory of each point in the 3D scenes represented by the point cloud, and has wide applications in autonomous driv-ing, robotics, etc. Although fully-supervised point cloud segmentation methods (Full-3DSeg) [19, 20, 28, 11, 9, 29] have achieved impressive performance, they heavily require large-scale annotated training data and rely on the closed set assumption that the class distribution of the testing point cloud remains the same as the training dataset. However, the closed set assumption is unrealistic in the open world where

It shows the horizontal planes of the sofa, table and chair are all activated to the same GW due to similar geometric structure. new classes arise continuously. The Full-3DSeg in this chal-lenging open-world setting thus requires large amounts of annotated data for new classes, which are time-consuming and expensive to collect.
The few-shot point cloud segmentation (FS-3DSeg) [35, 14, 8] algorithms are designed to ameliorate the lack of data for novel class adaptation. Generally, FS-3DSeg first trains a model with abundant training samples of the base classes, and then targets at segmenting the new classes by learn-ing from only a small number of samples from the corre-sponding new classes. By adopting episodic training [26] to mimic the testing environment and specific designs for feature extraction [35], FS-3DSeg achieves promising novel class segmentation results for the query point clouds. How-ever, in the task of point cloud segmentation, base and novel classes often appear together in one scene (see Figure 5 as examples). An ideal segmentor in practice is expected to give each point in the scene a semantic label. As a result, the
FS-3DSeg setting that only segments points of novel classes while ignoring the base classes suffers limited practicality.
In view of the impracticality of FS-3DSeg, we introduce the generalized few-shot point cloud segmentation (GFS-3DSeg) task. As shown in Tab. 1, given the model originally trained on base classes, the objective of GFS-3DSeg is to segment both base and novel classes using merely a limited
number of labeled samples for the new classes during test-ing. Furthermore, there is no access to the base training data during testing in GFS-3DSeg considering the issues of data privacy and storage memory limitations. In this demanding but practical context, we expect a good generalized few-shot point cloud segmentor to effectively learn to segment novel classes with few samples and also maintain the knowledge of the base classes. A potential solution to GFS-3DSeg can be using prototype learning [25, 21] to generate class proto-types of the base and novel classes as the classifier weights, which can quickly adapt to new classes and avoid forgetting past knowledge caused by fine-tuning. However, effective learning of the representation and classifier for the novel classes is not trivial and remains as a major challenge.
In this paper, we propose geometric words1 (GWs) as the transferable knowledge obtained from the base classes to enhance the learning of the new classes without forget-ting the old ones. Although different (old and new) classes contain distinct semantic representations, they usually share similar local geometric structures as shown in Fig. 1. Based on this observation, we first mine the representation for the local geometric structures from the pretrained features of the base classes and store them as the geometric words to facilitate learning of the new classes with few examples.
We then learn a geometric-aware semantic representation based on the geometric words. Specifically, the geometric-aware semantic representation is a fusion of two features: 1) Class-agnostic geometric feature obtained by the assign-ment of low-level features to their most similar geometric words. 2) Class-specific semantic feature which is the out-put of a feature extractor. Intuitively, our geometric-aware semantic representation allows the encoding of the transfer-able geometric information across classes while preserving the semantic information for effective segmentation.
We further introduce geometric prototype (GP) to sup-plement the original semantic prototype in the prototype learning. Particularly, the geometric prototype refers to the frequency histogram of GWs that can uniquely represent each class from the global geometric perspective despite
GWs are class agnostic. We thus leverage GP to propose a geometric-guided classifier re-weighting module for the rectification of biased predictions originating from semantic prototypes. Specifically, we first perform minor frequency pruning on the geometric prototypes to suppress noisy re-sponses of the geometric words for each class. Subse-quently, we measure the geometric matching score between each query point and the pruned geometric prototypes, and employ these scores as geometric-guided weights. By re-weighting the semantic logits with geometric-guided weights, our final prediction is enriched with geometric in-formation that is transferable across classes.

Our main contributions can be summarized as:
• We are the first to study the important generalized few-shot point cloud segmentation task, which is more practi-cal than its counterparts of fully-supervised and few-shot setting in the dynamic testing environment.
• We propose geometric words to represent diverse ba-sic geometric structures that are shared across different classes, and a geometric-aware semantic representation that allows for generalizable knowledge encoding.
• We introduce geometric prototype to supplement the se-mantic prototype. We design a geometric-guided clas-sifier re-weighting module comprising minor frequency pruning to dynamically guide the segmentation of novel classes with geometric similarity.
• We conduct extensive experiments on S3DIS and Scan-Net to verify the effectiveness of our method. Specifi-cally, our method improves over the state-of-the-art FS-3DSeg method by 6 and 8 times on the 5-shot and 1-shot settings of ScanNet, respectively. 2.
