Abstract
Decomposing a single mixed image into individual im-age layers is the common crux of a classical category of tasks in image restoration. Several uniﬁed frameworks have been proposed that can handle different types of degrada-tion in superimposed image decomposition. However, there are always undesired structural distortions in the separated images when dealing with complicated degradation pat-terns.
In this paper, we propose a uniﬁed framework for superimposed image decomposition that can cope with in-tricate degradation patterns adaptively. Considering the different mixing patterns between the layers, we introduce a degeneration representation in the latent space to mine the intrinsic relationship between the superimposed im-age and the degeneration pattern. Moreover, by extracting structure-guided knowledge from the superimposed image, we further propose structural guidance reﬁnement to avoid confusing content caused by structure distortion. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method remark-ably outperforms other popular image separation frame-works. The method also achieves competitive results on re-lated applications including image deraining, image reﬂec-tion removal, and image shadow removal, which validates the generalization of the framework. 1.

Introduction
Single superimposed image decomposition aims to de-compose a given superimposed image into the correspond-ing source images. It involves many critical research tasks, such as image deraining, reﬂection removal, and shadow re-moval, etc. The key feature of this type of task is that the input degraded image can be viewed as a superimposing of two layers. For example, image deraining can be treated as decomposing a rainy image into a rain-free image and rain streaks.
In superimposed image decomposition, the degradation

I = g (x1) + f (x2) , (1) where g (·) and f (·) represent various degradation repre-sentations for x1 and x2, which act as crucial components to model the degradation. A challenge of this task is deal-ing with various and complicated degradation patterns pro-duced in different degradation processes, like the mixing factor of two layers in Eq. (1). These degradation pat-terns are extremely difﬁcult to identify, therefore, previ-ous methods usually formulate these tasks as individual re-search problems, making great progress [8, 42, 15]. How-ever, the model well-designed for one task is hard to apply directly to another, due to the degradation changes. There is a high expectation to handle all the above tasks within a uniﬁed framework.
In recent years, existing studies have exploited the Unet-based [33] single lane structure to restore source images in a uniﬁed framework (see Figure 2). While high-ﬁdelity re-sults can be generated, this structure always suffers from

As Figure 1 shows, one layer contains arti-facts and residuals from another layer, since the single lane may introduce unstable factors and is insufﬁcient to han-dle complicated degradation patterns [21]. Subsequently, a multi-lane structure with two branches can split the de-composition problem into sub-problems [30]. The struc-ture performs the decomposition via the explicitly sepa-rated decoders. However, the intrinsic problem is not al-leviated, since existing models neglect to model the degen-eration representations and directly complete the decompo-sition task, which fails to preserve structural information in the complex degradation patterns.
In this paper, we propose a novel uniﬁed framework for single superimposed image decomposition, which is named as Variational Degeneration to Structural Reﬁne-ment (VDSR). On the one hand, the layers in the super-imposed image are combined in sophisticated degradation ways. Considering the intrinsic relationships between the superimposed image and the degradation patterns, we in-troduce a variational degradation module to describe the relationship by learning the degradation representations in the latent space. Such additional prior enables the net-work to handle various degradation processes adaptively.
On the other hand, different structural information is stored in the various layers of the superimposed image. To pre-serve the gradient structure of individual layers, we pro-pose a structure-guided learning strategy that focuses on the structure with superimposed edges by extracting structure-guided knowledge from superimposed images.
To demonstrate the proposed model’s effectiveness, we
ﬁrst use ﬁve image decomposition methods on two datasets for comparison. Subsequently, we apply our method to a variety of computer vision tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted on three different tasks, including image derain-ing, image reﬂection removal, and image shadow removal. 2.
