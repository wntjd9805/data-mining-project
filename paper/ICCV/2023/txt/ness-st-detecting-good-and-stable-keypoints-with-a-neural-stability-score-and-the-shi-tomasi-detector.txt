Abstract
Learning a feature point detector presents a challenge both due to the ambiguity of the definition of a keypoint and, correspondingly, the need for specially prepared ground truth labels for such points. In our work, we address both of these issues by utilizing a combination of a hand-crafted
Shi-Tomasi detector, a specially designed metric that as-sesses the quality of keypoints, the stability score (SS), and a neural network. We build on the principled and localized keypoints provided by the Shi-Tomasi detector and learn the neural network to select good feature points via the stability score. The neural network incorporates the knowledge from the training targets in the form of the neural stability score (NeSS). Therefore, our method is named NeSS-ST since it combines the Shi-Tomasi detector and the properties of the neural stability score.
It only requires sets of images for training without dataset pre-labeling or the need for recon-structed correspondence labels. We evaluate NeSS-ST on
HPatches, ScanNet, MegaDepth and IMC-PT demonstrat-ing state-of-the-art performance and good generalization on downstream tasks. The project repository is available at: https://github.com/KonstantinPakulev/

Introduction
Feature point detection (keypoint detection) is usually the first step in camera localization and scene reconstruc-tion pipelines based on sparse features commonly used in robotics [29], computer vision [33], augmented, mixed and virtual reality [7, 22] and other systems.
Whilst feature description is successfully approached in the literature as metric learning [27, 36] problem, applying deep learning to the feature detection task still poses a chal-lenge with classical solutions showing competitive results on the state-of-the-art benchmarks [15]. The difficulty is caused by the innate vagueness of point of interest defini-tion [40] that greatly complicates the formulation of feature detection as a learning problem.
The data required to learn keypoints with sufficient ro-bustness to illumination and viewpoint changes presents an-other challenge. Structure-from-Motion (SfM) [33, 10] and
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) [34, 10] reconstructions that are used by some methods [41, 30, 31, 13, 37] to obtain pixel-accurate correspondences are hard to build properly and lack full image coverage [19, 9].
We approach the problem of “defining a keypoint” by leveraging principled assumptions that make up reasonable keypoints [35]: we employ the Shi-Tomasi [35] detector to provide locations for keypoints as well as to perform sub-pixel localization. At the same time, we propose a quanti-tative metric to measure the stability of detected keypoints to viewpoint transformations, the stability score (SS), that randomly perturbs detected points and their surrounding patches for later aggregation of their statistics. This met-ric can be calculated in an online fashion for a set of key-points from a single image, so it is ideal for automatically generating a supervised signal for training a neural network that predicts the neural stability score (NeSS). We empower a classical method, the Shi-Tomasi detector, with a neural approach, NeSS, getting a method, NeSS-ST, that provides accurate locations of keypoints that are more likely to re-main stable under viewpoint changes.
The design presented in our work does not rely on ground-truth poses or reconstructed correspondences along-side [11, 3, 18]. These methods are sometimes referred to as self-supervised [11, 18]. Compared to the prior art,
NeSS-ST needs only a set of real images without any la-bels for training. Out of self-supervised methods, only
Key.Net [3] and REKD [18] work in a similar setting while
SuperPoint [11] relies on pre-labeled datasets and requires pre-training a base detector on a synthetic dataset (see Ta-ble 1).
Our contributions are as follows. We present a novel metric, the stability score, to estimate the quality of key-points. We propose a method, NeSS-ST, that employs the stability score to learn a neural network and requires only images for training. In terms of pose accuracy, NeSS-ST surpasses state-of-the-art on MegaDepth [19], is on par on
IMC-PT [15], ScanNet [9] and HPatches [2] being the best among the self-supervised methods (see Table 6).
