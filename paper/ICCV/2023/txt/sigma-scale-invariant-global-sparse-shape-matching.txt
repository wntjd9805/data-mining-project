Abstract
We propose a novel mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation for generating precise sparse correspondences for highly non-rigid shapes. To this end, we introduce a projected Laplace-Beltrami operator (PLBO) which com-bines intrinsic and extrinsic geometric information to mea-sure the deformation quality induced by predicted corre-spondences. We integrate the PLBO, together with an orientation-aware regulariser, into a novel MIP formula-tion that can be solved to global optimality for many prac-tical problems.
In contrast to previous methods, our ap-proach is provably invariant to rigid transformations and global scaling, initialisation-free, has optimality guaran-tees, and scales to high resolution meshes with (empiri-cally observed) linear time. We show state-of-the-art re-sults for sparse non-rigid matching on several challenging 3D datasets, including data with inconsistent meshing, as well as applications in mesh-to-point-cloud matching. 1.

Introduction
Finding correspondences or matchings between parts of 3D shapes is a well-studied problem that lies at the heart of many tasks in computer vision, computer graphics and beyond. Example tasks related to such 3D shape match-ing problems include generative shape modelling [49], 3D shape analysis [34], motion capture [46], or model-based image segmentation [5], which are relevant for applications in autonomous driving, robotics, and biomedicine.
While 3D shape matching is traditionally addressed in terms of an optimisation problem formulation, in re-cent years learning-based approaches became more popu-lar. Specifically, with the advent of geometric deep learn-ing we have witnessed a dramatic improvement in the per-formance of data-driven methods for 3D shape matching, even for difficult settings such as unsupervised learning for partial shapes [13, 3]. Yet, such learning-based approaches lack theoretical guarantees, both regarding the (global) op-timality and often also regarding structural properties of obtained solutions. While optimality guarantees are cru-cial in safety-critical domains (e.g. autonomous driving, or computer-aided surgery), desirable structural properties may be related to geometric consistency, such as smooth-ness or the continuity of matchings [48]. From a tech-nical point of view it is typically straightforward to im-pose respective structural properties within an optimisation-Method

Table 1: Overview of axiomatic shape matching approaches that have a global optimisation flavour. Our approach is the only one that at the same time is initalisation-free, scale- and rigid motion-invariant, and works on both meshes and point clouds. Moreover, ours achieves the best proportion of globally optimal solutions across all experiments.

However, resulting formulations are high-dimensional and non-convex, so that finding ‘good’ solutions is a major challenge – many resulting problems lead to large-scale integer linear programming formula-tions, e.g. when imposing discrete diffeomorphism con-straints [48], or when considering the NP-hard quadratic assignment problem [21, 30, 35, 36, 17, 47].
Yet, 3D shape matching typically involves profound structural characteristics (e.g. related to geometric con-straints), so that, despite the complexity and high dimen-sional nature of respective optimisation problems, several formalisms have been proposed that can be efficiently solved in practice. Often they are built on a low dimensional matching representation, e.g. in the spectral domain [27], or in terms of a sparse set of discrete control points that give rise to a dense correspondence [6]. In this work we build upon the latter and propose a novel formalism that has a range of desirable properties, including scale invariance, rigid motion invariance and a substantially better scalabil-ity (compared to [6]), which directly leads to a major im-provement of the matching quality. In Tab. 1 we provide an overview of the properties of our method and its direct competitors.
Contributions. We propose a novel mixed-integer pro-gramming formulation for Scale-Invariant Global sparse shape Matching (SIGMA) based on a projected Laplace-Beltrami operator, which combines intrinsic and extrinsic geometric information and is applicable to a variety of chal-lenging non-rigid shape matching problems. In summary, our main contributions are:
• A novel initialisation-free mixed-integer programming formulation for sparse shape matching, which can be solved to global optimality for many practical instances and (empirically) scales linearly with the mesh resolution.
• Our method is provably invariant to rigid transformations and global scaling, thus eliminating the extrinsic align-ment required by many shape matching pipelines.
• We propose the use of the projected Laplace-Beltrami op-erator for geometry reconstruction, which combines in-trinsic and extrinsic geometric information, while still be-ing invariant under actions of the Euclidean group E(3).
• We obtain state-of-the-art results on multiple challenging non-rigid shape matching datasets. 2.
