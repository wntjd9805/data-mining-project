Abstract
With the maturity of depth sensors, the vulnerability of 3D point cloud models has received increasing attention in various applications such as autonomous driving and robot navigation. Previous 3D adversarial attackers either fol-low the white-box setting to iteratively update the coordi-nate perturbations based on gradients, or utilize the output model logits to estimate noisy gradients in the black-box setting. However, these attack methods are hard to be de-ployed in real-world scenarios since realistic 3D applica-tions will not share any model details to users. Therefore, we explore a more challenging yet practical 3D attack set-ting, i.e., attacking point clouds with black-box hard labels, in which the attacker can only have access to the predic-tion label of the input. To tackle this setting, we propose a novel 3D attack method, termed 3D Hard-label attacker (3DHacker), based on the developed decision boundary al-gorithm to generate adversarial samples solely with the knowledge of class labels. Specifically, to construct the class-aware model decision boundary, 3DHacker first ran-domly fuses two point clouds of different classes in the spec-tral domain to craft their intermediate sample with high imperceptibility, then projects it onto the decision bound-ary via binary search. To restrict the final perturbation size, 3DHacker further introduces an iterative optimization strategy to move the intermediate sample along the deci-sion boundary for generating adversarial point clouds with smallest trivial perturbations. Extensive evaluations show that, even in the challenging hard-label setting, 3DHacker still competitively outperforms existing 3D attacks regard-ing the attack performance as well as adversary quality. 1.

Introduction

Figure 1. Illustration of our motivation. Our 3D hard-label setting cannot access any model details of the hidden layer or the logits of the output layer. To tackle this setting, we develop a spectrum-based decision boundary algorithm to iteratively optimize the best adversarial sample only with the knowledge of the predicted label. guishable from legitimate ones by adding trivial perturba-tions but often lead to incorrect model prediction. Many efforts have been made into attacks on the 2D image field
[7, 30, 21, 39]. However, in addition to image-based 2D attacks, 3D point cloud attacks are also crucial in vari-ous safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving
[5, 49, 14], robotic grasping [41, 56], and face challenges in realistic scenarios.
Existing 3D point cloud attack methods [38, 54, 57, 43] generally delve into achieving high attack success rate and maintaining the imperceptibility of adversarial examples.
However, these 3D attack methods still suffer from two main limitations: (1) Most of them are deployed in white-box setting where the attackers have the full knowledge of victim models including network structure and weights.
This setting makes the attacks less practical since most real-world 3D applications will not share their model de-tails to users. (2) The quality of their adversarial examples are limited. Since most previous works simply utilize ge-ometric distance losses or additional shape knowledge to implicitly constrain the perturbations according to gradient search or gradient optimization, their adversarial examples fail to properly keep the original 3D object shape and eas-ily have irregular surface or outliers. Although some at-tackers [51, 46, 43, 16] try to modify few points or design geometry-aware perturbations, their adversarial samples are hard to achieve optimal due to the greedy search in the op-timization process.
Based on the above observations, in this paper, we make the attempt to explore a more challenging yet practical 3D attack setting, i.e., attacking 3D point clouds with black-box hard labels, in which attackers can only have access to the final classification results of the model instead of the model details. Compared to previous general 3D black-box setting
[16] that still has the knowledge of predicted logits scores of the input, our hard-label setting is more difficult since we only access the prediction labels of the input and cannot rely on the changes of the final predicted logits for updating the perturbations. To tackle this new attack setting while improving the quality of adversarial examples compared to previous works, we aim to exploit the decision boundary mechanism [24, 26, 23] as the core idea to generate adver-sarial point clouds by determining the class-aware model decision boundary for searching the mispredicted boundary cloud with small distance to the source cloud, as shown in
Figure 1. Based on the concave-convex decision boundary, it can easily optimize samples with lowest perturbations.
However, directly adapting previous 2D decision bound-ary mechanisms [36, 18, 26, 24, 23] into the 3D point cloud field may face several challenges: (1) Previous 2D decision-boundary attackers [24, 23] generally generate ad-versarial images on decision boundary by calculating the weighted average of each pixel value between source and target images. However, 3D point cloud data mainly con-tain coordinates with optional point-wise values, which is unordered and irregularly sampled. Therefore, directly cal-culating the weighted average of the point coordinates be-tween two point clouds would make no sense, since it will disarrange the relations of neighboring points and deform the 3D object shape. Although one solution would be to solely add coordinate-wise perturbations to generate the de-cision boundary, this operation is not geometry-aware and easily leads to outliers and uneven point distribution (val-idated in our Experiment Section). (2) In the 2D field, in addition to achieving high imperceptibility, the averaged image also preserves the semantic features of the original image since their pixel relations are implicitly maintained.
However, the structural representations of 3D point clouds in the latent space will be easily broken when modifying points in the data domain. Therefore, it is critically chal-lenging to maintain both smooth appearance and geomet-ric characteristics for generating high-quality 3D adversar-ial examples. (3) Almost all 2D decision boundary mecha-nisms solely utilize pixel-wise iterative walking to move the image along the decision boundary for optimization. How-ever, directly applying the point-wise walking on 3D point clouds may stuck into the local optimum, since the opti-mized cloud on the decision boundary may not have the smallest perturbation and fail to overcome the large convex area without additional guidance as shown in Figure 1.
To address the above challenges, we propose a novel spectrum-based decision boundary attack method, called 3D Hard-label attacker (3DHacker). Instead of fusing the point cloud via coordinate-wise average operation, we pro-pose to fuse point clouds in the spectral domain, which not only preserves the geometric characteristics of both point clouds in coordinate-aware data domain, but also pro-duces the smooth structure of the generated sample for achieving high imperceptibility. Specifically, our 3DHacker consists of two parts-——boundary-cloud generation with spectrum-fusion and boundary-cloud optimization along the decision boundary. (1) During the boundary-cloud gen-eration, we aim to attack a benign source-cloud into the class of target-clouds at their decision boundary with triv-ial perturbations. To be specific, we first perform Graph
Fourier Transform (GFT) on each point cloud to obtain its graph spectrum, then fuse the spectrum of source-cloud and target-clouds with proper fusion rate with further inverse
GFT to generate corresponding candidate point clouds. In this manner, we can obtain the decision boundary between the point clouds of different class labels. We select the best candidate with slightest distortion and project it on (2) the decision boundary to obtain the boundary-cloud.
In boundary-cloud optimization stage, we perform itera-tive walking strategy on the boundary-cloud along the de-cision boundary aiming at further minimizing the distance between boundary-cloud and source-cloud. Each iteration starts from a perturbation generated by gradient estima-tion and then reduces the distortion through binary search-ing coordinates in the adversarial region. To jump out of the local optimum during optimization, we further design a spectrum-wise walking strategy in addition to the point-wise one. The boundary cloud optimized by the above two walking strategies will be taken as the final adversarial sam-ple of the source cloud with high imperceptibility.
To sum up, our main contributions are three-fold:
• We achieve 3D point cloud attack in a more challeng-ing yet practical black-box hard-label setting, and in-troduce a novel method 3DHacker based on decision boundary algorithm with point cloud spectrum.
• We propose spectrum-based decision boundary gener-ation for preserving high-quality point cloud samples.
Moreover, we introduce a new generation pipeline for boundary point clouds, and propose a joint coordinate-and spectrum-aware iterative walking strategy to alle-viate the local optimum problem.
• Experimental results show that the proposed 3DHacker achieves 100% of attack success rates with the compet-itive perturbations compared to existing attack meth-ods, even in the more challenging hard-label setting. 2.
