Abstract
In this paper we introduce the Tangent Sampson error, which is a generalization of the classical Sampson error in two-view geometry that allows for arbitrary central cam-era models.
It only requires local gradients of the dis-tortion map at the original correspondences (allowing for pre-computation) resulting in a negligible increase in com-putational cost when used in RANSAC or local refinement.
The error effectively approximates the true-reprojection er-ror for a large variety of cameras, including extremely wide field-of-view lenses that cannot be undistorted to a single pinhole image. We show experimentally that the new er-ror outperforms competing approaches both when used for model scoring in RANSAC and for non-linear refinement of the relative camera pose. constrains the geometry via the epipolar constraint, (p2; 1)⊺E(p1; 1) = 0, (1) where E = [t]×R ∈ R3×3 is the essential matrix and the points p1, p2 are on the normalized image plane. This con-straint ensures that the 2D-2D correspondence can be ex-actly triangulated (i.e. with zero reprojection error) using the camera pair extracted from E. However when the mea-surement (p1, p2) is inexact, it is natural to measure how close this correspondence is to being consistent with a given epipolar geometry. This is for example used for determin-ing inlier matches during robust estimation, or as a loss to be minimized when refining an initial estimate of E.
Under the assumption of i.i.d. Gaussian noise, the ML-estimate of the closest consistent correspondence, some-times called the gold-standard estimate in the literature
[12], is found by minimizing the squared reprojection error, 1.

Introduction
Estimating two-view geometry from a set of sparse 2D-2D correspondences is a common sub-problem in many vi-sion applications. Each correspondence (p1, p2) ∈ R2 ×R2

M L = min
X∈R3
∥p1 − π(X)∥2 + ∥p2 − π(RX + t)∥2, (2) where π : R3 → R2 is the camera projection function.
For identical pinhole cameras with unit aspect ratio and no
skew, this can be reformulated as finding the corrected nor-malized image points, i.e. the closest pair of 2D points that satisfy the epipolar constraint exactly,

M L = min
ˆp1, ˆp2∈R2 s.t.
∥p1 − ˆp1∥2 + ∥p2 − ˆp2∥2 ( ˆp2; 1)⊺E( ˆp1; 1) = 0. (3)
The closed-form solution to (3) can be found as a root to a degree-six polynomial (see [13]), or via iterative meth-ods [20]. In robust estimators, e.g. RANSAC, it is often nec-essary to evaluate these residuals thousands (or potentially millions) of times for each image pair, which in practice means that cheaper approximate error metrics are favored.
These approximate or surrogate error metrics can be di-vided into two categories: image-based (approximating the true reprojection error) or geometry-based (measuring some geometric quantity, e.g. angles, instead). In the first cate-gory we have the epipolar distance, i.e. distance from the point to the corresponding epipolar line. This can be inter-preted as assuming zero noise on one of the keypoints. The error is often computed symmetrically and thus called the symmetric epipolar distance, having the form

SED =
⊺ 2 Ed1|2
|d
∥E12d1∥2 +
⊺ 2 Ed1|2
|d
∥(E⊺)12d2∥2 , (4) where E12 ∈ R2×3 refers to the first two rows of E, and dk = (pk; 1) ∈ R3. Another image-based error is the
Sampson error, which is a first-order approximation of EM L (see Sec. 2.1 for details):
E 2
S =
⊺ 2 Ed1|2
|d
∥E12d1∥2 + ∥(E⊺)12d2∥2 . (5)
Both of these errors can after appropriate rescaling (using the focal lengths) be expressed in pixels and thus are natural to interpret in terms of the keypoint detection noise levels.
In the second category, an example is the cosine error,
E 2
CS =
⊺ 2 Ed1|2
|d
∥d2∥2 ∥Ed1∥2 +
⊺ 2 Ed1|2
|d
∥E⊺d2∥2 ∥d1∥2 , (6) which (symmetrically) measures the cosine between the normal of the epipolar plane Ed1 ∈ R3 and correspond-ing point d2 ∈ R3. Another geometric error is the algebraic residual,
⊺ 2 Ed1|,
EALG = |d (7) which was given a geometric interpretation in [19].
Most of the literature has focused on the pinhole cam-era case, and the image-based errors above (ESED and ES) measure the error in the image plane assuming this model.
For non-pinhole cameras, we either have to undistort the image such that ESED and ES are applicable, or use the
Figure 2. Undistorting the image deforms the level-sets of the re-projection error and introduces a radial bias in the optimization. geometry-based error metrics (e.g. ECS or EALG). How-ever, undistorting to a pinhole image (which is not always possible for large field-of-view cameras) will introduce a radial-bias into the error (see Figure 2).
In this paper we instead propose the Tangent Sampson error ET S, a version of the classical Sampson error that has been generalized to handle arbitrary camera models. Com-pared to current alternatives it has the following benefits;
• It is cheap to evaluate (similar in cost to the original
Sampson error) since it only requires computing the camera model forward-projection and Jacobian once (which can be pre-computed for each point).
• Since it measures errors in the original image, it is easier to set meaningful thresholds in pixels. This is in contrast to geometric error functions, where it is not al-ways clear how to relate the thresholds (e.g. in angles) to the keypoint detection noise in pixels.
• It works for arbitrary central camera models, only requiring that we can compute a Jacobian of the cam-era projection function at each correspondence. This also allows the formulation to work for cameras mod-eled via look-up tables, where the Jacobian can be es-timated via interpolation of finite differences.
In Section 2.1 we first recall the derivations for the orig-inal Sampson error. Next, in Section 3 we propose our gen-eralization to arbitrary central camera models, and in Sec-tion 4 we experimentally show that the proposed error out-performs the competing methods on a variety of camera and lens configurations. 2.
