Abstract
Which video has better quality?
The rapid increase in user-generated content (UGC) videos calls for the development of effective video qual-ity assessment (VQA) algorithms. However, the objective of the UGC-VQA problem is still ambiguous and can be viewed from two perspectives: the technical perspective, measuring the perception of distortions; and the aesthetic perspective, which relates to preference and recommenda-tion on contents. To understand how these two perspectives affect overall subjective opinions in UGC-VQA, we con-duct a large-scale subjective study to collect human quality opinions on the overall quality of videos as well as percep-tions from aesthetic and technical perspectives. The col-lected Disentangled Video Quality Database (DIVIDE-3k) conﬁrms that human quality opinions on UGC videos are universally and inevitably affected by both aesthetic and
In light of this, we propose the technical perspectives.
Disentangled Objective Video Quality Evaluator (DOVER) to learn the quality of UGC videos based on the two per-spectives. The DOVER proves state-of-the-art performance in UGC-VQA under very high efﬁciency. With perspective opinions in DIVIDE-3k, we further propose DOVER++, the
ﬁrst approach to provide reliable clear-cut quality evalua-tions from a single aesthetic or technical perspective. Code at https://github.com/VQAssessment/DOVER. 1.

Introduction
Understanding and predicting human quality of experi-ence (QoE) on diverse in-the-wild videos has been a long-existing and unsolved problem. Recent Video Quality As-sessment (VQA) studies have gathered enormous human quality opinions [1–5] on in-the-wild user-generated con-tents (UGC) and attempted to use machine algorithms [6–8] to learn and predict these opinions, known as the UGC-VQA problem [9]. However, due to the diversity of con-tents in UGC videos and the lack of reference videos during subjective studies, these human-quality opinions are still ambiguous and may relate to different perspectives.

Figure 1. Which video has better quality: a clear video with meaningless contents (a) or a blurry video with meaningful contents (b)? Viewing from different perspectives (aesthetic/technical) may produce different judg-ments, motivating us to collect DIVIDE-3k, which is the ﬁrst UGC-VQA dataset with opinions from multiple perspectives. More multi-perspective quality comparisons in our dataset are shown in supplementary Sec. A.
Conventionally, VQA studies [9–13] are concerned with the technical perspective, aiming at measuring distortions in videos (e.g., blurs, artifacts) and their impact on quality, so as to compare and guide technical systems such as cam-eras [14, 15], restoration algorithms [16–18] and compres-sion standards [19]. Under this perspective, the video with clear textures in Fig. 1(a) should have notably better quality than the blurry video in Fig. 1(b). On the other hand, sev-eral recent studies [2, 6, 7, 20, 21] notice that preferences on non-technical semantic factors (e.g., contents, composition) also affect human quality assessment on UGC videos. Hu-man experience on these factors is usually regarded as the aesthetic perspective [22–27] of quality evaluation, which considers the video in Fig. 1(b) as better quality due to its more meaningful contents and is preferred for content recommendation systems on platforms such as YouTube or
TikTok. However, how aesthetic preference plays the im-pact on ﬁnal human quality opinions of UGC videos is still debatable [1, 2] and requires further validation.
To investigate the impact of aesthetic and technical per-spectives on human quality perception of UGC videos, we conduct the ﬁrst comprehensive subjective study to collect opinions from both perspectives, as well as overall opinions on a large number of videos. We also conduct subjective 1
reasoning studies to explicitly gather information on how much each individual’s overall quality opinion is inﬂuenced by aesthetic and technical perspectives. With overall 450K opinions on 3,590 diverse UGC videos, we construct the
ﬁrst Disentangled Video Quality Database (DIVIDE-3k).
After calibrating our study on the DIVIDE-3k with exist-ing UGC-VQA subjective studies, we observe that human quality perception on UGC videos is broadly and inevitably affected by both aesthetic and technical perspectives. As a consequence, the overall subjective quality scores between the two videos in Fig. 1 with different qualities from either one of the two perspectives could be similar.
Motivated by the observation from our subjective study, we aim to develop an objective UGC-VQA method that ac-counts for both aesthetic and technical perspectives. To achieve this, we design the View Decomposition strategy, which divides and conquers aesthetic-related and technical-related information in videos, and propose the Disentangled
Objective Video Quality Evaluator (DOVER). DOVER consists of two branches, each dedicated to focusing on the effects of one perspective. Speciﬁcally, based on the differ-ent characteristics of quality issues related to each perspec-tive, we carefully design inductive biases for each branch, including speciﬁc inputs, regularization strategies, and pre-training. The two branches are supervised by the overall scores (affected by both perspectives) to adapt for existing
UGC-VQA datasets [1, 3, 4, 28–30], and additionally super-vised by aesthetic and technical opinions exclusively in the
DIVIDE-3k (denoted as DOVER++). Finally, we obtain the overall quality prediction via a subjectively-inspired fu-sion of the predictions from the two perspectives. With the subjectively-inspired design, the proposed DOVER and
DOVER++ not only reach better accuracy on the overall quality prediction but also provide more reliable quality pre-diction from aesthetic and technical perspectives, catering for practical scenarios.
Our contributions can be summarized as four-fold: 1) We collect the DIVIDE-3k (3,590 videos), the ﬁrst
UGC-VQA database that contains 450,000 subjective quality opinions from aesthetic and technical perspec-tives as well as their effects on overall quality scores. 2) By analyzing opinions, we observe that human qual-ity perception is broadly affected by both aesthetic and technical perspectives in the UGC-VQA problem, bet-ter explaining the human perceptual mechanism on it. 3) We propose the DOVER, a subjectively-inspired video quality evaluator with two branches focusing on aes-thetic and technical perspectives. The DOVER demon-strates state-of-the-arts on the all UGC-VQA datasets. 4) Our methods can provide quality predictions from a single perspective, which can be applied as metrics for camera systems (technical) or content recommenda-tion (aesthetic), or for personalized VQA (Sec. 5.5). 2.
