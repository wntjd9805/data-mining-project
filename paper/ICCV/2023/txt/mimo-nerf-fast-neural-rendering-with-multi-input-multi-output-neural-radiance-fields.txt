Abstract
Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have shown impressive results for novel view synthesis. However, they depend on the repetitive use of a single-input single-output multilayer perceptron (SISO MLP) that maps 3D coordinates and view direction to the color and volume density in a sample-wise manner, which slows the rendering. We propose a multi-input multi-output NeRF (MIMO-NeRF) that reduces the number of MLPs running by replacing the SISO MLP with a MIMO MLP and conducting mappings in a group-wise manner. One notable challenge with this approach is that the color and volume density of each point can differ ac-cording to a choice of input coordinates in a group, which can lead to some notable ambiguity. We also propose a self-supervised learning method that regularizes the MIMO
MLP with multiple fast reformulated MLPs to alleviate this ambiguity without using pretrained models. The results of a comprehensive experimental evaluation including com-parative and ablation studies are presented to show that
MIMO-NeRF obtains a good trade-off between speed and quality with a reasonable training time. We then demon-strate that MIMO-NeRF is compatible with and comple-mentary to previous advancements in NeRFs by applying it to two representative fast NeRFs, i.e., a NeRF with a sam-pling network (DONeRF) and a NeRF with alternative rep-resentations (TensoRF).1 1.

Introduction
Images are two-dimensional (2D) projections of three-dimensional (3D) scenes. Solving the inverse problem, that is, learning 3D representations from 2D images and synthe-sizing novel views, is a fundamental concern in computer vision and graphics and has been extensively studied for various applications such as photo editing, content creation, virtual reality, and environmental understanding.
With the advent of implicit neural representations 1The project page is available at https://www.kecl.ntt.co. jp/people/kaneko.takuhiro/projects/mimo-nerf/.
Figure 1. Comparison between NeRF and MIMO-NeRF (pro-posed). (a) A typical NeRF uses a SISO MLP that maps 3D co-ordinates and view direction to the color and volume density in a sample-wise manner. (b) In contrast, the proposed MIMO-NeRF uses a MIMO MLP that performs mappings in a group-wise man-ner. This change reduces the number of MLPs running and im-proves the rendering speed, but also requires addressing ambigu-ity in the color and volume density caused by the fact that these values are determined in a non-unique manner by a set of input coordinates that vary by viewpoint, grouping, and sampling. The main technical contribution of the present work is that of providing methods to mitigate this challenge. We demonstrate the impact of the proposed technique in Figure 2. (e.g., [56, 44, 39, 28, 69, 71, 55]), substantial advancements have been made towards addressing this problem. Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) [39] have been noted as a success-ful approach. A NeRF represents a scene using a continuous function that maps 3D coordinates and view direction to the color and volume density and renders a pixel by integrat-ing the outputs on a ray using volume rendering [34]. This formulation enables NeRF to learn to synthesize geometri-cally consistent and high-fidelity novel views with only 2D supervision.
Despite this advantage, a typical NeRF suffers from slow rendering because it uses a single-input single-output (SISO) MLP that calculates the RGB color and volume density in a sample-wise manner (Figure 1(a)). Although this architecture ensures the independent representation of each point, which is useful, for example, for learning view-independent volume density, its computational cost increases in proportion to the number of samples for each
ray (e.g., on the order of hundreds). Several methods devel-oped to address this issue can be roughly categorized into two approaches, including (1) sample reduction and (2) al-ternative representations.
A typical sample reduction strategy reduces the number of samples on a ray using a sampling network based on the depth [41] or density of a pretrained NeRF [47] or using a sampling network with an adaptive optimization mech-anism [29, 14, 27]. These methods successfully acceler-ate the rendering process while retaining the quality of an image adequately. However, most of these techniques still use a SISO MLP to predict the colors and volume densities of selected samples; therefore, they still need to run MLPs many times in proportion to the number of selected sam-ples. This issue can be alleviated by reducing the number of selected samples, although this deteriorates the quality of the synthesized images accordingly.
As alternative representations, various sophisticated and faster representations such as 3D voxel grids [17, 22, 30, 66, 60], sparse voxel-based octrees [70, 15], multiplane im-ages [65], tri-planes [7], vector-matrix decomposition [9], hashes [40], NeRF-specific structures [24], and space-wise
MLPs [50, 51] have been devised. These representations contribute to achieving fast rendering while retaining image quality moderately well. However, after powerful features are extracted using alternative representations, SISO MLPs are still commonly used for the final prediction of color or volume density owing to their memory-efficient and con-tinuous nature. Hence, part of the calculation cost still in-creases depending on the number of samples.
Consequently, owing to its compact, continuous (i.e., resolution-free), and independent (e.g., view-independent) nature, a SISO MLP is commonly used in various NeRFs.
However, as mentioned above, the calculation cost increases with the number of samples. This is not preferable when considering the improvement in rendering speed. Possible simple solutions include, for example, a reduction of the number of samples or a reduction of the size of a model with a corresponding sacrifice of image quality. However, these solutions are not necessarily the best for handling the trade-off between quality and speed.2 Alternatively, we propose a multi-input multi-output NeRF (MIMO-NeRF), which is a novel variant of NeRF that represents a scene using a MIMO
MLP that conducts mappings in a group-wise manner (Fig-ure 1(b)). This modification enables a reduction in the num-ber of MLPs running according to the number of grouped samples and consequently improves rendering speed.
However, in this approach, the uniqueness of the color and volume density of each point is not ensured because they are determined not only by the coordinates of the cor-responding point but also by the coordinates of the other points in a group, which vary by viewpoint, grouping, and 2We discuss this trade-off in detail in Section 5.2.
Figure 2. Challenge of training MIMO-NeRF and the impact of the proposed self-supervised learning. (a) MIMO-NeRF-naive suffers from ambiguity in the color and volume density of each point and deteriorates image quality. (b) We propose self-supervised learn-ing to address this problem without relying on a pretrained model.
This technique improves image quality. sampling. This leads to some ambiguity and causes fluctu-ation artifacts as shown in Figure 2(a). In particular, this ambiguity can be problematic when learning a 3D repre-sentation using only 2D supervision because obtaining di-rect supervision that can resolve the ambiguity is difficult.
One possible solution is to train a standard (i.e., SISO)
NeRF first and then distill the model onto the correspond-ing MIMO-NeRF. However, this increases training time be-cause both student and teacher NeRFs must be trained. Al-ternatively, we have also developed a novel self-supervised learning approach in which we reformulate a MIMO MLP in several ways (in particular, we use group shift (Fig-ure 3) and variation reduction (Figure 4)) and impose a consistent regularization so that the reformulated MIMO
MLPs produce the same outputs. Because each reformu-lated MIMO MLP can render a pixel faster than the original
SISO MLP, we can prevent a large sacrifice of training time even when using multiple reformulated MIMO MLPs by adequately adjusting the reformulation configuration. Fig-ure 2(b) shows an example of the effects of this learning scheme.
We investigated the benchmark performance of MIMO-NeRF by comparing it with possible alternatives (includ-ing the distillation of a pretrained NeRF, sample reduction, and reduction of the model size). We also performed ab-lation studies to examine the validity of each component of the proposed self-supervised learning method. We ap-ply MiMO-NeRF to two representative fast NeRFs, includ-ing a NeRF with a sampling network (DONeRF [41]) and a model with alternative representations (TensoRF [9]) to demonstrate that it is compatible with and complementary to previous advancements in NeRFs.
The main contributions of this study are summarized as follows.
• To speed up the rendering of NeRF, we propose
MIMO-NeRF, which represents a scene using a MIMO
MLP that maps the coordinates on a ray to the colors and volume densities in a group-wise manner.
• We introduce novel self-supervised learning to miti-gate the ambiguity in the color and volume density of each point and enable MIMO-NeRF to be trained with-out relying on pretrained models.
• We examined the effectiveness of MIMO-NeRF through a comprehensive experimental evaluation, and the results demonstrate the versatility of MIMO-NeRF in applications to two representative fast NeRFs. We also provide more detailed analyses and extended re-sults in the Supplementary Material. 2.
