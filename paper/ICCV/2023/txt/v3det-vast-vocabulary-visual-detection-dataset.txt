Abstract
Recent advances in detecting arbitrary objects in the real world are trained and evaluated on object detection datasets with a relatively restricted vocabulary. To facili-tate the development of more general visual object detec-tion, we propose V3Det, a vast vocabulary visual detec-tion dataset with precisely annotated bounding boxes on massive images. V3Det has several appealing properties: 1) Vast Vocabulary: It contains bounding boxes of objects from 13,204 categories on real-world images, which is 10 times larger than the existing large vocabulary object de-tection dataset, e.g., LVIS. 2) Hierarchical Category Orga-nization: The vast vocabulary of V3Det is organized by a hierarchical category tree which annotates the inclusion re-lationship among categories, encouraging the exploration of category relationships in vast and open vocabulary ob-* equal contribution. ject detection. 3) Rich Annotations: V3Det comprises pre-cisely annotated objects in 243k images and professional descriptions of each category written by human experts and a powerful chatbot. By offering a vast exploration space,
V3Det enables extensive benchmarks on both vast and open vocabulary object detection, leading to new observations, practices, and insights for future research. It has the poten-tial to serve as a cornerstone dataset for developing more general visual perception systems. V3Det is available at https://v3det.openxlab.org.cn/. 1.

Introduction
Object detection [21, 20, 43, 2, 35, 33, 4, 47, 52, 50, 53, 51, 62] is the cornerstone of various real-world applications, e.g., autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.
Taking images as inputs, it localizes and classifies objects within a given vocabulary, where each detected object is
denoted as a bounding box with a class label.
Detecting arbitrary objects has been a long-standing goal in computer vision. Since the real world contains a vast variability of objects in countless classes, an ideal visual de-tection system should be able to detect objects from an ex-tremely large set of classes and be readily applied to open-vocabulary categories. Therefore, it is imperative to equip the community with an object detection dataset with a vast vocabulary, as this can accelerate the exploration toward more general visual detection systems.
While there have been extensive efforts to create ob-ject detection datasets, they have only partially fulfilled the requirements for a comprehensive dataset with a vast vo-cabulary of categories. For example, as shown in Table 1,
COCO [34] is one of the most widely adopted datasets com-prising 123k images with 80 categories. Objects365 [45] and Open Images [29] are large-scale datasets aimed at pre-training, where Objects365 annotates 638k images with 365 categories, and Open Images contains 1,515k images with 600 categories. While these two datasets provide signif-icant amounts of annotated objects, their limited category numbers still fall short in training class generalizable detec-tors. LVIS [23] is a large vocabulary object detection and instance segmentation [26, 5, 55, 48, 9, 59, 60, 5] dataset containing 120k images with 1,203 categories. Despite its success in recent advances in large / open vocabulary object detection, the vocabulary of LVIS (1,203 categories) is still insufficient to represent the vast diversity of classes in the real world. Therefore, a new object detection dataset with a significantly larger vocabulary would benefit the training and evaluation of visual detectors.
To facilitate future research on more general object de-tection, we introduce V3Det: Vast Vocabulary Visual De-tection Dataset, which comprises a vast vocabulary of pre-cisely annotated objects in real-world images. The pro-posed dataset has several appealing properties: 1) Vast
Vocabulary: It contains bounding boxes of objects from 13,204 categories on real-world images, which is 10 times larger than the existing large vocabulary object detection dataset, such as 1,203 categories in LVIS. 2) Hierarchical
Category Organization: The vast vocabulary of V3Det is organized by a hierarchical category tree that annotates the inclusion relationship among categories. This tree begins with ‘entity’ category, which is the ancestor of all classes, containing both the categories of annotated objects and their parent categories as shown in Figure 1. This hierarchical tree enriches the vocabulary of V3Det, enabling the explo-ration of category relationships in open-world recognition. 3) Rich Annotations: V3Det comprises precisely anno-tated objects in 243k images. The large image collections ensure the diversity of objects and scenes. Besides cate-gory names, V3Det provides rich descriptions of each cat-egory written by human experts and a powerful chatbot,

Table 1: Dataset statistics comparison between the V3Det and ex-isting object detection benchmarks on the released annotations, in-cluding training and validation data. V3Det (All) includes all of training, validation, and testing data of V3Det. i.e., chatgpt, which can serve as language prompts for open-vocabulary object detection.
Extensive benchmarks are conducted on V3Det to reveal insights into this vast vocabulary object detection dataset.
Specifically, we perform extensive experiments on both classical close-set object detection and open-vocabulary ob-ject detection. 1) In close-set object detection, we evaluate various wide-adopted object detection frameworks. We in-troduce the best practices of data samplers, optimizers, and classifier designs to achieve higher performance on V3Det. 2) In the open-vocabulary setting, we benchmark recent rep-resentative methods on V3Det, shedding light on the chal-lengings of open-vocabulary object detections on a vast vo-cabulary of categories. Moreover, we show that pretraining on V3Det significantly boosts the class generalizability of detectors, demonstrating the solid benefits of a vast vocab-ulary dataset for open vocabulary algorithms.
In summary, we introduce V3Det: Vast Vocabulary
Visual Detection Dataset with 13,204 categories, hierarchi-cally organized with a category tree. To the best of our knowledge, V3Det is the first object detection dataset with more than ten thousand categories. Rich annotations of de-tection bounding boxes in 243k images, along with profes-sional category descriptions, ensure the diversity and ver-satility of the dataset. Taking advantage of the vast explo-ration space offered by V3Det, extensive benchmarks reveal new observations, practices, and insights for future research on vast and open vocabulary object detection. It has the po-tential to serve as a cornerstone dataset for developing more general visual perception systems. 2.
