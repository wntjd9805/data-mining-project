Abstract
Test on known lightness
Lightness adaptation is vital to the success of image processing to avoid unexpected visual deterioration, which covers multiple aspects, e.g., low-light image enhancement, image retouching, and inverse tone mapping. Existing methods typically work well on their trained lightness con-ditions but perform poorly in unknown ones due to their limited generalization ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel generalized lightness adaptation algo-rithm that extends conventional normalization techniques through a channel ﬁltering design, dubbed Channel Selec-tive Normalization (CSNorm). The proposed CSNorm pur-posely normalizes the statistics of lightness-relevant chan-nels and keeps other channels unchanged, so as to im-prove feature generalization and discrimination. To opti-mize CSNorm, we propose an alternating training strategy that effectively identiﬁes lightness-relevant channels. The model equipped with our CSNorm only needs to be trained on one lightness condition and can be well generalized to unknown lightness conditions. Experimental results on mul-tiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
CSNorm in enhancing the generalization ability for the ex-isting lightness adaptation methods. Code is available at https://github.com/mdyao/CSNorm. 1.

Introduction
Lightness adaptation is a vital step in image process-ing, encompassing tasks such as low-light image enhance-ment [27, 31], image retouching [29], and inverse tone map-ping [7]. These tasks have beneﬁted signiﬁcantly from the development of advanced neural network architectures. Al-though numerous powerful lightness adaptation methods have been proposed, the generalization problem [56, 46] for lightness adaptation still exists and is rarely explored.

The model equipped with our CSNorm can generalize well to other unknown lightness while keeping the performance on the known lightness. models to unknown lightness conditions is quite challeng-ing due to the brightness discrepancies between training and testing data [39, 52]. Existing lightness adaptation ap-proaches [31, 65, 59, 32, 1, 49, 7, 24] primarily focus on addressing the challenge of accurate image reconstruction.
However, they often underperform on wide-range scenes with other lightness conditions due to their over-ﬁtting to the training lightness component, leading to unsatisfactory visual effects (Fig. 1) and inadequate generalization in com-plex real-world scenarios.
An alternative way is constructing a larger mixed-lightness dataset including more lightness conditions, but it is impractical for many complicated cases and too time-consuming for cumbersome acquisition from diverse do-mains [47, 67]. Besides, existing models suffer from the drawback of inadequately encapsulating generalization and discrimination abilities, where the former is responsible for the performance on unknown lightness conditions and the latter mainly corresponds to the reconstruction characteris-1

In this paper, we focus on designing a mechanism that empowers existing lightness adaptation methods with the generalization ability to wide-range lightness scenes. The key challenge lies in obtaining the above generalization ability while keeping the discrimination ability. To achieve this goal, we introduce the normalization technique, which has the good property of extracting invariant representations from the given features [22], especially for lightness com-ponents [40, 17]. However, normalization is a double-edged sword due to its inevitable loss of information, which might degrade the reconstruction accuracy [40, 68]. Therefore, we explore normalizing particular channels that are highly sensitive to lightness changes while keeping other channels unchanged (Fig. 2). Such a design enhances the generaliza-tion ability and keeps the discrimination of features.
To this end, we propose a concept of Channel Selec-tion Normalization (CSNorm) to purposely select and nor-malize the lightness-relevant channels. CSNorm consists of two major parts: an instance-level lightness normaliza-tion module for eliminating lightness-relevant information and a differentiable gating module for adaptively selecting lightness-relevant channels. The gating module outputs a series of binary indicators to combine the normalized and original channels, which feasibly enhances the model’s gen-eralization capabilities and mitigates the information loss caused by normalization. The proposed CSNorm is simple, lightweight, and plug-and-play.
To identify lightness-relevant channels in CSNorm, we meticulously design an alternating training strategy. The network is alternately optimized with different inputs of two steps. Speciﬁcally, in the ﬁrst step, the network inputs the images to learn an essential ability for lightness adap-tation. In the second step, we slightly perturb the lightness of the above input image and solely optimize CSNorm with other parameters frozen. Since the only variable in the input images is the lightness condition, CSNorm can adaptively identify lightness-relevant channels and normalize them ac-cordingly, thereby exhibiting superior performance in terms of generalization and discrimination.
In summary, we make the following contributions.
• To our best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work that improves the generalization ability of lightness adaptation methods in wide-range lightness scenarios.
• We propose CSNorm, which selectively normalizes the lightness-relevant channels according to their sensitivity to lightness changes. The model equipped with our CSNorm can generalize well to unknown lightness conditions while keeping the reconstruction ability on known lightness con-ditions.
• An alternate training strategy is meticulously designed to effectively optimize CSNorm for identifying lightness-relevant channels.
• We conduct extensive experiments to validate the ad-vantage and versatility of CSNorm over existing lightness adaptation methods for improving their generalization in wide-range lightness scenarios. 2.
