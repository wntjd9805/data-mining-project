Recent advancements in neural rendering have paved the way for a future marked by the widespread distribu-tion of visual data through the sharing of Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF) model weights. However, while established techniques exist for embedding ownership or copyright in-formation within conventional visual data such as images and videos, the challenges posed by the emerging NeRF format have remained unaddressed. In this paper, we in-troduce StegaNeRF, an innovative approach for stegano-graphic information embedding within NeRF renderings.
We have meticulously developed an optimization frame-work that enables precise retrieval of hidden information from images generated by NeRF, while ensuring the origi-nal visual quality of the rendered images to remain intact.
Through rigorous experimentation, we assess the efﬁcacy of our methodology across various potential deployment sce-narios. Furthermore, we delve into the insights gleaned from our analysis. StegaNeRF represents an initial foray into the intriguing realm of infusing NeRF renderings with customizable, imperceptible, and recoverable information, all while minimizing any discernible impact on the rendered images.

Introduction
Implicit neural representation (INR) is an emerging con-cept where the network describes the data through its weights [14, 24, 40, 42, 45, 58, 65]. After training, the INR weights can then be used for content distribution, streaming, and even downstream inference tasks, all without sending or storing the original data. Arguably the most prominent INR is Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [42], where a network learns a continuous function mapping spatial coordinates to density and color. Due to its lightweight size and superb quality, NeRF has immense potential for 3D content repre-sentation in future vision and graphics applications.

Figure 1. We introduce the new problem of NeRF steganography: hiding information in NeRF renderings. Our proposed framework,
StegaNeRF, can embed and recover customized hidden informa-tion while preserving the original NeRF rendering quality.
While there is a plethora of work dedicated towards bet-ter quality [4,63,72,91], faster rendering [43,56,61,71,83], and sparse view reconstruction [10,11,44,57,80,81,85,88], in this paper, we look beyond the horizon and explore a new question: Can we achieve steganography with NeRF?
Established digital steganography method [12] focus on embedding hidden messages in 2D images. The recent growth of deep learning and social media platforms further gives rise to many practical use cases of image steganog-raphy. As countless images and videos are shared online and even used to train deep learning models, 2D steganogra-phy methods [2, 3] allow users and data providers to protect copyright, embed ownership, and prevent content abuse.
Now, with the ongoing advances in 3D representations powered by NeRF, we envision a future where people fre-quently share their captured 3D content online just as they are currently sharing 2D images and videos online. More-over, we are curious to explore the following research ques-tions: (cid:2) Injecting information into 2D images for copy-right or ownership identiﬁcation is common, but can we preserve such information when people share and render 3D scenes through NeRF? (cid:3) NeRF can represent large-scale real-world scenes with training images taken by different people, but can we preserve these multiple source identities in the NeRF renderings to reﬂect the collaborative efforts required to reconstruct these 3D scenes? (cid:4) Common image steganography methods embed either a hidden image or a message string into a given image, but can we allow differ-ent modalities of the hidden signal in NeRF steganography?
Driven by these questions, we formulate a framework to embed customizable, imperceptible, and recoverable in-formation in NeRF renderings without sacriﬁcing the vi-sual quality. Fig. 1 presents an overview of our proposed framework, dubbed StegaNeRF. Unlike the traditional im-age steganography that embeds hidden signals only into a speciﬁc source image, we wish to recover the same intended hidden signal from NeRF rendered at arbitrary viewpoints.
Despite many established works on 2D steganography and hidden watermarks for image and video [2, 3, 9, 25, 36, 64], naively applying 2D steganography on the NeRF training images is not practical, since the embedded infor-mation easily gets lost in the actual NeRF renderings. In contrast, our framework enables reliable extraction of the hidden signal from NeRF renderings. During NeRF train-ing, we jointly optimize a decoder network to extract hidden information from the NeRF renderings. To minimize the negative impact on the visual quality of NeRF, we identify weights with low impact on rendering and introduce a gra-dient masking strategy to steer the hidden steganographic information towards those low-importance weights. Exten-sive experimental results validate StegaNeRF balances be-tween the rendering quality of novel views and the high-ﬁdelity transmission of the concealed information.
StegaNeRF presents the ﬁrst exploration of hiding infor-mation in NeRF models for ownership identiﬁcation, and our contributions can be summarized as follows:
• We introduce the new problem of NeRF steganogra-phy and present the ﬁrst effort to embed customizable, imperceptible, and recoverable information in NeRF.
• We propose an adaptive gradient masking strategy to steer the injected hidden information towards the less important NeRF weights, balancing the objectives of steganography and rendering quality.
• We empirically validate the proposed framework on a diverse set of 3D scenes with different camera layouts and scene characteristics, obtaining high recovery ac-curacy without sacriﬁcing rendering quality.
• We explore various scenarios applying StegaNeRF for ownership identiﬁcation, with the additional support of multiple identities and multi-modal signals. 2.
