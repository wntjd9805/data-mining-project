Abstract
Gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) aided patient di-agnosis and prognosis analysis are promising directions in computational pathology. However, limited by expensive and time-consuming annotation costs, WSIs usually only have weak annotations, including 1) WSI-level Annotations (WA) and 2) Limited Patch-level Annotations (LPA). Cur-rently, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) often exploits WA, while LPA usually assign pseudo-labels for unlabeled data.
Intuitively, pseudo-labels can serve as a practical guide for
MIL, but the unreliable prediction caused by LPA inevitably introduce noise. Furthermore, WA-supervised MIL training inevitably suffers from the semantical unalignment between instances and bag-level labels. To address these prob-lems, we design a framework called Learning from Noisy
Pseudo Labels for promoting Multiple Instance Learning (LNPL-MIL), which considers both types of weak annota-tion. Specifically, for the LPA-trained weak classifier, we design a Super-Patch-based LNPL (SP-LNPL) method to reduce false positives in the noisy pseudo-labels and then select more accurate Top-K key instances. In MIL, we pro-pose a Transformer aware of instance Order and Distribu-tion (TOD-MIL) that strengthens instances correlation and weakens semantical unalignment in the bag. We validate our LNPL-MIL on Tumor Diagnosis and Survival Predic-tion, achieving state-of-the-art performance with at least 2.7%/2.9% AUC and 2.6%/2.3% C-Index improvement with the patches labeled for two scale. Ablation study and visu-alization analysis further verify the effectiveness. 1.
