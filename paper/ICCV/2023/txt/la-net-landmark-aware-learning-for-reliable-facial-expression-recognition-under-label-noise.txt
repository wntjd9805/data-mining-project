Abstract
Facial expression recognition (FER) remains a challeng-ing task due to the ambiguity of expressions. The derived noisy labels significantly harm the performance in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we present a new
FER model named Landmark-Aware Net (LA-Net), which leverages facial landmarks to mitigate the impact of label noise from two perspectives. Firstly, LA-Net uses land-mark information to suppress the uncertainty in expression space and constructs the label distribution of each sam-ple by neighborhood aggregation, which in turn improves the quality of training supervision. Secondly, the model in-corporates landmark information into expression represen-tations using the devised expression-landmark contrastive loss. The enhanced expression feature extractor can be less susceptible to label noise. Our method can be integrated with any deep neural network for better training supervi-sion without introducing extra inference costs. We conduct extensive experiments on both in-the-wild datasets and syn-thetic noisy datasets and demonstrate that LA-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance. 1.

Introduction
Facial expression recognition (FER) is a fundamental task in the computer vision community, as it holds signif-icance in various applications, such as human-computer in-teraction and fatigue driving detection. Given its wide ap-plicability, researchers have developed multiple FER mod-els in recent years [32, 20, 24]. Despite the progress made so far, FER remains challenging due to noisy labels. Specif-ically, individuals may interpret one expression differently, resulting in inconsistent annotations. Besides, facial expres-sions have inherent inter-class similarity, which further ex-acerbates the problem of label noise. Accordingly, mitigat-ing label noise has become one of the primary tasks in FER.
Mainstream noise-tolerant FER models can be divided
*Corresponding author into two groups: selecting clean samples and using la-bel distributions as auxiliary training targets. For exam-ple, SCN [39] estimates the uncertainty of each sample and corrects the mislabeled samples during training. Moreover,
DMUE [33] utilizes multiple learnable branches to estimate the label distribution of each sample. While these methods promote FER performance under label noise, they still en-counter some problems. Firstly, sample selection methods assume that the neural network will fit clean samples before overfitting noisy labels [1, 44], which can lead to confusion between hard samples and noisy samples. Secondly, label distributions calculated based solely on expression informa-tion can still be noisy, since corrupt labels will disrupt both class and feature spaces [23].
To address the above problems, this paper proposes a new noise-tolerant FER model, called Landmark-Aware
Net (LA-Net). The overview of LA-Net is plotted in Fig. 1.
LA-Net leverages facial landmark information to combat label noise based on the underlying assumption that ex-pressions with analogous landmark patterns probably be-long to the same emotion category. The model comprises two key modules: label distribution estimation (LDE) and expression-landmark contrastive loss (EL Loss).
LDE calculates the label distribution of each sample and uses it as an auxiliary supervision signal. Based on the as-sumption that expressions should have similar emotions to their neighbors in feature space, LDE identifies neighbors in both expression and landmark spaces for each sample.
The landmark information is utilized to correct the errors in the expression space. The module then learns pairwise con-tribution scores and performs neighborhood aggregation to obtain target label distributions. Furthermore, to mitigate the impact of batch division on online aggregation, the tar-get label distributions are summed over previous epochs us-ing exponential moving average (EMA).
EL Loss incorporates landmark information into expres-sion representations to develop a robust backbone that is less susceptible to label noise. The algorithm treats land-marks and expressions as two views of facial images and establishes interactions between them via supervised con-trastive learning (SCL) [18]. However, traditional SCL uses one-hot labels to select positive and negative pairs, thus per-forming poorly in the presence of label noise. Accordingly, our EL Loss designs a new pair selection strategy based on the label distributions to enable noise-tolerant SCL. Specif-ically, it first assigns pseudo-labels to confident images and takes the rest as unsupervised samples. The module then uses the expression and landmark features of the same im-ages, or images with the identical pseudo-label, as positive pairs and all other combinations as negative pairs.
The proposed modules are solely used during training and thus incur no extra costs in deployment. Overall, our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) We present a landmark-aware FER model, named
LA-Net, which leverages facial landmarks to alleviate the label noise issue. (2) The LDE module uses landmark information to cor-rect the errors in expression space and finds a set of neigh-bors to construct the label distribution of each sample. (3) EL Loss devises noise-tolerant supervised contrastive learning and strengthens the expression feature extractor via expression-landmark interactions. (4) LA-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-the-wild datasets and synthetic noisy datasets. 2.
