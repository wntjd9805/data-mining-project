Abstract
This paper presents a learning-based method for trans-parent surface estimation from a single view polarization image. Existing shape from polarization(SfP) methods have the difficulty in estimating transparent shape since the in-herent transmission interference heavily reduces the reli-ability of physics-based prior. To address this challenge, we propose the concept of physics-based prior confidence, which is inspired by the characteristic that the transmission component in the polarization image has more noise than reflection. The confidence is used to determine the contribu-tion of the interfered physics-based prior. Then, we build a network(TransSfP) with multi-branch architecture to avoid the destruction of relationships between different hierarchi-cal inputs. To train and test our method, we construct a dataset for transparent shape from polarization with paired polarization images and ground-truth normal maps. Exten-sive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the superior accuracy of our method. Our cdataset and code are publicly available at https://github.com/shaomq2187/TransSfP 1.

Introduction
Surface normals provide detailed 3D information about the surface of objects. However, estimating the high-quality surface normal of transparent objects is still an open chal-lenge. The complex rays interactions in transparent objects lead to the difficulty of standard 3D sensors in acquiring accurate surface information[23]. Besides, transparent ob-jects lack texture of their own, adopting instead the texture of the background, making the regular image-based meth-ods extremely ill-posed and can not produce satisfied esti-mation[12]. Compared with regular 3D and RGB sensors, the polarization sensor can acquire information about the surface normal from the reflected light on transparent sur-face. In particular, the commercial polarization image sen-sors[20] that appeared in recent years have made it possible to capture polarization images at a single shot, making the

Our method is capable of estimating the normal map of various transparent surface from a single view polarization image acquisition of polarization images as easy as conventional sensors. Hence, in this paper, we focus on estimating the surface normals of transparent objects from a single-view polarization image.
The key barrier to using polarization information to esti-mate the surface normals of transparent objects is the exis-tence of transmission interference. Fresnel specular reflec-tion model(will be described in Sec.3.2) is commonly used to solve the possible surface normals, i.e. the physics-based prior in SfP, from the observed polarization state. How-ever, due to the high transmittance of transparent objects, the specular reflection energy only accounts for about 4% of the incident light energy[26]. The interference transmit-ted from the background is superimposed on the observed polarization information, leading to the high estimation er-ror of the physics-based SfP methods.
Aiming at the problem that the reliability of the Fres-nel specular reflection model is reduced, we find that the polarization observation of the transmission component has more noise. This characteristic is helpful to distinguish the interfered areas and motivates us to propose the concept of physics-based prior confidence. The confidence indicates the reliability of the physics-based prior and hence serves as the weight of physics-based prior and polarization an-gle loss. The polarization angle loss is designed to force
our network to learn the prior knowledge defined by Fresnel specular reflection model. In addition, we notice that pre-vious learning-based methods[2, 5] directly concatenating physics-based prior and raw polarization images will de-stroy the relationship between different hierarchies and lead to a decline in the performance. Therefore, we build a net-work called TransSfP with multi-branch architecture to han-dle different hierarchical inputs. To demonstrate the perfor-mance of our method, we construct a dataset for transparent shape polarization, which consists of both real-world and synthetic collections. Benefiting from the above designs, our method can estimate normal maps of various transpar-ent surfacess with lower error as shown in Fig.1. We sum-marize our contributions as:
• We propose a novel learning-based method for trans-parent surface normal estimation from a single view polarization image.
• We contribute the first dataset for transparent shape from polarization, which consists of both real-world and synthetic collections.
• Technically, we introduce three novel designs for transparent SfP problem: the concept of physics-based prior confidence, a multi-branch architecture, and a self-supervised polarization angle loss. 2.
