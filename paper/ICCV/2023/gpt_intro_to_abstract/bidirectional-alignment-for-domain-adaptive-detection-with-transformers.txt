This paper addresses the problem of cross-domain object detection in computer vision applications. Cross-domain object detection refers to the ability of a detector trained on images from one domain to generalize well on images from a different domain. The paper introduces a Bidirectional Alignment for domain adaptive Detection with Transformers (BiADT) approach that effectively disentangles features into domain-invariant and domain-specific components, and performs bidirectional feature alignment. This is achieved by extending the transformer architecture with deformable-attention and self-attention components. Additionally, the paper proposes a domain embedding component to integrate domain-specific features. The BiADT approach is compared with state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark cross-domain datasets and demonstrates competitive performance. The paper highlights the contributions of integrating token-wise domain alignment in the transformer architecture, introducing a token-wise domain embedding, and achieving strong performance on cross-domain object detection tasks.
