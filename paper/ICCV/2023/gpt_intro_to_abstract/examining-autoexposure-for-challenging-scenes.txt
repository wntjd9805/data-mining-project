This paper focuses on auto exposure (AE) for scenes with challenging lighting conditions. AE is responsible for determining capture-time settings to ensure a properly exposed image. This paper specifically looks at aperture-priority AE, where the aperture and ISO are fixed. AE algorithms play a crucial role in choosing the appropriate shutter speed based on the captured image. However, existing AE algorithms, including those on commercial cameras, still struggle in challenging lighting environments. The primary factors that make scenes challenging for AE algorithms are high dynamic range and abrupt changes in lighting. While datasets exist for the former scenario, there are no complete 4D datasets that capture the latter scenario. Therefore, the authors have created a new 4D dataset consisting of nine scenes, each with 100 time steps and 40 exposures per time step. The dataset covers a range of challenging conditions, and a software platform has been developed to evaluate various AE algorithms. The results from the user study indicate that users preferred an AE algorithm based on a simple saliency method. The remaining sections of the paper detail the dataset construction, the API for AE algorithm testing, the different AE algorithms used, and the results of the user study.
