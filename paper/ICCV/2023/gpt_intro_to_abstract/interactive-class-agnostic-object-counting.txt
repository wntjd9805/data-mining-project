The need for counting objects in images is essential in various applications, and significant advancements have been made in both class-specific and class-agnostic counting. However, validating visual counting results is challenging, and mistakes can occur without a mechanism for correction. In order to enhance the practicality of visual counting methods, this paper proposes an interactive framework that allows human users to detect and correct errors in the counting results. The framework aims to provide intuitive and verifiable results and incorporate feedback mechanisms for error correction. The development of this framework faces challenges in providing an intuitive visualizer for counting results, designing suitable user interaction methods for feedback, and developing an effective adaptation scheme. To address these challenges, the paper proposes a novel segmentation method for generating interpretable density maps, a user interaction method that requires minimal user effort, and an adaptation scheme based on range constraints. The paper primarily focuses on class-agnostic counting and demonstrates the framework's effectiveness through experiments on various benchmarks. However, the framework can be extended to category-specific counting. The main contributions of the paper include the novel segmentation method, the innovative user feedback scheme, and the effective adaptation approach. Overall, the paper presents a framework that improves the accuracy and practicality of visual counting.
