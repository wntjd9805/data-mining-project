The goal of this research is to develop a technique for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), which involves training a model using only image-level labels instead of pixel-level labels. The focus of this paper is on studying WSSS under image-level labels, which is a challenging scenario that has gained attention in recent years. The first step in WSSS is seed area generation, where an initial pseudo mask is created based on the image-level labels. The Class Activation Map (CAM) is commonly used for seed area generation, but it has limitations when applied to both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers. In this paper, a new paradigm called Unified optimization paradigm for Seed Area GEneration (USAGE) is proposed, which consists of a generation loss and a regularization loss. The generation loss measures the fitness between the contribution of a seed area and the classification result, while the regularization loss ensures consistency between seed areas generated from different views. A self-adaptive network adjustment strategy is also introduced to generate different views. Experimental results demonstrate that USAGE improves the quality of seed areas for both CNNs and Transformers. Moreover, the instantiation of USAGE for Transformers achieves state-of-the-art WSSS results on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets.
