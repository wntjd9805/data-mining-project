Face forgery technology has advanced and realistic forgery faces are sometimes misused to disguise identities, which has led to serious social problems. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown good performance in detecting face forgery. However, these networks may not generalize well to unknown forgery methods. To address this issue, researchers have studied common artifacts of various forgeries and used data augmentation to generate more training data. They have also explored better discriminative features and introduced attention mechanisms, local relation, and frequency information to capture forgery traces. However, current methods treat different forgery domains as a unified category without distinction, resulting in learned features that still contain forgery-irrelevant information. This may limit the generalization of the model. In this paper, we propose a novel guide-space (GS) based framework to increase discrimination between different forgery domains. By learning the differences between domains and the consistency within each domain, the model can focus more on forgery traces and reduce the correlation between different domains in terms of forgery-irrelevant information. We introduce a decision boundary manifold adjustment module (A-DBM) to better align the features with the guide-space. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art generalization in multiple cross-domain settings.
