This paper introduces ARNOLD, a new benchmark for grounding task instructions to precise robot actions and object states in realistic natural scenes. The authors address the challenges of language-grounded task learning by leveraging a highly accurate physics simulation engine to create eight challenging robot manipulation tasks. Each task includes continuous robot motion, friction-based grasping, and a variety of object state manipulations. The authors provide detailed task descriptions in human language form and plentiful demonstrations for robot learning. They also evaluate the generalization ability of agents to unseen scenarios using a collection of distinct objects and scenes. Through extensive experiments and analyses, the authors demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art language-conditioned manipulation models in promoting future research on language-grounded task learning. Overall, ARNOLD offers a realistic 3D interactive environment and a systematic benchmark for advancing precise robot manipulation.
