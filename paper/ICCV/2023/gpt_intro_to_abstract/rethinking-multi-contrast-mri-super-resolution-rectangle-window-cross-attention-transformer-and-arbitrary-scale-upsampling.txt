Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a valuable clinical imaging technique for visualizing tissue structure and function. However, the acquisition of high-resolution (HR) MR images is time-consuming and can cause discomfort to patients. Image super-resolution (SR) techniques have been developed to generate HR images from low-resolution (LR) MR images obtained by MRI. Traditional SR methods have limitations in terms of reconstruction performance, especially at high upsampling scales. Recent deep learning-based methods have shown promise in improving the quality of MR images, but they often overlook the complementary information present in multi-contrast MR images. Utilizing multi-contrast images can enhance the reconstruction quality of the images. However, existing multi-contrast methods have limitations in terms of addressing arbitrary-scale upsampling and establishing longer-range dependencies among different windows. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel network called McASSR for multi-contrast MRI arbitrary-scale SR. The network incorporates a rectangle-window cross-attention transformer for feature extraction, which effectively establishes longer-range dependencies and captures more similar features. Additionally, a reference-aware implicit attention upsampling module is introduced, which achieves arbitrary-scale super-resolution and fuses complementary information from the reference and target images. The contributions of this work include the development of the first network for arbitrary-scale upsampling in multi-contrast MRI tasks, the design of a rectangle-window cross-attention transformer to increase the receptive field, the proposal of reference-aware implicit attention for multi-contrast MRI SR, and the demonstration of the effectiveness of McASSR on various benchmark datasets. The results indicate the potential of McASSR for clinical applications in enhancing the quality of MR images.
