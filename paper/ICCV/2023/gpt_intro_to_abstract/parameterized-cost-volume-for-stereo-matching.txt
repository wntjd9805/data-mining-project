Stereo matching is a widely studied problem in computer vision, aiming to find pixel-wise correspondences between images. Existing methods have been successful in matching within a small predefined disparity range, but are time and memory consuming for larger ranges. This limitation hinders the application of stereo matching in real-world scenarios, particularly in high-resolution images. Previous methods address this challenge using dynamic cost volumes, which sample disparity candidates in a local disparity space. However, these methods require numerous iterations to converge to the ground truth. In this paper, we propose a new approach that encodes the entire disparity space using a parameterized cost volume based on a multi-Gaussian distribution. This allows for a global view of the disparity space, enabling fast convergence to the ground truth. We formulate the computation of the parameters as an optimization problem and solve it through iterative gradient descent updates. Additionally, we design an uncertainty-aware refinement module to correct the final results. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves real-time performance and state-of-the-art accuracy, while requiring fewer iterations and maintaining fixed memory costs compared to other methods.
