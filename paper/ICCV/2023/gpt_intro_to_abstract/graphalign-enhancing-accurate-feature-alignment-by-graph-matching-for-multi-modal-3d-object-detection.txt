In this paper, we address the challenge of 3D object detection in autonomous driving by proposing a novel feature alignment strategy called GraphAlign. 3D object detection relies on deep learning and accurately identifying and locating objects in 3D space. However, limitations of individual sensor modalities, such as the lack of semantic information in LiDAR point cloud and the lack of depth information in camera images, pose challenges for accurate detection. To leverage the complementary advantages of both modalities, multi-modal 3D object detection has been proposed. However, the fusion of heterogeneous modal features remains a difficulty. Current methods either rely on deterministic correspondences or attention-based solutions for feature fusion, but these approaches suffer from misalignment errors or high computational cost. To overcome these challenges, we present GraphAlign, a graph matching-based feature alignment strategy for multi-modal 3D object detection. GraphAlign consists of two key modules: Graph Feature Alignment (GFA) and Self-Attention Feature Alignment (SAFA). The GFA module divides the point cloud space into subspaces and generates the K nearest neighbor features for each point cloud, transforming local neighborhood information into image neighborhood information. The SAFA module employs a self-attention mechanism to enhance the weights of important relationships in the fused features. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We propose GraphAlign to address the misalignment issue in multi-modal 3D object detection. (2) We introduce GFA and SAFA modules to achieve accurate alignment of image and point cloud features, enhancing feature alignment between modalities and improving detection accuracy. (3) We conduct experiments on the KITTI and nuScenes benchmarks, demonstrating the efficacy of GraphAlign in boosting point cloud detection accuracy, particularly for long-range object detection. Overall, our proposed framework offers a promising solution for accurate and efficient multi-modal 3D object detection in autonomous driving scenarios.
