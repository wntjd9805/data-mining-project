The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the importance of structured reconstruction models in facilitating various vision tasks, such as feature matching, 3D modeling, and 3D scene understanding. The authors highlight the two steps involved in shape topology recovery: geometric primitive detection and graph inference based on these primitives. They mention that previous researchers have used heatmaps of corners and edges for structure reasoning, but incorrect topology inference remains a problem due to the lack of holistic geometric clues in low-level features. The authors propose a frequency-domain feature learning strategy called F-Learn, which effectively fuses geometric primitives in a holistic manner, leading to improved performance in structured reconstruction. The main contributions of the paper include exploring the difference in learning tendency between frequency- and space-domain convolutions, proposing the F-Learn strategy, and showing improved performance in structured reconstruction through experiments on vectorizing world buildings.
