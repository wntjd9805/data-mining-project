Accurately estimating hand poses in real-world scenarios is challenging due to various factors such as object occlusion, self-occlusion, motion blur, and low camera exposure. Existing approaches leverage temporal information through self-attention mechanisms but suffer from contamination and inaccurate output caused by heavy occlusion or blurring. Finger tips, being located at the periphery of the hand, are especially challenging to estimate accurately due to occlusion and complex motion patterns. In this paper, we propose Deformer, a dynamic fusion transformer that leverages neighboring frames to learn hand deformations and assemble multiple wrapped hand poses for robust estimation in the current frame. Deformer models the temporal correlations between frames and automatically selects frames to focus on. To address the error imbalance issue, we introduce a novel loss function called maxMSE, which emphasizes the importance of difficult-to-estimate vertices and provides a more balanced optimization. Our approach extracts frame-wise hand features using a shared CNN, reasons the relationships between hand parts using a spatial transformer, attends to frame-wise hand features using a temporal transformer, and regresses the hand pose parameters using a shared MLP. To ensure consistency of hand shape over time, we predict a global hand shape representation using cross-attention. To handle occlusion and blurring, we introduce a Dynamic Fusion Module that deforms the hand pose based on neighboring frames with clear hand visibility. The deformed hand poses from each timestamp are synthesized into the final output with confidence scores. Additionally, our maxMSE loss function focuses on critical hand parts, such as fingertips, leading to improved overall performance. Experimental results on two large-scale hand pose estimation video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and is more robust to occlusions. Our contributions include the Deformer architecture for robust hand pose estimation, the dynamic fusion module for handling occluded or blurred frames, and the maxMSE loss function that emphasizes critical hand parts.
