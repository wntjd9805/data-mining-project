3D detection from point clouds is a fundamental research area in computer science with applications in intelligent robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous driving. State-of-the-art 3D detectors still suffer from performance degradation when facing the domain shift problem, where training and testing data come from different environments. Fine-tuning detectors with target domain data can alleviate this issue, but manual annotation of point cloud scenes is expensive. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for LiDAR-based 3D detection is necessary to overcome these challenges. While UDA methods for image-based detection have been proposed, directly applying them to point cloud detection is insufficient. Existing literature on UDA for LiDAR-based 3D detection is limited. This paper introduces a novel UDA framework called Geometry-aware Prototype Alignment (GPA-3D) that considers the problem of distributional discrepancy in feature space. GPA-3D incorporates geometric associations into feature alignment, reducing the discrepancy and facilitating adaptation. The framework includes noise sample suppression and instance replacement augmentation techniques to enhance pseudo-labels. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that GPA-3D outperforms state-of-the-art methods in different adaptation scenarios, making it a flexible solution for point cloud detectors.
