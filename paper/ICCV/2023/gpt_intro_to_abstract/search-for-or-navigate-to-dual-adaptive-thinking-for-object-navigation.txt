This paper introduces the challenging task of object navigation in unknown environments using first-person visual observations. Previous research has incorporated scene prior knowledge into navigation networks to address various issues, but these methods mainly focus on the "search for" phase and neglect the "navigate to" phase. Experiments show that current state-of-the-art methods have low navigation efficiency in the "navigate to" phase compared to humans. To overcome this limitation, the paper proposes a dual adaptive thinking (DAT) method that separates the agent's thinking modes into search thinking and navigation thinking. The agent adaptively adjusts the dominance of these thinking methods in an end-to-end network based on the navigation progress. The paper also develops specific designs for the search thinking network and navigation thinking network, incorporating object association and attention allocation strategies for efficient navigation. This approach aims to integrate the task decoupling concept from modular methods into end-to-end methods to improve object navigation efficiency.
