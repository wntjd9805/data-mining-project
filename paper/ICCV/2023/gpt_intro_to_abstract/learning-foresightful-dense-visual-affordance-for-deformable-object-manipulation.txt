Deformable objects, such as ropes and fabrics, present unique challenges for manipulation due to their complex dynamics and high-dimensional degrees of freedom. Unlike tasks for rigid or articulated objects that can be accomplished in a few steps, manipulating deformable objects often requires multiple steps. In this paper, we propose a method for deformable object manipulation that incorporates dense visual affordance and foresightful estimation of future actions. We leverage the concept of dense affordance, which has shown effectiveness in tasks like grasping and manipulating articulated objects. However, we extend its application to deformable objects and introduce foresightfulness to avoid local optima. Inspired by Dynamic Programming and Q-Learning, we estimate the 'value' of states for future actions to coordinate and smoothly complete multi-step tasks. We present a framework for learning dense visual affordance that is adaptable to various tasks and includes novel designs for stable training and efficient data collection. Our experiments on benchmark tasks and real-world scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and superior performance of our proposed method for manipulating deformable objects.
