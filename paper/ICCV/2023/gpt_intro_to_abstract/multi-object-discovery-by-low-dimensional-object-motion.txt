This paper addresses the problem of unsupervised multi-object discovery in computer vision. While previous methods have focused on separating foreground objects from the background, this work proposes a novel approach that incorporates both geometry and object motion to improve the segmentation of multiple objects without supervision. The existing methods fail to consider the underlying 3D geometry that creates the observed motion. The paper also highlights the limitations of using sparse depth supervision, which is not typically available in common video datasets. Instead, the authors propose using optical flow to obtain motion cues for grouping and training on synthetic data to bridge the domain gap. The paper discusses previous work that utilizes motion for supervision during training and proposes a method that models pixel-wise geometry to remove ambiguity in reconstructing flow from a single image. By predicting pixel-wise depth, the approach addresses the mutual occlusion problem and provides a more expressive power in explaining the observed motion. The paper also references recent work that shows the motion resides in a low-dimensional subspace and can be used to supervise depth prediction. The proposed method is evaluated on synthetic datasets and real-world videos, demonstrating superior performance compared to previous work and achieving state-of-the-art results in segmentation and depth prediction tasks.
