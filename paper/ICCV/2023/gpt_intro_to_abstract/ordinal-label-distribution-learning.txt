This paper introduces a new paradigm called ordinal label distribution learning (OLDL) in the field of machine learning. Unlike traditional single-label or multi-label learning, OLDL focuses on capturing the sequential patterns and relative importance of labels in a dataset. The paper proposes three approaches to model the sequential patterns: spatial order, semantic order, and temporal order. These approaches are then used to derive three new order-sensitive metrics (MCAD, MQF D, and MCJS) to assess the prediction results in OLDL tasks. The paper also presents comprehensive experiments on five datasets from four vision tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed OLDL paradigm. The results show that the new paradigm and associated metrics outperform existing approaches in label distribution learning.
