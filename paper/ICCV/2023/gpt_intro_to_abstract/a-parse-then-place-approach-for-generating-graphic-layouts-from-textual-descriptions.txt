This paper introduces the concept of Text-to-Layout, a method that uses natural language descriptions as guidance to create graphic layouts. The authors highlight the challenges of this task, including implicit, combined, and incomplete constraints, as well as the scarcity of labeled data. They propose a two-stage approach called parse-then-place, where the parse stage converts text into an intermediate representation (IR) that captures layout constraints, and the place stage generates layouts based on the constraints in the IR. The authors present a Transformer-based layout generation model and evaluate their approach on two datasets, Web5K and RICO2.5K, showing significant improvements over baseline approaches in terms of perceptual quality and consistency. A user study further confirms the effectiveness of their approach.
