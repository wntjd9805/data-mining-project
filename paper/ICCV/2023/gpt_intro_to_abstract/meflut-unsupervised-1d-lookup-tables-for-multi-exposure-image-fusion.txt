In this paper, we address the limitations of capturing images with wide dynamic ranges using commercial imaging products. High dynamic range (HDR) imaging techniques, such as multi-exposure image fusion (MEF), have been proposed as a solution to overcome these limitations. However, existing MEF methods suffer from robustness issues when applied to modified conditions. Inspired by the success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in computer vision, some deep learning-based approaches have been proposed to improve MEF. However, these methods do not consider real-world deployment and struggle to balance speed and quality. To address these challenges, we propose a method called MEFLUT that achieves higher quality and efficiency simultaneously. MEFLUT consists of two parts: a network based on multi-dimensional attention mechanism and a simplified model using 1D LUTs (Look-Up Tables) for fusion weight encoding. Our method outperforms existing methods in terms of image detail preservation and running speed. We also introduce a new dataset consisting of 960 multi-exposure image sequences captured by mobile phones, which includes ground truth samples for quantitative evaluation. Our contributions include the proposal of MEFLUT, the demonstration of the benefits of LUTs for MEF, the introduction of a new network structure with attention modules, and the release of a new dataset for MEF research.
