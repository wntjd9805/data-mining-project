Deep learning has achieved great success in various computer vision applications, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, and human pose estimation. However, there has been a recent shift towards dealing with massive 3D point clouds due to the increased availability of such data in robotics, autonomous driving, and urban modeling. The majority of current work on 3D point cloud processing focuses on tasks like 3D shape classification, object detection and tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation. To enable rapid algorithm advancement, numerous datasets have been established for training and evaluating deep learning algorithms. While supervised learning methods heavily rely on labeled data, the expensive cost of obtaining labeled data has led to increased attention on self-supervised learning methods that learn representations from unlabeled data. These self-supervised learning methods have achieved top performance on 2D image classification benchmarks and are being adapted for 3D point clouds. However, current deep learning methods for urban modeling are limited to small or synthetic datasets. To address this, we introduce an urban-scale dataset for 3D roof modeling from aerial LiDAR point clouds. This dataset covers 16 cities in Estonia and includes millions of LiDAR point clouds and thousands of building models in mesh and wireframe formats. Mesh models are made up of small discrete cells, while wireframe models retain only the outlines of component polygons. Wireframe models are particularly suitable for representing polyhedral objects like buildings. In addition to the dataset, we provide two new baselines for supervised and self-supervised learning for 3D roof modeling and evaluate various supervised and self-supervised pipelines. Our contributions include the first and largest urban-scale building modeling dataset, the evaluation of deep and handcrafted feature-based methods, and the establishment of new baselines and evaluation metrics. Moreover, we are the first to propose and adopt self-supervised pre-training methods for 3D building reconstruction.
