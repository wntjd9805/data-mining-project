Abstract:In this paper, we address the problem of reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) using multiple reference images. While previous RefSR methods have focused on using a single reference image for training, there is often the availability of multiple reference images for testing or practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a large-scale, multi-reference RefSR dataset called LMR, which consists of 112,142 groups of 300Ã—300 training images, each group containing 5 reference images of different similarity levels. Additionally, we propose a new RefSR baseline method called MRefSR, which incorporates a Multi-Reference Attention Module (MAM) for feature fusion from an arbitrary number of reference images and a Spatial Aware Filtering Module (SAFM) for fused feature selection. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LMR and the potential of multi-reference RefSR methods, achieving significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Overall, this work contributes the first multi-reference RefSR dataset, provides a baseline RefSR method for multiple reference RefSR, and facilitates the development of the RefSR research field.
