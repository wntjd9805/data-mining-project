This paper introduces the problem of domain shift in 3D point cloud data and the need for unsupervised domain adaptation methods to overcome this challenge. It explores the value of different types of knowledge transfer and suggests two design philosophies for a point cloud-specific domain adaptation framework. The authors propose a novel adapter-based approach called Point Cloud Adapter (PC-Adapter) that efficiently learns feature transformation to adapt local spatial structures of the target domain while preserving the global geometry knowledge from the source domain. The PC-Adapter consists of a global shape-aware adapter and a locality-aware adapter, both updated using target point clouds. The paper also presents a pseudo-label correction strategy to address label distribution bias in selecting pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the PC-Adapter outperforms existing methods, even when combined with auxiliary self-supervised learning tasks.
