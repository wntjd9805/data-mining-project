The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the recent improvements in end-to-end driving approaches on the CARLA leaderboard and the lack of understanding regarding the reasons behind their success. The authors highlight the strong performance of methods trained with Imitation Learning (IL) and their ability to recover from the compounding error problem. The authors also discuss the use of target points (TPs) as conditioning signals in these methods and compare them to previous methods that used discrete navigation commands. The introduction further explores the issues of target point shortcuts and waypoint ambiguity in current state-of-the-art (SotA) models and proposes a transformer decoder and path-based outputs as potential solutions. The paper presents the TransFuser++ (TF++) model, which outperforms previous models on benchmark tests. The contributions of the paper include showcasing the shortcut learning of target point conditioned models, highlighting the ambiguity of waypoint output representation, and introducing the TF++ model as a new SotA. The paper concludes by providing a link to access the code, data, and models used in the study.
