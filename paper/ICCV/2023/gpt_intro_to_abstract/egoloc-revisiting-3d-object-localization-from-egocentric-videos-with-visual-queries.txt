This paper introduces the concept of Episodic Memory, which is the ability of the human mind to remember past events. The paper focuses on the task of Visual Queries with 3D Localization (VQ3D) from egocentric videos, where the goal is to localize the last time a specific object was seen in a video and determine its 3D displacement vector. The paper proposes a pipeline that combines 3D multiview geometry with 2D object retrieval to improve 3D scene understanding. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in the VQ3D task. The paper also discusses the Simulation-2-Real gap in camera pose estimation and performs an empirical analysis of different components and configurations in the VQ3D pipeline. Overall, this paper presents a thorough study of the VQ3D task and provides insights for future research in this area.
