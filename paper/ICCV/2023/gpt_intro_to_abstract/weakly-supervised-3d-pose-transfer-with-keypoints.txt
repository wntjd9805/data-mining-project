3D pose transfer is an important research topic in computer vision with wide applications in augmented/virtual reality, movie making, gaming, and metaverse. Significant progress has been made using deep learning-based methods, but the lack of paired training data makes it a challenging task. Existing works generate synthetic data using models like SMPL and SMAL, but these have biases and cannot adapt well to real 3D meshes. Unsupervised approaches that learn shape and pose embeddings implicitly have shown promise but are limited to meshes with the same topology and do not fully disentangle shape and pose information. To address these limitations, we propose a weakly-supervised 3D pose transfer model with keypoints. Our method only requires supervision on keypoints instead of ground truth deformed mesh. We detect keypoints on both source and target meshes, compute transformation matrices, and propagate the transformations to all vertices of the source mesh using differentiable Scalable Inverse and Forward Kinematics (IK/FK) functions and Linear Blending Skin (LBS) motion propagation. We also design a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based pseudo label to supervise the skinning weights. Our approach achieves accurate 3D pose transfer without using ground truth paired data. It is topology-agnostic and can be applied to meshes with large shape variations and different topologies. We propose a cycle reconstruction that enforces pose transfer from the target to the source mesh and includes shape regularizers for consistency. We evaluate our method on several datasets and outperform existing unsupervised approaches and achieve comparable performance with fully-supervised approaches. Our contributions include a new 3D pose transfer framework for training data without ground truth supervision, the first keypoint-based data-driven method for 3D pose transfer that achieves better shape and pose disentanglement with IK/FK, a topology-agnostic approach applicable to different topologies, and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches on FAUST dataset and supervised approaches on Mixamo dataset.
