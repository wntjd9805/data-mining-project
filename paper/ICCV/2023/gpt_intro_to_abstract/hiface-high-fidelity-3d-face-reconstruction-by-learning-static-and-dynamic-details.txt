This paper introduces HiFace, a method for reconstructing high-fidelity 3D faces from a single image. The authors discuss the potential applications of 3D face reconstruction, such as face recognition, face animation, and virtual reality. They highlight the limitations of previous techniques in capturing fine details and distinguishing between static and dynamic factors. To address these issues, HiFace explicitly models static and dynamic details using a displacement basis and regression coefficients. The authors propose novel loss functions to simultaneously learn coarse shape and fine details from synthetic and real-world datasets. They demonstrate that HiFace achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and is compatible with optimization-based methods. The contributions of this paper include the explicit modeling of static and dynamic details, the introduction of novel loss functions, and significant performance gains in 3D face reconstruction. The authors also show that HiFace is capable of transferring expressions and details between different faces for face animation.
