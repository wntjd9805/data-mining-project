This study introduces X-VoE, a comprehensive benchmark dataset designed to assess and push the limits of AI agents' intuitive physics comprehension. The dataset covers four distinct scenarios, each with predictive, hypothetical, and explicative setups, allowing for a more comprehensive assessment of intuitive physics understanding. The Violation of Expectation (VoE) paradigm, widely used in psychological studies, is adopted to evaluate AI agents' intuitive physics comprehension. Existing works have primarily focused on predictive abilities, neglecting the explanatory component. Motivated by this, X-VoE incorporates explanation within VoE and introduces the eXplanation-based Physics Learner (XPL) model to emulate the explanation-based VoE process. The XPL model includes perception, reasoning, and dynamic learning modules to enhance intuitive physics understanding. Experimental results demonstrate that XPL outperforms other baselines and provides insights into hidden factors. This work contributes to advancing AI agents' intuitive physics comprehension and understanding.
