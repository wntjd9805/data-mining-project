Event-based cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that react to moving edges in a scene with high temporal resolution and minimal motion blur. These characteristics make events suitable for accurate relative motion estimation, especially in challenging motion and lighting conditions where standard cameras often struggle. However, estimating motion from event measurements is a difficult task as motion cues need to be inferred from the complex spatio-temporal structures formed by events. This paper introduces a geometric, deterministic solution to the problem of relative motion estimation using event-based cameras. The paper focuses on line features as a possible alternative to assist in motion estimation and introduces a novel feature extractor that relies on a geometrical model of line-generated manifolds. The paper presents a minimal parametrization of the manifolds and proposes a 5-point solver for estimating the manifold parameters. The paper also demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method through evaluation on simulated data and real-world examples. The results show that the proposed method consistently achieves a higher success rate in estimating linear velocity compared to existing solvers. Overall, this paper contributes to a better understanding of the geometry of event-based cameras and provides a reliable solution for motion estimation using these sensors.
