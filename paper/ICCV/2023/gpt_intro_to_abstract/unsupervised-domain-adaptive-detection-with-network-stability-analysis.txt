Deep neural networks have greatly advanced object detection in recent years. However, these detectors often fail when applied to images from new target domains. Collecting a new dataset for each target domain is labor-intensive and not feasible for all possible target domains. To address this issue, researchers have explored unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) detection, which aims to transfer knowledge from an annotated source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Existing UDA detection approaches can be classified into three families: aligning feature distributions, self-training, and teacher-student models. However, these approaches have limitations such as the requirement of both source and target datasets, vulnerability to local misalignment, and limited utilization of valuable information among samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for UDA detection called Network Stability Analysis (NSA). We observe that attribute changes and style variations are the major causes of domain differences. We utilize the concept of stability in control theory and analyze the influence of various disturbances on internal features and external predictions. We consider three types of disturbances: Heavy and Light Image-level Disturbances (HID and LID), and Instance-level Disturbance (InsD). For each type of disturbance, NSA performs external consistency analysis (ECA) or internal consistency analysis (ICA) using teacher-student models. The NSA framework is integrated into the Faster R-CNN detector and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark datasets.Our contributions include proposing the NSA framework for domain adaptive detection, introducing ECA and ICA for NSA, and integrating NSA for different disturbances into existing detectors to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Overall, our approach shows the potential of NSA for domain adaptive detection and can be applied to various detection frameworks.
