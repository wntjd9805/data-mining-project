Humans have the ability to continuously learn and retain previous experiences in an ever-changing environment. However, deep neural networks have been shown to suffer from catastrophic forgetting. Previous works in continual learning have focused on idealistic and simplified settings, where static images are presented in a sequence. However, these settings deviate from the real-world scenario of online continual learning in video streams. In this paper, we introduce the problem of Label-Efficient Online Continual Object Detection (LEOCOD), which addresses the challenges of training models strictly online and minimizing the need for extensive human labeling in object detection on videos. We propose a plug-and-play module called Efficient-CLS, inspired by the theory of Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) in human brains. Our method consistently outperforms existing CL models on two real-world video datasets, OAK and EgoObjects, with only 25% labeled data. Our contributions include the introduction of LEOCOD as a challenging problem, the proposal of Efficient-CLS for efficient and effective learning, and benchmarking of existing methods on LEOCOD.
