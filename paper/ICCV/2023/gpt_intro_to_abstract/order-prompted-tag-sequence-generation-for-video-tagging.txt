Video tagging is an important task in the field of computer vision, as it allows for efficient organization and search of videos on various platforms. However, the current methods for video tagging are limited in their ability to handle the characteristics of video tags, such as their abundance and disordered nature. In this paper, we propose a novel generative model called OP-TSG that addresses these challenges.OP-TSG is a sequence generation model that incorporates prompts and a word-based generation strategy to tackle the difficulties posed by video tags. The model includes a Video-Title Multimodal Hybrid Encoding module, which integrates visual and textual information to create a unified representation of a video. It also features an Order-prompted Tag Sequence Decoding module, which utilizes prompts to guide the generation of tag sequences.One of the key advantages of OP-TSG is its improved tag dependency modeling. By decoupling the generation order of tags using order prompts, the model is able to focus on capturing the dependencies between tags, thereby alleviating the long tail problem often faced in video tagging. Additionally, OP-TSG enables the generation of novel tags by leveraging word-based generative modeling and pre-training.To evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of our method, we establish two benchmarks: the Chinese video tagging benchmark CREATE-tagging and the English image tagging benchmark Pexel-tagging. These benchmarks contain large datasets of videos and images, respectively, and feature various performance metrics to assess the model's performance at the tag and video levels.Our contributions in this work include a comprehensive analysis of the video tagging task and its distinctions from traditional multi-label classification and video captioning tasks. We also propose the order-prompted tag sequence generation approach and develop benchmarks for evaluation. The results of our experiments demonstrate that OP-TSG outperforms existing methods in both benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in automatic video tagging.
