Face recognition (FR) is a widely used biometric technology, with applications such as logical access control to portable devices. The recent advancement in deep learning and novel margin-penalty based softmax losses have led to high accuracies in FR. However, the availability and use of large-scale FR training databases collected without proper consent raises legal and ethical concerns. As a solution, synthetic data has emerged as an alternative to authentic databases for FR training, driven by Deep Generative Models (DGMs) such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Previous works have shown degradation in verification accuracies for synthetic data training compared to authentic data training. In this paper, we propose a new approach called IDiff-Face that leverages a low-dimensional latent space of autoencoders and injects identity conditions through Cross-Attention (CA) mechanism, along with a Contextual Partial Dropout (CPD) technique to introduce realistic variations. Our synthetic-based FR achieved an average accuracy of 88.20%, outperforming previous synthetic-based FRs and approaching the performance of FR trained on authentic data. Additionally, our model outperformed human-level performance in face verification.
