This paper addresses the challenges of segmenting transparent objects, such as glass, in computer vision tasks. Traditional learning-based solutions that rely on RGB textures often fail to adequately capture the illumination and view-dependent features of glass. Recent advances have explored using richer modalities such as light fields and polarization for more robust segmentation. This paper introduces a Polarization Video Glass Segmentation network (PGVS-Net) that leverages multi-view polarimetric features for propagating an initial glass segmentation mask over an RGB-P video sequence. The network incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Memory network (STM) variation, a Polarization-Guide Integration module (PGI), and a Polarization Temporal Forward module (PTF) for spectral consistency. Cross-modal and cross-temporal attention (CMTA) is used to integrate multimodal features and temporal representations. The paper also introduces a large-scale video glass segmentation dataset, PGV-117, containing annotated frames and masks. The proposed PGVS-Net outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively in glass segmentation.
