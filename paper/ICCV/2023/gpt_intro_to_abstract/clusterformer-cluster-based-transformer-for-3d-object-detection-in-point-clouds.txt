LiDAR 3D object detection using point clouds is a challenging task due to the unstructured and sparse nature of the data. Traditional approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), struggle to effectively process point cloud data. Recent research has shown the potential of using the transformer architecture, originally designed for natural language processing tasks, in processing point cloud data. This paper introduces a novel query-based detector called Clusterformer that leverages the transformer structure for outdoor 3D object detection. The proposed method utilizes clusters of non-empty voxels within the point cloud data and encodes them as initial queries for the transformer. This allows for accurate localization information from the 3D space. Additionally, an intra-cluster cross-attention mechanism is introduced to enhance the interaction between the queries and grouped voxel features, focusing on areas of interest. Experimental results on the Waymo Open Dataset and KITTI dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the Clusterformer, showcasing its effectiveness in outdoor 3D object detection.
