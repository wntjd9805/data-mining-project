Abstract:Multi-person keypoint detection is an important task in computer vision, with applications in sports, entertainment, and surveillance. However, the manual annotation of keypoints in large datasets can be time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we propose Click-Pose, a novel framework that incorporates pose error modeling and an interactive human-feedback loop to improve the efficiency and accuracy of keypoint annotation. We demonstrate that Click-Pose outperforms existing models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end keypoint detection. Moreover, Click-Pose significantly reduces the annotation efforts and time costs, making it a valuable tool for various annotation scenarios. Our contributions include the introduction of interactive keypoint detection as a new task and the validation of Click-Pose through extensive experiments. This work has the potential to inspire further research in related fields.
