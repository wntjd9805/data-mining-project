In the field of computer science, detecting shadows poses a significant challenge due to their lack of specific shapes, colors, or textures, and their subtle intensity differences compared to the surrounding areas. However, with the advancements in deep learning, several works have made significant progress in shadow detection by proposing new network architectures and training the networks on datasets with labeled shadow regions. Unfortunately, existing datasets may suffer from inaccurate labels, which can affect the performance of shadow detection algorithms. These inaccuracies can arise from various issues such as lacking details, incomplete shadows, missed shadows, and rough annotations. The root causes of these inaccuracies can be attributed to the generation of annotations from manually lazy-labeled datasets and subjective perception of shadows by human annotators.To address the problem of noisy labels, we propose an approach that employs a self-training framework. This framework involves training a network iteratively to refine the noisy labels in the original datasets. Additionally, we introduce techniques such as refining annotations using a low-shot segmentation model, identifying and filtering out inaccurate predictions, and incorporating zero-labeled non-shadow images to improve the identification of non-shadow regions. Our approach utilizes a simple U-Net architecture in the context of our self-training framework.To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we re-label the test set of an existing dataset to obtain high-quality and accurate shadow masks. Through various experiments, we demonstrate the superior performance of our approach in producing more precise shadow detection results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that our refined training set can significantly enhance the performance of these state-of-the-art methods.In conclusion, our proposed approach addresses the issue of noisy labels in existing shadow detection datasets by leveraging a self-training framework. The results of our experiments indicate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the precision of shadow detection and its potential to enhance the performance of state-of-the-art methods. The code, pre-trained model, and dataset used in our study are publicly available for further research and development.
