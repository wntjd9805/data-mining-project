Recent advances in 3D scene understanding have been facilitated by the development of 3D sensors and the availability of large-scale datasets. In particular, data-driven deep learning approaches have been extensively explored for 3D instance segmentation on point clouds, which involves localizing and recognizing objects in a 3D scene. This task is crucial for various applications such as autonomous driving, mixed reality, and robot navigation.In the realm of 2D instance segmentation, top-down approaches have been widely studied, where instance-level proposals are generated to predict instance masks. An example of this is BMask R-CNN, which introduces a boundary-sensitive branch to improve segmentation of objects with complex shapes and fine details.In contrast, 3D instance segmentation mainly relies on bottom-up pipelines, where point-level semantic labels are learned and points of the same class are grouped together to form instances. Various grouping strategies have been developed to achieve this. Recently, attention-based techniques, particularly using transformers, have shown promising results in 3D instance segmentation. However, the structural differences between transformers and sparse convolutional backbones limit the information exchange between the encoder and the decoder.To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid-based instance segmentation technique that combines a sparse convolutional backbone with a transformer decoder. We introduce enhanced supervision that targets the encoder, as well as a learning technique to regress per-voxel coordinates and semantic labels. Additionally, we append voxel positions to the highest-resolution features to improve mask prediction.Our contributions include exploring ways to improve information exchange between the encoder and decoder, enriching features with voxel positions for better mask prediction, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet V2 and ScanNet200 datasets.Overall, our proposed approach enhances the accuracy and comprehensiveness of 3D instance segmentation, making it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications.
