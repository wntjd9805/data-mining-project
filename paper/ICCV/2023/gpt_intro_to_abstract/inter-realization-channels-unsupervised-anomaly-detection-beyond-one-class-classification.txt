Anomaly detection is a challenging task in computer vision, especially in relation to image data due to its high dimensionality. Previous works in anomaly detection have focused on one-class classification, also known as cold-start anomaly detection. However, unsupervised problems have been avoided due to the difficulty of handling anomaly corruptions in the dataset. This paper aims to present a fully unsupervised anomaly detection method, called Inter-Realization Channels (InReaCh), which provides competitive results compared to existing one-class classification methods. The primary application of image anomaly detection is in industrial defect detection, where any anomaly is considered a defect. This domain poses challenges due to the subtle nature of anomalies and the variety of classes present. Various methods have been proposed for one-class classification anomaly detection, all of which require anomaly-free training data. In this context, InReaCh builds on patch-based methods and utilizes patch-based feature descriptors generated from a pre-trained CNN. By associating patches across images into channels, InReaCh identifies nominal patches in the training data. Experimental results on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate that InReaCh achieves comparable results to supervised one-class classification methods, even when trained on corrupted datasets. Moreover, InReaCh offers advantages such as unsupervised data collection, flexibility for non-stationary problems, and applicability to scenarios where the expected nominal data is unknown. This broadens the scope of image anomaly detection beyond controlled industrial applications.
