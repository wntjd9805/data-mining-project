Three-dimensional perception is crucial for autonomous vehicles and robots, and LiDAR sensors are commonly used to provide accurate 3D information. However, LiDAR data presents challenges for object detection due to its unstructured nature and variable point density. Detecting objects with sparse data points often leads to false positives. Existing 3D object recognition approaches have largely been inspired by 2D image-based models and have not fully exploited the geometric properties inherent in 3D point clouds. This paper introduces GACE, a model-agnostic method that improves confidence estimation in object detection by leveraging geometric information. GACE utilizes neglected features such as point distribution, dimensions, and contextual properties to enhance confidence values. The effectiveness of GACE is demonstrated on the Waymo dataset and other datasets, resulting in significant performance gains without the need for retraining existing detectors.
