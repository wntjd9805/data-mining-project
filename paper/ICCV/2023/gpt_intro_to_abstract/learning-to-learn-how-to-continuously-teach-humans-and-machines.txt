Our goal in this study is to develop an artificially intelligent (AI) teacher that produces optimized curricula to enhance learning outcomes for both human students and machine learning algorithms. We draw inspiration from curriculum development in education, which has shown that carefully designed curricula facilitate incremental learning and minimize forgetting of tasks. We explore the effects of curriculum learning on machine learning outcomes, focusing on the presentation order of training examples in supervised, weakly-supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning settings. We find that curriculum design choices greatly influence knowledge transfer and forgetting in initial task learning and propose an automatic curriculum designer algorithm that efficiently designs and ranks curricula. Our results demonstrate that curricula ranked highly by our algorithm improve learning performance across multiple machine learning algorithms. We also conduct human psychophysics experiments and introduce a new dataset to benchmark the effectiveness of curricula for both humans and machine learning algorithms. We observe a high degree of agreement between the most effective curricula for machine learning algorithms and humans. Overall, our contributions include establishing a methodology to study curriculum effects, introducing a new benchmark dataset, quantifying commonalities among optimal curricula for both humans and machine learning algorithms, and proposing an automated curriculum designer.
