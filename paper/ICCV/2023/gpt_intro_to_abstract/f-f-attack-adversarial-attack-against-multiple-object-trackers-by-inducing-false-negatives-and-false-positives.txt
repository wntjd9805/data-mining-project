Multi-object tracking (MOT) is an important visual perception task that involves building moving trajectories for objects. Most MOT methods follow the tracking-by-detection paradigm, relying on a detector to find objects of interest and associating them with historical trajectories. While adversarial attacks have been extensively studied in other computer vision tasks, such as detection and tracking, the robustness of MOT to attacks has only recently gained attention. Existing attack methods, such as the detection attacker and the association attacker, have limitations in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel adversarial attack mechanism called the false positive and false negative (F&F) attack. This attack integrates the false alarm attack, false negative attack, and the idea of the association attack. The F&F attack focuses on crowded scenes with severe occlusions and frequent changes in visibility, which pose challenges for detection and association and increase the likelihood of identity switches. Our attack involves erasing the original detection and injecting multiple deceptive false alarms around it, effectively misleading the multi-object tracker's detector component. The F&F attack offers several advantages. Firstly, it is effective in attacking multiple targets simultaneously, as it can tolerate non-independent perturbations. Secondly, it is simple and efficient, as it does not require accessing or forwarding association components. Thirdly, it is flexible and can be deployed on different types of multi-object trackers that share the same detectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the F&F attack through experiments on three modern trackers (CenterTrack, SORT, and ByteTrack) on two public datasets. In summary, our contributions include the proposal of a novel adversarial attack mechanism, the demonstration of its flexibility in attacking different types of multi-object trackers, and the evaluation of its effectiveness through experiments. The F&F attack shows promising results in fooling multi-object trackers and highlights the need for improved robustness in MOT systems.
