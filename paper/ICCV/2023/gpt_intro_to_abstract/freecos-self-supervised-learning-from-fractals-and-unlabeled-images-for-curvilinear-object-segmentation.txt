Automatically segmenting curvilinear structures in medical images and aerial photography is important for various applications such as disease screening, diagnosing coronary artery disease, and road condition evaluation. Existing methods that leverage supervised deep learning for curvilinear object segmentation require expensive manual annotations for training. Domain adaptation and unsupervised segmentation have been proposed as potential solutions, but they have limitations in achieving satisfactory performance for curvilinear objects. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised segmentation method that combines fractals and unlabeled target images to learn robust and distinctive features of curvilinear structures. We introduce a novel Fractal-FDA synthesis module and a geometric information alignment approach. The synthetic curvilinear structures generated by the Fractal-FDA module serve as segmentation labels, while the geometric information alignment aligns the features of synthetic and target images. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised, unsupervised, and traditional methods on multiple public datasets. Our contributions include the proposal of a self-supervised curvilinear feature learning method, the development of the Fractal-FDA synthesis and geometric information alignment modules, and the implementation of a self-supervised segmentation network that achieves superior performance without the need for manual annotations.
