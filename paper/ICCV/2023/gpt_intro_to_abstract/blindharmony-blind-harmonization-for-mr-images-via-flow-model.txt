Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely-used medical imaging technique. Deep learning-based computer vision techniques have been applied to MRI for various tasks such as disease classification and tumor segmentation. However, the presence of a domain gap in MRI data hinders the generalization of deep learning models trained on different datasets. To address this challenge, several harmonization methods have been developed, both non-deep learning-based and deep-learning based. However, these methods often require multiple datasets or have limited generalizability. In this paper, we propose the concept of "Blind Harmonization" where a harmonization network is constructed using only the target domain data and can be applied to diverse source domains unseen during training. We introduce BlindHarmony, an implementation of blind harmonization using normalizing flow, a class of invertible generative models. Our method is evaluated on both simulated and real-world data.
