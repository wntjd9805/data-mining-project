Image denoising is a fundamental task in low-level computer vision, aiming to recover noise-free images from noisy observations. Existing image denoising algorithms can be grouped into filtering-based, model-based, and learning-based methods. While learning-based methods have shown superiority, they typically rely on clean-noisy image pairs obtained from predefined additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) models. However, real-world noise is more complex and different from AWGN, leading to poor performance with these methods. To address this, unsupervised denoising-based methods have emerged, mainly based on generative adversarial network (GAN) frameworks. However, the performance of existing unsupervised denoising frameworks is unsatisfactory. Additionally, these frameworks lack the ability to maximize the denoising potential without changing their structure or increasing inference complexity. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised real-world denoising network called Self Collaboration Parallel Generative Adversarial Branches (SCPGabNet). Our approach utilizes a self-collaboration (SC) strategy, enabling the denoisers to continuously evolve and significantly improve their performance. We introduce a novel filter-guided synthetic noisy image generator with a noise extraction module and a parallel generative adversarial branches framework with "self-synthesis" and "unpaired-synthesis" constraints. Our SCPGabNet outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised image denoising methods on benchmarking datasets, such as SIDD and DND.
