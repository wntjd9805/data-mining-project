This paper explores the possibility of performing computational processing on individual photons using a new class of single-photon detectors called single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs). The authors demonstrate that photon data captured by SPADs can emulate various imaging modalities, such as exposure bracketing, video compressive systems, and event cameras. They propose a software-defined approach to post-capture imaging functionalities by computing projections of photon-cubes, which represent the spatio-temporal detection of photons. The authors present case studies of high-speed video compressive imaging, event cameras, and motion projections, showcasing the versatility of photon-cube projections. They discuss different strategies for obtaining photon-cube projections, including reading out the entire photon-cube off the SPAD array and performing computations off-chip or computing projections near the sensor. The authors also introduce the concept of a photon-level software-defined camera, which provides multiple camera functionalities without additional hardware complexity. They discuss the limitations of the current SPAD array and near-sensor processor used in their experiments but anticipate future advancements in single-photon cameras and near-sensor processors.
