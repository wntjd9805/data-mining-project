Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have the potential to become the mainstream representation for digital media. However, training a NeRF model is a challenging task and raises concerns about the protection of intellectual property. One solution is to embed copyright messages, or digital watermarks, directly into the rendered samples using existing watermarking approaches. However, this only protects the copyright of the samples and leaves the core model vulnerable to theft. To address this, we propose CopyRNeRF, a method that embeds copyright messages into the weights of the NeRF model itself. By accessing the information encoded in the model through 2D renderings, we ensure that the embedded messages are both invisible and robustly extractable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CopyRNeRF through comparisons with other watermarking methods and show that it provides better reconstruction quality under different settings. Our contributions include a method to produce copyright-embedded NeRF models, a watermarked color representation for invisibility and high-quality rendering, and distortion-resistant rendering to ensure robustness across different rendering strategies and 2D distortions.
