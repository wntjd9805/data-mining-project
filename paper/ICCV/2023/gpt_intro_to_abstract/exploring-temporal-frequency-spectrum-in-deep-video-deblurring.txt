Video deblurring is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims to recover the original frame from a blurred sequence using temporal information. Research efforts in this area can be divided into traditional optimization methods and deep learning-based approaches. However, traditional optimization methods often involve complex design and optimization processes, limiting their practical usage. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have shown promising results by following a common pipeline of feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and optimization. However, these methods have mainly focused on exploring temporal information in the spatial domain and have not fully utilized its potential. This paper proposes a novel Fourier-based frequency-temporal solution for video deblurring. The key insight is to transform the blurred feature sequences into the frequency domain using the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and exploit the temporal sharp cues for each step in the deblurring pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in restoring clear frames from blurred sequences.
