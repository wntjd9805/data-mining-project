This paper addresses the problem of navigating to an object instance specified by an image in the context of last-mile package delivery. The authors propose a modular navigation system that consists of four components: Exploration, Instance Re-IdentiÔ¨Åcation, Goal Localization, and Local Navigation. The system achieves a high success rate on the challenging Habitat-Matterport3D benchmark and performs well in real-world environments. The proposed method outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models in the instance-based Image Goal Navigation task. The authors argue that modular methods offer advantages in terms of sample efficiency and real-world execution compared to end-to-end approaches. Overall, the paper presents a reliable and efficient solution for the instance-specific Image Goal Navigation task.
