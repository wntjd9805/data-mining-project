Deep learning has made significant advancements in recent years, particularly in the area of object detection. State-of-the-art models, such as those referenced as [5, 19, 23, 50, 51], have been developed and demonstrate exceptional performance on benchmark datasets. Despite these achievements, there is a need to improve upon the existing models and methodologies. This paper presents a novel approach for object detection through the use of a deep learning framework called ABR-IOD (Adaptive Box Regression for Instance Object Detection). The proposed method leverages the strengths of existing models while addressing their limitations. Specifically, ABR-IOD introduces a new answer format that focuses solely on the introduction section of a computer science paper. The effectiveness of the ABR-IOD approach is demonstrated through extensive experimentation, and the results show promising improvements in object detection accuracy. Additionally, the source code for ABR-IOD is openly available on GitHub for further research and development. Overall, this paper contributes to the ongoing progress in the field of deep learning and provides a valuable tool for object detection tasks.
