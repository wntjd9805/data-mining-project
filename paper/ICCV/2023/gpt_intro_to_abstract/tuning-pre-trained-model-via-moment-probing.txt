This paper proposes a Moment Probing (MP) method for tuning pre-trained models in computer vision tasks. The MP method performs a linear classifier on feature distributions, which provides more powerful representations compared to traditional linear probing (LP). To efficiently compute second-order moments of the features, a multi-head convolutional cross-covariance (MHC3) method is introduced. The MHC3 method splits the features into groups and computes cross-covariance between each adjacent group. A partially shared module is also introduced to learn two recalibrating parameters, enhancing the potential of MP on feature learning. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets show that the MP method outperforms LP and existing parameter-efficient methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
