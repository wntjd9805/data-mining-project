Physics-based motion imitation has gained attention in the vision and graphics communities for its potential in creating realistic human motion and advancing virtual avatar technologies. However, controlling high-degree-of-freedom humanoids in simulation presents challenges, such as falling, tripping, and deviating from reference motions. Using poses estimated from noisy video observations can also lead to humanoid falling. Learning a motion imitator that can faithfully reproduce human-like motion with a high success rate is a major challenge. Reinforcement learning-based imitation policies have shown promise but have not yet achieved successful imitation from a large dataset. Using external forces like residual force control (RFC) compromises physical realism and leads to artifacts like floating. Handling noisy input and failure cases is also important. Most physics-based methods resort to resetting the humanoid when a failure condition is triggered, but obtaining reliable reference poses is challenging. In this work, we aim to create a humanoid controller for controlling real-time virtual avatars using video observations. We propose the Perpetual Humanoid Controller (PHC), which achieves high success rates in motion imitation and can recover naturally from a fail-state. We introduce the progressive multiplicative control policy (PMCP) to learn from the entire motion dataset without catastrophic forgetting. PMCP allows the controller to learn fail-state recovery tasks without compromising motion imitation capabilities. Additionally, we adopt the Adversarial Motion Prior (AMP) to ensure natural behavior during fail-state recovery. Our controller only requires link positions as input, making it compatible with off-the-shelf video-based pose estimators. Our contributions include the development of PHC, the proposal of PMCP, and the demonstration of the controller's capabilities through evaluations on motion capture and estimated motion from videos. We also showcase a live demo of driving perpetually simulated avatars using webcam video input.
