Deep learning has become a widely used tool in computer vision for solving image restoration tasks. However, designing and training DNN models for specific applications can be costly in terms of resources and expertise. While pre-trained models are often shared in the community, many providers charge for their commercial usage. This paper focuses on protecting the intellectual property rights (IPR) of DNN models used for low-level image restoration tasks. Existing methods for IPR protection in DNN models mostly focus on high-level vision tasks, and little attention has been given to image restoration tasks. Image restoration outputs images in a high-dimensional space, making existing fingerprinting methods for classification DNNs inadequate. Therefore, a new fingerprinting framework is proposed specifically for image restoration DNN models. The framework introduces the concept of critical images, which are points near the performance border zone that serve as effective fingerprints for the models. The proposed approach is applied to denoising and super-resolution tasks and demonstrated to be more robust than baseline fingerprinting methods. This study contributes to the development of IPR protection methods for image restoration DNN models, filling a gap in the existing literature.
