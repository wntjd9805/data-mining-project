Point cloud registration is a crucial technique in computer vision tasks such as SLAM, scene flow estimation, and 3D scene understanding. In driving scenarios with large-scale outdoor point clouds, point cloud registration becomes more challenging but important for enhancing driving safety. Accuracy in registration is particularly crucial when dealing with low-overlap point clouds. The density-mismatch problem arises in distant outdoor point clouds, where the density of overlapping point clouds decreases quadratically with the distance from the LiDAR. This density mismatch negatively impacts registration performance as deep learning features are sensitive to point density. Recently, there has been a surge in learning-based outdoor point cloud registration methods that utilize pair-wise contrastive learning. However, these methods struggle to handle distant point clouds due to the violation of the independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) principle. In this paper, we propose a group-wise contrastive learning (GCL) scheme to overcome the density correlation issue between positive examples. By utilizing groups of highly-overlapped point clouds, GCL ensures i.i.d. positive samples for training density-invariant feature extractors. We introduce a group-wise loss that minimizes the variance of features while also aligning the mean of a positive group close to the feature derived from the point with the highest density. We implement GCL on sparse voxel convolution and KPConv and evaluate its performance on KITTI and nuScenes datasets. Experimental results show that GCL achieves significant improvements in registration recall on distant scenarios without any loss in near point cloud registration benchmarks. Moreover, GCL is lightweight and suitable for online distant point cloud registration on smart vehicles. Our contributions include a theoretical analysis of the challenges in registering distant point clouds, the proposal of a density-invariant feature extraction scheme based on GCL, and extensive experiments demonstrating the superior performance of GCL in handling distant point cloud pairs.
