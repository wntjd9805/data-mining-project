In this paper, we propose a method for creating a photorealistic neural hand avatar in real-time. We introduce a hybrid hand model representation using the MANO hand model as a coarse proxy, surrounded by a neural radiance field. Our approach is solely learned from segmented multi-view videos of an articulated hand and respective hand pose annotations. We use a shallow coordinate-based MLP to regress the scene color and density based on normalized coordinates. This formulation allows for efficient sampling of a low-resolution NeRF representation of the scene. We also utilize a CNN-based super-resolution module for efficient upsampling. Our highly efficient representation allows for training on full images, allowing for supervision of the implicit scene representation using a perceptual loss. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of visual quality and runtime performance. We also provide a live demo of our approach, showcasing its practical use in daily life scenarios.
