One-stage multi-object tracking (MOT) is a complex research topic that aims to locate and track multiple objects in a sequence. Deep learning-based methods have shown great success in this field, but they require a large amount of annotated data for training, which is expensive and time-consuming. Active learning (AL) is a promising approach to address this issue by selecting the most informative samples for training. However, existing AL algorithms for computer vision tasks do not directly relate to the performance improvements of one-stage MOT and may lead to suboptimal results. Moreover, one-stage MOT requires detecting and associating intra-class objects, which adds an additional challenge to the active learning process. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel active learning framework called Heterogeneous Diversity driven Active Multi-Object Tracking (HD-AMOT) that formulates the active learning of one-stage MOT as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). HD-AMOT utilizes a Diversified Informative Representation Module (DIRM) and an Informative Frame Selection Network (IFSN) to infer informative and diverse frames for annotation. We also develop a novel DIRM to characterize the diversity and distribution of frames. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that HD-AMOT achieves similar or even higher performance compared to fully-supervised learning under a reduced annotation budget of 50%. This work is the first to investigate the annotation budget for one-stage MOT based on active learning.
