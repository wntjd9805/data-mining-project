This paper introduces the problem of mural degradation and the need for a mural restoration algorithm. Ancient murals, which provide valuable information about ancient civilizations, are often damaged by various factors such as light, winds, bacteria, and human activities. Manual restoration is time-consuming and inefficient due to the large areas of missing content caused by wall peeling and color decay. To address this issue, the authors propose a mural restoration algorithm that can accurately repair structured and unstructured defects. Prior to the deep learning era, research focused on geometry-based or patch-based methods, but these approaches had limitations. The authors propose a framework to generate realistic damaged murals using 3D open-source software. They also propose a diffusion-based model, called the Attention Diffusion Framework (ADF), as a baseline for their dataset. Additionally, they introduce a lightweight module called the Damage Attention Map (DAM) to predict the extent of damage. The authors propose a series of loss functions to preserve the basic structure and style of the input image while repairing missing information. The main contributions of this work are the novel pipeline for generating damaged murals, a restoration framework based on a generative diffusion model, and extensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
