Adversarial attacks in computer science are classified into two types: white-box and black-box attacks. White-box attacks occur when the attacker has complete knowledge of the targeted classifier, while black-box attacks occur when the attacker has limited knowledge. This paper focuses on decision-based black-box attacks, which allow the attacker to craft an adversarial example by querying only the top-1 classification label from the target classifier. Most existing decision-based attacks search for new boundary points using the estimated normal vector at a point on the decision boundary. However, these approaches have limitations in accurately estimating the normal vector and may not converge towards perturbation reduction when the adversarial region is narrow. To address these limitations, the authors propose a new curvature-aware geometric black-box attack (CGBA) that conducts boundary search along a semicircular path on a restricted 2-D plane. The proposed CGBA overcomes the limitations of existing 1-D search methods and achieves improved attack efficiency. Additionally, the authors develop a variant of CGBA, called CGBA-H, which performs better for targeted attacks with high curvature decision boundaries. The paper also introduces an algorithm for choosing a better initial boundary point, leading to significant performance improvement for targeted attacks. Experimental results on ImageNet and CIFAR10 datasets demonstrate the efficacy of CGBA and CGBA-H for non-targeted and targeted attacks, respectively.
