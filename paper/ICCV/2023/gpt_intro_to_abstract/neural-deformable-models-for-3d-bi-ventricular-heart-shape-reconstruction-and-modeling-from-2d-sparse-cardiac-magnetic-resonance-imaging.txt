Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) is widely used for non-invasive evaluation of global cardiac function, particularly blood pumping of the left ventricle (LV). However, current CMR scan protocols are 2D-based, limiting the reconstruction of the 3D geometry of the heart. To overcome this limitation, a stack of short axis (SAX) and long axis (LAX) images are acquired. While these images provide high-resolution 2D anatomical details, they only produce sparse 3D point cloud representations of the heart. Dense and accurate 3D geometry reconstruction is essential for various clinical applications, including image-guided interventions and biomechanics simulations. Previous methods have focused on reconstructing 3D shape from sparse point clouds generated from CMR image segmentation. However, these methods often struggle with accurately representing shapes that deviate significantly from the mean shape. In this paper, we propose a neural deformable model (NDM) inspired by conventional deformable models (CDMs) and equipped with global deformations using parameter functions and local deformations using neural diffeomorphic flows. NDM can be trained to learn global and local deformation parameters from a shape distribution manifold, providing accurate and detailed 3D shape reconstruction of the cardiac ventricles. Furthermore, NDM enables implicit learning of dense correspondences among shape instances and allows for the estimation of shape parameters that can be readily utilized by clinicians. The contributions of this work include the formulation of a new shape modeling framework, the design of the NDM, and the demonstration of its effectiveness in 3D heart shape reconstruction, registration, and interpretation. This approach has the potential to inspire similar tasks in other domains.
