This paper introduces a novel approach called E3Sym for estimating 3D global planar symmetry in a fully unsupervised fashion. The method uses a point cloud representation of a shape and applies an encoder network to extract E(3) invariant features, allowing for the establishment of dense symmetric point correspondences. Dense potential symmetry planes are then deduced, and a novel clustering algorithm is proposed to aggregate the dense prediction and produce the detected symmetry set. The main contributions of the paper include leveraging E(3) invariance for symmetry detection, achieving state-of-the-art performance in symmetry detection, and successfully identifying planar symmetries in incomplete shapes.
