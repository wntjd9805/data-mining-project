NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields) is a popular 3D reconstruction method that generates photorealistic reconstructions using multiple 2D images. However, there is a growing demand for techniques that can modify the contents of these 3D scenes. Previous methods for editing NeRF scenes have limitations, such as causing unwanted color alterations in areas that should remain unchanged. In this paper, we propose ICE-NeRF, a method that allows interactive and intuitive editing of NeRF scenes. Our approach is simple and efficient, using a pre-trained model and the user's rough mask as input to achieve the desired color in the specified region. We address the issues of entanglement and multi-view consistency with two novel techniques: Activation Field-based Regularization (AFR) and Single-mask Multi-view Rendering (SMR). Our method allows selective recoloring without changing undesired areas, is time and memory efficient, and achieves strong decomposition performance and multi-view consistency. Overall, our contributions include introducing the ICE-NeRF framework, which enables interactive and controlled recoloring, and proposing the AFR and SMR techniques to enhance the performance of NeRF editing.
