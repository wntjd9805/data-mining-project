Single-frame infrared small target (SIRST) detection is commonly used in various applications such as marine resource utilization, high-precision navigation, and ecological environment monitoring. However, existing SIRST detection methods rely heavily on pixel-level annotation, which can be time-consuming and hinders quick deployment in large scale data-dependent scenarios. This paper proposes a point-level supervision approach that provides category and localization information for each target, alleviating the annotation burden while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in SIRST detection. The proposed method utilizes a linear clustering approach with random noise-guided Monte Carlo regularization to extract and refine the candidate target region. Experimental results on four public SIRST datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing that pixel-level labels are not necessary for SIRST detection and single-point supervision is sufficient.
