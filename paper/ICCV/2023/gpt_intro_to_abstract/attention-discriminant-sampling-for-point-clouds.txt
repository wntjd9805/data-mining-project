Point cloud sampling is a crucial step in 3-dimensional (3-D) computer vision applications. Existing techniques rely primarily on distance-based geometric information, but fail to consider the semantic and structural aspects of the point cloud distribution. This paper introduces a cluster-based formulation that incorporates discriminant attention analysis to achieve structure-aware point cloud sampling. Deep learning has had significant success in 2-D computer vision, leading to increased interest in solving realistic and challenging 3-D tasks. Point clouds are a raw data format obtained by scanning objects using instruments like LiDAR scanners and multibeam sonars. Learning directly from raw 3-D point clouds is inefficient due to their irregular and unstructured format. Previous approaches have addressed this issue by preprocessing the data or simplifying it through voxelization. However, these methods still struggle with intricate scenes or objects with complex shapes. This paper proposes the Attention Discriminant Sampling (ADS) framework, which includes clustering, attention, and sampling processes. Unlike conventional Set Abstraction (SA) modules, ADS utilizes clustering to identify parts or objects within the scene and then performs cluster-wise sampling based on attention responses, cluster size, and complexity. The proposed method aims to address the limitations of existing point cloud techniques and improve representation learning and sampling efficiency for 3-D point clouds. The effectiveness of the ADS scheme is demonstrated in the task of part segmentation, showcasing its advantages compared to existing methods.
