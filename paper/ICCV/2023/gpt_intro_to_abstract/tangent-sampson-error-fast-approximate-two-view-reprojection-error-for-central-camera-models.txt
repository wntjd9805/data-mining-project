This paper addresses the problem of estimating two-view geometry from sparse 2D-2D correspondences in computer vision applications. The goal is to find the closest pair of 2D points that satisfy the epipolar constraint exactly. The traditional approach involves evaluating the residuals thousands of times for each image pair, making approximate error metrics favorable. Two categories of approximate error metrics are discussed: image-based and geometry-based metrics. Image-based metrics include the symmetric epipolar distance and the Sampson error, which can be rescaled to pixels for easy interpretation. Geometry-based metrics include the cosine error and the algebraic residual. Most existing literature focuses on the pinhole camera case, and undistorting the image or using geometry-based metrics are common strategies for non-pinhole cameras. However, undistorting the image introduces a radial bias in the error. To address this, the paper proposes the Tangent Sampson error, a version of the Sampson error that is applicable to arbitrary camera models. The Tangent Sampson error has several advantages, including ease of evaluation, meaningful thresholds in pixels, and compatibility with arbitrary central camera models. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed error metric compared to existing methods in various camera and lens configurations.
