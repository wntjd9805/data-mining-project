Semantic segmentation is an important task in computer vision that involves classifying each pixel in an image based on its local and global context. Deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers, have shown great success in semantic segmentation but require large amounts of annotated training data. Annotating data for this task is costly and time-consuming, limiting the availability of training data.Simulations and graphics engines have been used to generate annotated frames, reducing the time and cost needed for data labeling. However, there is a significant difference between simulated data and real-world images, requiring adaptation to bridge this domain shift. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) techniques have been developed to train semantic segmentation networks on synthetic frames and then adapt them to real images without human annotation. However, UDA techniques typically focus on the synthetic-to-real shift, while real-world deployment involves various domain shifts.Online domain adaptation has recently been introduced as a solution to continuous and unpredictable domain shifts at deployment time. However, it incurs a high computational cost and can lead to catastrophic forgetting. This paper proposes a novel framework for online domain adaptation in semantic segmentation that addresses these issues.The framework includes an automatic lightweight mechanism to reduce back-propagation complexity by training a subset of the network that yields the highest improvement in the allocated optimization time. It also introduces a lightweight domain detector to activate training only when necessary and optimize hyperparameters for maximum adaptation speed. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple online domain adaptation benchmarks and shows superior accuracy and speed compared to other test-time adaptation strategies.The paper presents experimental results demonstrating the real-time adaptation performance of the proposed framework compared to slower methods. It achieves impressive framerates while maintaining high accuracy. Overall, the paper provides a promising solution for online domain adaptation in semantic segmentation, overcoming the limitations of existing approaches.
