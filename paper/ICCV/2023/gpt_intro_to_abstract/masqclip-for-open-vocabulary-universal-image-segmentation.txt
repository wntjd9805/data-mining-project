This paper introduces MasQCLIP, a new approach for open-vocabulary instance, semantic, and panoptic segmentation in images. Traditional image segmentation methods are limited by being trained in a supervised manner, but MasQCLIP aims to be more powerful and less specific by utilizing CLIP models trained on image-text pairs. CLIP models do not directly output segmentation maps, so MasQCLIP adopts a two-stage approach of generating class-agnostic mask proposals and classifying each mask region based on a CLIP model. However, previous works still have limitations in being open-world, as the mask proposal network is trained on a limited set of base classes. MasQCLIP addresses these weaknesses through a student-teacher self-training module to enhance mask generation and a fine-tuning strategy called MasQ-Tuning that adapts the CLIP models for mask region representations. The contributions of this work include substantial performance improvement over current state-of-the-art methods in all three segmentation tasks, a progressive distillation process for generating novel mask proposals, and a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy.
