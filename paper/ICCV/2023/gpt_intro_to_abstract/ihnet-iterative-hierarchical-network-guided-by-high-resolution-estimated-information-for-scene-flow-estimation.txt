Scene flow estimation on point clouds is an important task in autonomous driving and robotics applications. Neural networks have become popular for processing point clouds, but existing methods have limitations in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. This paper introduces an Iterative Hierarchical Network (IHNet) that leverages the accuracy of downsampled estimation results from finer to coarser levels to improve scene flow estimation. The paper also addresses the issue of poor correspondence between consecutive frames in point clouds by proposing a resampling scheme to adjust point coordinates. The proposed network achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.
