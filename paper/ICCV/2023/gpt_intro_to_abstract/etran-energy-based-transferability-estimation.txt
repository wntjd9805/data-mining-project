Abstract:Pre-trained neural networks are essential in transfer learning for downstream tasks with limited training data. Selecting the best pre-trained model for a target task can be a time-consuming and computationally expensive process. Previous works have focused on assessing transferability based on extracted features, but this approach may not be reliable when the target dataset differs from the training data. In this paper, we propose an energy-empowered transferability estimation method that uses energy-based models to detect whether a target dataset is in-distribution or out-of-distribution for a given pre-trained model. By considering the energy score, classification score, and regression score, our method is able to accurately assess transferability for classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and we achieve state-of-the-art results in transferability assessment for image classification and object detection.
