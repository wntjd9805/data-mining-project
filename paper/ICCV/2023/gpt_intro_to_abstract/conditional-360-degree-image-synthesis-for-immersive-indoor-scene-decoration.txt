Panoramas, or 360◦ images, have become popular in virtual reality applications due to their immersive user experiences. However, generating indoor scenes in the 360◦ view for architectural and interior design purposes is still a challenging task. This is because the generation process needs to account for the common distortions in the 360◦ view and the generated content must be controllable.Existing generative models, such as StyleGAN, can generate realistic images but lack interpretability and control over the content. On the other hand, conditional image synthesis techniques, like image-to-image translation, do not explicitly support scene representations, limiting their ability for scene manipulation.In this paper, we propose a conditional image synthesis method for 360◦ indoor scenes, inspired by the neural scene decoration (NSD) technique. However, the NSD method has limitations in terms of user input requirement, applicability to the 360◦ view, and control over generated furniture attributes.Instead, we take a different approach and introduce a 360-aware object layout generator that automatically learns an object arrangement from a 360◦ background image. This layout serves as the latent representation in a generative adversarial network, enabling control over the generated content. Additionally, we devise a scene emptier to reinforce the conditioning and generation abilities in the training process.We make several contributions in this work, including the 360-aware object layout generator, a novel framework for diverse and controllable scene decorations, the scene emptier, and extensive experiments and user studies conducted on benchmark datasets to validate our method.Overall, our approach addresses the challenges in generating indoor scenes in the 360◦ view and offers a solution for immersive and controllable scene decoration in virtual reality applications.
