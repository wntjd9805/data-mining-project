In this paper, we introduce RLSAC, a novel Reinforcement Learning enhanced SAmple Consensus framework for end-to-end robust estimation in computer vision. We address the issue of excluding disturbances while estimating accurate models by integrating the sampling consensus process with reinforcement learning. RLSAC employs a neural network to sample the minimum set from the data as an action, and the environment performs model generation and evaluation based on the action, outputting the next state. We propose new state transition and reward modules, encoding the state with memory features and using the evaluation result as the reward signal. RLSAC achieves robustness to disturbances and effective progressive exploration capability, as demonstrated in 2D line fitting and fundamental matrix estimation tasks. It can be easily applied to other robust estimation tasks and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our contributions include the proposal of RLSAC framework, the approach for state encoding, and the evaluation of RLSAC on robust estimation tasks.
