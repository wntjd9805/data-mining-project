Anomaly detection is a crucial task in computer vision with applications in industry and medicine. However, collecting and annotating anomalous data is expensive. Unsupervised anomaly detection, which aims to learn the distribution of normal data without access to anomalous samples, has gained attention. Classical reconstruction-based methods assume that anomalous regions cannot be reconstructed, but this approach has limitations. DRAEM proposes generating pseudo anomalies to train an autoencoder, but performs poorly when real anomalies differ significantly. Current methods for medical anomaly detection rely on denoising autoencoders, but the reconstruction from noisy images is challenging and unsuitable for complex industrial anomaly detection. In this work, we propose a new reconstruction-based approach for anomaly detection that achieves precise anomaly localization and top reconstruction quality. We formulate the task as a noise removal problem and introduce random noises into the input image during training. We leverage a diffusion model for denoising and reconstruction, measuring the reconstruction error at each step for accurate anomaly localization. Our approach also includes a gradient denoising process that reconstructs normal images from anomalous ones, preserving structural appearance and high-frequency details. We outperform existing methods in terms of reconstruction quality and anomaly detection accuracy.
