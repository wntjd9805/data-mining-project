Accurately estimating the 3D pose and shape of animals is important for understanding their behavior and has applications in wildlife conservation, animal ecology, and biomechanics. Previous works have focused on specific animals, limiting the generalization ability of models. To address this, we propose Animal3D, the first benchmark for mammal animal 3D pose and shape estimation. Animal3D is a dataset consisting of 3379 high-quality images from 40 mammal species. Each image is annotated with 26 keypoints and 3D shape and pose parameters. We benchmark representative models on Animal3D and analyze their strengths and limitations. The dataset facilitates research in animal behavior and ecology and has potential for downstream applications. Our contributions include the Animal3D dataset, baselines on Animal3D using state-of-the-art methods, and an analysis of the strengths and limitations of these methods.
