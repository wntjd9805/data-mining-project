In this paper, we introduce a novel joint compression framework called Unified Data-Free Compression (UDFC) that addresses the limitations of existing compression methods. UDFC combines pruning and quantization techniques to reduce the memory footprint and computational costs of a model. We propose an assumption that the information loss caused by pruning or quantization of a layer can be restored by reconstructing the channels of the next layer. Based on this assumption, we derive a reconstruction form and formulate a reconstruction error between the original network and its compressed version. We prove that the reconstruction error can be minimized and provide a closed form solution. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets with different architectures demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of UDFC. For example, UDFC achieves significant reductions in FLOPS and memory footprint with only a minimal decrease in accuracy compared to the uncompressed baseline.
