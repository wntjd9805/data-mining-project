Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is widely used in various applications to capture rich spectral and spatial information. Hyperspectral image super-resolution (HSI-SR) aims to generate high-resolution HSI from low-resolution HSI. This paper focuses on the single-HSI-SR task, which restores high-resolution HSI from a single low-resolution HSI without auxiliary images. Conventional methods for single-HSI-SR use hand-crafted priors, but deep learning approaches using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown significant improvements. However, CNNs have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies in HSI data, leading to artifacts in the generated images. To address this, a Transformer model called ESSAformer is proposed, which utilizes an iterative downsampling and upsampling strategy and introduces a new attention mechanism called SCC-kernel-based self-attention (ESSA). ESSAformer efficiently enlarges the receptive field and improves the representation ability of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of both visual quality and objective metrics.
