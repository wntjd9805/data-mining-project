X-ray CT is a widely used modality in clinical screening and diagnosis but there are concerns about the increased risk of cancer induction due to X-ray radiation exposure. Sparse-view CT is an effective solution to reduce radiation dose, but conventional reconstruction methods result in severe global streak artifacts. To address this, image-domain methods have been used for streak artifacts removal and structure preservation, but they have difficulty in modeling global information efficiently. Current dominant methods use sinogram data for CT image post-processing, including the use of deep neural networks to interpolate missing data in the sinogram. However, these methods suffer from unsatisfactory and unstable performance. In this paper, we propose a novel image-domain method for sparse-view CT reconstruction. We introduce the concept of global representation (GloRe) learning using fast Fourier convolution to model global information and alleviate the limitations of limited receptive field. We also propose a GloRe distillation framework that leverages extra supervision from intermediate-view reconstructed images to improve the quality of information recovery and reconstruction. Our approach includes representation directional distillation and band-pass-specific contrastive distillation for aligning representation directions and preserving clinically important details. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods in terms of quantitative metrics and visual comparison.
