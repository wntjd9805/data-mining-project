3D Face generation is a critical technology with diverse applications in industries such as movies and games. While recent works have shown success in generating 3D faces, they are limited in their ability to be guided by texts, which can enhance creativity and efficiency. This paper introduces a novel fine-grained text-driven 3D face generation framework called TG-3DFace, which aims to generate high-quality 3D faces that are semantically consistent with input texts. The framework incorporates a text-conditioned 3D generation network and two cross-modal alignment techniques. By injecting texture condition into the generator and discriminator networks, the framework enables 3D face generation under text guidance. Additionally, the alignment techniques address challenges such as the lack of large-scale text-3D face data pairs and the rich facial attributes of 3D faces. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of TG-3DFace in generating high-quality and semantically consistent 3D faces. The proposed framework can have applications in single-view 3D face reconstruction and text-guided 3D face manipulation.
