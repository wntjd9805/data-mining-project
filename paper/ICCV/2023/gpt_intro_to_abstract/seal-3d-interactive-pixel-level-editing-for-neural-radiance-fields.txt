Implicit neural representations, such as neural radiance fields (NeRF), have been widely used to model 3D scenes due to their high reconstruction accuracy and rendering quality. However, there is a lack of human-friendly editing tools for interacting with these models. Existing methods for editing NeRF focus on coarse-grained object-level editing and lack interactivity. This paper proposes an interactive pixel-level editing method and system called Seal-3D, which allows for fine-grained editing of neural radiance fields. The system consists of various editing tools, including bounding box, brushing, anchor, and color editing tools. To address the challenges of editing implicit representations, the paper introduces a proxy function that maps the user's edit instructions to the original scene space and a teacher-student distillation strategy to update the parameters. A two-stage training process is also proposed, which enables instant preview of local editing effects without compromising the global structure and colors of the scene. Overall, the contributions of this paper include the first interactive pixel-level editing method for neural radiance fields, a proxy function to establish correspondence between explicit editing instructions and parameters, and a two-stage training strategy for instant preview of local editing effects.
