This paper introduces a new approach to estimating the relative pose between two images using 2D-2D point correspondences. The traditional approach involves passing through the essential matrix, but this method has limitations and requires a fixed number of correspondences. The authors propose an intuitive algebraic characterization of the space of essential matrices, known as quintessential matrices, which uniquely encode epipolar configurations. They explore the relationship between quintessential matrices and unit quaternions and present two semidefinite relaxations of the essential matrix estimation problem. They also design a Riemannian truncated-Newton trust-region method to efficiently solve this reduction. The findings in this paper open up possibilities for improved relative pose estimation in computer vision applications.
