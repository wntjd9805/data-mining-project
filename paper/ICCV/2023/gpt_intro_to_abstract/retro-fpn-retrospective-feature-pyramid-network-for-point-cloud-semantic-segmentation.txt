The task of 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, which involves predicting category labels for each point in a point cloud, is crucial for the understanding of large-scale scenes in 3D computer vision. Existing solutions often use encoder-decoder frameworks that propagate features from larger to smaller receptive fields, forming a feature pyramid. However, these frameworks tend to lose semantic information in the intermediate region features, leading to the loss of accuracy and ambiguous identification of objects. Previous approaches have attempted to address this issue through hierarchical supervision, but they still struggle to obtain accurate per-point predictions. To overcome these limitations, we propose Retro-FPN, a method that improves per-point semantic feature prediction by fully utilizing the feature pyramid. Retro-FPN incorporates an explicit and retrospective refining process, where per-point labels are predicted for each stage, allowing region information to flow into individual points and obtaining point-level semantic features. These features are then refined through a retrospective summarization of the semantic pattern from the previous layer and an adaptive rearrangement of the current information.To achieve retrospective refinement, we introduce a novel retro-transformer that consists of two stages. The first stage uses a local cross-attention block to retrospect useful information from the previous layer, utilizing per-point semantic features of nearby points. The second stage refines the current semantic features by selectively preserving and forgetting previous information using a lightweight semantic gate. This retro-transformer establishes cross-level semantic relationships between different decoding stages, effectively preserving useful information and discarding erroneous information.Retro-FPN can be integrated into various prevailing backbones, including point-based and voxel-based methods. Evaluation on benchmark datasets such as S3DIS, ScanNet, and SemanticKITTI demonstrates the effectiveness of Retro-FPN in improving segmentation performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. In summary, our contributions include the proposal of Retro-FPN, a plug-and-play network that improves per-point semantic feature prediction, the introduction of a novel retro-transformer for establishing cross-level semantic relationships, and the integration of Retro-FPN with different backbone architectures, yielding significant performance improvements.
