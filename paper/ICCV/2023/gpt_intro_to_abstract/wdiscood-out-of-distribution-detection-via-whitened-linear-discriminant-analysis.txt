Deep learning models are susceptible to generating incorrect answers with high confidence when presented with out-of-distribution (OOD) data, as they are typically designed with a closed-world assumption. This can have catastrophic consequences in real-world applications and hinders the deployment of deep neural networks in the open world. To address this issue, substantial research efforts have focused on the problem of OOD detection.In this paper, we propose a novel OOD detection method based on Whitened Linear Discriminant Analysis (WLDA). Our method aims to establish a robust approach for identifying "unknown" testing data. Specifically, we develop a scoring function that separates in-distribution (ID) and OOD data by utilizing both class-discriminative and class-agnostic information within the feature space.Existing approaches for OOD detection in deep visual classifiers mostly examine activation patterns from the classification layer. Our method differs by exploring both discriminative and residual information solely within the feature space. We project visual features into two subspaces using WLDA: a discriminative subspace and a residual subspace. The discriminative subspace contains class-discriminative signals, while the residual subspace captures shared information.To detect anomalies, we measure the distance of a sample to the nearest class center in the discriminative subspace. In the residual subspace, where ID classes are entangled, we examine the distance to the centroid of all training data as an indicator of OOD. Our final scoring function combines the scores from both subspaces.We evaluate our method on the ImageNet-1k benchmark using ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16 models. Our approach outperforms baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results. It also surpasses other feature-space approaches, including the Supervised Contrastive (SupCon) and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the Whitened Discriminative Residual Subspace in identifying anomalous responses and highlight the importance of class-agnostic feature components for the task.In summary, our contributions include the development of a new OOD detection score based on WLDA, the exploration of the effectiveness of the Whitened Discriminative Residual Subspace, and state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet-1k benchmark for various visual classifiers and contrastive visual encoders.
