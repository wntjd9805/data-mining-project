This paper introduces a novel 6D pose estimation algorithm called CheckerPose, which aims to improve object pose estimation from RGB images. The algorithm consists of three cooperative components: dense 3D sampling, progressive 2D localization through binary coding, and shape prior encoding with a graph neural network. Unlike previous methods, CheckerPose samples 3D keypoints on the object surface and finds their 2D pixel correspondences through 3D-to-2D matching. It also uses hierarchical binary coding to refine the correspondence progressively and incorporates a graph neural network to model interactions between 3D keypoints and improve predictions of invisible keypoints. Experimental results on popular benchmarks demonstrate that CheckerPose consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in object pose estimation.
