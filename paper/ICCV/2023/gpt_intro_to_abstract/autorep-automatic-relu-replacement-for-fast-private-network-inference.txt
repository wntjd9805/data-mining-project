In recent years, the market for Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has seen significant growth, with several platform providers offering MLaaS solutions. However, most of these solutions compromise data privacy and security by requiring clients to share their private input. Private inference (PI) techniques have emerged as a solution to address data and model confidentiality concerns. These techniques typically use cryptographic primitives such as multi-party computation (MPC) and homomorphic encryption (HE) to ensure security. However, the application of cryptographic primitives in PI faces challenges due to the high computation and communication overhead introduced by nonlinear operators, such as ReLU. This paper addresses the limitations of existing techniques for reducing ReLU operators in PI and proposes an automatic ReLU replacement framework called AutoReP. The framework incorporates a joint fine-grained replacement policy and polynomial approximation to simultaneously reduce the non-linear operators while maintaining high model accuracy and expressivity. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoReP achieves higher accuracy and significantly reduces the ReLU budget compared to existing techniques. Overall, this paper presents a systematic solution to the efficient PI problem by addressing the selection and replacement of non-linear operators and maintaining model accuracy and expressivity.
