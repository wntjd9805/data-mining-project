This paper introduces the concept of high-definition maps (HD maps) and their importance in ensuring the safe navigation of autonomous vehicles. The process of constructing HD maps is typically done manually by human annotators, which can be expensive and time-consuming. As a result, the authors propose the development of reliable algorithms that can decrease or replace the need for human labor in HD map construction. The authors argue that multi-view consistency is an intrinsic property of HD maps, and existing methods using bird's-eye-view perception often yield unreliable results with noticeable inconsistencies. To address this issue, the authors propose a region-centric framework called MV-Map that generates a multi-view consistent HD map from an arbitrary number of frames. They also introduce and extend Voxel-NeRF, a variant of neural radiance fields, to encode the 3D structure from all frames for HD map generation tasks. Large-scale experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that MV-Map significantly improves the quality of HD maps and can effectively utilize an increasing number of input frames. Overall, this paper presents a novel approach to offboard HD map generation and contributes to the advancement of autonomous driving technology.
