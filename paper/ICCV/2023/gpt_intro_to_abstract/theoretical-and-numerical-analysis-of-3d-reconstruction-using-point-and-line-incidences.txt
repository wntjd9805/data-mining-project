The Structure-from-Motion pipeline is a crucial technique for estimating camera positions and the relative position of objects in a set of images. This process involves identifying corresponding points and lines in multiple images, which are then used to estimate camera positions and triangulate the positions of the points and lines. In this paper, we focus on the triangulation of points and lines that satisfy a specific incidence relation, such as points contained in a single line. We develop a theory for triangulating these problems, assuming complete visibility and an arbitrary number of pinhole cameras. Previous methods for triangulating points do not consider incidence relations, but incorporating line features and incidence relations can lead to more accurate scene estimation, as lines are more robust to noise than points and incidence relations are common in many scenes. We use algebraic varieties, which are the vanishing sets of polynomial equations, as the main tools in our work. We define and study the anchored point and line multiview varieties, which are the smallest varieties containing point and line correspondences satisfying specific conditions. We provide formulas for the Euclidean distance degrees of these varieties, which measure the complexity of error correction using algebraic methods. Our numerical simulations show that our proposed methods for triangulating points in a line using the anchored multiview varieties are faster and more accurate than traditional approaches. We believe these approaches can be efficiently implemented in practical software and hardware for triangulation.
