Shape primitives extraction is a fundamental task in 3D shape representation. It aims to decompose a complex object into simple geometry, resembling human visual perception and facilitating industrial manufacturing. Previous methods using parameterized shapes could guarantee simplicity but had limited expressiveness, leading to low fidelity. Implicit functions offer higher fidelity but diminish semantic information. However, prior works require 3D data, making them impractical for real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a method to learn implicit primitives from multi-view images. We introduce a convex regularization term to ensure simplicity and semantics preservation in primitive decomposition. Convexity is beneficial in industrial manufacturing processes like 3D printing. We derive the implicit convexity regularization and prove its sufficiency for convexity. Each primitive is guaranteed to be convex, and they are combined into a whole object using softmax-weighted-sum. We experiment on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating the simplicity, semantics, and fidelity of our generated primitives. Our method is particularly applicable to datasets without 3D data.
