Deep neural networks have achieved significant breakthroughs in computer vision problems such as image classification, object detection, and medical image analysis. While these models perform well, their predictions often lack interpretability, making it challenging for domain experts to understand the basis of these predictions. One common approach to interpreting neural network predictions is by analyzing the gradient of the prediction score function. However, existing gradient-based interpretation methods have been observed to lack robustness and produce dense and noisy saliency maps.To improve the robustness and quality of gradient-based interpretations, SmoothGrad was introduced, which applies Gaussian smoothing to gradient-based methods. While it improves visual quality, it remains inflexible in incorporating prior knowledge of sparsity and group-sparsity structures. This paper proposes a new approach called MoreauGrad, which achieves a smooth and sparse gradient-based interpretation by leveraging the Moreau envelope of a classifier's gradient. Convex analysis is used to establish the smoothness and robustness properties of MoreauGrad.Furthermore, the authors demonstrate that MoreauGrad can be combined with L1-norm-based regularization penalties to output sparse and group-sparse interpretations. These extensions preserve the smoothness and robustness properties of MoreauGrad, showcasing its adaptability in incorporating prior knowledge of sparsity structures.Finally, empirical experiments using standard image recognition datasets and neural network architectures confirm the satisfactory performance of MoreauGrad in terms of visual quality and robustness. The proposed Sparse MoreauGrad interpretation outperforms standard gradient-based saliency maps in terms of robustness and sparsity. The main contributions of this paper include the proposal of MoreauGrad as an interpretation scheme, the analysis of its smoothness and robustness properties, the introduction of L1-regularized Sparse MoreauGrad, and numerical results supporting the superiority of MoreauGrad over standard image recognition datasets.
