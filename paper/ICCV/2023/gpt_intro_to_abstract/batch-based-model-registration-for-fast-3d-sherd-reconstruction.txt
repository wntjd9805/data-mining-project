Digital documentation of archaeological artifacts is essential for their preservation and virtual restoration. In particular, the reconstruction and digital archiving of 3D shapes of sherds, the most commonly uncovered artifacts during archaeological excavations, are crucial for analysis and preservation purposes. However, the scanning and reconstruction capacity of existing imaging systems is insufficient for the large number of fragments uncovered in a day. Therefore, there is a high demand for methods and systems capable of scanning and reconstructing hundreds of fragments per day.Batch processing is the most promising approach to achieve high-throughput scanning of sherds. This approach involves dividing the fragments into groups and performing three steps of operation for each group: front side reconstruction, back side reconstruction, and full model registration. While the first two steps are technically straightforward, the third step, full model registration, poses new technical challenges. These challenges include efficiently and reliably finding the corresponding back scan for each front scan, as well as providing reliable initial relative pose estimation for the registration process. Additionally, the small overlap between the front and back scans, which commonly occurs, presents significant challenges for existing registration methods.To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel contour-based solution for batch matching and a boundary-aware ICP (Iterative Closest Point) method for fine registration. The contour of a fragment's 2D projection is used as a reliable shape representation, and a novel intrinsic shape descriptor is devised for comparison and pairing of front and back scans. This method proves to be efficient and robust in finding matching pairs. The initial alignment of the paired scans is achieved through the alignment of 2D contours, which then induces a good initial alignment of the 3D scans for subsequent ICP iterations. Furthermore, a boundary-based ICP method is proposed to address the issue of small overlap and lack of salient textures and features in the overlapping region of the scans.The presented batch-based model registration method enables the efficient and automatic registration of partial front and back 3D scans to produce complete 3D models of sherds in high throughput. Validation experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithmic contributions result in significantly faster scanning and reconstruction of sherds compared to existing systems. The paper also provides a dataset of fragments and the code used in the experiments to facilitate further research in batch-based model registration for 3D reconstruction of archaeological fragments.
