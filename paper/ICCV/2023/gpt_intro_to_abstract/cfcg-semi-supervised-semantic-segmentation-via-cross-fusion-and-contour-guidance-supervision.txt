This paper introduces a novel semi-supervised semantic segmentation framework called CFCG. The framework combines cross-fusion supervision (CFS) and an adaptive contour guidance module (ACGM) to address the challenges of noisy supervisions and unreliable confidence score measurements in SSSS. CFCG leverages the knowledge from multiple learners and uses a contour-guided weight map to re-weight training loss, improving the reliability of pixel-wise pseudo labels. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFCG achieves state-of-the-art performance in semantic segmentation tasks.
