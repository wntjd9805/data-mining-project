Our paper introduces a method for discovering the audio-visual hierarchy from video data in a self-supervised manner. We aim to address the limitations of manually defined hierarchies, which may not suit domain-specific tasks. We propose a two-stage process for hyperbolic hierarchical clustering, which allows us to efficiently train on large-scale video datasets and obtain hierarchical pseudo-labels. Our contributions include discovering audio and video hierarchies unsupervised, reducing the computational complexity of hyperbolic hierarchical clustering, and outperforming plain clustering-based competitors in a self-supervised setting.
