Visual object tracking is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims to localize a target in video sequences based on its initial status. However, challenges such as occlusion, scale variation, object deformation, and the presence of distractor objects make it difficult to develop effective trackers for real-world scenarios. Current dominant trackers address these challenges using Transformer-based architectures. The core components of these frameworks are the object modeling blocks, which employ different methods such as hybrid modeling with cross-attention, hybrid modeling with self-attention, and separate modeling. In this paper, we propose a robust object modeling framework for visual tracking called ROMTrack. Our framework combines the advantages of separate and hybrid template modeling by incorporating inherent and hybrid templates, as well as introducing novel variation tokens. The inherent template applies self-attention to enhance its learned features and provides inherent information for discriminative target-oriented feature learning. The hybrid attention operation enhances the template and search region features with mutual guidance. Additionally, we address the challenges of object deformation and appearance variations by using variation tokens generated from hybrid template features. Our variation tokens perform well with minimal computation. The main contributions of this work are three-fold: 1. We propose the ROMTrack framework, which maintains the inherent information of the target template and enables simultaneous mutual feature matching between the target and the search region. 2. We introduce a neat and effective variation-token design that incorporates the object's appearance context into the attention calculation of hybrid target-search features during tracking. 3. The ROMTrack framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on six challenging benchmarks, including GOT-10k, LaSOT, TrackingNet, LaSOText, OTB100, and NFS30.
