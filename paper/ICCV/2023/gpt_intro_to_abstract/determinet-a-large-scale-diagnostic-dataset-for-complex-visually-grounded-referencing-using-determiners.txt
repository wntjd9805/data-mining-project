This paper introduces the concept of determiners in natural language processing and highlights their importance in object localization, referencing, and quantification tasks. The authors discuss the limitations of existing deep learning models in dealing with the complexity of determiners and propose the need for a learning-based approach along with suitable training data. To address this gap, the authors present the DetermiNet diagnostic dataset, which consists of synthetic images and captions covering 25 determiners. The dataset focuses on the logical semantics of determiners and tests the ability of algorithms to understand and apply determiner concepts. The authors evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art visually-grounded models on DetermiNet and find that further advancements are required to achieve satisfactory results. The contributions of this paper include the development of DetermiNet as a benchmark dataset for learning determiners and the identification of challenges and opportunities in this area of research.
