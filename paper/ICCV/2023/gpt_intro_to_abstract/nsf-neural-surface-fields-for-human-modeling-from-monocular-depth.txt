Human modeling is a challenging field with applications in Computer Vision and Graphics. Recent advancements in data acquisition techniques have allowed for the capturing and digitizing of human appearance, leading to the development of digital avatars. The goal of this research is to build a controllable and detailed body model that can produce different poses and faithfully reproduce details such as garment wrinkles. While 4D scans provide rich information about a subject's appearance, they require exclusive technology and expert intervention, making them difficult to scale. To mitigate the noise in input data, parametric models and point cloud representations have been used, but they have limitations in terms of flexibility and computational cost. In this paper, we propose Neural Surface Fields (NSF), a neural field that defines a continuous field over the surface, allowing for the modeling of detailed deformations. NSF enables the reconstruction of a coherent mesh at any resolution with just one run of surface extraction algorithms, reducing computational cost significantly. We validate our approach on various datasets and demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods. Our contributions include the proposal of NSF, which is a compact and efficient representation, and the development of a self-supervised approach for learning animatable human avatars from monocular depth sequences. NSF is the first work in avatarization to directly output a mesh at arbitrary resolution while maintaining coherence across different poses.
