This paper explores the potential of automated generative processes modeled by modern neural networks in the field of artistic typography. The goal is to generate typography that visually conveys the semantics of a word while maintaining readability. The challenges include balancing aesthetics with legibility, subjective definitions of artistic typography, and the vast range of ways to depict semantics. To address these challenges, the paper proposes a model called DS-Fusion that combines adversarial learning and diffusion in a single framework. The model uses a denoising generator and a CNN-based discriminator to adapt the input style onto the input text. The paper showcases the effectiveness of DS-Fusion through experiments, quantitative evaluations, and user studies. The results demonstrate the generality and versatility of the approach in accommodating different semantics, letters, and artistic styles. The user studies reveal that in a significant percentage of cases, the automatically generated typography was preferred over or considered equally good as results produced by professional artists.
