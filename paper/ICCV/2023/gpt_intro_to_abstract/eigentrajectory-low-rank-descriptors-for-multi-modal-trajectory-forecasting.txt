Trajectory prediction is a crucial technology for autonomous navigation, social robot platforms, and surveillance systems. Existing approaches typically design prediction models in the Euclidean space, directly inferring a sequence of 2D coordinates. However, these approaches struggle to capture explanatory features in higher-dimensional spaces. Recent works have introduced trajectory descriptors, such as BÃ©zier curves and B-spline curves, to represent pedestrian movements and reduce dimensionality. However, it is unclear how well these parametric functions capture human motions and behaviors. In this paper, we propose the EigenTrajectory (ET) descriptor, which can be learned from real-world human trajectory data. Our approach decomposes trajectory sequences using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and represents them as a linear combination of eigenvectors. We aggregate social interaction features and predict future path coefficients using the ET descriptor. By clustering the coefficients, we ensure diversity in prediction paths. Experimental results demonstrate that the ET descriptor effectively represents pedestrian motion dynamics and significantly improves prediction accuracy on various public benchmarks.
