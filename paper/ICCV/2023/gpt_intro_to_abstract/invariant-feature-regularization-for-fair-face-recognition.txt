Face recognition is a crucial task in computer vision, with applications in areas such as crime prevention. However, ensuring fair face recognition, where the model performs equally well on all demographic groups, is a pressing need. Unfortunately, demographic attributes are naturally imbalanced in large-scale face datasets, leading to decreased accuracy on minority groups in deployment. This bias stems from the confounding effect, where the model learns to exploit demographic-specific features that may not generalize well to unseen faces. To address this issue, we propose Invariant Feature Regularization (INV-REG), which self-annotates the confounders by learning data partitions. INV-REG leverages the invariance of causal relations to discover diverse demographic partitions and impose an invariant regularization in training. Experimental results demonstrate that combining INV-REG with existing face recognition methods achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of multi-racial accuracy. The proposed method provides a solution for fair face recognition in challenging scenarios with imbalanced demographic attributes.
