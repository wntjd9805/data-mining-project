In recent years, point cloud analysis, specifically 3D segmentation, has become a popular area of research due to its wide range of applications in fields like autonomous driving, robotics, laser scanning, and virtual reality. Deep learning has significantly advanced the state-of-the-art in this field, but applying standard neural networks designed for grid-like data to point clouds is challenging because point data is unorganized and irregular. Current approaches involve projecting point clouds to regular representations or ingesting raw point clouds directly using specialized operators and architectures. However, these methods fail to address the challenge of learning a discriminative and robust point embedding space that can handle the variations in point data. To tackle this issue, we propose a clustering analysis based training scheme for point cloud segmentation. Our approach combines supervised learning of point-wise classification with unsupervised clustering and regularization of the feature space. The clustering is conducted within each labeled semantic class to discover hidden subclass patterns, capturing the fine-grained distribution of the training dataset. The discovered subclass patterns reshape the point embedding space, emphasizing inter-subclass discriminativeness and reducing intra-subclass variation. This regularization facilitates the discovery of within-class variation modes and improves point recognition. Our algorithm offers several advantages, including a dataset-level context-aware training strategy, efficient large-scale point cloud training, and seamless integration with existing point cloud segmentation networks. We evaluate our algorithm on four prominent point cloud segmentation models and conduct experiments on urban and indoor scenes as well as 4D segmentation of point cloud sequences. The results demonstrate significant gains in mean intersection over union (mIoU) compared to state-of-the-art models, showing the effectiveness and generality of our approach.
