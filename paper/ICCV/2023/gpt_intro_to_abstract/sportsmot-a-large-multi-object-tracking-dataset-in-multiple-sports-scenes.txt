Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a crucial task in computer vision, but current research has mainly focused on practical use cases such as crowded street scenes, dancing scenes, and driving scenarios. MOT for sports scenes, specifically tracking players on the court, has been overlooked. Prevailing state-of-the-art trackers have components for object localization, motion-based object association, and appearance-based association. However, these components have difficulty adapting to sports scenes due to differences in data distribution and object characteristics. Sports scenes involve fast and variable-speed movement, making existing motion-based association methods less effective. Additionally, players in sports scenes have similar yet distinguishable appearances, requiring more discriminative appearance models. To address these challenges and promote the development of tracking and sports analysis, we propose a new multi-object tracking dataset called SportsMOT. This dataset consists of 240 videos from basketball, volleyball, and football games, with over 1.6 million bounding boxes and annotations for every player on the court. The dataset has two key properties: fast and variable-speed motion and similar yet distinguishable appearance. We expect SportsMOT to encourage the development of trackers that excel in motion-based association and appearance-based association. Additionally, we benchmark some recent tracking approaches on SportsMOT and propose a new multi-object tracking framework called MixSort that improves objects association. Our extensive exploration studies provide insights into SportsMOT and contribute to the advancement of tracking and sports analysis.
