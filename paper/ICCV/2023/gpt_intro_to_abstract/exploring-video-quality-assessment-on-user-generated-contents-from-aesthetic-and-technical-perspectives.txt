Understanding and predicting human quality of experience (QoE) on diverse in-the-wild videos is a challenging problem in computer science. Previous studies have attempted to use machine algorithms to learn and predict human quality opinions on user-generated content (UGC), known as the UGC-VQA problem. However, due to the diversity of UGC videos and the lack of reference videos during subjective studies, the human-quality opinions are still ambiguous and may relate to different perspectives. In this paper, we aim to investigate the impact of aesthetic and technical perspectives on human quality perception of UGC videos. We conduct a comprehensive subjective study to collect opinions from both perspectives, as well as overall opinions on a large number of videos. With overall 450K opinions on 3,590 diverse UGC videos, we construct the first Disentangled Video Quality Database (DIVIDE-3k). We observe that human quality perception on UGC videos is affected by both aesthetic and technical perspectives. Motivated by this observation, we propose an objective UGC-VQA method, called DOVER, that accounts for both perspectives. DOVER consists of two branches, each dedicated to focusing on one perspective and is supervised by overall scores as well as aesthetic and technical opinions. Our contributions include the collection of DIVIDE-3k, the observation of the impact of aesthetic and technical perspectives on human quality perception, the proposal of DOVER as a state-of-the-art video quality evaluator, and the provision of quality predictions from a single perspective for various applications in practical scenarios.
