This paper introduces the problem of training object detectors with sparse annotations, specifically missing region or bounding box annotations. The authors highlight the importance of this problem, as obtaining crowd-sourced datasets can be expensive and time-consuming. They propose a novel framework called SparseDet, which operates on an image and its augmented counterpart to generate region proposals. The framework partitions the region proposals into labeled, unlabeled, and background regions and trains features extracted from unlabeled regions with a self-supervised loss. The authors also address the issue of evaluating SAOD methods by standardizing the generation of splits and proposing a new benchmark that assesses the semi-supervised learning capabilities of SAOD methods. Experimental results show that SparseDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on sparsely annotated object detection across multiple splits. Overall, this paper presents a comprehensive approach to training object detectors with sparse annotations and provides a standardized evaluation framework for SAOD methods.
