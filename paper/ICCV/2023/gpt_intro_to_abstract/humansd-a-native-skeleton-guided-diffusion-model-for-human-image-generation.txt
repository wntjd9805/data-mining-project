Controllable human image generation (HIG) is a field that aims to generate human-centric images based on specific conditions such as human pose, body parsing, and text. While earlier solutions based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational auto-encoders (VAEs) have been successful in certain applications, they have limitations in training difficulties and multi-modality fusion and alignment capabilities. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as the dominant technique in HIG, but they struggle to provide precise position control with text information, especially for deformable objects like humans. To address this issue, two concurrent controllable diffusion models, Control-Net and T2I-Adapter, have been proposed. These models introduce an additional learnable diffusion branch to improve controllability through the enforcement of various conditions. However, the learnable branch in these dual-branch diffusion models faces limitations and challenges in image feature editing. Moreover, the inference cost of these models increases compared to the original frozen stable diffusion model. In contrast, this work introduces a native skeleton-guided diffusion model called HumanSD. HumanSD directly fine-tunes the stable diffusion model with skeleton conditions concatenated to the latent embeddings, enabling native guidance of image generation with the desired pose. To mitigate model overfitting, a novel heatmap-guided denoising loss is proposed to disentangle conditioned humans from unconditioned backgrounds during the fine-tuning process. Additionally, training data plays a crucial role in model performance. This work fine-tunes HumanSD on three large-scale human-centric datasets, including GHI, LAION-Human, and Human-Art, which provide high-quality images and corresponding skeletal information and text descriptions. The main contributions of this work include the proposal of the HumanSD framework, the introduction of two large-scale datasets, and the demonstration of the effectiveness and efficiency of HumanSD through various evaluation metrics. HumanSD outperforms previous solutions in terms of pose control and human image generation quality, particularly in scenarios with sophisticated skeleton guidance.
