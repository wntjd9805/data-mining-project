The introduction discusses the success of the Detection Transformer (DETR) and the development of universal architectures for image segmentation. It also introduces the Video Panoptic Segmentation (VPS) task and the challenges faced by existing VPS models and universal video segmentation methods. The limitations of current solutions for video segmentation are examined, categorizing them into online and near-online methods. The study introduces Tube-Link, a universal video segmentation framework that combines the benefits of both online and near-online methods. Several key improvements to the Mask2Former-VIS meta-architecture are proposed, including extending the instance query into an entity query, improving the modeling of cross-tube relationships, and learning temporal association embeddings. The effectiveness of Tube-Link is demonstrated through evaluations on multiple video segmentation tasks and datasets, outperforming specialized architectures in various benchmarks.
