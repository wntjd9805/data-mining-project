Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in various computer vision tasks, including object detection. However, the performance of deep learning-based approaches heavily relies on balanced and representative datasets. Unfortunately, many real-world datasets follow a long-tailed distribution, where there is a significant imbalance between the number of instances in the head classes and the tail classes. This class imbalance leads to biased models towards the head classes and a significant degradation in performance for the tail classes.To address the long-tailed distribution problem in object detection, previous approaches have utilized data resampling and loss reweighting methods. Data resampling methods aim to rebalance the instance numbers of each category, while loss reweighting methods adjust the loss based on category statistics. Additionally, Hu et al. proposed the LST method, which employs class-incremental few-shot learning to address the long-tailed distribution problem. However, LST suffers from catastrophic forgetting of the head classes and struggles to sufficiently learn the tail classes during the incremental learning process.In this paper, we introduce a novel step-wise learning framework for long-tailed object detection. Our framework addresses the class imbalance issue by constructing smooth-tail data, consisting of a head class dominant data and a tail class dominant data. We fine-tune a pre-trained model on the head class dominant data to create a head class expert model. Subsequently, we train a unified model on the tail class dominant data while preserving the knowledge of the head classes from the head class expert model. We employ knowledge distillation at both the feature level and the classification head to facilitate the learning of tail classes from the head class expert model.Our contributions include the proposal of smooth-tail data to alleviate class imbalance and prevent catastrophic forgetting, the design of a novel step-wise learning framework for long-tailed object detection, and the achievement of state-of-the-art performances on long-tailed datasets. Our framework demonstrates impressive overall accuracy and particularly excels in accurately detecting rare categories.In conclusion, our frustratingly simple yet effective step-wise learning framework addresses the challenges posed by the long-tailed distribution problem in object detection, leading to improved performance in both overall accuracy and rare category detection.
