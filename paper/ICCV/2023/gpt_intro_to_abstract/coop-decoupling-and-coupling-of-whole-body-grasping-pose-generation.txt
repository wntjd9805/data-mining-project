In this paper, we propose a novel framework called COOP for generating life-like whole-body grasping poses for virtual humans in a 3D scene. Unlike existing works, our approach can handle objects located at various heights in the vicinity of a human, without requiring any temporal aspects such as object movement. We address the challenges of generating realistic grasping poses by decoupling and subsequently coupling the generation of hand and body poses. We introduce a fine-grained representation of hand-object contact and a Body Graph Transformer model to generate hand poses and body poses separately. Our framework also includes a unified optimization stage that couples the generated body parts and introduces contact constraints and balance constraints. Our contributions include the COOP framework, the Body Graph Transformer model, and a unique pre-training method that can utilize out-of-domain data. Our framework can be easily applied to other domains and tasks in whole-body pose generation. We also propose an evaluation method to test the generalization ability of different whole-body pose generation methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.
