Existing semantic segmentation methods in computer vision are primarily developed for day-time scenes with sufficient and uniform lighting. However, practical applications often require visual systems to work under insufficient and complicated lighting conditions, such as night-time scenes. This discrepancy in lighting can lead to performance drops in existing day-time methods and calls for the development of night-time segmentation methods. Previous approaches have utilized unsupervised domain adaptation techniques to transfer knowledge from labeled day-time domain to unlabeled night-time domain, but the lack of corresponding labels at night limits the improvement in segmentation performance. To address this issue, a large-scale night-time dataset called NightCity has been introduced, resulting in substantial improvement in night-time scenes compared to pure day-time methods. However, these methods still parse scenes based on lighting-entangled representations, which are not suitable for challenging lighting conditions in night-time scenes. In this paper, we propose a disentangle then parse (DTP) paradigm for night-time semantic segmentation to address the challenge of insufficient and complex lighting. We disentangle the light-invariant and light-specific components from night-time images, allowing us to obtain more discriminative features related to the content itself. We introduce a semantic-oriented disentanglement (SOD) framework that utilizes semantic constraints to disentangle the images and generate training data with ground truth. Additionally, we propose an illumination-aware parser (IAParser) that learns the correlation between illumination and semantics to improve segmentation performance. We also present the NightCity-fine dataset, which corrects erroneous labels in the existing NightCity dataset, providing a more robust benchmark for night-time segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method and the reliability of the NightCity-fine dataset. Overall, our contributions include the DTP paradigm for night-time segmentation, the SOD framework for disentanglement with semantic constraints, the IAParser for utilizing illumination as a cue, and the NightCity-fine dataset for improved evaluation of night-time segmentation models.
