This paper introduces snapshot spectral imaging (SSI), which involves acquiring a 3D spatial-spectral data cube containing spectral information in a single exposure. The paper discusses the visual and discriminatory capabilities offered by the spectral and temporal dimensions of spectrum, highlighting the potential for high-dimensional visual capability. The authors argue that high temporal-spatial-spectral resolution data can provide a more comprehensive observation and measurement of dynamic objects or processes. The paper then compares SSI methods with traditional imaging spectrometer scanning strategies, highlighting the specific system designs and potential applications of SSI. However, the authors identify shortcomings in the compactness, resolution, and robustness of existing SSI systems. They propose a framework called ADIS that utilizes a single mask at non-focal plane locations to achieve diffractive effects, improving the compactness of spectral imaging systems. The paper also discusses the trade-offs associated with filter array-based SSI schemes and presents a novel encoding scheme and deep unfolding method for sub-super-resolution reconstruction. The authors highlight the advantages of the ADIS method in terms of spatial invariance and simplicity of calibration. The paper concludes by outlining the contributions of the research, including the novel SSI framework, diffraction-projection-guided algorithm, prototype device, and theoretical analysis.
