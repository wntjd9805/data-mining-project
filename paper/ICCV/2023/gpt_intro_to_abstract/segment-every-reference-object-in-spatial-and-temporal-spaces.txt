The introduction introduces the concept of reference-guided object segmentation, which involves segmenting a specified object using given references. It discusses three representative tasks in this field: referring image segmentation (RIS), referring video object segmentation (RVOS), and semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS). These tasks play a crucial role in vision understanding and have various applications. The introduction highlights the need for a unified model for these tasks, as the current fragmented approach requires separate models and results in redundant parameters. The authors propose a unified model called UniRef that can perform multiple tasks by specifying the corresponding references. The challenges in unifying these tasks are also discussed, including the variations in methods across different fields and the differences in solving RVOS and VOS tasks. The introduction concludes by summarizing the contributions of the paper, which include the proposal of UniRef, the introduction of a UniFusion module to inject reference information into the network, and the achievement of state-of-the-art performance in RIS and RVOS tasks.
