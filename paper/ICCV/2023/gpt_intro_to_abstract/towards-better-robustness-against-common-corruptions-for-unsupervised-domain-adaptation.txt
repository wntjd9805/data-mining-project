Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in various applications. However, they often fail to generalize well to new data due to the domain shift problem, where data comes from a different target domain. Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to address this issue by learning domain-invariant representations from labeled source domain data and unlabeled target domain data. Existing UDA methods mainly focus on adversarial training to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations, but they neglect the robustness against common corruptions that often occur in practical applications. Common corruptions, such as noise and blur, are more relevant to real-world scenarios. In recent studies, data-dependent regularization methods have been investigated to improve robustness in supervised learning, but they are not directly applicable to UDA problems due to the lack of labeled data. This paper proposes a novel unsupervised adversarial regularization framework called Distributionally and Discretely Adversarial Regularization (DDAR) to enhance robustness against common corruptions in UDA. DDAR formulates a min-max optimization using a distribution distance, considering adversarial data as worst-case examples with respect to the latent distribution of natural data. By minimizing the distribution distance between natural and adversarial data, DDAR enables the model to generalize well to unknown types of common corruptions sharing similar distribution with adversarial data. The proposed framework also integrates an image discretization scheme to improve adversarial regularization. Additionally, the distribution distance measurement is updated to the Wasserstein distance on semantic space to provide a tighter upper bound for regularization. Empirical experiments on UDA benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous unsupervised approaches, such as virtual adversarial training and adversarial feature desensitization, in terms of generalization to unknown common corruptions. Overall, this work contributes a novel unsupervised adversarial regularization method to improve robustness against common corruptions in UDA, offering new insights and achieving state-of-the-art performance.
