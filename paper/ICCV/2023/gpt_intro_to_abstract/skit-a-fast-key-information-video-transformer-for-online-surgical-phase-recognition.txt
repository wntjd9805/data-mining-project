Surgical Artificial Intelligence aims to understand surgical workflows, evaluate surgeon performance, and provide real-time assistance. One crucial task towards achieving these goals is surgical phase recognition, which involves accurately predicting the phase of a surgical video frame. While offline recognition uses past and future information, online recognition only relies on past information. This paper focuses on online phase recognition.Previous work in surgical phase recognition employed methods such as Dynamic Time Warping, Hidden Markov Models, and machine learning models. However, these methods relied on handcrafted features specific to the surgery type, limiting their generalizability. Deep learning approaches introduced more sophisticated spatio-temporal feature extraction mechanisms, but annotation requirements hindered their use in online recognition.Online surgical phase recognition requires models that can capture long-range temporal dependencies, as surgical videos can range from 40 minutes to a few hours. RNN-based, CNN-based, and Transformer-based models have been proposed, each with their own limitations. RNNs struggle with long-term dependencies, CNNs may lose information with long sequences, and Transformers have quadratic time and memory complexity.To address these issues, this paper proposes a fast Key information video Transformer (SKiT) for online surgical phase recognition. SKiT leverages a key pooling method to efficiently and effectively record global key events along the temporal dimension. By combining this global information with the current local feature, SKiT accurately recognizes the current surgical phase. The proposed model offers several advantages, including O(1) time complexity for key pooling, independence of inference time from video length, and state-of-the-art performance.The contributions of this paper include the introduction of a new key pooling method, an efficient and stable approach for online recognition, and an accurate model with improved efficiency. The code for SKiT is available on the GitHub repository.
