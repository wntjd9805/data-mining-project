Indoor scene understanding from partial observations is a complex task in computer science that involves generating 3D semantic scene models for indoor applications. Early approaches focused on reconstructing room structures and objects separately from corresponding detections. However, more recent methods have proposed end-to-end learning techniques that can simultaneously estimate layouts, detect objects, and predict shapes in a single pass for semantic scene reconstruction. In recent years, there has been increased interest in directly detecting and modeling objects from sparse point clouds, leading to improved performance in detection and instance reconstruction. Despite these advancements, there are still two key issues that limit the quality of semantic reconstruction: noisy instance feature learning during detection and the difficulty of retrieving instances from sparse point clouds for reconstruction. The detection phase requires grouping features to learn instance representations. Existing methods, such as ball query and 3D convolution, often mix noise with informative features due to their fixed grouping range. Voting-based strategies attempt to overcome this issue by clustering object features but can generate unconstrained grouping areas that introduce outliers. While some methods restrict the grouping space using coarse box proposals, objects with irregular shapes can still result in points falling far beyond targets. During the reconstruction stage, the retrieval of outlier-free object points is crucial for accurate object recovery. However, the noise introduced during feature grouping in the detection phase makes it challenging to use the grouped points as reconstruction priors. Current methods resort to additional foreground classifiers or complex instance segmentation backbones to sample object points, but these approaches increase the risk of gluing different instances together or misclassifying background points. To address these issues, we propose a shape anchor-guided learning strategy called AncLearn. This strategy generates surface anchors that fit feature grouping areas to object shape distributions, effectively merging local target-focused features and constructing a shape-aware search space for robustly sampling instance points without segmentation during reconstruction. The proposed anchor-guided learning strategy can be easily integrated into an end-to-end learning system for object detection, layout estimation, and instance reconstruction in indoor scene understanding. The main contributions of this work include the development of a shape anchor guided learning strategy to address noisy feature learning and instance point retrieval issues, the integration of this strategy into a holistic scene understanding system, and extensive experiments demonstrating high-quality semantic scene reconstruction and state-of-the-art performance in instance detection and mesh prediction.
