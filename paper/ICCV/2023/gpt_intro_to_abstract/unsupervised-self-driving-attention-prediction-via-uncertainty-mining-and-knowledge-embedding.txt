The development of autonomous driving has led to growing interest in predicting attention regions for self-driving systems. These attention regions provide contextual information and assist in locating salient areas in the traffic scene. These salient areas are considered the riskiest, and small perception errors can pose a significant threat to driver safety. Therefore, accurate attention area prediction can help enhance perception accuracy, reduce driving risks, increase explainability, and improve the reliability of autonomous driving systems.Existing methods for self-driving attention prediction rely on large-scale labeled datasets, which are difficult to build and unreliable. These methods suffer from potential biases and a mismatch between the collected data and real-world environments. Additionally, bridging the domain gap between self-driving scenes and pre-trained models trained on natural scenes remains a challenge.To address these issues, we propose a novel unsupervised framework for self-driving attention prediction. Our approach does not use ground-truth labels from self-driving datasets and instead relies on pseudo-labels generated from models pre-trained on natural scene datasets. We train a model on the source domain and adapt it to the target domain using unsupervised domain adaptation techniques. Our proposed model includes an uncertainty mining branch to exploit pseudo-label uncertainties for reliable results and a knowledge embedding block to transfer traffic knowledge into the natural domain.Our contributions include the introduction of an unsupervised framework for self-driving attention prediction, the incorporation of an uncertainty mining branch to produce plausible attention maps, the design of a knowledge embedding block to bridge the domain gap between autonomous driving and common domains, and extensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method compared to fully-supervised approaches.Overall, our work presents a novel approach to self-driving attention prediction, addressing the limitations of existing methods and achieving promising results.
