This paper introduces VoroMesh, a novel method for geometry processing of three-dimensional shapes using a differentiable surface representation based on the 3D Voronoi diagram. Traditional mesh-based learning methods face difficulties in handling the combinatorial nature and non-stable predictions of vertex connectivity. In contrast, VoroMesh leverages the geometric properties of the Voronoi diagram to formulate a differentiable optimization of the generators, resulting in an adaptive discretization of 3D surfaces. The paper proposes a novel loss function, called the VoroLoss, which optimizes the Voronoi generators to fit a target shape without explicitly computing the Voronoi diagram. Experimental results show that VoroMesh outperforms existing methods in terms of geometric fidelity and can be integrated into a learning pipeline for reconstructing closed and non-self-intersecting meshes. Overall, this work contributes a powerful tool for data-driven mesh prediction and geometry processing.
