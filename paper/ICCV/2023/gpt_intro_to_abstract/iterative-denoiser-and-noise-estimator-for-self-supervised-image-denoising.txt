Image denoising is a crucial problem in image processing, aiming to remove noise while preserving the details and structures of the original image. Various methods have been proposed, including traditional hand-crafted priors and more recent deep learning approaches. However, the reliance on high-quality noisy/clean training pairs limits the application of deep learning methods in real scenes. To address this challenge, two common technical approaches have been developed: the use of synthetic noisy/clean image pairs and the design of unsupervised and self-supervised training strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel Denoise-Corrupt-Denoise training pipeline (DCD-Net) for self-supervised image denoising. Our method overcomes the limitations of existing self-supervised methods by iteratively training a denoiser with a noise estimation model. This allows the denoising network to gradually approach the performance of a strong weakly supervised baseline. We evaluate the proposed DCD-Net on synthetic and real image denoising benchmarks and demonstrate its superiority over leading self-supervised methods. The contributions of this work include a comprehensive analysis of existing denoising methods, the proposal of the Denoise-Corrupt-Denoise learning pipeline, and the application of our denoising framework on both synthetic and real image denoising benchmarks. The results validate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach.
