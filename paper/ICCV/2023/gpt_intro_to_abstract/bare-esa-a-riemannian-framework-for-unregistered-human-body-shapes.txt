The increasing interest in analyzing the morphological variability of the human anatomy in the past decade has led to the need for a framework that can model and retrieve changes in full body shape and pose. This framework would have wide-ranging applications in graphics, including 3D human modeling, augmented and virtual reality for animated films and computer games. The desired operations include shape interpolation, shape extrapolation, and random shape generation. Additionally, there is a need for a natural disentanglement of changes in pose and shape to enable motion transfer. A major challenge in human body shape analysis is the registration problem, where raw scans of human bodies lack point correspondences and consistent mesh structures. Traditionally, this issue has been addressed by finding new representations of meshes and estimating point correspondences using external frameworks. However, recent research suggests that separating registration and subsequent analysis can introduce bias and that an integrated approach can improve performance.To address these challenges, this paper introduces a new pipeline that quantifies geometric differences between unregistered human body scans without prior point correspondences or consistent parametrization. The focus is not solely on metric comparisons but also on estimating plausible deformation processes between human body scans. A transformation model is introduced to disentangle changes in pose and shape, enabling realistic interpolation, extrapolation, motion transfer, and shape generation. The approach leverages the varifold representation and kernel metrics, eliminating the need for consistent mesh structures and performing well even in the presence of topological noise.Unlike current deep learning frameworks, the encoding component of this approach relies on pre-trained deformation bases for shape and pose changes but is coupled with a non-Euclidean metric in the latent space. This simplifies the training process and does not require large amounts of training data. The results of this approach demonstrate improved interpretability of human body paths and generalization to unseen data.
