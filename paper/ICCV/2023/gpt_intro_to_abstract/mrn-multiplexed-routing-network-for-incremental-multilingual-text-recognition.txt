Scene text recognition (STR) has made significant advancements in recent years, thanks to deep learning techniques. However, the task of multilingual text recognition (MLTR) remains challenging, especially in practical scenarios where different languages are introduced sequentially. This scenario, known as incremental multilingual text recognition (IMLTR), poses unique challenges, including rehearsal-imbalance, data imbalance, and class imbalance. Existing methods for addressing these challenges require retraining on mixed multilingual data, increasing training costs and potentially leading to imbalances between old and new data. Additionally, incremental learning (IL) methods typically assume balanced datasets, which may not reflect real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a novel approach called Multiplexed Routing Network (MRN) for IMLTR. MRN involves training a new text recognition model at each learning step and utilizing previously trained models for parallel feature extraction. A domain MLP router predicts the probability of different languages, and the features are used for character recognition in their respective domains. The results obtained at both the language and character levels are fused to decode the recognized character sequence. Our experiments on two benchmarks show that MRN outperforms existing IL methods, achieving significant accuracy improvements. The proposed MRN not only addresses rehearsal-imbalance but also opens up new possibilities for IL in text recognition.
