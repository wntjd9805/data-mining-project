Photometric stereo is a technique used to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) shapes from images taken under different lighting conditions. It offers detailed surface shape recovery, which is useful for applications such as additive manufacturing and rendering. Existing benchmark datasets for evaluating photometric stereo methods focus on non-Lambertian surfaces, making it difficult to assess the accuracy of surface detail recovery. Additionally, these datasets lack a comprehensive evaluation of near-planar surfaces. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a new dataset called DiLiGenT-Π, which consists of 30 real-world near-planar objects with varying geometric details. The dataset includes objects with metallic, specular, rough, and translucent surface reflectance. To provide ground truth data, an optical profilometer is used to capture ultra-precise surface 3D structures. DiLiGenT-Π is then used to evaluate current photometric stereo methods in terms of their performance on detailed structures and near-planar surfaces. The evaluation results highlight the challenges faced by learning-based photometric stereo methods, uncalibrated photometric stereo for near-planar surfaces, and the impact of different surface reflectance types on surface detail recovery. The paper concludes by presenting new challenges and open problems for future research in photometric stereo. Overall, this work contributes to the field by providing a benchmark dataset for near-planar surfaces with rich geometric details, evaluating the performance of photometric stereo methods on surface details, and identifying obstacles specific to planar detailed objects.
