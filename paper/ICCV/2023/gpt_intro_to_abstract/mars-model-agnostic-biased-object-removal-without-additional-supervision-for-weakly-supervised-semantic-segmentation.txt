Fully-supervised semantic segmentation (FSSS) requires significant time and domain expertise to prepare pixel-wise annotations. In contrast, weakly-supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level supervision reduces the labeling cost. However, the false positive (FP) is a crucial bottleneck in WSSS performance. This paper addresses the biased problem in WSSS by proposing a novel fully-automatic biased object removal method called MARS (Model-Agnostic biased object Removal without additional Supervision). MARS leverages unsupervised semantic segmentation (USS) to separate biased and target objects in WSSS using two key observations related to the integration of USS and WSSS. MARS achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets, including PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014, without requiring additional datasets or human supervision. This method significantly improves the performance of representative WSSS methods and validates the effectiveness of USS grafting on WSSS.
