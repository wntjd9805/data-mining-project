Space-filling curves (SFCs) are widely used in computer vision tasks such as image compression, data clustering, and point cloud analysis. Traditional SFCs have fixed structures, limiting their flexibility for different data and tasks. In this paper, we propose data-adaptive SFCs to improve their performance. Previous works have focused on using image context to generate SFCs, but these methods are computationally expensive. To address this, we introduce an Effective-GCN module that reduces the memory cost of graph neural networks (GNN). We also propose a new learning scheme for finding optimal SFCs and adopt a multi-stage Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm to generate stable SFCs. Our experiments show that our method outperforms both DNN-based and traditional methods.
