In recent decades, deep learning methods have made significant progress in various fields such as object detection, face recognition, and natural language processing. However, these methods are often based on the assumption that the samples or domains seen during training are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). In reality, unseen samples or domains often have different distributions from the training set, causing the learned models to perform poorly on these unseen samples. Domain generalization (DG) is a technique that aims to address this problem by learning a robust model that can generalize to unseen domains. Previous DG methods focused on domain invariant feature learning and domain alignment constraints, which emphasize the common information between domains but neglect domain-specific information. This limitation restricts the discriminative ability of these methods and leads to poor generalization on unseen samples.To overcome these limitations, we propose a new method that integrates multiple domains for domain generalization. Instead of tightly aligning the domains or considering them separately, our method organizes the multiple domains together, pulling them closer while preserving their individuality. We achieve this by using an instance adaptive classifier that deviates slightly from the universal classifier, allowing all instances of the same category with different variations to disperse around the class centers. This dispersion leads to better generalization for unseen samples.Our contributions include: 1. Proposing a new method that integrates multiple domains for domain generalization by using an instance-adaptive classifier.2. Introducing a deviation norm scaling hyper-parameter to control the shifting degree of the learned instance-adaptive classifier.3. Conducting experimental analyses that demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and show that our predicted classifier deviation preserves category semantic and domain relation information.Our proposed method addresses the limitations of previous DG methods and provides a better approach for domain generalization.
