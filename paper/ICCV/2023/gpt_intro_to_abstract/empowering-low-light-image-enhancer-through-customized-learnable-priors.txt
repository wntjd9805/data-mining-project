Low-light conditions often result in images with limited visibility and noise, which can negatively affect downstream computer vision tasks. The field of low-light image enhancement aims to recover details and remove noise from such images. Existing approaches can be classified into two categories: traditional methods and deep learning-based methods.Traditional methods formulate the low-light image enhancement problem as an optimization task and use image priors as regularization terms. However, designing hand-crafted priors is challenging and these methods have limited representative ability in complex scenes. On the other hand, deep learning-based methods have shown promising results in low-light image enhancement. However, these methods often lack transparency and interpretability.To address this, the authors propose a customized unfolding paradigm called Customized Unfolding Enhancer (CUE). The authors analyze the characteristics of the illumination and noise components in low-light images and aim to leverage their intrinsic properties to improve transparency. They utilize the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) to customize learnable priors for illumination and noise. The illumination prior is trained to preserve the structure of the image while adapting to different lighting conditions, and the noise prior learns the histograms of oriented gradients to eliminate noise.The proposed paradigm integrates the customized priors into the low-light image enhancement process through two perspectives: structure flow and optimization flow. In the structure flow, the illumination prior is embedded into the design of the proximal operator in the Retinex decomposition unfolding process. In the optimization flow, the noise prior is redeveloped as a regularization term to constrain the gradient representation consistency between the enhanced and normal-light images.The authors conducted extensive experiments on multiple low-light image benchmarks, and the results demonstrate the superiority of their paradigm over state-of-the-art methods. They also verified the effectiveness of the proposed learnable noise prior for image denoising.In conclusion, the authors activate the potential of customized learnable illumination and noise priors through their CUE paradigm, improving transparency and interpretability in low-light image enhancement. The proposed paradigm outperforms existing methods and the customized noise prior is effective for image denoising.
