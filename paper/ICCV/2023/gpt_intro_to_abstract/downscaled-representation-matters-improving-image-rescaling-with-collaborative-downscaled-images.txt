Image rescaling is a widely used technique in computer vision that involves downscaling high-resolution images to visually valid low-resolution images and then upscaling them to recover the original high-resolution images. Downscaled images are important for saving storage or bandwidth and fitting screens with different resolutions. In applications such as image/video restoration and communication, downscaled images are commonly used to obtain high-resolution images/videos on edge devices while saving storage and reducing transmission latency. However, existing image rescaling methods often have limitations in terms of reconstruction performance. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative image downscaling method, called Hierarchical Collaborative Downscaling (HCD), which optimizes the representations in both high-resolution and low-resolution domains to learn a better downscaled representation. Unlike previous approaches that focus on learning the downscaling or upscaling models, our method directly optimizes the downscaled representation to improve image rescaling performance. We formulate the learning process as a bi-level optimization problem and solve it by generating collaborative high-resolution and low-resolution examples alternatively. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that our HCD method significantly improves the reconstruction performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our method achieves a substantial improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) compared to state-of-the-art image rescaling models, such as HCFlow, with a 0.7 dB improvement on Set5 for 4Ã— rescaling. Overall, our proposed method provides a new perspective and approach for improving image rescaling performance by enhancing the downscaled representation.
