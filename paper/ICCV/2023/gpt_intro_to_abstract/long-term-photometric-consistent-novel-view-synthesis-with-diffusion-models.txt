This paper introduces a novel view synthesis (NVS) method that generates plausible image sequence continuations from a trajectory of given camera views. Unlike most current approaches, which focus on generating views close to the input and visible from some subset of the given views, our method tackles the more extreme case of a single input view and aims to generate consistent and harmonious views of both visible and previously unseen elements. To address this challenge, we propose a NVS method based on denoising diffusion models, which can produce multiple plausible novel views by generating new samples from the model. We demonstrate that our model can generate a sequence of views with little or no overlap with the starting view. We also introduce a new metric for evaluating the geometric consistency of generated views, independent of image quality. We evaluate our method on real and synthetic datasets in terms of both image quality and geometric consistency, and also test its generalization ability on novel trajectories.
