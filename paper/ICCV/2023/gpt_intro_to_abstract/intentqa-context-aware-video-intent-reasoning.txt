This paper introduces the concept of IntentQA, a new task in video question answering (VideoQA) that focuses on intent reasoning. Intent understanding is crucial for human intelligence, as humans interpret events based on intentions rather than the entirety of action details. However, existing VideoQA work has not focused on intent understanding. The paper proposes a new dataset for IntentQA and presents a model with three modules that handle different contexts: situational context, contrastive context, and commonsense context. The main contributions of this paper include the introduction of the IntentQA task, the collection and annotation of a large-scale VideoQA dataset, and the proposal of a Context-aware Video Intent Reasoning model (CaVIR) with benchmark results.
