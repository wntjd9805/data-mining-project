In recent years, significant progress has been made in recovering human mesh from single person images. However, accurately reconstructing groups of people from large-scale crowded scenes remains challenging. The existing top-down methods predict individuals from cropped image patches, while the bottom-up methods parse inter-person interactions using pixel-level cues. However, bottom-up methods fail in large-scale scenes due to downsampling images. Some works address low-resolution inputs using techniques like composite fields and occlusion augmentation, but cannot reconstruct absolute body meshes in camera coordinates. Additionally, the challenges of a large number of people, mutual occlusions, and complex spatial distribution further complicate the problem. In this paper, we propose a relational reasoning approach to promote human mesh recovery in large-scale scenes by exploiting collective and social interactions in crowds. We address two technical obstacles - limited hardware and the complex correlation among individuals and groups. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a multiscale hypergraph network that represents individuals and groups in different scales and facilitates relational reasoning. We utilize bounding-box information and construct a hypergraph to represent individuals and groups. We introduce differentiable optimization to infer the graph topology and assign individuals with high feature similarity to the same group. After relational reasoning, we can regress the groups of people with absolute positions. We also build pseudo ground-truth on two crowd datasets to alleviate the domain gap for synthetic data and promote future research in pose estimation and human behavior understanding in large-scale crowded scenes. The contributions of our work include reconstructing crowds from single color images and demonstrating the essential knowledge that crowds can provide for multi-person mesh recovery. We also propose a hypergraph relational reasoning network to improve human mesh recovery by exploiting collective and social interactions in crowded scenes. Finally, we build pseudo ground-truth on two crowd datasets to facilitate research in pose estimation and human behavior understanding in large-scale crowded scenes.
