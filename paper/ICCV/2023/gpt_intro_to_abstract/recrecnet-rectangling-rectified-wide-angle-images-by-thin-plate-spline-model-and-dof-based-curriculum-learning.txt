This paper introduces the problem of distortion induced by wide-angle lenses in images and proposes a novel rectification algorithm called RecRecNet. Existing rectification methods focus on correcting the image content but often distort the image boundaries, leading to performance degradation in vision perception models. RecRecNet aims to achieve a win-win representation by correcting the distorted content while keeping the image boundary straight. The algorithm utilizes a thin-plate spline motion module to perform non-linear and non-rigid transformations for rectangling the rectified wide-angle image. Additionally, a degree-of-freedom (DoF)-based curriculum learning is employed to facilitate progressive deformation rules and improve convergence. The paper also provides an analysis of how the deformed boundary affects visual perception models and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The major contributions of this work are the development of RecRecNet for win-win rectification representation, the introduction of the thin-plate spline motion module, and the design of DoF-based curriculum learning.
