The paper introduces the concept of Class Incremental Learning (CIL) in the field of Continual Learning. The paper focuses on Non-Exemplar based CIL (NECIL), which aims to preserve old knowledge without storing exemplars. NECIL methods often struggle with overlapping old and new class representations, leading to catastrophic forgetting. The paper proposes a solution called NAPA-VQ, which incorporates neighborhood-aware prototype augmentation with vector quantization to create clearer class boundaries and reduce representation overlap. NAPA-VQ consists of two components: Neighborhood-aware Vector Quantizer (NA-VQ) and Neighborhood-aware Prototype Augmenter (NA-PA). NA-VQ learns the topology of the feature space manifold to identify neighboring classes and increase their separability, while NA-PA generates surrogate exemplars for old class prototypes. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of NAPA-VQ in NECIL, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods on various datasets.
