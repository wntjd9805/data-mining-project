Instance segmentation for 3D point clouds is a challenging task due to the irregularity and sparsity of 3D data. Existing methods primarily focus on 2D images and are not particularly effective for 3D point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called PBNet for 3D point cloud instance segmentation. We address the limitations of distance clustering-based methods by introducing a binary clustering strategy. We divide foreground points into two categories: high and low density points (HPs vs. LPs) based on their density on the offset branch. By binarizing neighbor points between adjacent objects as LPs, we effectively separate adjacent objects. We combine semantic prediction and neighbor voting to assign LPs, resulting in complete instance clustering.To handle potential offset errors and density threshold effects, we search for surrounding instances to construct local scenes. We encode each instance in the local scene to generate a corresponding weight mask, enabling the network to focus on the primary instance. By combining global and local features, PBNet achieves superior performance on both the ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets.The contributions of our work include the development of a novel binarized clustering method for effective instance segmentation in 3D point clouds. We also propose the construction of local scenes combined with weight masks to refine instances and improve performance. Our end-to-end 3D instance segmentation framework outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, ranking first in the mAP metric of the ScanNetV2 official benchmark challenge.
