Abstract:Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) involves detecting multiple objects and maintaining their identities in a video stream. It has various applications in areas such as action recognition, behavior analysis, and autonomous driving. Tracking-by-detection methods have been widely used but face challenges when dealing with complex scenarios. Transformer-based tracking methods have shown promise in addressing these challenges but still struggle with certain issues. In this paper, we propose a Memory-augmented Multi-Object Tracking method with Transformer (MeMOTR) that leverages long-term temporal information to improve tracking performance. Our approach utilizes a long-term memory with exponential recursion update algorithm for each tracked object and incorporates it into the track embedding. We also introduce a memory-attention layer and adaptive aggregation to enhance the representation of multiple tracked targets. Additionally, we address the semantic information gap between detection and tracking queries by performing preliminary object detection using a light decoder. Experimental results on the DanceTrack dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method, particularly in association metrics. Evaluation on the MOT17 dataset and BDD100K dataset further validates the effectiveness of our approach.
