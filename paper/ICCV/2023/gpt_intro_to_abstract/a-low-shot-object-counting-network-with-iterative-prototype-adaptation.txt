Object counting is an important task in computer vision that involves estimating the number of specific objects in an image. Previous solutions based on object detectors have focused on well-annotated categories such as people, cars, and animal species. However, these methods require large annotated training datasets and are not applicable to counting new classes with limited annotations. To address this problem, recent research has explored the area of low-shot counting, which includes few-shot and zero-shot counting.Few-shot counters aim to count all instances of a class with only a few annotated examples. This is achieved by extracting image and exemplar features and matching them using correlation. The resulting intermediate image representation is then used to regress into a 2D object density map, which provides an estimate of the object count. The methods for constructing the intermediate image representation differ, with some using Siamese similarity, cross-attention, or feature and similarity fusion.In contrast, zero-shot counters focus on counting the most frequent class without any annotations. These methods either identify possible exemplars through majority voting or implicitly through attention modules.However, existing few-shot counting methods suffer from a loss of object shape information, which affects the accuracy of the density map. Some recent works have addressed this issue by using complex architectures for learning a nonlinear similarity function. In this paper, we propose a simpler counting architecture called LOCA (Low-shot Object Counting network with iterative prototype Adaptation) to address this problem.The main contribution of LOCA is a new object prototype extraction module that separately extracts the exemplar shape and appearance queries. The shape queries are gradually adapted into object prototypes by considering the exemplar appearance as well as the appearance of non-annotated objects. This approach leads to excellent localization properties and highly accurate counts.Our experiments on the FSC147 benchmark demonstrate that LOCA outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant relative performance gains. It also outperforms methods specifically designed for one-shot counting and achieves state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot counting. Additionally, LOCA demonstrates excellent cross-dataset generalization on the CARPK car counting dataset.In conclusion, our proposed LOCA method improves few-shot object counting by explicitly addressing exemplar shape information, resulting in more accurate counting by constructing strong prototypes that generalize well across images.
