Image compositing is a common technique in vision and graphics to create new images by inserting objects from one image into another. However, these composite images often appear synthetic to human observers due to color and texture inconsistencies. Previous methods for image harmonization can be categorized into non-deep learning-based approaches and deep learning-based approaches. Non-deep learning methods manipulate low-level image statistics to match the foreground object with the background, but often produce unrealistic results. Deep learning methods utilize region appearances and priors to constrain the harmonization process, but can still result in dull or inconsistent colors. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for harmonizing cut-and-paste images by performing the harmonization process in a high dynamic range (HDR) color space. We address the problem of color inconsistencies by harmonizing scene illumination differences in an intermediate HDR color space, which preserves the original scene radiance. Our approach involves a neural network that converts the source image to the HDR domain, performs the harmonization process, and then converts the harmonized image back to the low dynamic range sRGB space. To estimate the HDR version of the input image, we introduce an image unprocessing module that employs a diffusion process. We also propose a color harmonization module that models image colors in the estimated linear color space. Our experiments demonstrate that our method produces visually pleasing results and outperforms state-of-the-art harmonization approaches. The main contributions of this paper are: 1. The proposal of a novel neural approach for image harmonization in the linear color space, allowing accurate modeling of object colors based on scene radiance.2. The introduction of two novel modules: an image unprocessing module to convert the source image to a high dynamic range linear color space, and a color harmonization module to harmonize object colors based on scene radiance information.3. Extensive experimental results validating the superiority of our proposed method compared to existing harmonization methods.
