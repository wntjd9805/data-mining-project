Autonomous driving has been extensively researched in the field of computer vision, with a focus on tasks such as 3D detection, segmentation, and localization. Recently, there has been a shift towards the problem of motion forecasting, which aims to provide insights into the future trajectories of objects to improve decision making mechanisms. Traditional datasets in this domain only focus on forecasting pedestrian trajectories in a campus setting, treating each agent separately and lacking interaction. To address this limitation, the Waymo Open Motion dataset introduced interactive trajectory prediction with interacting agents. In this paper, we contribute a new large-scale dataset called INT2, which focuses on interactive trajectory prediction at intersections. INT2 offers high-quality data captured by a multi-sensor system, including RGB cameras and LiDARs, and applies state-of-the-art detection and tracking algorithms. The dataset contains 612,000 scenes, each lasting 1 minute, providing a comprehensive view of traffic at intersections. Additionally, INT2 includes rich information such as road maps, 3D agent boxes, and traffic light information. This dataset is ideal for studying domain mismatch in trajectory prediction, as minor errors caused by domain mismatch can significantly impact iterative prediction models. Furthermore, INT2 solves the challenge of defining domains in trajectory prediction by capturing data at fixed intersections, allowing for clear differentiation between rush-hour and non-rush-hour data. To facilitate benchmarking, we provide in-domain and cross-domain trajectory prediction results using the M2I method and release baseline training frameworks and pre-trained models along with the dataset.
