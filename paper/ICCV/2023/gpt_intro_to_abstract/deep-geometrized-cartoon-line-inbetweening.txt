Cartoon animation has evolved over the years, but the process of hand-drawing each frame for 2D animation remains time-consuming. Developing an algorithm that can automate the process of generating intermediate line drawings, known as "inbetweening," can greatly improve productivity. Line inbetweening poses challenges due to the sparse structure of line drawings and the lack of texture compared to full-textured images. Existing raster-image-based methods struggle with accurate motion prediction and loss of detail. To address these challenges, we propose AnimeInbet, a deep learning framework that performs inbetweening on geometrized line drawings. By transforming the source images into vector graphs, our framework overcomes the challenges of pixel-wise correspondence and preserves the intricate line structures. Compared to existing methods, AnimeInbet produces clean and complete intermediate line drawings. This is achieved by finding matching vertices between the input line drawing graphs, repositioning them to create a new intermediate graph, and predicting a visibility mask to erase occluded vertices and edges. We introduce MixamoLine240, a line art dataset with ground truth geometrization and vertex matching labels, to facilitate supervised training. Our work presents a challenging task in line inbetweening and offers a superior method along with a comprehensive training dataset.
