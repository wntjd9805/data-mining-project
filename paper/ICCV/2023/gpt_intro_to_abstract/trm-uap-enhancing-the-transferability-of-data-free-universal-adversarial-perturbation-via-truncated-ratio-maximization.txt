Adversarial Examples (AEs) are tiny perturbations intentionally added to benign samples that can significantly disrupt the prediction results of deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly for image recognition tasks. These AEs are not only imperceptible to the human eye but also easily transferable among different DNN models, making them a serious threat to the security and reliability of DNN models. Many methods have been proposed to craft AEs that can fool a wide range of DNN models, but they often fail to perturb samples that are not specifically designed for. To address this issue, a universal attack approach called universal adversarial perturbation (UAP) has been introduced, which generates image-agnostic AEs that can fool most DNN models trained on similar datasets efficiently and with reduced computational cost. However, existing UAP methods require well-annotated training data, which is challenging and costly to obtain, especially in applications with high security demands. Recently, data-free universal attack methods have been explored, where AEs are generated directly from random noises without the need for training data. These methods have shown promising results by maximizing the activation of CNN features, but they tend to perturb all layers of CNN features equally, making it difficult to transfer the AEs to target models. In this paper, we propose a novel data-free universal attack method called TRM-UAP that formulates the UAP generation as a truncated ratio maximization problem. TRM-UAP over-fires positive neurons and performs a ratio maximization of positive and negative activations to disrupt features from multiple CNN layers effectively. Furthermore, a truncation strategy is introduced to selectively maximize the activation of shallow convolutions while suppressing high-level convolutions, improving the transferability of UAPs. A curriculum learning-based optimization algorithm is also utilized to explore the diversity of inputs. Experimental results on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that TRM-UAP achieves the highest average fooling rate compared to other data-free UAP methods, indicating its improved transferability and effectiveness in generating universal AEs.
