This paper introduces the problem of whether artificial intelligence perceives colors in the same way as humans. The authors explore this question from a machine learning perspective. They discuss the physiological and cognitive aspects of color perception, including color space and color naming. The paper then compares traditional perception-centered color quantization methods with a machine-centered approach, highlighting the trade-offs and limitations of each. The authors argue for the integration of perception and machine in color quantization and propose a novel end-to-end color quantization transformer called CQFormer. They demonstrate the effectiveness of CQFormer in discovering artificial color naming systems and achieving high performance in classification and object detection tasks. The paper concludes by summarizing the contributions of the research.
