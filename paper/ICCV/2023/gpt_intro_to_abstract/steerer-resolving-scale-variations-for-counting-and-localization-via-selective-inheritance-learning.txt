The utilization of computer vision techniques for object counting has gained significant attention in various domains such as anomaly detection, traffic management, disease diagnosis, species protection, and production estimation. However, scale variations in counting tasks pose a formidable challenge. This paper introduces STEERER, a method that addresses scale variations by selecting and inheriting discriminative features from the most suitable scale. It proposes a Feature Selection and Inheritance Adaptor (FSIA) to partition features into scale-customized and scale-uncustomized components, allowing for independent processing. Additionally, a Masked Selection and Inheritance Loss (MSIL) is proposed to select the optimal scale for each region, maximizing the discriminatory power of features. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art counting results and is extended to object localization. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of STEERER, FSIA, and MSIL to improve object counting accuracy by effectively handling scale variations.
