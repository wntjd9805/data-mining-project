Deep learning models have shown great potential for neuroimage analysis. However, due to the limited size of neuroimaging datasets, it is common practice to combine data from multiple sites and MRI scanners. This combination, however, introduces non-biological variance that can mask the biological signals of interest. Therefore, the development of harmonisation methods is necessary for unbiased analysis of neuroimaging data from different scanners and studies. Most deep learning based harmonisation methods are based on domain adaptation (DA) methods, but they often fail to be applicable in realistic data scenarios. Centralized data stores for model training are infeasible, especially when working with protected personal information such as MR images. Distributed learning offers a promising solution, but existing distributed harmonisation methods assume the simultaneous presence of the source and target data. This may not be feasible in practice due to confidentiality agreements, loss of source data, or computational constraints. In this paper, we explore an unsupervised DA setting called Source Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA), where only the source model is provided to the unlabelled target domain for harmonisation. We propose a method called SFHarmony, which aims to match feature embeddings from the source and target using a modified Bhattacharyya distance. This approach requires no modifications to the training of the source model and only requires communication of summary statistics of the source feature embedding, which contain no information about individuals. Our contributions include: proposing SFHarmony for SFDA, demonstrating its applicability to classification, segmentation, and regression tasks, and showing its superiority over existing SFDA methods for domain shifts in neuroimaging data. We also demonstrate the robustness of the method to challenges such as differential privacy and label imbalance.
