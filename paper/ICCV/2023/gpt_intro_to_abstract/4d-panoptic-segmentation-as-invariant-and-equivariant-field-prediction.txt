Perception with LiDAR point clouds plays a crucial role in developing real-world autonomous systems like self-driving cars. The increasing complexity of tasks, as more capable neural networks are built, has led to the emergence of 4D panoptic segmentation. This task combines semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object tracking in a unified framework using sequential LiDAR scans. Solving this task has significant practical value as it provides abundant useful information for understanding the dynamic driving environment.Existing methods for 4D panoptic segmentation ignore the rich symmetries present in the task. For example, the center of an object instance in the point cloud remains invariant to rotations, and the offset vector from any point on the object to the center rotates along with the body frame. In this paper, we propose the use of equivariant neural networks to solve 4D panoptic segmentation. Equivariant networks respect the symmetries in the data and can help the model consistently perform and generalize over rotations in the input data.While equivariance is desirable, equivariant models can be complex and computationally expensive. Current equivariant models are mostly applied to smaller-scale problems, and achieving significant performance improvement without extra computational cost in large-scale equivariant perception solutions remains a challenge. In this work, we incorporate SO(2)-equivariance in the 4D segmentation model and show consistent improvements in performance metrics. We also demonstrate that formulating the output as equivariant vector fields maximizes the benefits of equivariant models compared to restricting to invariant scalar fields.Moreover, our equivariant networks not only improve segmentation performance but also reduce computational costs. Through our proposed design, we surpass non-equivariant models and achieve the top-1 ranking position in the SemanticKITTI benchmark.Our main contributions include the development of the first rotation-equivariant model for 4D panoptic segmentation, which brings improvements in both performance and efficiency. We investigate different strategies and designs for constructing the equivariant architecture and highlight the advantage of formulating prediction targets as equivariant vector fields. Our equivariant models significantly outperform existing methods on the SemanticKITTI benchmark, validating the value of equivariance in this large-scale perception task.
