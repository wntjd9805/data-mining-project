The paper introduces a method for generating urban building layouts in arbitrarily shaped city blocks using a variational auto-encoder framework and graph neural networks. The method addresses the limitations of existing approaches, such as image resolution constraints and time-consuming procedural rules. Three key observations are made: the organization of buildings within city blocks can be represented as a spatial data structure, a 2D message passing setup can capture building layout configurations, and skeletonization can support diverse block shapes. The proposed approach includes a graph-based representation, an encoder to codify building shapes and layouts, and a decoder to generate varied building shapes and layouts. The method is demonstrated on 28 large cities and compared to existing methods, showing superior performance in generating realistic urban layouts. The contributions of the paper include the graph-based representation, the spatial transformation for encoding layouts, and the controllable generation of urban layouts for arbitrary road networks.
