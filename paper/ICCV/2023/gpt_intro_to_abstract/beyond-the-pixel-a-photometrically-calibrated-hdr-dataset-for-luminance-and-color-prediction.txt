Natural light plays a crucial role in human visual system evolution, circadian rhythm, mental health, and social organization. However, computer vision approaches typically ignore the relationship between pixel intensity and luminance, as modern digital cameras prioritize visually appealing photographs over physically accurate perceived brightness. This paper aims to explore the possibility of recovering per-pixel luminance from a single image by proposing the Laval Photometric Indoor HDR Dataset. The dataset, obtained from a calibrated camera with chroma meter corrections, captures the diversity of indoor environments in terms of illuminance and color. The paper introduces three learning tasks enabled by the dataset: estimating per-pixel luminance, per-pixel color, and planar illuminance. Additionally, the paper addresses important questions regarding the accuracy of luminance estimation with uncalibrated cameras, the necessity of HDR imagery, and the suitability of generic approaches versus camera-specific methods. The authors present learning experiments on the dataset and release the calibrated datasets and code in order to stimulate community interest and encourage consideration of physical light measurements in computer vision research.
