Abstract:3D object detection has become crucial in various applications. However, labeling a large-scale dataset for such tasks is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) has shown promise in enhancing the performance of supervised detectors with limited labeled datasets. Current SSOD strategies can be categorized into Mean-Teacher and Pseudo-Labeling approaches. While they have achieved significant improvements, they are not model-agnostic and may suffer from the quality of pseudo labels. In this paper, we present NoiseDet, a simple yet effective SSOD framework that addresses the noise learning problem from unlabeled data. We acknowledge the existence of noise in the pseudo-labels and design a noise-resistant instance supervision module for better model generalization. We also introduce dense pixel-wise feature self-supervised consistency constraints to further mitigate the negative impact of noisy data. Our approach is model-agnostic and can be easily applied to any 3D object detector. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on competitive benchmarks, including state-of-the-art performance on the challenging ONCE dataset.
