The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the advancements in deep learning in computer vision models, such as CNNs, Vision Transformers, and MLP-based vision models. It introduces the concept of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and their potential for more versatile image processing. The paper focuses on a recent development called ViG, which uses GNNs to enhance visual perception. However, there are limitations to using a graph as the optimal data structure for image representation, including the complexity of relationships and the generation of redundant edges. To address these limitations, the paper proposes a new framework called Vision HyperGraph Neural Network (ViHGNN), which uses hypergraphs as a more dynamic and effective image representation. The paper discusses the challenges in determining the optimal hypergraph structure and introduces a feedback loop approach for learning and updating the hypergraph structure. The paper highlights the contributions of ViHGNN, including its ability to capture higher-order relationships, mitigate redundant memory and computational expenses, and improve performance in visual tasks like image classification and object detection. The ViHGNN model achieves impressive results in these tasks, demonstrating its efficacy.
