Face recognition has rapidly developed and is widely used in face verification, security systems, and other daily applications. However, manual annotation of high-quality face data is expensive and time-consuming. As a solution, face clustering has emerged as a primary technology to address this problem. This paper introduces different categories of face clustering methods: unsupervised and supervised. While existing unsupervised methods like K-means and DBSCAN have limitations, a new unsupervised method called FaceMap has shown positive results by adjusting the relationships between images. However, the original features in FaceMap are not clustering-oriented, which limits its performance. On the other hand, supervised learning methods based on graph convolution networks (GCNs) have shown significant improvements in clustering performance. But there are limitations to GCN-based models, such as the propagation of harmful information through undesirable edges and the influence of inaccurate labels. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel GCN model that combines labels with similarities to adjust face graphs and improve clustering performance. The proposed model utilizes confidence edges, which are highly consistent edges, to guide the building of face graphs. Additionally, local information fusion (LIF) and unsupervised neighbor determination (UND) are proposed to enhance the face graphs and increase the ratio of confidence edges. The proposed model, called confidence-GCN, gives higher attention to non-confidence edges and effectively deals with label errors. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performances on face recognition and person re-identification tasks.
