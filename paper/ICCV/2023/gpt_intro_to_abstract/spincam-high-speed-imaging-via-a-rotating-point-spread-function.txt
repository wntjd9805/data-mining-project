The paper introduces a new approach to compressive high-speed imaging. Traditional high-speed cameras are expensive, bulky, and have limitations on capture rates. The proposed method makes use of a rotating diffraction grating and a motor to change the point-spread function (PSF) during the camera's exposure period. By distributing light across a sensor using this technique, it is possible to record a single global-shutter frame and reconstruct scene dynamics through a deconvolution-based procedure. This approach is targeted towards spatiotemporally sparse scenes and can be applied in various domains such as motion capture, particle-image velocimetry, 3D scanning, and capturing fast flickering lights. The paper highlights four advantages of this method over existing techniques, including superior light efficiency, easily adjustable temporal resolution, support for a wider range of scenes, and simple hardware requirements. Experimental results and a DIY guide are provided to support the proposed approach.
