This paper discusses the importance of video recognition in various downstream tasks and the potential of video technologies in the field of computer science. The authors highlight different approaches that have been proposed, including convolution-based and transformer-based methods, as well as the effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) in the video domain. The paper then introduces a new approach called Importance-aware Frame Alignment (ILA), which aims to derive important motion and action clues by aligning pairwise frames. The authors argue that this simple frame alignment method eliminates the need for complex temporal self-attention and achieves superior temporal modeling at a low computational cost. The effectiveness and efficiency of ILA are demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative experiments, and the paper concludes by showcasing ILA as a promising bridge between CLIP and video recognition.
