Illumination estimation (IE) is a crucial task in the auto white balance (AWB) module of a camera. IE algorithms estimate the sensor's response to scene illumination in order to remove color cast. White balance correction is achieved by scaling the color channels of the image such that the estimated illumination becomes achromatic. This correction simulates color constancy in the human visual system and aims to produce realistic and aesthetically pleasing images. However, existing IE algorithms typically assume a single dominant light source in the scene, which may not be representative of real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new formulation of the IE problem that allows for the estimation of a global illumination distribution for the entire scene. We leverage an existing dataset to establish ground truth illumination distributions for a large number of images and conduct a user study to validate the effectiveness of our approach. We also adapt existing algorithms and develop a lightweight neural network to predict the illumination distribution from a single input image. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our neural network over baseline methods. Finally, we discuss the potential integration of the estimated illumination distribution into the DNG RAW file format.
