Planar tracking is an important problem in computer vision, particularly for robotics and augmented reality. Existing benchmarks for planar tracking are limited in pushing the frontier of the field, as they lack suitable datasets and do not reflect the challenging scenarios encountered in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a new large-scale benchmark called PlanarTrack, which consists of 1,000 video sequences collected from complicated and unconstrained scenarios. Each video is manually labeled with four corner points to ensure high-quality annotations. We also provide challenge factor information for each video to enable in-depth analysis. PlanarTrack is the largest and most challenging planar tracking dataset to date. We evaluate 10 representative planar object trackers on PlanarTrack and observe degraded performance compared to less challenging benchmarks, highlighting the difficulties presented by realistic scenes. We provide comprehensive analysis and discuss potential directions for future research in planar tracking. Additionally, as a by-product of PlanarTrack, we develop PlanarTrackBB, a variant suitable for generic box tracking, and highlight the need for improved methods in handling planar objects. Our contributions include the introduction of PlanarTrack as a dedicated platform for planar trackers, comprehensive evaluations and analysis of the benchmark, and the development of PlanarTrackBB for generic tracking.
