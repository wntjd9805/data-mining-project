The introduction of the paper discusses the rolling shutter (RS) mechanism commonly found in consumer video cameras and its effects on image quality and 3D vision algorithms. It highlights the significance of rolling shutter correction (RSC) in photography and the need for improved methods. The paper categorizes existing RSC methods into single-frame and multi-frame approaches, noting their limitations in handling complex scenes and scene occlusion. To address these challenges, the paper proposes a geometry-based Quadratic Rolling Shutter (QRS) motion solver for accurate correction field estimation and a 3D video architecture called RSA2-Net for reconstructing high-quality occlusion frames. The proposed methods are evaluated and shown to outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and generalization ability.
