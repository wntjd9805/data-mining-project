This paper discusses the challenge of accurately estimating depth information on transparent or mirror surfaces (ToM) and its impact on the tasks of spatial AI and autonomous navigation. The authors argue that depth estimation on ToM surfaces is challenging for both computer vision algorithms and humans due to the misleading visual information these surfaces introduce. The paper proposes a strategy to address this challenge by replacing ToM objects with opaque objects in images and using a monocular depth network to generate virtual depth annotations. This annotated dataset is then used to fine-tune the monocular network, enabling it to accurately estimate depth even in the presence of ToM objects. The paper also introduces a processing pipeline for fine-tuning stereo networks and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed strategy through experiments on the Booster dataset.
