Object categories in real-world environments are constantly evolving and expanding, making it challenging for conventional deep learning-based visual recognition methods to handle open-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Continuous Generalized Class Discovery (C-GCD) setting, where an object recognition model is trained offline on pre-defined categories and is deployed to discover and learn novel classes in diverse environments. Unlike previous works, we fully exploit the offline training stage and propose MetaGCD, a fully learning-based solution that minimizes hand-engineered heuristics. MetaGCD couples offline training and downstream learning objectives through meta-learning-based bi-level optimization. We simulate the testing scenario and construct pseudo incremental novel class discovery sessions during offline training, and then update the model using unsupervised contrastive learning to discover novel classes during each incremental session at deployment. We propose soft neighborhood contrastive learning to mine more positive pairs and ensure discriminative feature learning. Our method achieves superior performance with less hand-engineered design, making it suitable for real-world applications.
