Semantic segmentation is an important task in computer vision that assigns semantic labels to pixels in an image. Deep learning has greatly advanced the field of semantic segmentation, but fully supervised models require expensive pixel-level annotations. In response, weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has gained attention, particularly the use of image-level labels for training. This paper focuses on WSSS based on image-level labels, which is considered the cheapest yet most challenging setting. Existing image-level WSSS methods typically follow a three-step pipeline, which involves generating pseudo-labels, refining them as segmentation ground truth masks, and training the segmentation network. However, the quality of the pseudo-labels generated by current methods is unsatisfactory. To address this, the paper explores the use of image matting, a technique that predicts the probability of each pixel belonging to the foreground object, to generate pseudo-labels for WSSS. The alpha matte derived from image matting provides better object activation and edge representation compared to common class activation maps (CAMs) used in existing methods. Additionally, constructing the trimap required for image matting is easier than obtaining complete and accurate object activation with CAMs alone. The paper introduces a pseudo-label generation pipeline called Mat-Label that treats WSSS pseudo-label generation as an image matting task. To improve the quality of the trimap, the paper proposes a Double Decoupled Class Activation Map (D2CAM) approach that models foreground and background separately. The paper presents extensive experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of the Mat-Label pipeline in achieving state-of-the-art performance in WSSS.
