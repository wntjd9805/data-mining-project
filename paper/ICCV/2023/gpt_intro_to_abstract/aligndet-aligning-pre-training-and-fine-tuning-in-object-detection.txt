Recent advancements in large-scale pre-training and fine-tuning optimization paradigms in computer vision have shown significant progress in boosting downstream performance. However, there are discrepancies between the pre-training process using single object-centric datasets and the fine-tuning process that deals with multiple objects with different scales and locations. These discrepancies can lead to limited results, poor generalization, and slow convergence. To address these issues, this paper proposes AlignDet, a universal pre-training framework for object detection. AlignDet decouples the pre-training process into image-domain pre-training and box-domain pre-training, optimizing the detection backbone and other modules separately. It introduces detection-oriented pre-training by learning classification and regression knowledge and efficiently pre-trains various detectors using a completely unsupervised paradigm. Experimental results demonstrate that AlignDet achieves significant performance improvements in various settings.
