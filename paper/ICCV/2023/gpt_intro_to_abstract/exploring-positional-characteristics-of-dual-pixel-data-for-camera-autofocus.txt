Automatic focusing in digital photography is a crucial problem that significantly impacts the quality of captured images. Existing autofocus (AF) techniques, such as contrast detection autofocus (CDAF) and phase detection autofocus (PDAF), have limitations in terms of speed, power consumption, and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages dual-pixel data to address these limitations. Our approach focuses on improving AF accuracy by handling spatially-varying distortions and enhancing efficiency for low-end smartphones. We introduce two positional encodings, RoI-PE and lens-PE, that effectively capture the complex characteristics of dual-pixel data. Our model demonstrates significant improvements in focusing accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Additionally, we analyze the effects of spatial position in dual-pixel data for various problem settings.
