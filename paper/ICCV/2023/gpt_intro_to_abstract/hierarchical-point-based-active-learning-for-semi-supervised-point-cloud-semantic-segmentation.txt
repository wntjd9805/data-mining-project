Point cloud semantic segmentation is a crucial task in various domains such as robotics, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. Deep learning methods have shown promising results in this area, but they require a large amount of densely labeled data, which is expensive and time-consuming to acquire. To address this challenge, recent methods have explored semi-supervised learning techniques to train segmentation models using limited labeled points. However, these methods may suffer from performance limitations due to the random selection of labeled points, where some important points may be omitted, and redundant points may be included. In this paper, we propose an alternative learning strategy called active learning to enhance the performance of 3D segmentation with limited labeled data. Unlike previous region-based methods that divide the point cloud into multiple regions, our approach measures the uncertainty and importance of labeling for each individual point. We introduce a hierarchical minimum margin uncertainty measurement module that considers the local contextual information, allowing us to effectively identify the importance of each point. Based on this uncertainty measurement, we select the top-K points for labeling. To further reduce labeling costs, we propose a feature-distance suppression module that removes redundant points with similar features in the neighborhood. By combining the hierarchical point-based active learning strategy with the feature-distance suppression module, our method selects valuable points for labeling, leading to a reduction in labeling costs. Additionally, we employ a teacher-student scheme to leverage the unlabelled points and enhance the supervision signal by assigning pseudo labels. Our proposed method outperforms current semi-supervised and active learning methods in point cloud semantic segmentation tasks, achieving comparable performance to full supervision methods that rely on scarce annotations. The main contributions of this research include the development of a novel hierarchical minimum margin uncertainty module, a feature-distance suppression module, and a point-based active learning method for semi-supervised point cloud semantic segmentation.
