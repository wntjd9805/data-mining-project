The paper introduces the concept of Image-free Zero-Shot Learning (I-ZSL), which aims to extend pre-trained visual classifiers to recognize unseen classes without using image data. The authors propose a method called Image-free Classifier Injection with Semantics (ICIS), which directly relates semantic class descriptors to the classifier weights of a pre-trained model. ICIS consists of two encoder-decoder networks that inject priors from class descriptors and classifier weights into a simple descriptor-to-weights mapping. The networks are supervised using pairs of seen class descriptors and their corresponding weights to encourage better generalization on unseen descriptors. The effectiveness of ICIS is validated on standard ZSL benchmarks, where it consistently outperforms existing ZSL methods and adapted zero- and few-shot learning approaches. Overall, the paper contributes by addressing the new I-ZSL task and proposing a simple yet effective framework for achieving high-performance zero-shot classification without using image data.
