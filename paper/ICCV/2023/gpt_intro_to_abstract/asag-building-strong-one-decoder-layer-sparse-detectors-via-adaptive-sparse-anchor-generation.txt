Object detection is a challenging task in computer vision. Traditional dense object detectors use sliding-window paradigm, while sparse detectors use object queries to search through the image. Sparse detectors simplify the detection pipeline and are fully trainable with transformer encoder-decoder architecture. However, they require multiple decoder layers, leading to slower inference time. Previous methods attempted to bridge the performance gap but failed to achieve comparable results. In this work, we propose a fully sparse one-decoder-layer detector to narrow the performance gap while maintaining fast speed. Our method uses patches as prediction units, alleviating feature discrepancy and enjoying global receptive fields. We introduce Adaptive Sparse Anchor Generator (ASAG) for image-specific query initialization, Adaptive Probing for adaptive patch cropping, and Query Weighting for stability handling. Experimental results on the COCO dataset show that our model outperforms dense-initialized Query RCNN with fewer FLOPs and achieves a better speed-accuracy trade-off.
