Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated high performance and resilience in various computer vision tasks. However, their heavy reliance on correlation in training data can lead to the learning of spurious correlations, resulting in biases and reduced generalization. Existing debiasing approaches rely on prior knowledge or auxiliary labels, which can be costly or noisy to obtain. In this work, we propose a bias-agnostic approach that identifies the optimal time to extract bias-target alignment information by observing the relative distance of misclassified samples to the Voronoi boundary of the target class. We use this information to train an unbiased model by giving higher weight to bias-misaligned samples and removing bias alignment information from the bottleneck layer. Our contributions include a bias-agnostic approach for extracting bias-target alignment information, weighting the loss contribution of each sample based on bias alignment, eliminating bias information at the bottleneck layer, and evaluating the performance of our approach on various datasets compared to supervised approaches.
