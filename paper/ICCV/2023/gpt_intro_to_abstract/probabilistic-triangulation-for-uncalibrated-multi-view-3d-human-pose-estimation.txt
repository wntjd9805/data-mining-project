3D human pose estimation is a crucial tool in computer vision and computer graphics applications. The development of these fields requires a more accurate, convenient, and robust algorithm for 3D human pose estimation. Recently, RGB-based pose estimation methods have gained popularity due to their convenience, wide application scenarios, and low cost. These methods can be classified into single-view and multi-view methods. While single-view methods have widespread applications, they face challenges in estimating 3D human pose without depth information, especially in handling occlusions and multi-person scenes. Multi-view methods can achieve more accurate results by utilizing multiple cameras to restore depth information and handle occlusions. However, these methods require synchronized and calibrated cameras, which complicates the process, and existing datasets lack diversity in camera parameters.To address these issues, we propose a Probabilistic Triangulation module for uncalibrated 3D human pose estimation. This module eliminates the need for camera pose parameters during training, leading to better generalization performance in wild scenes. The main idea is to use a probability distribution to model the camera pose, making the entire process differentiable. We transform the uncalibrated 3D human pose estimation into a nonlinear optimization problem based on reprojection error. The camera pose distribution is estimated from 2D pose features, and the posterior probability is computed through Monte Carlo sampling.Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other uncalibrated methods and achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art calibration methods. This indicates that our proposed method improves the ability to handle camera parameters in multi-view human pose estimation while maintaining high accuracy. In summary, our contributions include proposing Probabilistic Triangulation for uncalibrated 3D human pose estimation, introducing approximation and distribution methods for camera pose, and conducting experiments to validate the accuracy, generalization capability, and applicability of our method in wild scenes.
