Aquatic biodiversity is crucial for maintaining the health of aquatic ecosystems, but human activities are threatening its preservation. Monitoring aquatic biodiversity requires efficient species recognition, which is often time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. Deep learning methods have shown promise in automating species recognition, but their accuracy relies on large and diverse training datasets. Existing datasets for fish recognition are limited in species coverage, hindering their application in real-world scenarios. Therefore, we present FishNet, a large-scale and diverse dataset containing 94,532 images of aquatic species from 17,357 species worldwide. The dataset is organized based on scientific classification and includes manual-labeled bounding box annotations. Additionally, FishNet provides traits associated with each species, enabling a better understanding of their ecological roles. We establish benchmarks for fish classification, fish detection, and functional trait prediction to advance aquatic species recognition systems and support research efforts in aquatic ecology. Preliminary experiments on FishNet show that accurate fish recognition and functional trait prediction remain challenging. FishNet serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating deep learning models and supporting conservation efforts in aquatic ecosystems.
