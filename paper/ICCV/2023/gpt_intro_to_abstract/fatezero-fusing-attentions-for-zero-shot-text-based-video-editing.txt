This paper introduces a novel framework called FateZero for zero-shot video editing using a pretrained text-to-image model. Unlike previous methods that solely rely on inversion and generation, FateZero stores self and cross-attention maps at each step of the inversion process, allowing for better motion information and the preservation of original structures. The proposed Attention Blending Block utilizes cross-attention maps to prevent semantic leakage and improve shape-editing capability. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages of FateZero in video and image editing, including style editing, local attribute editing, and object shape editing. Overall, this paper presents a valuable framework for temporal-consistent text-based video editing.
