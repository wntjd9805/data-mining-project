This paper introduces the concept of utilizing Radio-Frequency-vision (RF-vision) for fine-grained 3D Hand Pose Estimation (HPE) in occluded scenes. The use of non-optical vision technologies, such as RF-vision, has gained attention due to its occlusion robustness, low complexity, energy efficiency, and deployability. However, the occlusion robustness of RF-vision has not been fully explored in previous research. The paper focuses on addressing the challenges of non-Euclidean mapping of keypoints, model design for low-resolution complex-valued RF data, and model training for occluded scenes. To overcome these challenges, the paper presents OCHID-Fi, the first 3D RF-HPE model capable of extracting 3D hand keypoints behind full occlusion. OCHID-Fi uses cross-modality training and a synchronized pair of camera and RF sensor for data collection. It employs a deep complex-valued network, OCH-Net, to handle complex-valued RF data and leverages adversarial learning, OCH-AL, to transfer knowledge from the Line-of-Sight (LoS) domain to the occluded domain. The contributions of the paper include the development of OCHID-Fi as an occlusion-robust 3D RF-HPE model and the bridging of the gap between complex RF-vision data and hand keypoints.
