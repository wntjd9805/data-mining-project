Optical flow estimation, which determines the pixel-wise correspondence between video frames, is crucial for various applications such as video editing, action recognition, and object tracking. Recent advancements in deep learning have improved the accuracy of local flow estimation between adjacent frames, but estimating long-range flow between distant frames remains challenging. Long-range optical flow has practical applications in video completion, key-point propagation, super-resolution, and segmentation mask propagation. However, few researches have focused on this task due to the lack of publicly available datasets. Existing methods for long-range flow estimation either accumulate flows along motion trajectories or apply local flow estimation methods. However, these methods suffer from degradation in performance and accuracy, particularly in occluded regions or when the time interval between frames is large. Moreover, these methods are computationally expensive or not suitable for dense flow applications. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework called AccFlow that progressively accumulates local flows with effective corrections to estimate long-range optical flow. Our framework includes an arbitrary optical flow estimator, a backward accumulation module, and an adaptive blending module. Additionally, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset called CVO, which includes comprehensive cross-frame bidirectional flow annotations and challenging cases with large pixel displacement and severe occlusion. The proposed AccFlow framework achieves state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks and provides an effective solution for long-range optical flow estimation.
