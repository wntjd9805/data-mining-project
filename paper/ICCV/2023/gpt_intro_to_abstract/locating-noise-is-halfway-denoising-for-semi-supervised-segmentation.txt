Past decades have seen significant advancements in semantic segmentation through the use of deep learning and large-scale datasets. However, annotating a large number of training images is expensive and time-consuming, limiting scalability. To address this, semi-supervised semantic segmentation algorithms have emerged, leveraging a small number of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. These algorithms can be categorized into consistency regularization and entropy minimization methods. While consistency regularization achieves good performance, it has complex training pipelines. On the other hand, entropy minimization has a simpler pipeline but tends to over-fit noisy pseudo masks. Previous approaches have attempted to moderate the impact of noise in pseudo labels but often ignore the contextual information of noisy pixels. To address this, we propose a data augmentation technique called Uncertainty-aware Patch CutMix (UPC) that identifies and replaces uncertain regions in a patch-wise manner. UPC is model-structure and training-procedure agnostic, easy to implement, and requires minimal effort to incorporate into existing workflows. Our experiments on Pascal VOC and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that UPC improves the performance of existing methods and outperforms other data augmentation techniques. Furthermore, UPC shows excellent generalization capabilities regardless of the distribution of unlabeled images. Overall, our contributions include the introduction of UPC as an effective denoising method and showing its significant improvement in semi-supervised semantic segmentation without introducing additional hyper-parameters or re-training stages.
