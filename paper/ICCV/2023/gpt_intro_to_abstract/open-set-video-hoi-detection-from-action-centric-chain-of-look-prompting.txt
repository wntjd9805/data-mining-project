Human-object interaction (HOI) detection has gained considerable attention in recent years due to its importance in scene understanding and applications in various fields. Most existing works focus on HOI detection in static images in closed settings, where all HOI classes are predefined and examples are provided in the training set. However, real-world scenarios are often open-set, meaning that novel HOIs may be present in videos that were not seen during training. Detecting open-set HOIs in videos is challenging due to the lack of temporal information in static images and the tremendous compositional space resulting from the <person, interaction, object> triplets. Additionally, semantic ambiguity of HOIs, particularly those related to temporality, further complicates the task. To address these challenges, we propose ACoLP, an open-set HOI detection model for videos. ACoLP abstracts each frame into action prompts and models the prompt generation process as a series of intermediate visual reasoning steps. The model utilizes the chain-of-look prompting scheme, inspired by natural language processing, to prompt the model with input-output visual reasoning steps. This approach enables the model to reason about visual events on unseen classes, leveraging the few/zero-shot learning ability from large-scale vision-language models. ACoLP consists of two reasoning networks: the visual-semantic reasoning network (VSR) and the spatio-temporal reasoning network (STR), which generate HOI prompts and action prompts, respectively. This allows the model to capture the temporal dynamics and semantic information of events in videos. We validate the effectiveness of ACoLP through experiments on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in open-set video HOI detection and comparable results in closed-set settings. Our contributions include the introduction of an action-centric video HOI detection model, the chain-of-look prompting scheme for capturing visual reasoning processes, and substantial improvements in open-set video HOI detection compared to state-of-the-art methods.
