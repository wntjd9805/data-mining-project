The digitization of hard-copy documents and the challenges associated with it are actively researched in academia and industry. This involves scanning documents through an OCR process for downstream NLP tasks like named entity recognition (NER). However, there is a considerable gap between current approaches and human-level performance in scenarios where handwritten and printed text overlap. This overlap is common in legal documents due to signatures overlapping with information. To address this challenge, this research focuses on improving the segmentation performance in overlapping regions of scanned legal documents. A new dataset, SignaTR6K, is introduced, comprising signatures, handwritten text, and printed text. A novel architecture is proposed that integrates semantic segmentation features and fine features, along with a new Fusion loss function. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the superior performance of the approach in text segmentation, particularly in challenging scenarios with overlapping text.
