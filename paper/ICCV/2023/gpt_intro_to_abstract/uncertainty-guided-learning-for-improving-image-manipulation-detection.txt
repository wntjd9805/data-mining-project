The paper introduces the problem of image manipulation detection (IMD) in the context of modern image editing tools. It highlights the challenges of data uncertainty and model uncertainty in detecting manipulated images, with examples of noisy labels and inconsistent object labeling. The existing methods for IMD tend to implicitly address model uncertainty and overlook data uncertainty. The paper proposes a new uncertainty-guided learning framework that incorporates an Uncertainty Estimation Network (UEN) to explicitly model both data and model uncertainty. The UEN consists of Dynamic Uncertainty Supervision (DUS) and Uncertainty Prediction Refinement (UPR) components. The proposed method is capable of identifying over-segmentation, under-segmentation, and phantom-segmentation regions by assigning high uncertainty to misclassified areas. The paper claims to achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks for image manipulation detection. The contributions of the paper include the development of a new learning framework for IMD, explicitly addressing data and model uncertainty, and achieving superior results in image manipulation detection.
