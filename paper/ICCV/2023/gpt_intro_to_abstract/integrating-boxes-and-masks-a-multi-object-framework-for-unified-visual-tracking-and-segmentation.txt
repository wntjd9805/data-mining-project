Visual object tracking (VOT) and video object segmentation (VOS) are critical tasks in computer vision for applications such as video surveillance and autonomous driving. While VOT focuses on tracking specific objects in a video stream using boxes, VOS aims to segment objects in a video sequence using masks. In this paper, we propose a Multi-object Mask-box Integrated framework for unified Tracking and Segmentation (MITS) that integrates both boxes and masks in a unified manner. We address the challenges of converting between boxes and masks and lack of compatibility and flexibility in previous approaches. Our framework includes a unified identification module for initialization and a pinpoint box predictor for accurate box prediction. Our experiments demonstrate the strong compatibility and performance of our framework on benchmark datasets for VOT and VOS tasks. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly improves box initialization on VOS benchmarks. Our contributions are the multi-object framework, the unified identification module, and the pinpoint box predictor.
