The field of 3D human mesh reconstruction (HMR) has gained popularity in various applications such as AR/VR gaming, fitness tracking, and virtual try-on. However, one of the major challenges in HMR is the cost of collecting 3D training data on in-the-wild images taken in everyday environments. To address this challenge, most HMR methods are trained on Motion Capture (MoCap) datasets, which provide accurate 3D annotations but lack diverse image appearances compared to in-the-wild datasets.This paper introduces CycleAdapt, a test-time adaptation framework for 3D human mesh reconstruction that aims to overcome the domain gap between training and test data. Unlike previous methods that rely on weak supervision using 2D evidence from test images, CycleAdapt utilizes a cyclic adaptation scheme that adapts a pre-trained HMR network to a given test in-the-wild video. The framework consists of two networks: a human mesh reconstruction network (HMRNet) and a human motion denoising network (MDNet). In the adaptation process, HMRNet is supervised with 3D targets generated from MDNet and the imperfect 2D evidence. The MDNet is self-supervised to enhance motion denoising performance by reconstructing masked parts of noisy human meshes.The proposed CycleAdapt framework improves the accuracy and naturalness of human mesh reconstruction compared to previous methods, addressing the limitations of the 2D reprojection loss and imperfect 2D evidence. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of CycleAdapt in various scenarios. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of CycleAdapt as a test-time adaptation framework, the proposal of the human motion denoising network for generating 3D supervision targets, and the demonstration of the superiority of CycleAdapt over previous state-of-the-art methods.
