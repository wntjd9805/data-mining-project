This paper introduces the concept of "Hallucinator" to improve the performance of contrastive learning in computer vision. Contrastive learning has shown promising results in self-supervised learning, treating each image as one class and creating positive pairs. However, existing techniques focus on improving the original pairs and often require large batch sizes. The authors argue that humans have the ability to imagine additional positive pairs by envisioning samples from different surroundings and perspectives. Inspired by this, they propose the Hallucinator, a feature-space operation that manipulates feature vectors to generate additional positive pairs. They also introduce an asymmetric feature extrapolation method and a non-linear hallucination process to ensure sufficient variance and smoothness in the generated features. The Hallucinator is shown to improve the performance of popular contrastive learning models, achieving stable improvements in linear classification and better transferability in downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation. The proposed approach is simple, effective, and can be easily applied to any contrastive learning framework. Experimental results demonstrate the benefits of incorporating hallucination into contrastive representation learning.
