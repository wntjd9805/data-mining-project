This paper explores the effectiveness of joint audio-visual modeling in addressing the catastrophic forgetting problem in class-incremental learning. The researchers propose audio-visual class-incremental learning, which trains a model continually in the scenario of audio-visual video recognition. They introduce a method called AV-CIL (Audio-Visual-Class-Incremental Learning) that includes a Dual-Audio-Visual Similarity Constraint (D-AVSC) to preserve semantic similarities between audio and visual features throughout the incremental steps. Additionally, they propose Visual Attention Distillation (VAD) to preserve previously learned cross-modal audio-visual correlations. The researchers conduct experiments on three audio-visual class-incremental datasets and demonstrate that their method outperforms state-of-the-art class-incremental learning methods significantly. This paper contributes to the exploration of joint audio-visual modeling and proposes effective techniques for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting problem in class-incremental learning.
