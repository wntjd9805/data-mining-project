This paper focuses on measuring apparent skin color in images for fairness benchmarking. Previous studies have shown that common computer vision models can produce adverse decisions for individuals with darker skin tones, leading to incorrect diagnostics or measurements. To address this issue, it is important to develop comprehensive skin color scores to characterize images of individuals. However, describing the apparent skin color remains a challenge due to the complex nature of human perception and the variations in skin color among individuals. In this paper, we introduce a measure of skin hue, in addition to skin tone, to quantify apparent skin color variations. We propose a multidimensional scale to capture these variations and demonstrate its relevance and benefits in fairness assessments in computer vision. Our contributions include quantifying biases in commonly used image datasets and generative models, identifying biases in image cropping and face verification models, and measuring the causal effect of skin color in attribute prediction. Overall, our multidimensional approach offers novel insights for assessing skin color and understanding biases in fairness evaluations of datasets and models.
