The goal of this study is to develop an embodied AI agent that can efficiently perform various tasks in a home environment, such as preparing a meal or tidying up. The focus is on the problem of object rearrangement, where the agent must move a specific object from its initial position to a desired goal position without any prior knowledge or detailed object locations. This task requires both low-level motor commands for precise movements and high-level decision-making skills. Previous research has shown that it is possible to learn a single policy that can perform diverse tasks, but scaling this approach to long-horizon tasks with thousands of steps and egocentric visual observations is challenging. Other works decompose the task into individual skills and sequence them separately, but this approach suffers from hand-off errors and does not address skill sequencing or adaptation to unknown disturbances.To address these limitations, the authors propose Skill Transformer, an end-to-end trainable transformer policy for multi-skill tasks. This policy predicts both low-level actions and high-level skills based on a history of egocentric camera observations. By combining conditional sequence modeling with a skill prediction module, Skill Transformer can model long sequences of high and low-level actions without the need for disconnected sub-modules. The authors train Skill Transformer using trajectories that solve the full rearrangement task and test it in unseen settings with unknown perturbations.The results show that Skill Transformer achieves state-of-the-art performance in rearrangement tasks, outperforming modular and end-to-end baselines. It exhibits higher success rates, especially in challenging situations requiring variable-length high-level planning and delicate low-level actions. The authors also demonstrate the robustness of Skill Transformer to environment disturbances that were not encountered during training. The study emphasizes the importance of design decisions in Skill Transformer and its scalability with larger training dataset sizes. The code for Skill Transformer is available online.
