Large image datasets play a vital role in Computer Vision, but their constantly increasing size raises concerns about bias and negative social impact. However, manual inspection of these datasets is impractical due to their large size and visual nature. To address this problem, better tools for dataset inspection are needed. This paper proposes a promising approach for dataset inspection based on effective summarization techniques. These techniques allow for exploratory dataset inspection without the need for supervised pretraining. However, a drawback is that they only discover visually prominent concepts, relying on frequency as a proxy for importance. To overcome this limitation, the authors argue for a comparative approach that can discover a wider range of concepts. The authors suggest that comparing two datasets, such as ImageNet and the PASS dataset, can lead to new insights and help evaluate the presence of specific concepts. The paper also highlights a limitation of existing summarization approaches, which separate the summarization process from representation learning. To address this limitation, the authors propose a method for prototype-based dataset comparison that integrates representation learning and summarization into an end-to-end process. Dataset prototypes, similar to cluster centroids, are discovered within the feature space. The authors introduce the ProtoSim module, which can be integrated into deep networks without altering the optimization process. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through experiments on a Vision Transformer (ViT). The contributions of this paper include the introduction of dataset comparison as a novel approach for inspecting datasets, the presentation of the ProtoSim module for integrated learning of dataset prototypes, and the demonstration of how dataset comparison can provide new insights through two case studies.
