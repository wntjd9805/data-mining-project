Generative models have made significant advancements in various image synthesis tasks, but they still struggle with generating plausible content and often produce perceptual artifacts. These artifacts are visually detectable and require manual retouching, making the image editing process time-consuming and iterative. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of training AI oracle models to automatically identify and segment these perceptual artifacts. The goal is to provide users with automatically delineated masks of potential artifact areas, eliminating the need for manual masking. Additionally, we propose a zoom-in inpainting pipeline to refine the generated images by addressing challenges in capturing intricate object details. We have created a dataset with per-pixel artifact segmentation labels and trained a versatile artifact detection model. Our contributions include the dataset, the artifact detection model, the zoom-in inpainting pipeline, and demonstrated applications such as automatic artifact refinement and image quality evaluation. We will release the dataset and code to facilitate further research in this area.
