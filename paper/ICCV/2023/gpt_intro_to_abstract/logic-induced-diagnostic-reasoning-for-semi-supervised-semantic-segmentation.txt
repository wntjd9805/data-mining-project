Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision tasks, but it relies on large labeled training datasets that are difficult to acquire. Semantic segmentation, in particular, requires pixel-level manual labeling, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, semi-supervised semantic segmentation has gained interest, which combines limited labeled data with a large amount of unlabeled data. Pseudo labeling is one such technique, where unlabeled data is assigned pseudo labels based on model predictions. However, the pseudo labeling paradigm is often perceived as unreliable due to the accumulation of erroneous predictions. Previous works have attempted to mitigate this issue with heuristic confidence thresholding but it has limitations. In this paper, we propose a promising direction towards integrating statistical learning and symbolic reasoning to improve performance. We introduce LOGICDIAG, a new SSL framework that uses logical reasoning to identify conflicts within pseudo labels and suggests possible diagnoses. We model the likelihood of each diagnosis being the actual fault based on predictive confidence and degree of conflicts using fuzzy logic. LOGICDIAG seamlessly integrates with mainstream semi-supervised learning methods and demonstrates solid performance gains in extensive experiments on three well-established benchmarks. The results showcase the potential of integrated neural-symbolic computing in large-scale semi-supervised segmentation.
