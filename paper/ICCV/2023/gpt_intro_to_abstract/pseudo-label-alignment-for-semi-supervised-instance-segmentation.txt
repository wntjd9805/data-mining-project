Semi-supervised instance segmentation is a technique that aims to reduce the manual labeling effort by using a combination of labeled and unlabeled data. Existing pipelines generate pseudo-labels from unlabeled data to train the models. However, current frameworks do not fully utilize the potential of these pseudo-labels, often filtering out valuable information. This paper presents a new framework called PAIS that improves the utilization of filtered pseudo-labels. The main challenge is the mismatched scores between pseudo-classes and pseudo-masks. To address this, the paper introduces a dynamic aligning loss (DALoss) that adjusts the contribution of different pseudo-labels based on their quality. Experimental results on COCO and Cityscape datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PAIS, achieving state-of-the-art results with only 1% labeled data. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of PAIS framework for semi-supervised instance segmentation, the proposal of DALoss, and comprehensive evaluation on different datasets. PAIS is also the first framework adaptable to box-free instance segmentation models.
