The deployment of efficient convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has led to significant progress in vision detectors for edge devices. However, traditional evaluation metrics such as parameters and speed are not well correlated with the energy efficiency of models. This paper aims to reduce the energy costs of efficient object detectors while improving their performance by achieving energy-performance tradeoffs. The paper identifies energy-efficient components of detectors, including activation functions, convolution operators, and feature fusion structures. It proposes a low-energy detector called FemtoDet, which has a small number of parameters and low power consumption. The paper also introduces a novel instance boundary enhancement module (IBE) and a training strategy called recursive warm-restart (RecWR) to improve the generalization and performance of the detector. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FemtoDet, IBE, and RecWR in improving performance without significantly increasing parameters. FemtoDet is designed for hierarchical intelligent chips and is suitable for always-on applications such as in-home monitoring or robots. The proposed methodology achieves competitive results in diverse scenarios.
