Chaotic situations can occur in various scenarios, such as natural disasters, accidents, crimes, or protests, and understanding human behavior and interactions in these chaotic events is crucial for public safety and order. However, analyzing human behaviors in chaotic scenes is challenging due to their dynamic and complex nature, as well as the large volume of surveillance footage that needs to be screened. In this paper, we propose the creation of Chaotic World, a multi-modal video dataset that comprehensively analyzes different dimensions of human behaviors in chaotic situations. This dataset includes information on the type of chaotic situations, complex interaction graphs among individuals, actions of individuals, and sound and voice localization. The dataset poses challenges with complex scenes, crowds, occlusions, dynamic backgrounds, and motion blur. We believe that this dataset will facilitate the development of advanced methods for analyzing human behaviors in chaotic events and benefit various applications in event planning, urban space design, psychology, criminology, and content rating guidance. Additionally, we present the IntelliCare model with a Dynamic Knowledge Pathfinder module, which utilizes multi-modal information to analyze various aspects of a chaotic scene in a unified architecture. Overall, our research aims to expedite the rate of research in analyzing human behaviors in chaotic events and provide detailed holistic analysis for future applications.
