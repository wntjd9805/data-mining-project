Visible watermark removal is a challenging task in the field of computer science, as watermarks can be diverse in terms of location, pattern, and transparency. Previous research has developed dynamic networks to cope with these diversified watermarks adaptively. However, existing approaches treat the watermarked region in an image as a whole and do not consider the fact that the region can be divided into multiple parts with distinct appearances. Furthermore, when a watermark is overlaid on a background image with certain transparency, the colors of different parts in the watermarked region can vary, complicating the removal process.In this work, we propose a part-specific dynamic network that not only adapts to the watermarked regions in different images but also handles different watermarked parts within a single image. We adopt a multi-task framework with one encoder and two decoders, where the mask decoder localizes the watermark and the background decoder recovers the watermarked region. To address different watermarked parts adaptively, we introduce query embeddings into the framework, establishing a connection between the mask decoder and background decoder. These query embeddings interact with the encoder feature map through a transformer block, producing adapted query embeddings that contain part-relevant and watermark-free information. The adapted query embeddings are then used in the mask decoder to generate part masks and a watermark-free mask. In the background decoder, modulated convolution kernels are produced for different part categories, allowing for adaptive restoration of different watermarked parts.We evaluate our proposed method on two benchmark datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in fine-grained visible watermark removal. Our contributions include considering fine-grained part categories in the removal task, designing a query-based multi-task framework, and achieving better restoration results through part-specific dynamic network.
