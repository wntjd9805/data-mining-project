The paper presents a novel task of generating 3D dance movements that incorporate both text and music modalities. The authors highlight the importance of including text as a modality cue, as it provides richer actions and more flexible motion guidance. However, there are significant challenges in designing a system pipeline for this bimodality driven dance generation task. Existing datasets only cater to either music-driven or text-driven human motion generation, and there is no paired 3D dance generation dataset that takes into account both music and text. Additionally, integrating text into the existing music-conditioned architecture might result in degraded dance generation quality. To address these challenges, the authors propose utilizing existing music-dance and text-motion datasets and projecting the motions into a consistent and shared latent space using a VQ-VAE architecture. They also propose a cross-modal transformer architecture that formulates both music2dance and text2motion as sequence-to-sequence translation tasks. This architecture enables the fusion of audio and text features in the latent space and allows for the generation of coherent 3D dance motions. The paper introduces two new evaluation metrics, Motion Prediction Distance (MPD) and Freezing Score (FS), to assess the coherence and quality of the generated dance. The authors also collect in-the-wild music data for evaluation to better assess the performance of their method in real-world scenarios. Their method successfully generates realistic and coherent dance based on both music and text instructions while maintaining comparable performance on the single modality tasks. In summary, the contributions of the paper include the proposal of the TM2D pipeline for bimodality driven 3D dance generation, the effective combination of existing datasets using the VQ-VAE framework, the development of a cross-modal transformer and bimodal feature fusion strategy, the introduction of the MPD and FS evaluation metrics, and the successful generation of realistic dance based on both music and text instructions.
