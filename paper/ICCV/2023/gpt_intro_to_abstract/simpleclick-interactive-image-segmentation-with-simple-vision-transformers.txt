The introduction focuses on the goal of interactive image segmentation, which is to obtain pixel-level annotations with limited user interaction. Various interactive image segmentation approaches using different interaction types have been explored, with the click-based approach being the most common. Recent advances in click-based approaches have focused on developing effective backbone networks and exploring refinement modules. This work specifically delves into the development of a plain backbone for interactive segmentation. The use of a plain ViT backbone, which captures global information from the first self-attention block, eliminates the need for a feature pyramid network. The proposed method, SimpleClick, utilizes a plain ViT backbone and a lightweight MLP decoder to achieve efficient and high-quality segmentation. Extensive evaluations on both natural and medical images demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of SimpleClick, making it suitable as a practical annotation tool. The main contributions of this work include the proposal of SimpleClick, achieving state-of-the-art performance, and meeting the computational efficiency requirements for real-world applications.
