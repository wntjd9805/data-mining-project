This paper introduces the concept of privacy-preserving face recognition (PPFR) and proposes a novel PPFR scheme called PartialFace. The current practice of face recognition involves outsourcing face images to a service provider, which raises concerns about the privacy of sensitive data. PPFR aims to protect the visual information of face images while maintaining the accuracy of the recognition process. The proposed PartialFace scheme learns face images from random combinations of their partial frequency components, effectively concealing visual information and preventing recovery. The paper explores the disparity between how humans and models perceive images and demonstrates that high-frequency components carry negligible visual information for both humans and models. By pruning low-frequency channels and training the model on the remaining high-frequency channels, the processed face images become visually indiscernible while the recognition model still performs accurately. However, without additional safeguards, the attacker can still recover visual features from the remaining high-frequency channels. To reinstate protection, the paper proposes training and inferring the model on randomly chosen channels, which preserves more complete facial features and achieves a privacy-accuracy equilibrium. The paper presents experimental analyses to show that the proposed PartialFace method effectively balances privacy and accuracy. The contributions of the paper include an in-depth study of privacy protection in face recognition, two methodological advances (pruning low-frequency components and using randomly selected channels), and the development of the PartialFace PPFR method, which effectively safeguards privacy and maintains satisfactory recognition accuracy.
