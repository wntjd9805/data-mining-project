In this paper, we tackle the problem of removing specular highlights from images, as they can degrade image quality and remove important visual content. We discuss the limitations of traditional methods and deep learning-based methods in achieving satisfactory results, leading to visual artifacts and limited generalization. To address this, we propose a three-stage specular highlight removal network that incorporates physics-based formation modeling, specular-free refinement, and tone correction. We also create a large-scale synthetic dataset for training and evaluation purposes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative assessments.
