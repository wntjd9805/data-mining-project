Monocular 3D object detection, a challenging task in computer vision, has gained prominence due to its practical applications in fields like self-driving cars and robotics. Despite progress in the field, accurately localizing 3D centers remains a major challenge. This paper proposes leveraging bottom-up 2D-to-3D predicted bounding boxes as informative priors for monocular 3D object detection. By analyzing vehicle detection performance on the KITTI dataset, the authors demonstrate the potential of a top-down approach using 3D bounding box proposals. However, this approach requires addressing challenges such as increased number of proposals and handling highly overlapped boxes. The authors propose using a Perceiver I/O model to fuse 3D-to-2D geometric features with appearance features, enabling effective bounding box denoising. Experimental results on KITTI and Waymo datasets show significant performance improvement with limited computation overhead, with the proposed method achieving 1st place among monocular methods on the KITTI vehicle detection benchmark.
