The problem of image quality assessment (IQA) is crucial in various image applications, but often a reference image is not available for assessment. No reference (NR) or blind IQA aims to predict image quality without a reference image, often utilizing machine learning approaches. Deep learning methods have shown success, but IQA applications face challenges due to diverse distortions and distributional shifts. Test time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a solution to address distributional shifts, modifying global parameters of the model. However, there is limited research on TTA for IQA. This paper focuses on designing TTA for IQA by introducing two auxiliary tasks. The first task enforces quality relationships among a batch of samples using group contrastive (GC) learning. The second task ranks the image quality of further distorted versions of each test sample. The combination of both tasks overcomes their limitations, leading to superior performance. The paper presents TTA techniques for blind IQA, formulates quality-aware auxiliary tasks, and demonstrates the significant improvements in performance using four different quality-aware source models on four different test IQA databases.
