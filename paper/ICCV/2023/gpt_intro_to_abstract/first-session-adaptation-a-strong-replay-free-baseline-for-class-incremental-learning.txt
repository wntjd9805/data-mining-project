Continual learning (CL) is essential for applying machine learning models to real-life scenarios where new classes naturally emerge. Class incremental learning (CIL) focuses on training a single classification model that can efficiently acquire new knowledge while preserving existing knowledge. This paper explores the benefits of continuous adaptation in CIL and introduces a replay-free method called First Session Adaptation (FSA). FSA adapts the body of a pre-trained neural network in the first session of continual learning, while the head is adapted at each session using an approach similar to Linear Discriminate Analysis. The paper presents empirical evidence and comparisons to existing methods, demonstrating that FSA performs well in different CIL scenarios, particularly in few-shot learning situations. Additionally, the paper proposes a measure that predicts the benefits of body adaptation for unlabeled inputs. Overall, this work contributes a simple yet effective baseline method for CIL and provides insights into the benefits of feature adaptation in CIL settings.
