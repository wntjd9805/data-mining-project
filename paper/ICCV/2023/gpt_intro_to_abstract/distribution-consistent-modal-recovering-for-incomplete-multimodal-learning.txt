This paper proposes a novel framework called DiCMoR (Distribution-Consistent Modal Recovering) for addressing the problem of missing modalities in multimodal machine learning. The traditional approach of data recovery and downstream tasks on the recovered data is limited by the inconsistent distribution between the available and recovered modalities. In contrast, DiCMoR transfers the distribution from the available modalities to the missing modalities before decoding the data, aiming to mitigate the distribution gap. The framework introduces modality-related flows and bridges different modalities within the embedded distribution space. The invertible modality-specific normalizing flow is used to map features of different modalities into latent spaces with gaussian distributions, reducing the distribution gap. The latent states of the missing modality are sampled to estimate the original missing data. Class-specific flows are designed to ensure discriminability and enhance the recovery. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of DiCMoR in various modality-missing patterns, with reduced distribution gaps between recovered and missing modalities. Overall, this paper presents a novel approach for multimodal understanding with missing modalities.
