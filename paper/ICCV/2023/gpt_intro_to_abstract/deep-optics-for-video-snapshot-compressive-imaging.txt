High-dynamic-range (HDR) and high-frame-rate (HFR) video capture is a challenging task in computational photography. Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) offers a solution by multiplexing video frames with distinct modulation patterns into a snapshot measurement and reconstructing the original video using advanced algorithms. This paper proposes a deep optics framework that enhances the performance of real-world video SCI. The framework introduces a new type of structural mask for motion-aware and full-dynamic-range (FDR) measurement, enabling FDR video SCI. Additionally, a lightweight reconstruction network called Res2former is developed, which uses Transformer to capture long-term temporal dependencies and achieves competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art network. The proposed deep optics framework optimizes both the structural mask and the reconstruction network, incorporating sensor response to enable end-to-end training that closely resembles real systems. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in performance on synthetic and real data compared to previous reconstruction methods.
