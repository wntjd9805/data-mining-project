Camera motion estimation is a critical problem in computer vision with applications in various tasks such as motion segmentation, video stabilization, 3D reconstruction, and more. This paper proposes a robust method for estimating camera rotation in crowded scenes. It distinguishes between static and moving objects, which is a challenging task in crowded environments. The proposed method focuses on frame-to-frame camera motion estimation and optical flow-based techniques, which are better suited for small motions. Existing methods for frame-to-frame camera motion estimation often break down in the presence of moving objects. The proposed method uses a rotation voting mechanism based on optical flow to estimate camera rotation without relying on RANSAC. A new dataset of crowded scenes is also introduced to evaluate the algorithm's performance. The contributions of this paper include a novel camera rotation estimation algorithm, comparative evaluations in dynamic and static scenes, and the introduction of a new dataset with ground truth rotation.
