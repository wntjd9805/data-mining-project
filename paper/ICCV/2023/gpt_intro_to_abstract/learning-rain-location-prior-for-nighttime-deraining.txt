Rain can significantly degrade image quality and visibility, especially at night, due to the low light conditions and complex illuminations. This poses challenges in distinguishing rain streaks from other image features, hindering the performance of high-level vision algorithms and posing safety risks in applications like autonomous vehicles. Despite recent advancements in deep learning, existing deraining methods primarily focus on daytime scenarios, leaving nighttime deraining largely unexplored. Current datasets also lack nighttime scenes and fail to consider the interactions between rain and light sources. In this paper, we propose a novel deraining method specifically targeting night scenes. We emphasize the importance of location information of rain streaks in nighttime deraining and introduce a Rain Location Prior (RLP) that can be learned implicitly by recurrent residual models. We also propose a Rain Prior Injection Module (RPIM) to enhance the importance of features within rain streak areas indicated by RLP. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real night rainy scenes. Our contributions include the proposal of a nighttime deraining method, the development of RLP and RPIM techniques, and the validation of our method's performance through rigorous experiments and ablation studies.
