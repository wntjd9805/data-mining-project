This paper introduces the field of 3D semantic segmentation for autonomous driving using LiDAR data. It highlights the advantages of using LiDAR data, such as resilience to domain shifts and precise geometric information. However, deep learning methods for LiDAR data are still sensitive to domain shifts, making domain adaptation and domain generalization methods necessary. The paper proposes a method called 3DLabelProp for domain generalization in 3D semantic segmentation, which accumulates sequences of LiDAR frames and utilizes geometry-based mechanisms to speed up processing. The contributions of the paper include evaluating state-of-the-art methods in domain generalization and introducing the 3DLabelProp method for autonomous driving semantic segmentation.
