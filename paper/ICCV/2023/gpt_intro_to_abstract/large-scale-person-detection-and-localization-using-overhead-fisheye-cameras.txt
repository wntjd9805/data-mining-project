Accurate position finding of persons is important for various location-sensitive applications. GPS is unreliable in interior spaces and urban areas, leading to the investigation of alternative solutions. Signal-based solutions such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are easily interfered with, while vision-based solutions rely on cameras and pre-acquired maps for location information. However, existing efforts mainly focus on urban place recognition or indoor camera localization using perspective cameras, with limited attention to person positioning using overhead fisheye cameras. In this paper, we introduce LOAF, a large-scale overhead fisheye dataset for person detection and localization in both indoor and outdoor scenes. LOAF offers a wide variety of surveillance scenarios and includes radius-aligned human-box annotations specifically designed for the positioning challenge. We also devise a person positioning system that utilizes fisheye visual models and altitude information. Our system outperforms previous methods in person detection and delivers precise localization results.
