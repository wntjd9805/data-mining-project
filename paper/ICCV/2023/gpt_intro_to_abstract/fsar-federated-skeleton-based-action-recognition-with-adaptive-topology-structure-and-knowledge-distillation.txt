Skeleton-based action recognition is a valuable research area with applications in various fields such as human-robot interaction and intelligent security surveillance. Recent advancements in deep neural networks have shown promising results in learning spatial and temporal features from skeleton sequences. However, these methods heavily rely on centralized collection of human skeleton videos, which raises privacy concerns. In response to the increasing awareness of personal data protection, decentralized training techniques, such as federated learning, are being developed. In this work, we explore the application of federated learning to skeleton-based action recognition for privacy-preserving of skeleton data. Federated Learning is a collaborative learning approach that aims to collectively learn from multiple decentralized edge devices while preserving the security and privacy of local data. We propose a vanilla Federated Skeleton-based Action Recognition (Vanilla FSAR) paradigm, which optimizes a generic feature space from multiple and non-shared data silos while maintaining data privacy. We also address the challenges of non-IID data distribution and heterogeneous graph topologies across clients, which can hinder model convergence. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce Adaptive Topology Structure (ATS) and Multi-grain Knowledge Distillation (MKD) mechanisms to enhance the collaborative training between decentralized clients and improve model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, showing significant improvements over state-of-the-art federated learning methods while maintaining data privacy.
