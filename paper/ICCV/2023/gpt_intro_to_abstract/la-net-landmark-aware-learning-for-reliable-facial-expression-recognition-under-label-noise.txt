Facial expression recognition (FER) is a vital task in computer vision, with significant applications in human-computer interaction and fatigue driving detection. Despite the development of multiple FER models, the presence of noisy labels remains a challenge. Individuals may have varying interpretations of facial expressions, resulting in inconsistent annotations. Additionally, facial expressions exhibit inter-class similarity, further complicating label noise. This paper proposes a new noise-tolerant FER model, called Landmark-Aware Net (LA-Net), which leverages facial landmark information to combat label noise. LA-Net consists of two key modules: label distribution estimation (LDE) and expression-landmark contrastive loss (EL Loss). LDE calculates the label distribution of each sample based on the assumption of similar emotions for expressions with analogous landmark patterns. EL Loss incorporates landmark information into expression representations through supervised contrastive learning. The proposed modules are used during training and do not incur additional costs in deployment. Experimental results demonstrate that LA-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-the-wild and synthetic noisy datasets. Overall, this paper contributes a landmark-aware FER model that uses facial landmarks to alleviate label noise and improve FER performance.
