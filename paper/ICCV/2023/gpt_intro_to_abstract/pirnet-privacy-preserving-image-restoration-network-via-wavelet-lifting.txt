Abstract:Cloud-based multimedia services have rapidly developed with the advancement of cloud computing technology. However, image processing in the cloud poses a serious threat to client privacy. To address this issue, researchers have explored the field of privacy-preserving image processing, focusing on image encryption as a defense mechanism. However, encryption-based methods have drawbacks such as making the encrypted images easily detectable and relying on complex homomorphic cryptosystems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that operates privacy-preserving image restoration in the steganographic domain, which offers advantages in terms of invisibility and security. Our method utilizes steganography to conceal the secret image within a cover image, making it difficult for attackers to detect. All restoration operations are performed on the stego images, ensuring that the secret image remains undisclosed during transmission and storage on the cloud server, significantly reducing the risk of privacy leakage. Moreover, our approach eliminates the need for complex homomorphic cryptosystems, reducing computational costs. We present a wavelet lifting based privacy-preserving image restoration network, PIRNet, which achieves confidential image restoration without revealing the source image. We also reveal an important finding regarding the correlation between the quality change of stego images and the restored secret image. This finding serves as a foundation for designing our network for confidential image restoration.
