Machine learning-driven technologies, including video anomaly detection (VAD), are increasingly being adopted in society. VAD aims to identify anomalous events in videos without human supervision. However, concerns about privacy violations and accuracy arise with the public adoption of such technologies. VAD, in particular, is susceptible to visual privacy leakage and data bias. Existing approaches to prevent privacy leakage in action recognition have been proposed, but privacy-preservation in video anomaly detection remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose TeD-SPAD, a framework that addresses the privacy-preservation issue in VAD by using a temporally-distinct triplet loss during anonymization training. We evaluate the framework's performance on widely used anomaly datasets and demonstrate significant improvements compared to prior methods in terms of privacy leakage reduction and anomaly detection utility. Our contributions include introducing the problem of privacy-preservation in video anomaly detection, proposing a novel framework, and establishing evaluation protocols. By using TeD-SPAD, we are able to eliminate 32.25% of privacy leakage with only a 3.96% reduction in frame-level AUC performance on the UCF-Crime dataset.
