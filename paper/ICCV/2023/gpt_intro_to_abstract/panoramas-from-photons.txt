Motion recovery from image sequences is a fundamental task in computer vision with various applications. Traditional methods struggle with fast motion and low-light conditions, limiting their effectiveness. Specialized high-speed cameras are an option but have limitations. Single-photon cameras based on SPAD technology offer high-speed imaging in low-light and are increasingly common. However, the binary nature of the captured frames presents challenges for motion estimation. This paper proposes a technique for estimating rapid motion using high-speed binary frames from single-photon cameras. The method aggregates frames in a motion-aware manner to increase signal and bit-depth while minimizing motion blur. Experimental results demonstrate the recovery of global projective motion, enabling the capture of high-quality panoramas with super-resolution and high dynamic range capabilities. The limitations of current SPAD arrays are acknowledged, but the evolving technology and increasing availability offer promising solutions.
