Developing intelligent autonomous wayfinding agents that can navigate in unexplored environments is a fundamental task in robotics. This paper focuses on audio-visual navigation, where agents locate sound-emitting objects in visually and acoustically rich 3D environments. Existing solutions use reinforcement learning algorithms for direct audio-visual perception, but lack basic wayfinding skills and omnidirectional information gathering. To address these limitations, the authors propose ORAN, an omnidirectional audio-visual navigation agent. ORAN leverages cross-task wayfinding skill transfer and incorporates an omnidirectional information gathering ability. Experimental results show that ORAN outperforms existing methods in terms of navigation performance on the Soundspaces Challenge dataset.
