The problem of Human Motion Prediction (HMP) involves predicting future pose sequences based on observed motions. This problem is challenging as the predicted motions need to be continuous, diverse, and realistic. Previous methods have used an encoding-decoding fashion, but they have limitations such as relying on multiple loss constraints, requiring multi-stage training, and difficulty in switching between different categories of motions. In this paper, we propose a new framework called HumanMAC, which tackles HMP from the perspective of masked completion. In the training stage, we integrate observed and predicted motions to learn a motion diffusion model. In the inference stage, we use a method called DCT-Completion, which employs observed motions for future motion prediction. HumanMAC has several advantages such as having only one loss function, training in an end-to-end manner, and achieving more diverse prediction results with motion switches. We conduct experiments on benchmark datasets and compare our method with state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior performance. Our work provides insights for algorithm improvement in the field of human motion prediction.
