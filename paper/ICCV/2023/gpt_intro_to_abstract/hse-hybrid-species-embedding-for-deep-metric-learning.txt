The field of image retrieval heavily relies on deep metric learning to understand visual similarities. Early methods, such as pair-based loss and proxy-based loss, were proposed to train models for image retrieval. However, the main challenge lies in selecting a metric that can effectively handle the differences between classes in deep metric learning. A promising approach is to explore both intra-class and inter-class variations within the image itself, rather than relying solely on label information.Hard negative samples, also known as false positives, refer to images that resemble anchor images but have different labels. These hard samples share remarkably similar or even identical features with the anchor samples. Different approaches such as hard sample mining and generation have been proposed to aid network convergence by introducing a significant gradient. Recently, generating appropriate hard samples involves creating supplementary training data. This is achieved through linear interpolation, a prevalent method for generating synthetic samples. However, assigning absolute labels to these synthesized samples is challenging due to the manifold structures and cluster boundaries present in the embedded space.To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Hybrid Species Embedding (HSE) method that leverages mixed sample data augmentation to generate additional training samples. HSE creates hybrid species by combining features from multiple classes and embedding them into spatial positions. During training, different classes are randomly chosen for data augmentation in each batch. The labels of hybrid species are disregarded, and their placement near the category with the most similar features simulates human categorization behavior. This strategy ensures similarity while avoiding unrelated samples. By synthesizing samples using various mixed sample data augmentation techniques, our approach imparts similar characteristics to the hard sample for the model without explicit mining. Additionally, we dynamically adjust the position of each batch of hybrid species embedding, bypassing the need for considering label information of these hybrid instances.Our contributions include introducing a novel metric learning strategy (HSE) that embeds challenging and unseen classes during training, adapting mixed sample data augmentation techniques for HSE, and demonstrating through experiments the efficacy of our approach in enhancing performance across state-of-the-art metric learning tasks on various datasets.
