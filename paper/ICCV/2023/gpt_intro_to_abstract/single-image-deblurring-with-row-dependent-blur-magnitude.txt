This paper focuses on image restoration, specifically the task of recovering a high-quality clean image from a corrupted one by removing undesired degradation. The authors highlight the importance of understanding the camera's exposure mode, which can induce motion blur and distortion in images. They compare two common exposure modes: global shutter (GS) and rolling shutter (RS). They explain that image deblurring is more tractable for GS cameras compared to RS cameras due to the need for pixel-level correspondences in RS correction. The authors also introduce a lesser-known shutter mode called global reset release (GRR), which combines elements from both GS and RS modes. The GRR mode introduces blurring effects with row-dependent blur magnitude. Previous research has shown that GRR mode can be advantageous for video deblurring. However, the authors note that utilizing GRR mode for single image deblurring is a more challenging task. To address this challenge, the authors propose a shifted horizontal window-based Transformer block with spatial compensation and spectral enhancement. This Transformer block leverages self-attention and U-net structure with multi-scale input/output to tackle single GRR deblurring. The authors also introduce a new dataset captured under real scenes named GRR-real to facilitate the development and evaluation of GRR deblurring. The contributions of this paper include the proposed Transformer block, the use of horizontal partition strategy and hierarchical positional encoding, and the validation of the benefits of using GRR mode for single image restoration.
