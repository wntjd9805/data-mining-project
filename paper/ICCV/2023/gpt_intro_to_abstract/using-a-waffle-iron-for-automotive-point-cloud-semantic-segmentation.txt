This paper introduces a novel 3D backbone architecture, called WaffleIron, for semantic segmentation of point clouds in autonomous driving scenarios. Unlike previous methods that rely on sparse 3D convolutions, WaffleIron is built using standard MLPs and dense 2D convolutions, making it more widely available and easy to implement. The architecture of WaffleIron is described and its training process is explained to achieve state-of-the-art performance on automotive semantic segmentation benchmarks. The paper also highlights the ease of tuning the hyperparameters of WaffleIron and the stable performance over a wide range of grid resolutions. Experimental results demonstrate that WaffleIron can compete with existing top-performing methods, proving the effectiveness of standard MLPs and dense 2D convolutions in 3D segmentation tasks.
