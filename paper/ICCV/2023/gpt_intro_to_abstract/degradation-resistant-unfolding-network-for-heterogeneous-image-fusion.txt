Heterogeneous image fusion (HIF) is a technique that combines images from different sensors to generate a more robust and informative image. It has been studied in various domains such as infrared and visible image fusion, medical image fusion, and biological image fusion. The fused image is expected to have better quality and be better suited for decision-making or subsequent processing, especially in degradation scenarios.Existing HIF techniques can be classified into model-based and learning-based methods. Model-based methods use optimization-based fusion frameworks with manually designed fusion rules, but they are limited by hand-crafted features and struggle to cope with degradation conditions. Learning-based methods, on the other hand, utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN) to learn an end-to-end fusion mapping, but they lack interpretability and perform poorly in complex degradation scenarios.In this paper, we propose a novel deep unfolding network called Degradation-Resistant Unfolding Network (DeRUN) for the HIF task. DeRUN integrates a fusion model (HIFM) that emphasizes salient information and suppresses noise to better resist degradation conditions. We frame the fusion model's iterative optimization process into a multi-stage network with data fusion, visual fidelity, and structure preservation modules. We also incorporate a joint constraint strategy (JCS) and a partial weight sharing module (PWSM) to ensure robustness and efficiency.To train DeRUN, we introduce a gradient direction-based entropy loss (LGDE loss) that encourages the model to possess texture representation capacity even in degradation scenarios. Experimental results on four HIF tasks demonstrate that DeRUN outperforms existing methods in terms of image quality, running efficiency, degradation resistance, and favorability in downstream applications.In summary, our contributions include the proposal of DeRUN, a deep unfolding network for HIF, that combines interpretability and generalization to generate high-quality fused images even in degradation scenarios. We also introduce techniques such as JCS, PWSM, and LGDE loss to enhance the robustness and efficiency of DeRUN. Experimental results validate the superiority of DeRUN over existing methods.
