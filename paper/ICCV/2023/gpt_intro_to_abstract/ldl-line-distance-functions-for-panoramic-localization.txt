Estimating the location of a mobile device or agent in relation to a 3D map, known as visual localization, has numerous applications in robotics and AR/VR. While perspective images are commonly used for localization, panorama images offer a 360-degree field of view that includes a wealth of visual evidence from the entire scene. Recent advancements in visual localization using panoramic images have shown promising results, utilizing a two-step process of candidate pose selection and refinement. However, existing methods for this task often suffer from limitations in computational efficiency and robustness, mainly due to the costly and unstable pose selection process. To overcome these limitations, this paper explores the use of lines as the major cue for panoramic localization. Lines have desirable properties, such as stability in extraction and sparse representation of a scene, which can lead to reduced memory consumption and computation. However, lines alone are visually ambiguous and harder to use for successful localization compared to other cues. This paper presents LDL, a fast and robust localization method that leverages the contextual information from lines in panoramas and 3D maps to effectively find the camera pose. LDL focuses on using line segments for pose search rather than pose refinement, which is a departure from prior works. The proposed method rapidly evaluates an immense set of poses in milliseconds and selects the coarse poses for further optimization. LDL compares the distribution of lines in 2D and 3D using distance functions for candidate pose selection and enhances the discriminative power of distance functions through decomposition. Once a small set of initial poses are found, LDL refines them using PnP-RANSAC and leverages local features for establishing correspondences. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that LDL performs competitively against baselines in various indoor scenes, exhibiting robust performance in the presence of object changes and large illumination shifts. Furthermore, LDL achieves an order-of-magnitude faster runtime compared to global feature comparison methods, making it a practical localization algorithm that can enhance existing techniques.
