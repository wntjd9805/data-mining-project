Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a new machine learning paradigm that has gained popularity for its ability to learn high-quality representations of complex data without the need for data labeling or human annotations. One dominant SSL approach, contrastive learning, has achieved comparable performance to supervised learning and also provides robustness to adversarial perturbation, label corruption, and data distribution shift. However, the vulnerability of SSL to malicious attacks, particularly backdoor attacks, remains an open question. In this work, we explore the vulnerability of SSL to backdoor attacks and present CTRL, a simple yet highly effective self-supervised backdoor attack. Through empirical evaluation on benchmark models and datasets, we demonstrate that SSL is highly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, achieving comparable attack success rates to supervised backdoor attacks. We also analyze the inherent vulnerability of SSL and discuss the challenges in defending against self-supervised backdoor attacks. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the vulnerability of SSL to backdoor attacks and suggests directions for further research in defense mechanisms.
