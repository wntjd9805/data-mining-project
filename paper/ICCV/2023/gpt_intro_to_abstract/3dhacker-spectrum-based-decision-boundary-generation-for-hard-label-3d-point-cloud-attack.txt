Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are indistinguishable from legitimate ones but lead to incorrect model predictions. Existing 3D point cloud attack methods suffer from limitations such as reliance on white-box settings and low-quality adversarial examples. In this paper, we propose a more challenging black-box hard-label setting for attacking 3D point clouds, where attackers only have access to the final classification results. We introduce a novel spectrum-based decision boundary attack method called 3DHacker, which fuses point clouds in the spectral domain to preserve geometric characteristics and generate smooth adversarial examples. Our method consists of boundary-cloud generation and boundary-cloud optimization stages. We achieve 100% attack success rates and competitive perturbations compared to existing methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.
