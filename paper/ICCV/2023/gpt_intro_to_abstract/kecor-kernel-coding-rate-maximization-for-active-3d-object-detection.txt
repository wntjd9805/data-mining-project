LiDAR-based 3D object detection is a crucial component in scene understanding for applications such as robotics, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. However, achieving highly accurate recognition of objects requires a large volume of labeled point cloud data, which can be costly and time-consuming. Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to mitigate labeling costs by iteratively selecting the most beneficial samples for label acquisition. While AL has been effective in reducing labeling costs for recognition tasks, its application in LiDAR-based object detection has been limited due to high computational costs and the involvement of both detection and regression tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel AL strategy called kernel coding rate maximization (KECOR) for efficient and effective active 3D detection. By using the coding rate theory and modifying the formula from feature selection to sample selection, KECOR allows for the greedy search of informative point clouds. We train a proxy network of the 3D detector head with labeled samples and extract the outer product of Jacobians from all proxy layers to form the empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK) matrix of all unlabeled samples. The NTK kernel captures non-linearity and considers both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, aiding in the recognition of challenging objects. We further incorporate classification entropy maximization into the selection criteria to accommodate different choices of kernels and 3D detector architectures. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed approach, achieving significant reductions in annotations and running time compared to state-of-the-art active 3D detection methods.
