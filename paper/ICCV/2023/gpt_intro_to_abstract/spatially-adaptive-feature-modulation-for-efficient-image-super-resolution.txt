Single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task in computer vision that aims to restore a high-resolution image from a low-resolution counterpart. With the rapid development of streaming media and high-definition devices, there is a growing need for efficient and effective SR methods to improve visual display on these platforms. Deep learning-based SR methods have shown significant performance improvements by leveraging large amounts of training data and powerful hardware technologies. However, these large models require high computational costs, making them challenging to deploy in resource-constrained scenarios.Recent advancements in visual transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated the importance of exploring non-local feature interactions for high-quality image reconstruction. However, existing self-attention mechanisms used in ViTs are computationally expensive and not suitable for efficient SR design. Therefore, there is a need to develop a lightweight yet effective model that integrates the principles of convolution and self-attention.To address this challenge, we propose a spatially-adaptive feature modulation network (SAFMN) that achieves a favorable trade-off between performance and efficiency. The SAFMN model utilizes a feature modulation mechanism based on multi-scale representations to dynamically select representative features. Additionally, a convolutional channel mixer is introduced to encode local contextual information and perform channel mixing. The SAFMN network demonstrates better trade-off between SR performance and model complexity compared to existing lightweight methods.The contributions of this paper include the development of an efficient feature modulation mechanism that combines the efficiency of CNNs and the adaptability of transformers. We also present a compact convolutional channel mixer that efficiently encodes local contextual information. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SAFMN model achieves a favorable trade-off between accuracy and model complexity. Overall, this work provides insights and advancements in the field of single image super-resolution, enabling more efficient and effective reconstruction of high-resolution images.
