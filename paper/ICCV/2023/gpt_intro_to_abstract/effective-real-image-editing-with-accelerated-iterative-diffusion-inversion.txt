Diffusion models have proven to be valuable in generating high-quality images by applying a de-noising process from a random noisy starting point. These models have achieved state-of-the-art image quality and have been used extensively in image generation and editing. However, reducing the number of sampling steps for image generation and editing is still an ongoing research challenge.In this paper, we propose an improved numerical solver for the inversion process in diffusion models. We model the inversion process as an ordinary differential equation problem and utilize the implicit backward Euler method for exact reconstruction. We introduce the Accelerated Iterative Diffusion Iteration (AIDI) method, which adopts a fixed-point iteration process for each inversion step. We also incorporate the Anderson acceleration method to enhance the convergence of this iteration.Through experiments conducted on a large test set, we demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves reconstruction accuracy compared to a baseline approach. We achieve a reduction in the LPIPS value for a 20-step reconstruction from 0.148 to 0.063. Additionally, our method effectively handles lower guidance scales and exhibits minimal artifacts even with inversion steps as low as 10.In summary, our framework for text-based real image editing, based on pretrained text-to-image diffusion models, offers several key advantages. We introduce fixed-point iteration and acceleration in diffusion inversion, leading to improved reconstruction accuracy. We also propose a blended guidance method for effective editing in relevant areas while maintaining fidelity elsewhere. Our image editing method remains effective even with lower inversion steps, offering superior performance compared to competing approaches.
