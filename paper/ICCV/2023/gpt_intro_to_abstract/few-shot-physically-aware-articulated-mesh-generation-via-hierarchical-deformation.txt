This paper introduces a hierarchical mesh deformation-based generative model for few-shot physically-aware articulated mesh generation. The existing works on mesh generation mainly focus on whole objects without considering object functionalities and rely on reconstructing meshes from other representations. In this work, the authors consider mesh generation for articulated objects to support physically realistic articulations. Training a generative model on existing articulated object datasets presents two challenges: limited scale and the need for physically plausible generation. The paper addresses these challenges by proposing a hierarchical mesh deformation model and a physics-aware deformation correction scheme. The model learns from a limited number of meshes by borrowing shared convex-level deformation patterns from large-scale rigid meshes. The deformation correction scheme prevents self-penetrations by penalizing them during mesh articulation and using a collision response-based shape optimization strategy. Extensive experiments on the PartNet-Mobility dataset show that the proposed model outperforms baseline methods in terms of fidelity, diversity, and physical plausibility. The contributions of this work include the first solution for few-shot physically-aware articulated mesh generation and the introduction of a hierarchical mesh deformation model and a physics-aware deformation correction scheme.
