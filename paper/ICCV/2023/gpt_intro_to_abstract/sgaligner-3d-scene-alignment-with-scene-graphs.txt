Generating accurate 3D maps of environments is a fundamental component for agents and machines to operate within the scene. Recently, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a structured and rich way to represent the world, offering scalability, updateability, and shareability. However, the problem of aligning partial 3D scene graphs from different observations in real-world scenarios has not been explored. In this paper, we propose SGAligner, the first method for aligning pairs of 3D scene graphs that is robust to unknown overlap and changes in the environment. We leverage entity alignment methods in multi-modality knowledge graphs and independently encode the semantic entities, attributes, and relationships in the scene graphs. We perform scene graph alignment using node matches with the highest similarity and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in 3D point cloud registration and alignment tasks. We create a benchmark on the 3RScan dataset and show that our approach achieves significant improvements in registration accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our contributions include the proposal of SGAligner, the evaluation of our method on various tasks, and the creation of a benchmark dataset.
