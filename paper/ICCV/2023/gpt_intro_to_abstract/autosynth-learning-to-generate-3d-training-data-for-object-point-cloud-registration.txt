This paper introduces the concept of 3D point cloud registration using deep learning networks. The paper argues that the quantity and quality of training data are just as important as network architecture and training details. Traditional methods of collecting 3D registration data are time-consuming and do not scale well for deep network training. To address this, the paper introduces AutoSynth, an automated approach to curating a 3D dataset for effective training data. AutoSynth uses a meta-learning strategy to search for the optimal dataset from a large space of potential datasets. The search is guided by a target real-world dataset, reducing the domain gap. The experiments demonstrate that the resulting training dataset improves registration performance on both the target data and other real-world point clouds. To make the search tractable, the paper replaces the true quality function with a proxy one, using an autoencoder for reconstruction accuracy. This approach yields a significant speedup compared to using a registration network. The paper demonstrates the generality of the approach by implementing it with two different point cloud registration networks and achieving better performance than using the widely used ModelNet40 dataset. The main contributions of the paper are the introduction of AutoSynth, the use of a surrogate network for tractability, and the evidence of good generalization ability using a single scanned real-object as a target dataset during the search process.
