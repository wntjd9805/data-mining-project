Diffraction poses a significant limitation on the performance of under-display cameras (UDCs). The small spacing between display pixels results in blurring due to diffraction, which spans multiple pixels in the captured images and is difficult to remove in post-processing. Additionally, the display blocks a significant portion of light, leading to a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the captured photographs. Previous work in UDC imaging has focused on using deep neural networks for deblurring, which outperforms conventional methods. However, the performance of these techniques is strongly influenced by the condition of the imaging model and SNR. Inspired by previous work on enhancing imaging systems with phase masks, we propose the use of phase masks to suppress diffractive blur and increase light throughput for UDCs. We show that a single phase mask placed at the display is ineffective and propose the use of two microlens arrays in front of and behind the display. These phase masks allow light to pass through the transparent areas of the display and recover the original waveform, resulting in increased light transmission and reduced blurring. We implement the microlens arrays as thin polarization-dependent phase masks to ensure high display quality. By optimizing the folding height of each microlens, we minimize chromatic aberrations. Through simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed phase mask significantly improves image quality in UDCs. However, there are limitations to our method. Extending the phase correction to 2D displays is computationally challenging, and the use of phase masks may constrain the field of view of the UDC.
