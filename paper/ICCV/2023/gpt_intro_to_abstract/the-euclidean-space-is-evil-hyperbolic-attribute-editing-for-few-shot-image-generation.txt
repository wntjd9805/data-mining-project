This paper focuses on the task of few-shot image generation, which aims to generate new realistic and diverse images using a small number of training examples. The authors propose a method called Hyperbolic Attribute Editing (HAE), which utilizes a hyperbolic latent space to capture hierarchical attribute relations among images. By mapping latent vectors from Euclidean space to hyperbolic space, HAE enables easy manipulation of the latent code to generate images of unseen categories. The authors demonstrate that the hyperbolic space allows for control over the semantic diversity of the generated images. Experimental results show that HAE achieves stable few-shot image generation with high quality and diversity, outperforming existing methods in terms of control over diversity. This paper presents a novel approach for few-shot image generation using hyperbolic attribute editing, making it a significant contribution to the field.
