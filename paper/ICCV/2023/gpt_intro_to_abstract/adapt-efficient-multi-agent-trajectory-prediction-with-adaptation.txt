This paper addresses the problem of trajectory forecasting for self-driving agents. Anticipating the future behavior of other agents is crucial for safe navigation, but it poses various challenges due to the dynamic nature of traffic scenes and the uncertainty in future predictions. While existing methods primarily focus on predicting the trajectory of a single agent, this paper highlights the importance of predicting the trajectories of all agents in the scene. The proposed approach introduces dynamic weight learning to adapt to the situation of each agent, enabling efficient adaptation in a scene-centric approach without iterating over agents. The method achieves accurate and efficient multi-agent prediction, outperforming state-of-the-art models with a fraction of their parameters. Furthermore, the model can easily switch between single and multi-agent settings, providing a unified prediction process. Overall, the contributions of this paper include the proposal of a novel approach for predicting the trajectories of all agents, achieving state-of-the-art results efficiently, and creating a unified prediction process for both single and multi-agent settings.
