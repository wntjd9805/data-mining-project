Point cloud segmentation is a crucial task in computer science, with applications in autonomous driving and robotics. While fully-supervised methods have shown impressive performance, they require large amounts of annotated training data and assume a closed set of classes. This assumption is unrealistic in the open world where new classes continually arise. Few-shot segmentation algorithms have been proposed to tackle the lack of data for novel class adaptation, but they often ignore the base classes and have limited practicality. In this paper, we propose the generalized few-shot point cloud segmentation (GFS-3DSeg) task, where both base and novel classes need to be segmented using limited labeled samples for the new classes. We introduce geometric words as transferable knowledge obtained from the base classes, which capture shared local geometric structures. We then learn a geometric-aware semantic representation that combines class-agnostic geometric features with class-specific semantic features. Additionally, we introduce geometric prototypes to supplement semantic prototypes and propose a geometric-guided classifier re-weighting module for rectifying biased predictions. Experimental results on S3DIS and ScanNet datasets show the effectiveness of our method, outperforming state-of-the-art few-shot segmentation methods. Overall, our contributions include studying the GFS-3DSeg task, proposing geometric words and a geometric-aware semantic representation, introducing geometric prototypes, and conducting extensive experiments to validate our method.
