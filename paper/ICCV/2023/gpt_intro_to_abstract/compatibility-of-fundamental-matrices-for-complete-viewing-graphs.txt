Finding camera matrices that correspond to a given set of fundamental matrices is essential in 3D reconstructions from 2D images. While many methods exist for estimating fundamental matrices, they often only estimate a subset of all possible fundamental matrices between cameras. To describe this incomplete set, viewing graphs are commonly used. In this paper, we focus on understanding the conditions under which a reconstruction of n cameras can be obtained given complete knowledge of n fundamental matrices. We also provide a result for general graphs. A camera is represented by a 3x4 matrix, and the fundamental matrix between two cameras with distinct kernels is a 3x3 rank-2 matrix that encodes point correspondences between the cameras. While there exists a unique pair of cameras for a given rank-2 3x3 matrix, it is not always guaranteed that there exist cameras such that a set of rank-2 matrices represents the fundamental matrices between them. We refer to such sets as compatible. Finding necessary and sufficient conditions for the compatibility of fundamental matrices has practical and theoretical applications. It can aid in algorithms for structure-from-motion and contribute to the understanding of critical configurations. For n = 3, there are known constraints on the fundamental matrices and their epipoles. For non-collinear cameras, necessary and sufficient conditions for compatibility have been established. However, these conditions are not projectively well-defined and do not rely on the fundamental matrices and their epipoles, as in the n = 3 case. This paper contributes by providing explicit homogeneous polynomials that give necessary and sufficient conditions for the compatibility of fundamental matrices in the case of complete graphs. For n = 4, we establish that a set of six fundamental matrices permits a reconstruction of camera matrices with linearly independent centers only if certain constraints are satisfied. We demonstrate that eigenvalue conditions from previous work are unnecessary in the generic case and when all epipoles in each image coincide. We also introduce the fundamental action as a tool for simplifying the compatibility problem and present a necessary and sufficient condition for any viewing graph using a cycle condition. Our approach utilizes algebraic equations and polynomial equations, drawing from applied algebraic geometry techniques and software.
