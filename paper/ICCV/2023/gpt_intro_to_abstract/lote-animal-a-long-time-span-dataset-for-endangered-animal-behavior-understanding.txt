Protecting endangered wildlife is increasingly challenging as global biodiversity declines. Accurate information about wild animals is crucial for effective conservation measures. However, gathering reliable information about endangered animals is difficult due to their scarce and wary nature, as well as their aggressive behavior. In this paper, we propose the use of camera trapping as an effective solution to these challenges. Camera trapping allows for the collection of wildlife image data while ensuring animal welfare. However, camera trap data is vast and contains a significant amount of irrelevant information, making manual sorting and analysis inefficient and imprecise. To address this issue, we propose the use of computer vision technology, specifically robust deep learning models, to automatically extract and analyze image information from camera trap data. We emphasize the need for comprehensive large-scale datasets to provide deep learning algorithms with training and testing data. However, existing datasets for animal protection have limitations in terms of scarcity of wildlife data, short time span and discontinuous space, and limited tasks for testing. To overcome these limitations, we present LoTE-animal, a long-term and continuous dataset for endangered animal behavior understanding. LoTE-animal contains abundant wildlife data in natural habitats, collected from infrared-triggered trap cameras over a 12-year period. The dataset includes videos and images of 11 endangered wildlife species, along with annotated information on different weather conditions, seasons, and habitat environments. We trained and tested computer vision models on the LoTE-animal dataset and evaluated their generalization performance. Our results can serve as a reference for the development of deep learning algorithms in the field of wildlife conservation.
