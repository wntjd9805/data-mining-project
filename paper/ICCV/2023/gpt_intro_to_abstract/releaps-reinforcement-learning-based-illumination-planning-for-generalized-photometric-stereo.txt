Photometric stereo is a technique used to estimate the surface normal of an object based on images taken from different light directions. While traditional methods assume ideal Lambertian reflectance and require at least three calibrated lights, real-world applications are more complex due to non-Lambertian reflectance and global illumination effects. To address this, more lights with uniform distribution are typically used, but this can be impractical. Therefore, there is a need for appropriate illumination planning strategies that can achieve accurate results with a limited number of light directions.Existing methods for illumination planning in photometric stereo are limited to Lambertian reflectance and do not capture the complex properties of real-world materials and illumination. Achieving optimal illumination planning requires addressing two primary concerns: developing an appropriate learning strategy and integrating the image formation model of generalized photometric stereo. Learning-based methods have shown success in handling non-Lambertian reflectance, motivating the integration of illumination planning with a learning-based approach.In this paper, we propose ReLeaPS, a reinforcement learning-based approach for illumination planning in generalized photometric stereo. Reinforcement learning enables efficient exploration of the large search space in a reward-driven manner. We use a dueling deep Q-network to learn the optimal action based on input images and light directions. We also introduce a brute-force exploration strategy and transform sparse rewards into dense rewards to facilitate the learning process. ReLeaPS aims to improve the time-efficiency and accuracy of photometric stereo by enhancing the performance of different photometric stereo backbones with fewer inputs.Results using ReLeaPS show that RL-based illumination planning outperforms existing methods and improves the accuracy of the recovered surface normals. We propose the first RL approach for online illumination planning, design a dueling DQN tailored to generalized photometric stereo, enhance the performance of photometric stereo backbones, and validate the RL-based illumination planning using real data.
