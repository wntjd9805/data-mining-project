In this paper, the authors introduce the concept of using feedback in the form of textual descriptions to modify and improve human body poses. They highlight the importance of static body poses in settings such as yoga and sports, where precise postures are essential. The authors propose leveraging natural language to convey these modifications, as it is a highly semantic and intuitive method. While the link between language and images has been extensively studied, the research on using natural language for 3D human modeling is still in its infancy. To address this gap, the authors introduce the PoseFix dataset, which contains pairs of 3D poses with textual instructions on how to move from one pose to another. They also design a pipeline to automatically generate modifiers and increase the dataset size. The authors then tackle two tasks: text-based pose editing and correctional text generation. For pose editing, they use a conditional Variational Auto-Encoder, while for correctional text generation, they use an auto-regressive transformer model. The authors provide a detailed evaluation of both baselines and demonstrate promising results. In summary, the contributions of this paper include introducing the PoseFix dataset, the task of text-based pose editing, and the task of correctional text generation.
