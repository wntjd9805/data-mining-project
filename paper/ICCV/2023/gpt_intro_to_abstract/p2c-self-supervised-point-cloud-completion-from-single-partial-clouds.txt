In this paper, we introduce a novel self-supervised approach to point cloud completion (PCC) that requires only a single partial point cloud observation per object for training. This approach eliminates the need for complete samples and reduces the difficulty and expense of annotation. We propose a category-specific network called Partial2Complete (P2C) that groups input points into patches and predicts masked patches based on unmasked regions. We also develop a cycle constraint and a latent reconstruction loss to guide the completion process. Additionally, we introduce two new components, Region-Aware Chamfer Distance (RCD) and Normal Consistency Constraint (NCC), to address the challenges of point cloud completion. We evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real-world completion tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to methods that have access to complete samples or multiple incomplete observations. Our contributions include the introduction of P2C, the design of RCD, and the presentation of NCC, all of which improve the completion quality of point clouds.
