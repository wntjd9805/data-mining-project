Abstract:High-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images are in high demand for agricultural monitoring and mapping services. To overcome the limitations of satellite sensors, existing approaches fuse high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral low-resolution (LRMS) images through pan-sharpening. While deep learning-based techniques have been widely used for pan-sharpening, most approaches have focused on spatial domain solutions, neglecting the exploration of frequency domain solutions. This paper introduces a Pyramid Dual Domain Injection Network (PDDIN) that incorporates frequency domain information into the pan-sharpening process. The PDDIN utilizes a Feature Extraction Pyramid, a Frequency Injection Pyramid, and a Spatial Injection Pyramid to extract multi-scale details from PAN images and inject them into LRMS images in both the spatial and frequency domains. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network outperforms existing state-of-the-art pan-sharpening algorithms in quantitative and qualitative evaluations on multiple satellite datasets. This work contributes to improving the accuracy and effectiveness of pan-sharpening techniques for agricultural monitoring and mapping services.
