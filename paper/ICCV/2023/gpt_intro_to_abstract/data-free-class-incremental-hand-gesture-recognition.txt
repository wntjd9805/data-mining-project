Humans rely on their hands for communication and interaction with their environment, making hand tracking in virtual reality (VR) a compelling method for user engagement. However, existing VR systems have predefined hand gestures, limiting customization and personalization. Registering custom gestures can enhance user immersion, comfort, and accessibility. This paper addresses the problem of registering new gesture classes to an existing model without access to previous data, a challenge in AR/VR domains. The authors propose a data-free class-incremental learning framework called BOundary Aware proTotypical Model Inversion (BOAT-MI) for 3D skeleton-based dynamic hand gesture recognition. Inspired by max-margin classification, BOAT-MI selects support vectors near decision boundaries for model inversion, preserving decision boundaries and improving generalization. The proposed approach is evaluated on a large-scale 3D skeleton gesture recognition dataset and demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods. This work contributes to the field of continual learning in hand gesture recognition and provides a benchmark for future research.
