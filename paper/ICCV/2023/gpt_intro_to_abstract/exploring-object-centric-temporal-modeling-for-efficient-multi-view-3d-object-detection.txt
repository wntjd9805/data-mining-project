This paper introduces a new paradigm for camera-only 3D detection in autonomous driving. It discusses the recent progress in multi-view object detection that leverages temporal information to improve performance. The paper categorizes existing methods into BEV temporal and perspective temporal methods based on their differences in temporal representation. It highlights the limitations of both approaches and proposes the use of sparse queries as hidden states of temporal propagation. The paper presents experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and its potential for generalization to other sparse query-based methods. The abstract also mentions that the paper only includes the introduction section and provides the answer format for the output.
