Point cloud registration is a key problem in 3D computer vision, widely used in mobile robotics and autonomous driving. While learning-based methods have shown promise in object-level and indoor registration tasks, large-scale point cloud registration faces challenges including processing efficiency, outliers, and mismatches. To address these challenges, this paper proposes RegFormer, an end-to-end network for large-scale point cloud registration. RegFormer utilizes a transformer-based architecture for feature extraction and frame association, processing the projected point cloud patches on a 2D surface. A projection mask is introduced to handle invalid positions. The paper also introduces a Bijective Association Transformer (BAT) to reduce mismatches in distant point cloud pairs. Experimental results on KITTI and NuScenes datasets demonstrate that RegFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, with successful registration recall rates of 99.8% and 99.9% respectively. The contributions of this work include the development of an efficient, keypoint-free and RANSAC-free network for large-scale point cloud registration, as well as the introduction of BAT to reduce mismatches and improve accuracy.
