In this paper, we discuss the limitations of current retouching tools and propose a new white-box framework for image retouching. We highlight the importance of providing retouching strategies that are understandable by humans and adaptable to individual preferences. Our proposed model, RSFNet, generates attention maps of regions and filter arguments simultaneously, allowing users to customize the suggested results. We demonstrate the superiority of our model compared to global white-box retouching methods, with a wider range of filter classes and a simpler training procedure. We also propose a scheme that allows users to easily edit and modify the RSFNet suggested results, making it effective and convenient for image applications.
