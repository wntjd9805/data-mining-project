Lens flare is a common artifact that affects the visual quality of images and degrades the performance of computer vision tasks. This paper focuses on the challenge of removing lens flare from images, particularly in smartphone imaging where flare is exacerbated. The lack of paired training data is a major obstacle in flare removal, but recent works have created datasets to address this issue. However, existing methods do not consider the specific tone mapping operator in the image signal processing pipeline, leading to over-saturation and inconsistency with auto-exposure. Additionally, most networks fail to separate the light source from the flare, resulting in unrealistic appearances. This paper proposes solutions to generate more realistic flare-corrupted images by considering tone mapping and synthesizes flare images by combining the scene and flare in inverse gamma space. The proposed method also effectively recovers multiple light sources by avoiding hard thresholds. A new dataset containing real flare-corrupted images captured by different consumer electronics is also contributed. The experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in overcoming the limitations of existing methods. Overall, this paper provides insights and solutions to improve the performance of lens flare removal techniques.
