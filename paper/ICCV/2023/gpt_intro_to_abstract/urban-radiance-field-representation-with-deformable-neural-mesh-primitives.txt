Synthesizing photo-realistic 3D scene images is a challenging problem in computer vision, particularly in urban outdoor scenarios. Previous approaches using mesh-based representations have faced difficulties in constructing water-tight mesh models and accurately recovering textures and illuminations. Recent neural rendering methods, like NeRF, have proposed representing scenes using implicit neural functions, but their computational intensity is still high. To address this, some researchers have combined neural rendering with explicit point cloud reconstruction to improve efficiency. However, current reconstruction algorithms often result in non-uniformly distributed and incomplete reconstructions, degrading rendering quality. In this paper, we propose an efficient radiance field representation for large-scale environments by combining mesh-based rendering with neural representations. We introduce the Deformable Neural Mesh Primitive (DNMP) to parameterize the geometry and radiance of local areas. We optimize a low-dimensional latent code to deform primitive shapes for 3D structure modeling. Unlike previous methods, we leverage the rasterization pipeline for feature interpolation, improving efficiency. We coarsely voxelize the scene based on 3D reconstruction results and represent the geometry and radiance of each voxel using DNMPs. To handle noisy reconstructions, we voxelize the scene at hierarchical resolutions and separately represent radiance fields with hierarchically-sized DNMPs. Our method achieves robustness against noisy reconstructions and outperforms previous point-cloud-based methods. We evaluate our approach on two urban datasets, achieving leading performance in novel view synthesis with faster speed and lower memory footprint compared to NeRFs. We also present a lightweight version that maintains interactive rates of rendering while sacrificing some quality. Our method supports scene editing and can be easily integrated into modern graphic rendering pipelines, offering potential applications in VR/AR.
