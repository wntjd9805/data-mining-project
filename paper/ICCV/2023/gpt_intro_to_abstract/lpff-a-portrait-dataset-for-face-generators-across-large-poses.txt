This paper introduces the concept of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and their advancements in high-resolution 2D image generation, particularly in face modification tasks. It discusses the limitations of existing 2D and 3D approaches in processing large-pose face data. The paper proposes a novel high-quality face dataset called Large-Pose-Flickr-Faces Dataset (LPFF) to extend the camera pose distribution of existing datasets and train face generators free of certain problems. The authors present a face detection and alignment pipeline suitable for large-pose images and demonstrate how LPFF can assist 2D and 3D face generators in generating and editing large-pose faces. The paper also introduces a new FID measure for evaluating the performance of 3D-aware generators. The contributions of this research include the collection of a large-pose face dataset, the development of retrained 2D and 3D face generators, and the introduction of a new evaluation measure.
