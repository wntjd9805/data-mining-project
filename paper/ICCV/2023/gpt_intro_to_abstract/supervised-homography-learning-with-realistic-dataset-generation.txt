Homography estimation is a crucial task in computer vision, with applications in high-dynamic range imaging, image stitching, and video stabilization. Traditional methods rely on feature extraction and matching techniques, but they struggle in challenging scenes without sufficient high-quality feature matches. Recently, deep learning-based methods have emerged as a more robust alternative. These methods can be divided into supervised and unsupervised approaches, with unsupervised methods benefiting from large amounts of real-world data. However, the lack of qualified training data is a major challenge for supervised methods. In this paper, we propose an iterative framework that generates image pairs satisfying both label and realism criteria for supervised homography learning. We utilize a homography estimation network and a dominant plane detection network to estimate the homography and dominant plane masks of unlabeled source and target images. Using a pre-trained dominant plane detection network and a sampled ground truth homography, we generate a new target image that maintains scene parallax and dynamic objects in the foreground. To ensure quality in the generated target image, we introduce a content consistency module and a quality assessment module. These modules eliminate unexpected content and select high-quality image pairs for training. Through iterative learning steps, we improve both the network's capability and the quality of the synthesized dataset. Our approach addresses the lack of qualified datasets in supervised homography learning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks.
