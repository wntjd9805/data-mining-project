With the increasing demand for high-resolution images and videos on the internet, efficient and versatile image compression methods are crucial for storage and transmission. Learning-based image compression (LIC) approaches have recently surpassed traditional codecs by training end-to-end networks to optimize non-linear transforms and probabilities for entropy coding. However, these models may not be ideal for every test case, especially when the test image comes from a different domain. Fine-tuning the model on a specific dataset has limitations, reducing generalization and consuming resources. This paper proposes an entropy-efficient adapter to bridge the gap between screen content and natural image compression. The proposed adapter enhances the model's adaptability during encoding and inserts a lightweight adapter into the decoder for image adaptive decoding. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves the best BD rate on both in-domain and out-domain compression, with an improvement of over 2 dB for images with a large domain gap. This work is the first to systematically investigate feasible solutions for entropy-efficient transfer learning in screen content image compression.
