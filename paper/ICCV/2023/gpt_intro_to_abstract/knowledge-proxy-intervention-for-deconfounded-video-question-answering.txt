In recent years, the field of Video Question-Answering (VideoQA) has gained significant attention due to its importance in interactive artificial intelligence and recognition science. VideoQA involves several challenges, including capturing visual clues in videos, parsing language semantics and syntax, and aligning visual clues with linguistic semantics and syntax. Many previous works have focused on these challenges and achieved success in open-ended and multi-choice VideoQA tasks. However, existing methods are often misled by dataset bias, leading to spurious correlations and difficulty in revealing causal relations between video, question, aligned feature, and answer. Dataset bias is a major issue in VideoQA, and simply enlarging the dataset does not eliminate it. This paper introduces the Knowledge Proxy Intervention (KPI) framework, which addresses dataset bias and implements causal intervention using front-door adjustment. The KPI framework is model-agnostic and can help mitigate spurious correlations caused by dataset bias. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through experiments on benchmark datasets, showing significant improvement over baseline methods.
