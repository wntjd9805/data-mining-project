The Fast Unified System for 3D Object Detection and Tracking (FUS3D Object Detection and Tracking) is introduced in this paper. This system performs both 3D object detection and multi-object tracking using 3D depth data, making it the first of its kind to achieve real-time inference speeds on edge devices like the Nvidia Jetson Nano. The FUS3D system is flexible and can be used as a standalone model for faster runtime with a slight drop in accuracy. It is best suited for small scale indoor environments and static camera settings, making it ideal for applications in human monitoring systems and surveillance. The use of 3D depth sensors in these settings allows for continuous operation and independence from lighting conditions, minimizing privacy concerns. The FUS3D system outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of object detection performance, tracking metrics, and runtime on the MIPT dataset focused on human indoor activity. The main contributions of this paper are the development of a significantly faster and resource-constrained 3D object detection method with a transformer-based tracking stage, several approaches to improve detection performance, and a seamlessly integrated transformer-based tracking stage that outperforms existing trackers. The paper also provides an overview of related work, a detailed description of the proposed pipeline, ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, and a discussion of limitations and reflections on the presented work.
