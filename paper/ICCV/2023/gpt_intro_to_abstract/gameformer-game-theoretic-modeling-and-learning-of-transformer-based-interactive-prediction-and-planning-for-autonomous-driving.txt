Accurately predicting the future behaviors of traffic participants is crucial for autonomous driving systems. Deep neural network-based approaches, particularly Transformers, have shown advancements in prediction accuracy. However, existing models often fail to explicitly model agents' future interactions and their interaction with the autonomous vehicle (AV). To address this, a typical approach is the conditional prediction model, which uses the AV's internal plans to forecast other agents' responses. But this one-way interaction neglects dynamic mutual influences. In this study, we propose a hierarchical game-theoretic framework and introduce a Transformer-based prediction model called Game-Former. We encode the driving scene and use a series of Transformers to implement level-k reasoning. Our model considers agents' reasoning levels and explicit interactions. We demonstrate the prediction and planning performance of our Game-Former model on benchmark datasets. Our contributions include proposing a hierarchical decoding structure, achieving state-of-the-art prediction performance, and validating the planning performance in different driving scenarios.
