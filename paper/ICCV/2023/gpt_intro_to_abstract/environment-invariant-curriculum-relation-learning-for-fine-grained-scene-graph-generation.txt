This paper introduces the problem of scene graph generation (SGG) in computer vision and its importance in high-level vision and language tasks. Despite advancements, SGG still faces challenges, particularly due to the imbalance of data in the given datasets. Existing methods primarily focus on addressing the class imbalance to generate accurate relation words. However, there is also a context imbalance from the subject-object pairs that is often overlooked. This paper proposes the Environment-Invariant Curriculum Relation Learning method to effectively generate fine-grained scene graphs by addressing both class and context imbalance. The paper provides an analysis of a popular SGG dataset and highlights the need for considering context imbalance in SGG.
