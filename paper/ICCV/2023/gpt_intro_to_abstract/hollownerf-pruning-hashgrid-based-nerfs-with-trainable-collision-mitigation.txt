Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have gained recognition for generating photorealistic 3D scenes from 2D images. Previous works have focused on improving the efficiency of NeRF. Instant-NGP is a solution with fast training speed, but suffers from severe collisions at fine resolutions. Other research focuses on accelerating NeRF rendering by sampling near the surface of interest, but this relies on prior knowledge of surface geometries. In this paper, we propose HollowNeRF, a novel NeRF compression method that improves rendering accuracy while using fewer parameters. HollowNeRF prioritizes important features and prunes unnecessary features, leading to a redistribution of hash collision probability. It uses a trainable 3D saliency grid to guide feature compression and a soft zero-skipping gate to ensure zero density in the 3D space. Experimental results show that HollowNeRF achieves better accuracy than state-of-the-art methods while using fewer parameters. The key contributions of this work include the novel NeRF compression solution, HollowNeRF, and the use of an ADMM-based optimization framework for feature pruning. Evaluation on popular NeRF datasets demonstrates the superior balance between cost and accuracy of HollowNeRF compared to existing solutions.
