The commercial solutions for cloud-based localization and mapping in mixed reality and robotics have raised privacy concerns. Previous approaches have focused on lifting point-based features to randomly oriented lines to conceal the appearance of images and maps, but these methods often come with trade-offs in terms of accuracy and recall. Additionally, density-based attacks have been shown to be effective in uncovering information from privacy-preserving representations. In this work, we propose a new approach that introduces a coordinate permutation scheme to construct axis-aligned lines, allowing us to recover the original points during pose estimation and improve the accuracy of localization results. Furthermore, our method increases combinatorial complexity for density-based attacks and reduces the chance for line intersections. We experimentally demonstrate these improvements and show that our approach provides a stronger level of privacy preservation while achieving accuracy comparable to traditional non-private methods.
