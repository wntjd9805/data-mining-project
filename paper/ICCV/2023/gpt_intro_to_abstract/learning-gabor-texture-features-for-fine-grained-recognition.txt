Recognizing fine-grained categories accurately is a challenging task in computer vision due to the subtle differences in their visual appearance. Deep neural networks have made significant advancements in extracting deep class-discriminative features for fine-grained recognition. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are commonly used as the model backbone, have limitations in capturing comprehensive information for fine-grained recognition. These limitations include the loss of local detailed information and the bias towards learning low-frequency components, while ignoring high-frequency components. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that introduces texture features as a complement to CNN features for fine-grained recognition. We use Gabor filters, a widely used technique in image processing for extracting low-level texture features, as the texture extractor. Gabor filters are effective in capturing local-detailed information and can extract sufficient high-frequency information by controlling the filter parameters. In our work, we propose a method to learn Gabor filter parameters in a supervised manner, along with a statistical feature extractor and a region selection gate, to extract effective and efficient texture features for fine-grained recognition. We conduct extensive experiments on four datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method with state-of-the-art performance. Our contributions include pioneering the use of Gabor filters in fine-grained recognition, improving recognition performance by leveraging texture features, and implementing key designs for model effectiveness and efficiency.
