Instance segmentation, the task of determining whether two image regions belong to the same object, is a challenge in computer vision. Humans are able to easily perform this task by recognizing parts as belonging to a whole. In this paper, we propose object-centric embeddings (OCEs) for unsupervised instance segmentation. OCEs map image patches in a way that preserves the spatial relationships between patches from the same object. We apply this approach to microscopy imaging and introduce a method called CELLULUS, which identifies and segments individual cells in microscopy images. By making reasonable assumptions about microscopy images, such as similar appearance and random distribution of objects, OCEs can be learned in an unsupervised fashion. Compared to supervised methods that rely on annotated training data, CELLULUS provides an unsupervised approach that eliminates the need for manual annotations. We demonstrate competitive results on diverse microscopy image datasets and show that our unsupervised pipeline can serve as a starting point for supervised training when limited ground truth annotations are available. Additionally, we find that combining supervised training with unsupervised segmentation leads to improved performance compared to purely supervised learning. This reduction in the need for manual ground truth annotations is particularly valuable in the field of biological research, where large amounts of microscopy data are generated. CELLULUS, our proposed method, addresses this need and is available for use.
