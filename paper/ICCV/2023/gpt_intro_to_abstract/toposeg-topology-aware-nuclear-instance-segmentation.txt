Pathological image analysis plays a crucial role in cancer diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. Nuclear instance segmentation, which focuses on the morphology of nuclei within pathology images, is an important step in this analysis. However, nuclear instance segmentation faces challenges such as crowded nuclei distribution, blurry boundaries, and variability in size, shape, texture, and intensity. Existing approaches have explored network architectures and incorporated distance maps to improve segmentation performance but often rely on pixel-wise losses that ignore crucial structural information. This leads to unreasonable results, especially in distinguishing touching or overlapping instances. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach called TopoSeg, which incorporates topology-aware nuclear instance segmentation. We introduce a topology encoding method to capture structural information and develop a topology-aware module (TAM) that encodes dynamic changes and persistence of different topology structures. A topology-aware loss function is also introduced, integrating topology information into model learning. Additionally, an adaptive topology-aware selection module (ATS) is introduced to focus on regions that require topological optimization. The proposed TopoSeg approach improves instance segmentation performance without altering the original network structure. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of TopoSeg on three nuclei datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
