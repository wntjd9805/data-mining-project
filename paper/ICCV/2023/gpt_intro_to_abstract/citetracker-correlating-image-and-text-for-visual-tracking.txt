Abstract:This paper introduces a novel visual object tracking framework, named CiteTracker, which incorporates text descriptions of target objects to improve tracking performance in challenging scenarios. Traditional trackers struggle with drastic appearance variations and low-quality target exemplars. To address these issues, we propose a text-image correlation based approach that generates adaptive text descriptions of the target and correlates them with test image features for target state estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our contributions include the development of a text-image correlation framework, an adaptive feature model for target descriptions, and the achievement of superior tracking results.
