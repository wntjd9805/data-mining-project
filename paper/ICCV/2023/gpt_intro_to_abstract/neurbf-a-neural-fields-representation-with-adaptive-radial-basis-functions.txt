Neural fields, or implicit neural representations, have become popular in various applications like image representation and 3D shape reconstruction due to their effectiveness. They utilize neural networks to map continuous input coordinates to corresponding output values, offering a concise and efficient formulation. However, early neural fields struggle with representing high-frequency details due to the limitations of MLPs. To address this, local neural fields have been proposed, using grid-like structures to organize neural features and interpolation to aggregate them. However, these structures are not adaptive and can lead to suboptimal accuracy. In this work, we propose NeuRBF, which combines adaptive RBFs and grid-based RBFs to increase the accuracy and compactness of neural fields. We extend radial bases with multi-frequency sinusoids to enhance their representation capability and propose tailored weighting schemes for adapting RBFs to different target signals. Our experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and compactness in various tasks.
