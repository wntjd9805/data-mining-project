This paper addresses the problem of distinguishing between visually similar but distinct 3D surfaces in computer vision systems. The authors propose a new method called visual disambiguation, focusing on the task of pairwise image comparison. They assemble a dataset called Doppelgangers, consisting of image pairs that depict either the same surface or different but similar surfaces. To train their model, they utilize existing image annotations from the Wikimedia Commons database and incorporate local features and 2D correspondence. The authors demonstrate that their approach significantly outperforms baselines and alternative network designs on challenging disambiguation tasks. Moreover, they showcase the usefulness of their learned classifier as a pre-processing filter in structure from motion pipelines. Overall, this paper formulates the visual disambiguation problem, introduces the Doppelgangers dataset, and presents a network architecture that achieves strong classification performance and improves the correctness of reconstructions.
