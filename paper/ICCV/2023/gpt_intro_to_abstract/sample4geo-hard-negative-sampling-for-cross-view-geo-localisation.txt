Determining the geo-location of images without meta-data is a challenge in computer vision. This problem is especially important in areas such as agriculture and automotive, where precise positioning is required. Existing solutions, such as real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS, are expensive and can be affected by signal outages. In urban areas, tall buildings can block or decrease the accuracy of GPS signals. To address these issues, computer vision approaches based on image retrieval have been proposed. Traditional methods rely on visual clues like sun position or weather, while current approaches focus on deep learning techniques. Specifically, cross-view image retrieval compares ground images with satellite images to determine the location. Previous work has mainly used CNN-based methods, but there is growing interest in using Transformer or MLP Mixer architectures. However, these models usually require larger sizes and non-shared weights between the view-specific encoders. This paper introduces a weight-sharing Siamese CNN that learns class-agnostic embeddings using the InfoNCE loss. The paper also presents two sampling methods for hard negative examples in deep metric learning. The performance and generalization ability of the proposed framework outperforms current approaches, without the need for complex preprocessing steps or special aggregation modules.
