3D point cloud registration is a crucial task in various fields such as robotics, graphics, and computer vision. Recent deep learning methods have achieved significant success in indoor scenarios, but they struggle to generalize to real-world indoor environments. One potential solution is to use synthetic data for training, but existing synthetic datasets lack complex geometric structures and have point distribution gaps compared to real scenes. To address these challenges, we propose FlyingShapes, a large-scale synthetic dataset for point cloud registration, constructed by inserting objects from ShapeNet into 3D-FRONT scenes. We also introduce SIRA, a generative sim-to-real adaptation pipeline that adapts the point cloud distributions. Our contributions include the construction of FlyingShapes, the design of SIRA, and extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrating the superiority of our method.
