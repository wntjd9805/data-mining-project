Rotated object detection has gained attention in computer science research due to the prevalence of objects with arbitrary orientations in natural scenes. This is particularly important in tasks such as scene text detection, face detection, and aerial image recognition. While progress has been made in detecting rotated objects, little emphasis has been placed on the design of a proper backbone feature extractor. In this paper, we propose an Adaptively Rotated Convolution (ARC) module that dynamically adjusts the convolution kernel based on the orientation of each input, improving the flexibility and adaptability of the network. We also introduce an efficient conditional computation technique to handle objects with multiple orientations within an image. The ARC module can be easily integrated into existing convolution layers, allowing any backbone network to effectively detect rotated objects. Experimental results on two popular rotated object detection benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance when combined with the Oriented R-CNN method.
