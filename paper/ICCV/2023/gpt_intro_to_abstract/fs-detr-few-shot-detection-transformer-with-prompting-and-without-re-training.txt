This paper introduces a system called Few-Shot Detection Prompting (FS-DETR) that addresses the limitations of current few-shot object detection (FSOD) systems. FS-DETR is capable of detecting multiple novel classes simultaneously, supports an arbitrary number of examples per class, and does not require re-training at test time. The system utilizes visual templates or prompts from the new classes, which are used in the encoder to filter image features and in the decoder as visual prompts to help predict the locations of objects. This approach is different from previous work that relies on additional modules or engineered structures. The main contributions of this work include the proposal of FS-DETR, a fine-tuning-free FSOD method, the extension of DETR based on visual prompting and pseudo-class embeddings, and the proposal of a simple and efficient pipeline for training the system. The experiments demonstrate that FS-DETR outperforms existing methods on standard FSOD benchmarks such as PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO, particularly in extreme few-shot settings.
