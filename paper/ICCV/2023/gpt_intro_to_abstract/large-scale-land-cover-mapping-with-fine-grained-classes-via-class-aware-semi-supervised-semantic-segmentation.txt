Land cover mapping is crucial for various applications such as urban management, climate change research, ecosystem protection, and sustainability-related studies. However, obtaining fine-grained annotations for large-scale land cover mapping is expensive and time-consuming. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) can be a potential solution to this problem by utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data. However, large-scale land cover mapping with fine-grained classes often suffers from class imbalance, leading to suboptimal performance in minority classes. Most SSL methods assume that labeled and unlabeled data have the same class distribution, which is not true in most scenarios. Existing pseudo-labeling methods also have limitations in assigning pseudo-labels and exploiting hard samples. To address these challenges, we propose a unified Class-Aware Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation framework. Our approach leverages the potential of unlabeled data and mitigates the class imbalance problem in large-scale land cover mapping. We introduce a class-aware unlabeled data selection method to construct an SSL dataset and compensate for class imbalance on the labeled data. Additionally, we propose a class-balanced learning method that dynamically estimates class prior information to re-weight samples and classes in the loss function. We also propose the Class Center Contrast method, which uses ground truth and pseudo-labels to optimize feature embedding space and utilize both easy and hard samples. By utilizing our proposed methods, we alleviate the class imbalance issue and effectively improve the performance of large-scale land cover mapping with fine-grained classes.
