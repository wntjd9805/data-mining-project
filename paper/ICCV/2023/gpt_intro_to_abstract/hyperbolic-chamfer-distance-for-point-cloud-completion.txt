This paper addresses the issue of incomplete and sparse point clouds captured by 3D sensors and its negative impact on downstream tasks such as point cloud segmentation and detection. The task of inferring the complete shape of an object or scene from incomplete raw point clouds is referred to as point cloud completion. Many learning-based approaches have been introduced for point cloud completion, with supervised learning using an encoder-decoder structure being the dominant paradigm. However, the visual quality of point clouds in real-world environments is often perceived non-homogeneously, with certain geometric structures being emphasized. This fact has been largely overlooked in the literature. The paper introduces Density-aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) to address the equal weighting problem in point cloud completion metrics. However, DCD has some issues, such as assigning higher weights to outliers and not preserving good matches well. To overcome these problems, the paper proposes Hyperbolic Chamfer Distance (HyperCD) as a distance metric in hyperbolic space. HyperCD preserves good matches and improves bad matches gradually during training, leading to better point cloud completion performance. The paper also demonstrates state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets using networks trained with HyperCD. Overall, the contributions of this paper include the introduction of HyperCD, the exploration of hyperbolic space for point cloud completion, and the demonstration of improved performance on benchmark datasets.
