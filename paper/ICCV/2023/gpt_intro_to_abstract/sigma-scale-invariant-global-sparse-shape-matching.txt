Finding correspondences or matchings between parts of 3D shapes is a well-studied problem in computer science with applications in computer vision, computer graphics, and other fields. Traditional approaches to 3D shape matching involve optimization problem formulations, but in recent years, learning-based approaches have become more popular. However, these learning-based approaches lack theoretical guarantees and structural properties of obtained solutions. In this paper, we propose a novel mixed-integer programming formulation called SIGMA for scale-invariant global sparse shape matching. Our method is initialization-free and can be solved to global optimality for many practical instances. It is also invariant to rigid transformations and global scaling, eliminating the need for extrinsic alignment. We introduce the use of the projected Laplace-Beltrami operator for geometry reconstruction, which combines intrinsic and extrinsic geometric information while remaining invariant under actions of the Euclidean group. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging non-rigid shape matching datasets.
