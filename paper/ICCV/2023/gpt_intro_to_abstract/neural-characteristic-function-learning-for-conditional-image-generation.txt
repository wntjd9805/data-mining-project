Abstract:Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been widely used for generating realistic images. However, the original GAN architecture only allows for random image generation from Gaussian noise. To address this limitation, conditional GANs (cGANs) have been developed to generate images based on pre-defined auxiliary information. This paper proposes a novel cGAN architecture called Conditional Characteristic Function GAN (CCF-GAN) that utilizes characteristic functions to establish joint distributions between data and auxiliary information. The paper introduces the Neural CF (NCF) metric, which is a neural network that approximates the difference between characteristic functions. The CCF-GAN is able to generate images that are conditioned on auxiliary information and demonstrates superior performance on synthetic and real-world datasets.
