Current non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging techniques using pulse lasers and time-resolved detectors have limitations in reconstructing hidden objects with large depth variations. Physics-based methods assume three-bounce reflections and no self-occlusion, resulting in a loss of high-frequency details. Learning-based methods have achieved better results but lack dedicated designs for addressing the high-frequency information loss in scenes with significant depth variations. Additionally, neural networks tend to focus on low-frequency components, making them less sensitive to high-frequency details. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework that operates in the Fourier domain. Our framework utilizes a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) to extract frequency features from raw NLOS transients. We make the inverse kernel learnable in the Fourier domain and use attention mechanisms to embed learned scene priors into low-frequency and high-frequency components. This results in finer reconstruction with richer high-frequency information. The obtained features are suitable for various NLOS imaging tasks. We evaluate our proposed method on synthetic datasets and experimental data, demonstrating its effectiveness in reconstructing high-frequency details and achieving higher accuracy.
