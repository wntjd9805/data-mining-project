End-to-end text spotting, which aims to combine text detection and recognition in natural scenes, has gained significant attention in recent years. The interaction and cooperation between text detection and recognition, known as scene text spotting synergy, can result in a combined effect greater than their separate effects. However, previous methods that attempt to join text detection and recognition have not fully achieved this synergy. This paper proposes an Explicit synergy Text Spotting Transformer framework, called ESTextSpotter, that explicitly models discriminative and interactive features for text detection and recognition within a single decoder. By designing task-aware queries to capture the distinct feature patterns of these two tasks, ESTextSpotter enhances the explicit synergy between them. The proposed framework outperforms previous methods in terms of text detection, English text spotting, and multilingual text spotting, demonstrating its effectiveness. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of ESTextSpotter, the incorporation of a vision-language communication module, and the achievement of significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in scene text spotting.
