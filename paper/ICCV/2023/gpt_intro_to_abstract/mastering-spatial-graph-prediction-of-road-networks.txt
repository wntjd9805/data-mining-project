Road layout modelling from satellite images has become an important task in remote sensing, with various applications in everyday life. The availability of vast amounts of geospatial data and the need to accurately establish the connectivity of roads in remote areas have led to increased interest in representing road networks precisely. Structured data types, such as graphs, are commonly used for efficient representation and encoding of geometry in various domains including computer graphics, virtual reality, gaming, and the film industry. However, when dealing with complex predicted structures, the optimization of a surrogate objective may not always indicate how well the model's predictions align with the intended final utilization.In this paper, we explore the use of reinforcement learning (RL) for fine-tuning road layout detection models and demonstrate its potential for improving performance in producing intricate geometric predictions. Existing methods for road layout detection primarily rely on pixel-based segmentation models trained on rasterized ground truth graphs. However, pixel-wise segmentation ignores important structural features and geometric constraints inherent to the problem, leading to fragmented outputs and connectivity issues. To address these drawbacks, we propose a new paradigm where outputs are generated directly as spatial graphs and the problem is formalized as a game, sequentially constructing the output by adding edges between key points. These key points can be identified by off-the-shelf detectors with sufficient accuracy. Our approach eliminates the need for cumbersome post-processing steps or optimization of surrogate objectives, allowing us to focus interactively on different parts of the image and train based on task-specific metrics.Our contributions include:1. Proposing a novel generic strategy for tuning autoregressive models that removes the requirement of decoding in a predefined order and refines initial sampling probabilities through a tree search.2. Creating a synthetic benchmark dataset of pixel-level accurate labels for overhead satellite images, specifically for road network extraction, to simulate complex scenarios and demonstrate improved robustness.3. Validating the wide applicability of our approach by improving the performance of existing methods on popular datasets such as SpaceNet and DeepGlobe.By leveraging RL for fine-tuning and introducing a new approach to road layout detection, we aim to address the limitations of current methods and provide a more accurate representation of road networks in remote sensing applications.
