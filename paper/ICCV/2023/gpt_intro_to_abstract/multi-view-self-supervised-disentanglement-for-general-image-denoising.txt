Image restoration is a critical sub-field of computer vision that focuses on reconstructing image signals from corrupted observations. This paper explores various low-level image restoration problems, such as image denoising, super-resolution, and JPEG artifact removal. Traditionally, image restoration systems are trained on specific corruption distributions and perform well within these distributions. However, they often struggle when deployed in settings with unknown environments or complex corruptions. This paper introduces a new approach called Multi-view self-supervised Disentanglement (MeD) to address the ill-posed nature of image restoration problems. MeD leverages multiple corrupted views to learn the shared scene latent information and separate noise from the scene in the latent space. Experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of MeD, surpassing existing methods in handling unknown noise distributions and outperforming supervised counterparts.
