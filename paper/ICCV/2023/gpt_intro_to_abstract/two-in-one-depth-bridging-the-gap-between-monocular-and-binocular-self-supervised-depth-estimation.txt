This paper introduces a novel self-supervised depth estimation model called TiO-Depth, which can handle both the monocular and binocular depth estimation tasks. The development of deep learning techniques has shown the effectiveness of deep-neural-network-based methods for depth estimation from single images and stereo image pairs. However, obtaining high-quality ground truth depths is time-consuming and labor-intensive. As a result, self-supervised depth estimation methods that do not require ground truth depths for training have gained attention. The monocular and binocular depth estimation tasks are closely related, as both output depth maps, but with differences in predicting depths from a single image and a stereo pair, respectively. Inspired by the finding that monocular models perform better on occluded regions visible in a single view, some models employ a separate binocular or monocular model to boost their performance. To address this, the authors propose a general depth estimation model, TiO-Depth, which can handle both tasks and potentially improve prediction accuracy. TiO-Depth employs a monocular model as a sub-network of a Siamese architecture and incorporates a monocular feature matching module to fuse features for binocular prediction. The paper also proposes a multi-stage joint-training strategy for self-supervised training and performance improvement. The contributions of this work include the introduction of TiO-Depth, the design of a dual-path decoder with feature matching modules, and the proposal of a multi-stage joint-training strategy.
