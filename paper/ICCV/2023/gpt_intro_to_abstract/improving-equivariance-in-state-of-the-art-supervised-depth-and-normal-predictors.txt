Depth regression and surface normal regression are dense prediction tasks in computer vision that involve predicting an output image of the same size as the input image. These tasks require equivariance, where a geometric transform applied to the input image results in the same transform to the output image. However, state-of-the-art depth and normal predictors often fail at equivariance. In this paper, we propose an equivariant regularization approach to improve equivariance in dense depth and normal prediction networks. Our approach consists of an equivariant averaging step and an equivariant loss. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning settings, and show improvements in both equivariance and accuracy. Our contributions include identifying the equivariance issue, proposing an effective regularization approach, and showcasing empirical successes in various scenarios.
