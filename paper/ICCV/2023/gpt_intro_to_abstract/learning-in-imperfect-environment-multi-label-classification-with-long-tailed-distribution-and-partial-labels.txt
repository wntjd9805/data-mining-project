The development of deep learning has greatly benefited the field of computer vision and multi-label classification (MLC) is important for real-world tasks. However, current MLC approaches have limitations in handling long-tailed class distributions and partial labels of instances. In this paper, we propose a new challenge called Partial labeling and Long-Tailed Multi-Label Classification (PLT-MLC), which combines both of these challenges. We identify three key challenges in PLT-MLC: false negative training, head-tail and positive-negative imbalance, and head overfitting and tail underfitting. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end PLT-MLC framework called COMIC, which includes correction, modification, and balance steps. We also create benchmarks for PLT-MLC and show through experiments that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches.
