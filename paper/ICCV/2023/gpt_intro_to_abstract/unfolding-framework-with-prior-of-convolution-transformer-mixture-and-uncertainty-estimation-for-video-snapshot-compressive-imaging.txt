This paper introduces a novel Transformer enabled deep unfolding framework for video Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) reconstruction. SCI systems capture high-dimensional data using a low-speed 2D camera and modulate consequent frames. The reconstruction process, considered as an ill-posed inverse problem, has been dominated by learning-based algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNN). However, previous CNN-based algorithms neglect high-frequency features and struggle to capture global features such as contour and texture features. To address these limitations, the proposed framework combines CNN and Transformer architectures, referred to as the Convolution-Transformer module (CTM), to capture both local and global spatial-temporal interactions effectively. Additionally, the paper introduces uncertainty estimation as a regularized prior under the unfolding framework, utilizing high-frequency information to improve reconstruction fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art algorithms, achieving a significant margin of over 1.2dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).
