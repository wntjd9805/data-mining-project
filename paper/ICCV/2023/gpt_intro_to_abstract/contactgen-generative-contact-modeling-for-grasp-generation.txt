This paper focuses on the modeling of hand-object interaction in various domains such as animation, games, and augmented and virtual reality. The authors highlight the importance of creating computational models that accurately represent the different ways a human hand can interact with an object in order to ensure realism and authenticity in these interactions. They argue that a thorough understanding of contacts, including regions of the object likely to make contact, parts of the hand that will touch the object, contact force strength, and contact direction, is crucial for achieving realistic interactions.The authors note that previous approaches often rely on contact maps applied to object point clouds, but these maps do not fully capture the details of contact and can leave ambiguities regarding which hand regions are in contact and the manner of contact. They propose a novel contact representation called ContactGen, which provides a comprehensive presentation of hand-object interactions by encoding the specific contact parts of both the object and hand, as well as the precise touch direction. ContactGen expands on traditional contact maps and offers a more precise and unambiguous representation of interactions.To generate diverse yet realistic ContactGen for any given object, the authors introduce a generative method using a hierarchical conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that models the contact map, hand part map, and contact coordinate. This CVAE allows for explicit uncertainty modeling for each component and enables the generation of direction maps based on the sampled contact map and hand part map.The proposed ContactGen is applied to human grasp synthesis, where the objective is to generate diverse and physically plausible human grasps for various objects. The authors address grasp uncertainty within the object space, which is a key innovation compared to existing work that mainly focuses on uncertainty within the hand space. They design a contact solver that effectively derives hand grasp poses from ContactGen, resulting in more realistic and organic hand grasps with improved contact, reduced penetration, and increased stability. The hierarchical contact modeling also enhances diversity in generated grasps.Overall, the authors contribute to the field by introducing the ContactGen representation, proposing a sequential CVAE model for uncertainty modeling in hand-object interactions, and developing a novel human grasp synthesis algorithm that combines generative modeling with model-based optimization for enhanced fidelity and diversity. Their experiments demonstrate the efficacy of their method, surpassing the performance of current state-of-the-art techniques.
