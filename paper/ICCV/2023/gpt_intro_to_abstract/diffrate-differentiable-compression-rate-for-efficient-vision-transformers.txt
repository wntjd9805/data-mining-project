This paper introduces a unified token compression framework called Differentiable Compression Rate (DiffRate) for Vision Transformers (ViTs). ViT has shown great success in various vision tasks, but suffers from intensive computational complexity. Various network compression techniques have been investigated to improve the efficiency of ViTs, including token compression which reduces redundancy in ViT. Existing token compression methods, such as token pruning and token merging, have drawbacks in manually setting compression rates and discarding informative foreground tokens. To address these issues, DiffRate leverages differentiable compression rates to seamlessly integrate token pruning and merging. DiffRate employs a novel method called Differentiable Discrete Proxy (DDP) module, which optimally selects important tokens with gradient back-propagation. This process allows for the preservation of top-K important tokens across input images. DiffRate achieves a good trade-off between efficiency and performance, outperforming previous methods in compressing ViTs. The contributions of this work include the development of DiffRate, a formulation of token compression as an optimization problem, and the demonstration of state-of-the-art performance on off-the-shelf models. The authors hope that DiffRate can advance the field of token compression and improve the practical application of ViTs.
