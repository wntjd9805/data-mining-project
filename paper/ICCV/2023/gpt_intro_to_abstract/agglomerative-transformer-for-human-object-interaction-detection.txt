This paper presents AGER, a single-stage Transformer-based HOI detector that aims to efficiently exploit instance-level cues for human-object interaction (HOI) detection. The challenge lies in designing an information carrier that ensures the integrality of instance-level representations (IRs) to satisfy the diverse region preferences of different tasks. Previous methods have addressed this challenge by using additional detectors or query-based instance decoders, but these approaches suffer from low efficiency or task bias. AGER introduces instance tokens, which are generated through a text-guided dynamic clustering process, to improve upon prior methods. Instance tokens allow for flexible extraction of different instance-level cues, eliminate task bias, and improve the integrality of IRs. AGER outperforms previous methods in terms of mAP and cue extraction precision. Moreover, the dynamical clustering mechanism integrates seamlessly with the Transformer encoder, resulting in impressive efficiency improvements. AGER demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on the HICO-Det dataset and achieves improvements in model efficiency compared to previous methods.
