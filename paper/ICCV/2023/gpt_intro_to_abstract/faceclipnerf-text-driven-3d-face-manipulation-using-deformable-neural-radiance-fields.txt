This paper introduces a text-driven manipulation pipeline for 3D face reconstruction using Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). While previous methods have focused on color or rigid geometry manipulations, this study aims to address detailed facial expression editing tasks. The proposed method utilizes face-specific implicit representation methods and spatially varying latent codes to control face deformations. By learning and separating observed deformations, the manipulation network is able to express a combination of locally observed deformations. The method is trained on a dynamic portrait video with approximately 300 training frames. The manipulation pipeline involves optimizing rendered images of the latent codes to be close to a target text in CLIP embedding space. The contributions of this work include the proposal of a text-driven manipulation pipeline, the design of a manipulation network using spatially varying latent codes, and being the first to conduct text-driven manipulation of a face reconstructed with NeRF.
