Action recognition has made significant progress in recent years, but privacy concerns have led to the emergence of privacy-preserving action recognition (PPAR). Current PPAR studies mainly focus on frame-level privacy preservation, neglecting the temporal dynamics between frames and leaving the entire video vulnerable to video-level privacy attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called STPrivacy that performs video-level PPAR from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Inspired by vision Transformers, STPrivacy treats the input video as a tubelet sequence and captures temporal dynamics using self-attention operations. We introduce two token-wise mechanisms, sparsification and anonymization, to remove privacy within our framework. The proposed network is trained using an adversarial learning objective. Experimental results demonstrate that STPrivacy outperforms existing methods in terms of action recognition and privacy protection. We also provide new benchmark datasets for evaluating PPAR methods. Overall, our framework enhances temporal dynamics for action recognition and protects privacy in a more strict manner compared to frame-level methods.
