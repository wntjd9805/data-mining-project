In this paper, we focus on the challenge of false negatives in 3D object detection and propose a pipeline called Hard Instance Probing (HIP) to address this issue. HIP is inspired by cascade-style decoder heads and progressively probes false negative samples, significantly improving the recall rate. We introduce a 3D object detector, FocalFormer3D, which employs multi-stage heatmap predictions and a class-aware Accumulated Positive Mask to focus on hard instances. We also introduce a box-level refinement step using a deformable transformer decoder and a rescoring strategy to eliminate redundant object candidates. Our approach achieves considerable gains over baselines in terms of average recall and ranks 1st on both nuScenes 3D LiDAR detection and tracking leaderboard.
