Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely-used imaging modality with numerous applications. In a parallel-beam CT system, x-ray measurements from various viewing angles are combined to reconstruct a 3D object. Traditional reconstruction methods like Filtered Back Projection (FBP) work well with complete projection data but fail in limited-angle scenarios. Limited-Angle CT (LACT) involves acquiring projections from a limited range of angles. Previous work in LACT reconstruction has focused on model-based optimization methods using sophisticated image priors. Recently, there has been a shift towards deep learning (DL) techniques.DL reconstruction involves training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform a regularized inversion of the forward model. Model-based DL (MBDL) techniques integrate CNNs into model-based algorithms. Popular MBDL frameworks include Plug-and-Play Priors (PnP) and Deep Unfolding. However, the reconstruction of high-quality images with sharp edges remains a challenge, especially in LACT scenarios. Additionally, most prior work in this area can only produce point estimates without quantifying reconstruction uncertainty.In this paper, we propose Diffusion Probabilistic Limited-Angle CT Reconstruction (DOLCE), a conditional generative model for LACT. DOLCE generates multiple diverse high-quality reconstructions from limited-angle data. Inspired by denoising diffusion probabilistic models, DOLCE is designed as a "repeated-refinement" conditional diffusion model. It uses a stochastic sampler conditioned on noisy seed reconstructions. DOLCE also includes a data-consistency step to further enhance image quality. Through extensive experimentation on real-world LACT datasets, we demonstrate that DOLCE outperforms existing methods in terms of image quality and generalization across different data distributions. We also show that DOLCE provides meaningful uncertainty quantification.The main contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) DOLCE is proposed as the first conditional diffusion model for high-quality CT image recovery from limited-angle sinograms. 2) DOLCE is effective on real-world datasets and achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art diffusion models. 3) DOLCE provides uncertainty maps that accurately reflect reconstruction errors. 4) DOLCE successfully recovers geometric structures and sharp edges in high-resolution images, even in severely ill-posed settings. The code for DOLCE is publicly available.
