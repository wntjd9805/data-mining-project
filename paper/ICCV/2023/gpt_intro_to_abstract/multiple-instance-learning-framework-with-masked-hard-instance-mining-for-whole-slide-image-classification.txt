Histopathological image analysis is crucial in cancer diagnosis and has been facilitated by the digitization of pathological images into Whole Slide Images (WSIs) using digital slide scanners. However, analyzing WSIs poses challenges due to their large size and lack of pixel-level annotations. This paper addresses this challenge by formulating histopathological image analysis as a multiple instance learning (MIL) task. In MIL, each WSI is treated as a bag containing thousands of unlabeled instances (patches). The imbalance in the number of slides and the low positive proportion of instances hinder the inference of bag labels. Previous methods have focused on selecting salient instances to improve WSI classification. However, these salient instances are "easy-to-classify" and may not be optimal for training a discriminative WSI classification model. This paper proposes a novel MIL framework called MHIM-MIL that mines "hard-to-classify" instances using masked hard instance mining strategies. MHIM-MIL incorporates instance masking strategies and an instance attention generator based on a Siamese structure to enhance training efficiency and mitigate overfitting. The framework is optimized using a consistency constraint that explores more supervised information beyond the limited slide label. Experimental results on two WSI datasets demonstrate that MHIM-MIL outperforms other methods in terms of performance and training cost. The contributions of this paper include the proposal of a simple and efficient MIL framework, hybrid instance masking strategies, and the use of a parameter-free momentum teacher and a consistency-based iterative optimization for improved performance.
