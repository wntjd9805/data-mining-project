This paper introduces a fully differentiable transportation pruning method for deep networks. Pruning is a technique used to reduce the size of deep networks while maintaining accuracy. However, selecting which parts of the network to keep and which to prune is a challenging and time-consuming task. To address this, the authors propose a method that optimizes a continuously differentiable mask to sparsify network connections and simultaneously learn network parameters. This allows for gradient-based optimization and efficient search space exploration. Unlike previous methods, the proposed approach offers precise control over network sparsity without the need for additional penalty terms in the loss function. The authors also introduce an efficient entropic optimal transportation algorithm to speed up the pruning process, along with an automatic temperature annealing mechanism for ease of use. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for structured and unstructured pruning on multiple datasets and models.
