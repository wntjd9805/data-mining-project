The introduction section of the computer science paper presents the goal of developing models in computer vision that can understand various scenarios in the visual world. It discusses the recent improvements in open-world performance achieved through web-scale image-text pretraining. However, challenges still exist for object-level tasks, particularly in videos. The paper proposes a transfer of the open-vocabulary capabilities of image-text models to object-level tasks such as object detection and tracking. The model proposed in the paper builds upon previous works and extends them to video understanding. It introduces a decoder to decouple object representations from the image grid, allowing consistent tracking of objects in videos. The paper provides a recipe for incorporating the decoder into the model and demonstrates its performance on challenging tasks. The resulting model, called Video OWL-ViT, shows strong performance in open-world video localization and tracking tasks, even for unseen classes. It also demonstrates zero-shot open-world generalization capabilities on a different dataset.
