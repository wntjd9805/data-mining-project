Lane detection plays a crucial role in autonomous and human driving. Traditional methods relied on low-level features, but recent advancements in deep learning have allowed for more accurate detection. However, these methods may still struggle to detect less visible lanes. To address this, anchor-based lane detection methods have been proposed, but they fail to consider the inter-frame correlation in video frames. Video lane detection utilizes consecutive frames to detect lanes more reliably, especially in challenging scenarios such as occlusions or unmarked lanes. While some techniques exist, they require multiple past frames as input and do not reuse features in subsequent frames. Existing datasets for video lane detection have limitations, such as a small number of images or annotations for visible lane parts only. To overcome these challenges, we modify the OpenLane dataset, creating OpenLane-V, which fills in missing lane parts using matrix completion. In this paper, we propose a novel video lane detector, RVLD, which incorporates information from the previous frame to improve detection results. RVLD consists of an intra-frame lane detector (ILD) and a predictive inter-frame lane detector (PLD). ILD localizes lanes in a still image, while PLD utilizes motion estimation and feature refinement to detect lanes more reliably in the current frame. Experimental results demonstrate that RVLD outperforms existing techniques on both VIL-100 and OpenLane-V datasets. The major contributions of this work include the improved detection results using a single previous frame, the development of simple yet effective motion estimation and feature refinement modules, the modification of the OpenLane dataset for video lane detection, and the introduction of two metrics for evaluating video lane detection performance.
