This paper introduces a novel approach for action recognition in videos using skeleton-based methods. The advantage of skeleton-based methods is their ability to create lightweight models with low computational complexity, as well as their robustness to background noise and lighting conditions compared to RGB-based methods. Previous approaches have focused on extracting features independently from each joint, ignoring the structural correlations between joints. This paper proposes a Spatio-Temporal Curve (STC) module that considers direct spatio-temporal dependencies in a skeleton sequence by constructing curves that connect highly correlated nodes across adjacent frames. Additionally, a Dilated Kernels for Graph Convolution (DK-GC) method is proposed to expand the spatial receptive field without introducing extra parameters. The proposed STC-Net is evaluated on four benchmark datasets and outperforms existing methods in skeleton-based action recognition.
