The concept of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) has been around for years, but ensuring the safety of AVs on real roads through 3D object detection models remains a challenge. Efforts have been made to collect large datasets of 3D road scenes and annotate them carefully, but the annotation burden is still significant. Semi-supervised learning methods have been proposed to address this challenge, but they rely on unlabeled raw 3D scenes which can potentially disclose private information on the roads and violate data protection regulations. In this paper, we propose UpCycling, a novel SSL framework that uses de-identified, unlabeled intermediate features instead of raw data for training 3D object detection models. UpCycling does not require additional computation or server-side annotation burden, and the use of intermediate features improves privacy protection. We address the challenges of augmenting features reliably to increase data diversity and providing high-quality pseudo labels by proposing hybrid pseudo labels and feature-level ground-truth sampling (F-GT). We implement UpCycling on two 3D detection models and perform experiments on major datasets for AV applications, demonstrating its effectiveness in both partial-label and domain adaptation scenarios. The contributions of this work include addressing labeling cost, privacy leakage, and AV-side computation cost, providing insights on GT sampling in SSL, and achieving privacy protection while performing comparably to state-of-the-art methods in 3D object detection.
