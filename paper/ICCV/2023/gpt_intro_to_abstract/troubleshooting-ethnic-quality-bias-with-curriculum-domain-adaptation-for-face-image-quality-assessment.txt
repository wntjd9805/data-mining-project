This paper addresses the issue of ethnic quality bias in Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) systems deployed in real-world scenarios with different demographic distributions. The existing FIQA schemes assume similar distributions between training and test data, leading to biased predictions in target domains. The unbalanced demographic attributes in mainstream FIQA training datasets contribute to domain shifts. The challenge lies in reducing ethnic quality bias using unbalanced training data. The paper proposes an Ethnic-Quality-Bias Mitigating (EQBM) framework based on curriculum domain adaptation. The framework explores intra-domain quality margin and inter-domain uncertainty to amend quality scores and mitigate ethnic bias. The contributions of the paper include addressing the problem of ethnic quality bias in FIQA, devising a new framework to amend quality scores, and proposing a sequential adaptation strategy for curriculum domain adaptation.
