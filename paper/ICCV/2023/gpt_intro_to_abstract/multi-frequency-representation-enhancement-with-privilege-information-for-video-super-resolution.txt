Video super-resolution (VSR) is a desired technique for restoring high-resolution video frames from low-resolution frames in real-world applications. Compared to single image super-resolution, VSR is more challenging as it requires aggregating information from multiple related but misaligned frames. This paper introduces a novel VSR model called MFPI, which leverages multi-frequency representation enhancement (MFE) and privilege training (PT) to improve performance. MFE operates in the frequency domain to capture spatial and temporal information, while PT encodes privilege information from high-resolution videos to enhance model training. Experimental results show that MFPI outperforms previous methods in several VSR benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of MFE and PT. This paper's contributions include the proposal of MFE, PT, and the demonstrated effectiveness of MFPI in various datasets.
