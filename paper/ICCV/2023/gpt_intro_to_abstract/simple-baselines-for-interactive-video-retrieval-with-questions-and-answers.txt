Abstract:This paper addresses the need for accurate and efficient tools to search video collections by proposing a framework for interactive video retrieval based on video question answering. The framework aims to improve the initial ranking of videos by allowing users to refine their queries. Previous research has mainly focused on single-shot scenarios, but this paper explores the potential of interactive retrieval systems. To overcome challenges in data collection, the authors use Video Question Answering (VideoQA) to simulate user responses. The proposed framework differs from previous work by directly incorporating video information with the question and not requiring fine-tuning. Three question generators are developed to gather discriminative information beyond objects in the target video. Experimental results show that the proposed system generalizes well to multiple datasets and significantly outperforms baseline models. The findings highlight the potential of question-based interactive retrieval frameworks to enhance video search.
