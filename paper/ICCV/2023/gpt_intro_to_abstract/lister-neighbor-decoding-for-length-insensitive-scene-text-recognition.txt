Scene text recognition (STR) is a popular topic in computer vision, involving the extraction of machine-readable symbols from images of text in real-world scenes. While recent works have made advancements in recognizing arbitrary-shaped text and incorporating language models, the issue of handling long sequences of text has received limited attention. This paper addresses this problem by analyzing the performance of existing methods on text of different lengths and proposing an effective approach for length-insensitive STR. The authors observe that the decoders in scene text recognition models play a crucial role in predicting text and are thus likely to be important for handling long text sequences. They identify three types of text decoders: CTC-based decoder, serial attention decoder, and parallel attention decoder. While the CTC-based decoder is efficient and robust to long text recognition, it has limitations in feature learning. The serial attention decoder predicts characters step by step using RNN or Transformer decoder, but it is slow in inference. The parallel attention decoder, on the other hand, suffers from redundancy and high GPU memory usage due to feeding all image patches or token features into Transformer layers.To address these challenges, the authors propose a Length-Insensitive Scene Text Recognizer (LISTER) that incorporates a novel Neighbor Decoder (ND) and a lightweight Feature Enhancement Module (FEM). The ND utilizes an attention mechanism to align characters based on their neighbors, regardless of their absolute position in the string. It relies on a novel neighbor matrix to indicate the next neighbor locations, enabling effective length-insensitive text decoding. The FEM enhances the feature map by selectively feeding aligned character features to the Transformer layers, reducing computation cost. The self-attention layers adopt a sliding window approach to handle arbitrary-length sequences.The contributions of this work include the introduction of LISTER as a length-insensitive scene text recognizer with the neighbor decoder as its core module. It is the first attempt to achieve effective length-insensitive text recognition. Additionally, the authors propose the Feature Enhancement Module for enhancing the feature map with low computation cost. Through extensive experiments, they demonstrate that LISTER performs on par with the state-of-the-art methods on common STR benchmarks and outperforms them on long text recognition. It also shows excellent performance in length extrapolation.
