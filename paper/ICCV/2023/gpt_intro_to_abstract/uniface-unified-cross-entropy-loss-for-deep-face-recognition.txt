Face recognition systems are widely used in various applications, such as mobile phone verification and surveillance. These systems typically consist of three main steps: face detection, facial feature extraction, and recognition. Discriminative facial feature learning is crucial for the success of face recognition systems. Most modern facial recognition approaches are based on deep convolutional neural networks, which can be categorized into sample-to-sample distance-based methods and sample-to-class similarity-based methods. However, both types of methods have limitations and require sophisticated strategies or additional hyper-parameters. To address these issues, this paper introduces a Unified Cross-Entropy (UCE) loss for face recognition. The UCE loss encourages positive sample-to-class similarities to be larger than a threshold, while negative similarities should be smaller than this threshold. The proposed loss is designed to effectively separate negative and positive pairs and is compatible with real face recognition applications. The paper presents the design principle of the UCE loss and its enhancements, such as introducing an enforced margin and balancing strategies. The resulting face model, called UniFace, is evaluated on multiple public datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. This work contributes by addressing the limitations of the softmax loss, proposing the use of a unified threshold as a learnable parameter, and demonstrating the effectiveness of the UCE loss in face recognition tasks.
