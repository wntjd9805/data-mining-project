The human hand plays a crucial role in communication and interaction, making high-fidelity hand modeling important for immersive applications in the digital era. Previous research on hand geometry modeling can be categorized into parametric meshes and implicit representations, each with its limitations. To address these limitations, we propose PHRIT, a parametric hand model with an implicit template that combines the advantages of both paradigms. PHRIT achieves high fidelity, generalization ability, and efficiency by using an implicit representation for continuous shape modeling and a deformation field for explicit correspondence. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in hand modeling tasks and produces immersive results.
