Driving safety is a major concern, especially with the advancement of automated driving technology. Driver distraction is a leading cause of road accidents, highlighting the need for active monitoring of the driver's state and intention. Vision-based Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) have shown promise in improving road safety. However, existing DMS datasets have limitations, such as neglecting exogenous scene factors and failing to evaluate driver emotional states. In response, the authors propose an AssIstive Driving pErception dataset (AIDE) that captures rich information both inside and outside the vehicle. AIDE offers multi-view, multi-modal, and multi-task features, providing a comprehensive understanding of driver behavior, emotion, traffic context, and vehicle condition. The authors also present baseline frameworks and perform ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of AIDE. This dataset aims to facilitate further research in vision-driven DMS and address the shortcomings of existing datasets.
