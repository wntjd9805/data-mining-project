The paper introduces the concept of graphic layout generation and the challenges associated with modeling global context in layout generation. It highlights the limitations of existing approaches that either rely on biased context or struggle with single-pass generation. The paper then presents the emerging diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) as a potential solution for layout generation, emphasizing its ability to refine layouts iteratively and utilize the generated layout as global context for the next round. The proposed LayoutDiffusion method formulates layout generation as a discrete diffusion process, taking into account the heterogeneous nature of layout sequences. The paper discusses the design of a mild forward corruption process for layout that considers the legality, coordinate proximity, and type disruption of tokens. The proposed method also allows for plug-and-play conditional layout generation without re-training. The authors conducted extensive experiments and user studies to validate the effectiveness of LayoutDiffusion, which outperformed existing methods in terms of various evaluation metrics.
