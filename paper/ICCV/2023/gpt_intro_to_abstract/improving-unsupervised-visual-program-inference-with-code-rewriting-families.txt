Visual data often has a structured nature, such as manufactured shapes, vector graphics, and textures. Visual programs, which generate visual outputs, are effective in representing this complexity. However, obtaining a program that generates a specific visual datum is challenging. Visual Program Inference (VPI) aims to automatically infer programs that represent visual inputs. Learning-based solutions have been explored, but they often require supervised training data, which is limited in many domains. In this paper, we propose Sparse Intermittent Rewrite Injection (SIRI), a bootstrapped learning algorithm that leverages a family of code rewriters to improve visual program inference. We introduce a set of rewrites applicable to multiple visual programming DSLs and a test-time rewriting scheme. We evaluate SIRI on various shape program DSLs and demonstrate its superior performance in terms of reconstruction accuracy and convergence speed. Our approach produces more parsimonious programs compared to other methods while achieving comparable or better reconstruction performance. Overall, we contribute a framework for unsupervised visual program inference that incorporates code rewriting techniques to enhance the learning process.
