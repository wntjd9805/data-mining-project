The utilization of artificial intelligence technology for autonomous driving has gained significant attention in recent years. Advance Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS), a crucial component of autonomous driving, requires vehicles to respond accurately and promptly to changes in the environment. Lane line detection is a vital aspect of ADAS as it helps in sensing the vehicle's surroundings and keeping it on track. Recent studies have made significant progress in lane shape detection using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a focus on accuracy and real-time performance. Anchor-based methods have shown superior accuracy and efficiency compared to other approaches. However, there are still challenges in the wide application of anchor-based methods. Firstly, these methods assume that lane lines only start from the edges of an image, which is often not the case in real-world scenarios. Secondly, existing anchor-based methods tend to have low-quality anchors, especially when the camera resolution varies or lane lines do not start from the edges. Moreover, capturing the geometric features of lane lines, such as their slenderness and continuity, poses significant challenges. In this paper, we propose the Anchor Decomposition Network (ADNet) to address these challenges. ADNet introduces flexible anchors by predicting the position of start points and their associated directions using a global-scale heat map. To improve anchor quality, we incorporate a Large Kernel Attention (LKA) module that captures slender and continuous lane lines. Our approach shows excellent performance on three lane detection benchmarks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. The main contributions of this paper include emphasizing anchor flexibility, investigating the effectiveness of the Large Kernel mechanism, proposing a General Line IoU (GLIoU) loss tailored for anchor-based lane detection, and introducing the Adaptive Lane Aware Unit (ALAU) for explicit physical modeling. Overall, our approach improves the accuracy and speed of anchor-based lane detection, making it more suitable for a wide range of scenarios.
