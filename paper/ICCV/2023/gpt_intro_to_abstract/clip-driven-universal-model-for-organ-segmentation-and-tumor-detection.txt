This paper discusses the challenges and potential of using AI models for multi-organ segmentation and tumor detection in medical imaging. Currently, the perceived limited size of annotated datasets hinders the development of robust AI models. To address this, the authors have collected 14 publicly available datasets with partial labels, including 3,410 CT scans with 25 partially annotated organs and 6 tumors. However, assembling these datasets presents challenges such as label inconsistency, including index and name inconsistencies. Despite these challenges, the authors aim to demonstrate the clinical impact of their AI framework, including model expansibility, generalizability, and transferability.
