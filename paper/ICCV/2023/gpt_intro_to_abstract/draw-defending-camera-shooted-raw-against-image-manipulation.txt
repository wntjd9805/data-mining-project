In today's digital world, the credibility of visual content is increasingly at risk due to the ease of manipulating and distributing fabricated images. This has significant implications, as misleading images can be used by individuals, particularly politicians, to sway public opinion or propagate fake news. Detecting and localizing image manipulation has been a critical area of research, with early methods focusing on statistical analysis. However, the advancement of deep networks has strengthened the capability to detect traces of manipulation. Yet, adversaries continue to evolve, producing highly realistic manipulations that may not leave discernible traces. Additionally, existing methods still struggle against well-crafted forgeries or lossy image operations. To address these challenges, we propose DRAW, a proactive image protection scheme that defends against manipulation by introducing imperceptible protective signals into the RAW data captured by cameras. These signals persist in the rendered RGB images, even after various image post-processing operations. A Multi-frequency Partial Fusion Network (MPF-Net) is also proposed to implement RAW protection, which significantly reduces computational complexity. Extensive experiments on RAW datasets demonstrate the imperceptibility, robustness, and generalizability of our method. Comparative analysis shows that DRAW outperforms previous methods and offers the advantage of content-related adaptive embedding. Furthermore, MPF-Net provides superior performance while consuming fewer resources. The contributions of this paper include proposing RAW protection against manipulation, enhancing resistance to lossy image operations, and introducing a lightweight architecture for potential integration into cameras, thus mitigating the unrestricted manipulation of digital images.
