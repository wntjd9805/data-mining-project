Autonomous Driving (AD) vehicles have become increasingly widespread in our daily lives, with vehicles like Tesla cars equipped with Autopilot now available to the public. Perception, the ability to detect surrounding objects in real time, plays a crucial role in ensuring safe and correct driving. Previous research has focused on the security of AD perception, particularly in causing the evasion of critical physical road objects. However, these attacks have primarily evaluated the success of the attack at the AI component level, without considering the system-level effects.In this paper, we aim to systematically evaluate the system-level effects of physical adversarial object evasion attacks in realistic AD system settings. We propose a system model that encompasses the entire attack context, including the remaining AD system pipeline and the attack-targeted driving scenario. We focus on measuring the system-level effects of STOP sign evasion attacks, as they have significant impacts on driving correctness and road safety.Our measurement study reveals that existing representative object evasion attacks are unable to cause any STOP sign traffic rule violations at the system level, despite achieving high attack success rates at the AI component level. We identify two limitations in existing works: the inconsistent object size distribution in pixel sampling and the lack of consideration for the vehicle and AD system models. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SysAdv, a system-driven attack design that can be integrated with state-of-the-art attack methods to improve system-level effects.We evaluate our proposed attack design and demonstrate a significant improvement in system-level effects, with an increase in the system violation rate by approximately 70%. We also validate the generality of our attack by examining different AD system parameters and object types, which further show improvements at both the component and system levels.In summary, this paper contributes to the field of AD security by conducting the first measurement study on the system-level effects of object evasion attacks and proposing a novel evaluation framework. We identify limitations in existing works and introduce SysAdv, a system-driven adversarial object evasion attack that overcomes these limitations. Our evaluation demonstrates the significant improvement in system-level effects achieved by SysAdv.
