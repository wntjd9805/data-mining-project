Snowfall can significantly affect the accuracy of computer vision tasks such as target detection, tracking, and autonomous driving. While image and video restoration has been extensively studied, research on snow removal is still limited. Removing snow is crucial for improving computer vision tasks and image/video quality. However, snow removal is a challenging task due to the complex geometric shape and texture of snowflakes, as well as the presence of haze. While image-based snow removal algorithms have achieved good results, applying them directly to videos is inappropriate as they ignore temporal information. This highlights the need for research on deep learning-based video desnowing. One major challenge is the lack of high-quality video desnowing datasets, which has slowed down progress in this field. In this paper, we present the Realistic Video DeSnowing Dataset (RVSD), the first high-quality annotated video dataset for video snow removal. We generate diverse and realistic snow and haze using a rendering engine and augmentation techniques. We propose a new haze model that better simulates real snowy conditions. We show that our dataset has more realistic snow scenes and models trained on it achieve better snow removal performance. Additionally, we propose a deep learning-based framework for video snow removal that consists of three main steps: preliminary snow removal on single frames, video fusion and snow removal using a novel "snow-query temporal aggregation module," and a "snow-aware contrastive loss" for identifying and removing snow features accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Our contributions include the RVSD dataset, demonstrating its visual effectiveness, and a deep learning-based framework for effective video snow removal.
