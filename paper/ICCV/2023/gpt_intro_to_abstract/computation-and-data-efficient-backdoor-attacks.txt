The paper introduces the problem of security threats to deep neural networks (DNNs) in computer vision tasks, specifically focusing on the backdoor attack. The backdoor attack involves injecting a stealthy backdoor into the target model during training, which causes the compromised model to misbehave on malicious samples with a trigger. The most common approach to backdoor attacks is data poisoning, where the adversary compromises certain training samples. The success of a backdoor attack depends on the ratio of poisoning samples, and the goal is to poison as few samples as possible while maintaining a high attack success rate (ASR). Many works have proposed backdoor detection solutions, but a majority of backdoor attacks randomly select a fixed ratio of training samples for poisoning, which may not be optimal. To address this, a recent work proposed a new method called forgetting score, which uses the frequency of forgetting events per sample during model training to select important samples for poisoning. However, the computation of forgetting scores requires multiple full training cycles, which is impractical for attacking large-scale datasets. Therefore, the paper poses the question of whether it is possible to achieve both data efficiency and computation efficiency in backdoor poisoning. To answer this question, the paper proposes a novel attack methodology that introduces the representation distance (RD) score, a trigger-agnostic and structure-free metric, to identify crucial poisoning samples. The RD score is based on the distance of poisoning samples from the target class, and it can be used early in the model training process with a greedy search scheme to select poisoning samples, reducing computation compared to the forgetting score. Extensive experiments on different models and datasets show that the proposed solution effectively reduces the amount of samples required for a successful backdoor attack while still achieving high ASR. The solution is also more computationally efficient compared to the forgetting score-based method.
