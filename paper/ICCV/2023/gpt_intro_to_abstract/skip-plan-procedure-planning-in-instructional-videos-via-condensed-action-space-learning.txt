This paper introduces the task of procedure planning, which aims to predict a sequence of actions to reach a desired goal based on visual observations. The authors propose a method called Skip-Plan, which reduces the compound error along action chains by skipping unreliable intermediate actions. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex state supervision, Skip-Plan focuses on modeling sequential relations in the condensed action space. The authors also decompose long action chains into multiple sub-chains and propose sub-chain decoders to learn their discriminative relations. Experimental results demonstrate that Skip-Plan achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for procedure planning.
