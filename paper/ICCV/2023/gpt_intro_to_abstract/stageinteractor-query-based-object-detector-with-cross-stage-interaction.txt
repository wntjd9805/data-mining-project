Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision, serving as a foundation for many downstream applications. Traditional object detectors rely on dense spatial priors, using pre-defined anchors or grid points to make predictions. However, these methods often result in redundant and near-duplicate predictions, requiring post-processing algorithms for duplicate removal. Recently, a new approach called query-based object detection, exemplified by DETR and its variants, has emerged. These detectors eliminate the need for dense priors and instead treat object detection as a set prediction problem. They utilize a sparse set of queries to capture object characteristics and locations through a series of decoder layers. Image features are sampled and fused into the queries, which are then decoded into object predictions and serve as inputs for the next layer. In this paper, we propose a novel method for query-based object detection. Our method introduces two advancements: cross-stage label assignment and cross-stage dynamic filter reuse. The cross-stage label assigner refines the training target labels by considering the results of bipartite matching across stages. This ensures proper assignment of labels based on query index and score. In the forward pass, we incorporate heavy dynamic operators from preceding stages and add lightweight modules to increase modeling capacity without significant computational cost.Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Using ResNet-50 as the backbone, our model achieves an average precision (AP) of 44.8 on the MS COCO validation set with 100 queries. With longer training time, more queries, and enhanced data augmentation, our model achieves higher AP scores with other backbones, outperforming previous methods. These results establish our model as the state-of-the-art query-based object detector.Overall, our work presents a novel approach to query-based object detection, addressing the limitations of traditional methods and achieving superior performance.
