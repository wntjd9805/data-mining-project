Stereo matching is a widely studied computer vision task with applications in various fields. Existing state-of-the-art methods struggle to achieve robust stereo matching across different datasets due to domain differences and unbalanced disparity distribution. These issues result in noisy and distorted feature maps and hinder the network's ability to capture global features. Previous approaches, such as CFNet, have attempted to address these challenges but still fall short in achieving robust matching. In this paper, we propose an uncertainty guided adaptive correlation module and a cascaded recurrent framework called CREStereo++ to tackle these problems. We introduce a variance-based uncertainty estimation module to adaptively adjust the sampling range in the warping process and improve non-parametric warping with content-adaptive weights. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets without adaptation and can be further optimized for real-time applications with our Lite-CREStereo++ version. We also conduct extensive experiments and obtain top results in terms of robustness and efficiency. Our proposed approach has been tested and won the championship in the stereo task of the Robust Vision Challenge 2022.
