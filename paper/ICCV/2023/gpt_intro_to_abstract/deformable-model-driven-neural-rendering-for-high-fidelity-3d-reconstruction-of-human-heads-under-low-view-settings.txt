Accurately modeling and rendering human heads is crucial for various applications in computer graphics and computer vision. Neural implicit functions have recently emerged as a promising technique for synthesizing novel views of complex objects, including human heads, by learning a continuous function from multi-view images. However, training these deep learning models often requires a large number of images as input, which can be costly and computationally inefficient. Additionally, a single implicit field may not generalize well to unseen heads, particularly with low or sparse views.In this paper, we propose a robust method for learning neural implicit functions that can accurately reconstruct 3D human heads with high-fidelity geometry and appearance from low-view inputs, reducing the need for extensive data collection and annotation. Our method learns a signed distance field (SDF) that consists of a smooth template, a non-rigid deformation, and a high-frequency displacement map. The template represents identity-independent and expression-neutral features, while the deformation and displacement maps encode identity-dependent geometric details for each specific individual. We represent 3D human heads as the zero level-set of the composed SDF.Our training involves two stages. In the first stage, we learn an identity-independent template head and a non-rigid deformation between each observed head and the template head. In the second stage, we learn an identity-dependent displacement map for further refining the geometry. To train the proposed SDF without 3D supervision, we adopt a volume rendering scheme to minimize the difference between the rendered colors and the ground-truth colors. We also incorporate regularization terms for the SDF, deformation, displacement map, and latent codes.We evaluate our approach on both senior and young individuals and demonstrate its robustness and effectiveness in learning SDFs for both types of inputs. Our method outperforms existing methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and visual quality. Furthermore, we show that our method can generalize to unseen identities by using the pre-trained template as a good initialization.In conclusion, our method provides a robust and efficient solution for accurately reconstructing 3D human heads from low-view inputs, making it suitable for various digital human-related applications.
