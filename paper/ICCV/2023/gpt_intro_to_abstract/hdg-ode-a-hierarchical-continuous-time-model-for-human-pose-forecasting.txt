Abstract: Human pose estimation is a crucial task in computer vision that has applications in various fields such as autonomous driving, human-computer interaction, and anomaly detection. Despite significant progress in this area, existing methods still have limitations in terms of accuracy and performance. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time framework for multi-person 3D pose forecasting using a sequence of 2D skeletons extracted from a video. Our model is designed as a hierarchical structure to handle the complexity of multi-person scenarios and different types of connections in the pose graph. We also introduce dynamic graph convolutions to address the irregular input caused by occlusions. The performance of our model is evaluated through experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting future multi-person 3D poses. Overall, our contributions include the development of a continuous-time framework, a hierarchical structure for efficient computation, and dynamic graph convolutions for handling occlusions.
