Ordinal regression, also known as ordinal classification, is a task in which object instances are classified into ordinal categories based on their natural order. This paper focuses on the challenging aspect of distinguishing adjacent categories in ordinal regression tasks, which is complicated by confusing data patterns and blurred boundaries. Previous approaches have introduced various algorithms and assumptions to handle ordinal regression, but they often fail to address the specific issue of adjacent categories distinction, thus hindering model performance. To address this problem, the authors propose a novel approach that gradually distinguishes adjacent categories in the processing of ordinal regression tasks. Inspired by the dichotomic search algorithm, which divides a sorted array to find a target item, the authors decompose an ordinal regression problem into multiple recursive dichotomic classification steps. Each step deals with a boundary of a pair of adjacent categories, allowing for more accurate classification. This approach transforms the ordinal regression task into a sequence prediction problem, where the goal is to predict a binary label sequence.The proposed approach, called Ord2Seq, consists of two main steps. First, in the pre-processing stage, ordinal regression labels are transformed into label sequences using a tree-structured label mapping approach. This transformation enables the prediction objective to become a sequence of binary labels. Next, the label sequence is predicted progressively using an encoder-decoder structured Transformer architecture. The Transformer integrates context information from earlier image features and prediction results, and it can adapt to different prediction lengths and numbers of categories.In order to focus on each binary decision when distinguishing remaining categories, the Transformer decoder is designed with a masked decision strategy, which suppresses the loss interference of eliminated categories. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of each component and demonstrate that Ord2Seq outperforms existing methods in distinguishing adjacent categories and achieves state-of-the-art performance on various image datasets.The main contributions of this paper include the proposal of transforming ordinal category labels into label sequences, the introduction of the Ord2Seq framework for ordinal classification, the design of a novel decoder with a masked decision strategy, and the comprehensive experimental validation of Ord2Seq's superior performance in distinguishing adjacent categories.
