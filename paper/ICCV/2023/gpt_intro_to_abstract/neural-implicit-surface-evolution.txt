This paper introduces a novel approach to extending the domain of neural implicit functions to the space-time domain, allowing for the representation of implicit animations in a single network. The proposed method utilizes a neural network to learn the evolution of an initial surface under a given level set equation (LSE). Unlike previous approaches, this method does not rely on numerical or discrete approximations of the LSE solution, and the network training only requires the initial condition of the LSE problem as data. The paper also presents a neural framework for fitting solutions of the LSE using its analytical expression, and the method is shown to be flexible and applicable to various geometry processing applications. Additionally, a new network initialization technique based on previously trained initial conditions is proposed.
