This paper introduces a lightweight learned resizer called MULLER, which operates on multilayer Laplacian decomposition of images. The authors demonstrate that MULLER outperforms existing methods in terms of computational efficiency, parameter efficiency, and transferability. The method requires very few parameters and FLOPs, and does not incur any extra training cost. The authors show that MULLER can be used as a drop-in replacement for off-the-shelf resizing functions on multiple computer vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection and segmentation, and image quality assessment, resulting in significant performance improvements. A state-of-the-art backbone, MaxViT, is used as a testbed, and the MULLER resizer achieves up to 0.6% performance gain. Extensive ablation studies, analysis, and visualization results are provided to demonstrate the robustness and generalization of the proposed resizer for various model scales, benchmarks, and tasks.
