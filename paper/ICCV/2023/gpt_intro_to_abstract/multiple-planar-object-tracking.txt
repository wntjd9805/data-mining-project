Tracking multiple planar objects (MPOT) is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims to track the location and pose of multiple targets simultaneously. This task has gained attention due to its applications in augmented reality, video editing, and robot navigation. MPOT is challenging compared to other tracking tasks as it involves tracking planar objects with a higher Degree-of-Freedom (DoF). Additionally, MPOT deals with occlusion, which is more complex than in other tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a tracking framework called PRTrack that incorporates appearance perception and occlusion reasoning. In the appearance perception stage, we use a dual branch network to predict the ordered vertexes and masks of planar objects. We also develop an occlusion area localization strategy to handle complex occlusions. Furthermore, we propose a two-stream self-attention network to refine the predicted planar objects. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the MPOT-3K benchmark dataset, which contains diverse planar objects with annotated ground truth. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PRTrack against state-of-the-art approaches. The contributions of this paper include the creation of a large-scale benchmark dataset for MPOT and the development of a tracking framework that accurately predicts the pose and location of planar objects.
