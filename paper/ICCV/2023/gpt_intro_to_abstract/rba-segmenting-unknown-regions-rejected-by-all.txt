This paper addresses the problem of semantic segmentation of unknown categories, specifically in the context of detecting novel objects in front of a self-driving vehicle. The distribution of potential objects on the road includes a long tail of unknowns that are not well-represented in existing datasets. The diversity of these unknowns in terms of appearance, size, and location poses additional challenges for segmentation. Additionally, most existing deep learning models for category prediction are built around the closed-set assumption and fail to accurately assign labels to unknown objects in the open-set scenario. The existing approaches to segmenting unknowns can be categorized into two types: those that use supervision for unknown objects and those that do not. However, these approaches either require multiple forward passes or rely on calibrated probability predictions, which may not be guaranteed. In the supervised case, outlier data can be used to learn a discriminative representation, but such data is limited and often requires additional datasets or artificially added outlier objects. Current methods for outlier detection in unknown segmentation suffer from a lack of smoothness and objectness in their predictions. This is primarily due to the limitations of closed-set performance. The objective of this paper is to optimize an outlier scoring function using a limited amount of outlier data, without compromising closed-set performance. The proposed method utilizes the inherent ability of mask classification models to express uncertainty and boosts the performance of existing out-of-distribution (OoD) segmentation methods. It introduces a novel outlier scoring function that represents the probability of being an outlier by not belonging to any of the known classes. This helps eliminate uncertainty in ambiguous inlier regions such as semantic boundaries. A loss function is also proposed to directly optimize the scoring function using minimal outlier data. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on challenging datasets with high distribution shifts, while maintaining closed-set performance. The contributions of this paper include studying the ability of mask classification models to express uncertainty, introducing a novel outlier scoring function, and optimizing the scoring function to achieve superior segmentation results without compromising closed-set performance.
