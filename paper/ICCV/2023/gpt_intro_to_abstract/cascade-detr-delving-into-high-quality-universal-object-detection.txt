Object detection is a critical task in computer vision with applications in self-driving and medical imaging. Transformer-based detectors have shown superior performance compared to CNN-based detectors on datasets like COCO. However, these detectors struggle when applied to task-specific domains due to limited training samples and diverse styles. This paper introduces Cascade-DETR, a method that addresses the limitations of DETR-based detectors. Cascade-DETR incorporates cascade attention in the decoder to improve local object-centric understanding and bounding box accuracy. It also introduces an IoU-aware Query Recalibration module to enhance the scoring of bounding box predictions. A new benchmark, UDB10, and evaluation metric, UniAP, are proposed to support high-quality universal detection. Experimental results show that Cascade-DETR outperforms DN-DETR and achieves significant improvements in detection quality on various datasets, including COCO.
