Pan-sharpening is an important task in computer vision and remote sensing, aiming to enhance the spatial resolution of multi-spectral images using a high-resolution panchromatic image. Existing pan-sharpening methods can be categorized into traditional optimization methods and deep learning-based methods. However, traditional methods suffer from ill-posedness and limited representation ability, while deep learning-based methods lack clear physical meanings of the prior terms and interpretable prior operations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel model-driven deep unfolding framework for pan-sharpening with interpretability. Our framework embeds a pre-trained masked autoencoder (MAE) with spatial masking strategy into the unfolding architecture to provide a transparent and interpretable reasoning prior. Additionally, we treat the pre-trained MAE with spatial-spectral masking as a regularization term within the loss function to enforce spatial-spectral consistency. Experimental results on multiple satellite datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. Our framework pushes the frontiers of pan-sharpening by incorporating deep prior terms and improves the interpretability and representation ability of pan-sharpening models.
