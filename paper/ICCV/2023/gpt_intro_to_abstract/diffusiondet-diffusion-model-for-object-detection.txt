Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision, with applications ranging from instance segmentation to visual relationship detection. Traditional approaches rely on defining object candidates using sliding windows, region proposals, or anchor boxes. However, recent research has proposed learnable object queries to simplify the detection pipeline. In this paper, we present a novel framework called DiffusionDet, which directly detects objects from random boxes without the need for learnable queries. Our approach gradually refines the positions and sizes of these randomly generated boxes until they accurately cover the targeted objects. We draw inspiration from denoising diffusion models and formulate object detection as a denoising diffusion process from noisy boxes to object boxes. DiffusionDet eliminates the reliance on heuristics or explicit queries and achieves competitive performance on benchmarks such as COCO, CrowdHuman, and LVIS datasets. Our contributions include introducing the concept of a noise-to-box detection paradigm and demonstrating the flexibility and effectiveness of DiffusionDet in various scenarios without the need for additional fine-tuning.
