Whole slide images (WSIs) are large-scale histopathological images used in clinical practice. Deep learning approaches have shown promise in automated analysis of WSIs for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy prediction. However, the size and annotation requirements of WSIs present computational challenges in model architecture design. Multiple instance learning (MIL)-based approaches have been proposed for weakly-supervised WSI analysis, but they typically assume a static model learning setting. The dynamic nature of WSI technology and staining protocols limits the performance of static models on new data. Retraining the model for every new dataset incurs high computational and storage costs, while training a new model for each dataset may not be feasible. Fine-tuning the pre-trained model can lead to catastrophic forgetting, where the network over-adapts to the current dataset and forgets knowledge from previous datasets. Continual Learning (CL) has been proposed to overcome these limitations by training models with adaptability to new tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. CL can be achieved through various strategies, such as parameter regularization, knowledge distillation, architecture design, or data rehearsal-based methods. However, there is a lack of CL frameworks specifically designed for WSI analysis, which poses unique challenges due to the hierarchical structure of WSIs. In this paper, we propose a novel WSI continual analysis framework called ConSlide, which enables the progressive update of a hierarchical WSI analysis architecture by sequentially utilizing heterogeneous WSI datasets. We develop a Hierarchical Interaction Transformer (HIT) as the backbone of our framework to efficiently model and utilize the hierarchical characteristics of WSIs. Additionally, we introduce a Breakup-Reorganize (BuRo) rehearsal module to tackle the challenges of WSI data replay during the continual update process. Our framework preserves knowledge from previous WSI datasets, mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving generalization for more accurate analysis. Experimental results on public WSI datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, outperforming other methods in terms of overall performance and forgetting on previous datasets under a fair WSI CL setting. The code for our framework is available online.
