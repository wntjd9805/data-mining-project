The goal of multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos is to estimate bounding boxes and identities of objects. While state-of-the-art MOT methods perform well in high-frame-rate videos, their performance degrades in low-frame-rate videos due to larger differences between adjacent frames. This paper proposes ColTrack, an end-to-end MOT approach that utilizes multiple historical queries for collaborative tracking and incorporates an information refinement module (IRM) and a tracking object consistency loss (TOCLoss) to improve performance in low-frame-rate scenarios. Experimental results show that ColTrack achieves stable performance at low frame rates and outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and processing speed.
