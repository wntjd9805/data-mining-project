This paper introduces a novel framework called UNIC (Unbounded Recommendation of Camera View and Image Composition) for addressing the difficulties faced by non-professional users in achieving harmonious image composition and high aesthetic quality in their photos. Existing image composition methods primarily focus on post-processing adjustments through image cropping, which can result in sub-optimal solutions when the best cropping is not entirely within the acquired image. To overcome these limitations, the UNIC framework combines camera view adjustment and image composition to recommend the most suitable camera view and corresponding image composition bounding box. The proposed UNIC model simplifies the task by merging cropping-based outputs and adopts the conditional-DETR structure. Unlike existing methods, UNIC allows for camera view adjustment beyond image borders, ensuring that pixels outside the original borders are real and consistent with those within the borders. Furthermore, the UNIC framework incorporates feature extrapolation instead of synthesizing unseen content, allowing for the extrapolation of camera movement and bounding box prediction. The effectiveness of UNIC is demonstrated through extensive experiments and ablation studies using generalized image cropping datasets, with superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of the UNIC method, the feature extrapolation module, and the construction of two unbounded image composition datasets.
