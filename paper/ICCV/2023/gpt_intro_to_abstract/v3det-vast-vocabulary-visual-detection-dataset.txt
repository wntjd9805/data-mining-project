Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision, with applications in real-world scenarios like autonomous driving and robotics. Existing object detection datasets have made significant contributions, but they often lack the necessary breadth and depth of categories. In this paper, we introduce V3Det, a vast vocabulary visual detection dataset, to address these limitations. V3Det contains annotated objects from an extensive set of 13,204 categories, making it ten times larger than other large vocabulary datasets like LVIS. Additionally, V3Det incorporates a hierarchical category organization that enriches the vocabulary and allows for exploration of category relationships. The dataset comprises 243k images, providing diverse and rich annotations along with category descriptions. Extensive benchmarks conducted on V3Det reveal insights into both classical close-set object detection and open-vocabulary object detection. Our experiments demonstrate the benefits of utilizing the vast vocabulary of V3Det, including improved performance and increased class generalizability for open-vocabulary algorithms. Overall, V3Det has the potential to serve as a foundational dataset for developing more general visual perception systems.
