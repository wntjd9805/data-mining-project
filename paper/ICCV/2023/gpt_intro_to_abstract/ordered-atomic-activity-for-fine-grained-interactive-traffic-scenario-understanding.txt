Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have made significant progress in addressing traffic fatalities, but effective scenario understanding and retrieval of real-world data is crucial to enhance scenario-based assessment and improve ITS deployment. This paper focuses on intersection scenarios, which account for a high number of traffic crashes. The research objective is to identify an effective way to describe interactive scenarios involving traffic participants in order to achieve better scenario understanding and retrieval. The paper proposes a novel representation called Ordered Atomic Activity, which decomposes interactive scenarios into a set of ordered atomic activities. Each activity consists of an action and corresponding actors, and the order represents the temporal development of the scenario. A large-scale dataset called OATS is collected and annotated with Ordered Atomic Activity. Three fine-grained scenario understanding tasks are introduced, and a graph convolutional network-based algorithm is designed to model appearance and motion for these tasks. The proposed representation and dataset present new challenges for the video scene understanding community. The paper also establishes a benchmark suite for future research and makes contributions in introducing Ordered Atomic Activity, constructing the dataset, proposing scenario understanding tasks, and developing the algorithm.
