3D object detection is a crucial task in various computer vision applications, but the annotation of 3D bounding boxes is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, recent research has focused on developing effective 3D object detectors with limited annotations. However, two main challenges arise in limited annotation scenarios: indistinguishable features and lacking reliable initial pseudo labels. This paper proposes a method called CoIn, which consists of a Multi-Class contrastive learning module (MCcont), an Instance Feature Mining module (InF-Mining), and a Labeled-to-Pseudo contrastive learning module (LPcont). MCcont enhances feature discriminability by contrasting instance features across multiple categories. InF-Mining mines feature-level pseudo-labels based on feature similarities, and LPcont ensures the correctness of pseudo-positive signals. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset show that CoIn significantly improves the performance of baseline detectors and can achieve similar accuracy with fully supervised methods using only limited annotations. The contributions of this paper are the proposed MCcont module, the feature-level pseudo-label mining framework, and the demonstrated superiority of CoIn in improving detection performance.
