In industrial inspection, delivering defective products due to detection failure can be costly and increase manufacturing costs. Therefore, high prediction accuracy and low false positive and false negative rates are preferred. Anomaly detection methods that use only normal samples are adopted due to the difficulty in collecting abnormal samples. However, existing methods fail to capture positional information and the correlation between normal features. To address this, this paper proposes a method that utilizes position and neighborhood information to construct conditional probability distributions and model the correlation between normal features. The proposed method combines these distributions to estimate the likelihood and anomaly score of an input image. Furthermore, a refinement network is trained with synthetic abnormal images to improve the detail of the localization map. The proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the-art method in terms of false negative and false positive rates, resulting in fewer defective products and less waste. The contributions of this paper include demonstrating the effectiveness of conditional normal feature distribution, validating the use of synthetic datasets for training a refinement network, and providing insights into the factors contributing to the improvement in performance.
