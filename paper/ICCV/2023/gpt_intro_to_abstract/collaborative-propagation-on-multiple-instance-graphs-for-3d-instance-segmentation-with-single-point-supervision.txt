With the advancement of 3D sensing technology, point cloud-based scene understanding has gained significant attention in recent years. Instance segmentation, a crucial task in this field, involves predicting both semantic categories and instance IDs for objects at the point level. While deep learning methods have shown promising results for this task, most of them rely on fully annotated data for network training, which can be labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, various types of weak annotations have been proposed, but not all of them are practical to obtain. In this study, we adopt an annotation method that requires annotating only a single point for each object, resulting in sparse initial annotations. We propose a weakly supervised learning approach called RWSeg for 3D point cloud instance segmentation, focusing on effective feature propagation and leveraging interactions among instance graphs. We introduce a self-attention module to capture long-range dependencies and develop a novel algorithm for collaborative propagation on multiple instance graphs to generate high-quality pseudo labels. Our method bridges the gap between weakly supervised and fully supervised learning in 3D instance segmentation with significantly fewer annotations.
