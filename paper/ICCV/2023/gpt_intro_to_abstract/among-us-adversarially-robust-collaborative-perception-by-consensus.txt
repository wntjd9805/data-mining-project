Perception is crucial for autonomous robots to understand their surroundings, but single-robot perception is limited by long-range and occlusion issues. Collaborative perception (co-perception) has been proposed to address these limitations by providing more viewpoints for each robot through communication. This paper focuses on the fusion of intermediate representations from a deep neural network (DNN) in multi-robot perception, which offers advantages in compressibility and preservation of contextual information. However, the communication channel in DNN-based perception models can become a potential vulnerability due to adversarial attacks. Prior work on adversarial training has limitations in terms of overhead, generalization, and accuracy loss. To address these challenges, this work proposes ROBust cOllaborative SAmple Consensus (ROBOSAC), a framework for adversarially robust collaborative perception. Inspired by random sample consensus (RANSAC), ROBOSAC enables an ego-robot to intelligently select benign collaborators from teammates, ensuring a consensus is reached after collaboration. ROBOSAC utilizes a hypothesize-and-verify workflow, sampling a subset of teammates and comparing results to detect attackers. Unlike adversarial training, ROBOSAC is attacker-agnostic and can easily generalize to unseen adversarial learning algorithms. The framework provides customization options, allowing a performance-computation trade-off based on the number of attacker-free collaborators and sampling budget. Additionally, an adaptive probing approach is proposed to handle unknown attacker ratios. Experimental validation is conducted on collaborative 3D object detection in safety-critical autonomous driving, demonstrating the effectiveness of ROBOSAC. The contributions of this work include the development of a scalable and generalizable adversarially robust collaborative perception framework, the proposal of aggressive-to-conservative probing (A2CP) for estimating attacker ratios efficiently, and the experimental validation of ROBOSAC's effectiveness.
