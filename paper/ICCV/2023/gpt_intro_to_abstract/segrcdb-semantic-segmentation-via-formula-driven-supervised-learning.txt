This paper introduces a novel formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL) method for semantic segmentation. It addresses the challenges of manual annotation efforts and ethical concerns in creating large-scale datasets by using a synthetic dataset for pre-training. The authors investigate the effectiveness of different dataset configurations for pre-training and develop the SegRCDB dataset, which achieves improved recognition ability in semantic segmentation. The contributions of this study include the development of the FDSL method for semantic segmentation, the investigation of effective elements in pre-training, and the creation of the SegRCDB dataset, which outperforms existing baselines. The SegRCDB dataset has the potential to reduce the time and effort required to create ground truth annotations for large-scale image datasets.
