This paper introduces SAMPLING, a scene-adaptive hierarchical representation for synthesizing novel views from a single image based on improved Multiplane Images (MPI). The authors address the challenges of synthesizing photo-realistic images at novel viewpoints in large-scale unbounded outdoor scenes. They propose a novel Adaptive-bins MPI Generation strategy to distribute planes adaptively, enabling a more efficient representation. Additionally, they propose a Hierarchical Refinement Branch that incorporates multi-scale information to enhance the quality of intermediate scene representations. The method achieves high-quality view synthesis results on challenging outdoor scenes and shows good cross-scene generalization. The contributions of the paper include the novel scene-adaptive representation, the hierarchical refinement method, and the improved performance in outdoor view synthesis.
