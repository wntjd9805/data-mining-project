Perceiving complex driving environments is crucial for autonomous driving in order to ensure road safety and traffic efficiency. While deep learning technologies have improved the perception ability of intelligent vehicles, the single-agent perception paradigm still faces challenges such as restricted detection range and occlusion. Collaborative perception, which promotes information sharing among agents, has emerged as a promising solution. However, current methods suffer from data sparsity and lack of meaningful semantic cues in the temporal context. Spatial information aggregation also presents problems, such as misalignment of feature maps and noise introduced by collaborative agents. In this paper, we propose a Spatio-temporal domain awareness multi-agent Collaborative PErception approach (SCOPE) to address these limitations. SCOPE consists of three core components: context-aware information aggregation, confidence-aware cross-agent collaboration, and importance-aware adaptive fusion. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SCOPE outperforms previous methods and effectively leverages the advantages of collaborative perception in multi-agent tasks. Our contributions include the introduction of temporal context in collaborative perception, as well as tailored components for spatial information aggregation.
