Vector maps are crucial for navigation and urban planning, and methods to automatically extract these maps from aerial or satellite images have improved in recent years. However, current vector mapping methods are typically designed for specific targets, requiring multiple models for comprehensive mapping systems. This limits system extensibility and increases the burden of model development. Designing a unified method for multiple vector mapping tasks is challenging due to processing multiple types of geometric primitives. Existing methods either focus on refining location accuracy or learnable topology reconstruction, but end-to-end shape regularization has been under explored. Shape regularization, which reduces the variation of relative relationships between primitives, is considered essential for accurate and flexible vector mapping. Conventional methods rely on heuristic-based rules, while recent methods utilize contour optimization or deformation, but do not incorporate global shape structure. This paper proposes GraphMapper, a unified framework that uses a primitive graph representation for multi-type vector mapping. GraphMapper incrementally learns to refine primitive locations and reconstruct pairwise relationships, achieving effective shape regularization and topology reconstruction through relationship classification of primitives. The proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in building and road mapping tasks, demonstrating its adaptability and versatility. The main contributions of this work are the proposed unified learning framework based on a primitive graph, an adaptive shape regularization module, and the achieved state-of-the-art performance in building and road vector mapping tasks.
