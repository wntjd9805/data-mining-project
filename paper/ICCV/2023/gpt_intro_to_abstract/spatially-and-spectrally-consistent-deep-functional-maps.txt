Non-rigid shape matching is a critical task in shape analysis, with applications in various fields. Traditional methods focused on designing hand-crafted features, while modern approaches leverage data-driven techniques for improved accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. Deep Functional Maps (DFM) is a popular formalism in learning-based shape matching, allowing for the encoding of maps into compact matrices. While most DFM works focus on local map priors, there is limited attention given to global map priors. This paper introduces a novel two-branch unsupervised DFM framework that promotes cycle consistency in both spectral and spatial domains. The proposed method achieves superior performance over existing methods, especially with significant shape distortions. It reduces over-fitting and demonstrates remarkable generalization performance. The two-branch design can be easily incorporated into existing DFM frameworks with minimal computational burden. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) a theoretical analysis on spectrally cycle consistency, (2) a simple and effective two-branch design based on theoretical justification, and (3) empirical evidence of the method's effectiveness in challenging non-rigid shape matching tasks.
