Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) has made significant progress in recognizing sub-categories of objects within the same class. However, previous efforts have mainly focused on single-view-based approaches, limiting the model's performance in fine-grained classification. This paper introduces multi-view active fine-grained visual recognition (MAFR), which aims to infer the discriminative perspective within the physical world by leveraging multiple views. The paper presents a new multi-view vehicle dataset called MvCars and proposes an efficient recognition framework based on active next-view selection and dynamic exiting. The framework consists of a feature encoder, next-view selection using proximal policy optimization, and a dynamic exit inference strategy. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of performance and efficiency. The paper also provides benchmark results, analysis of the upper bound, selected trajectories, and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of each component.
