Graph Matching (GM) is an important task in computer science that involves establishing correspondences between keypoints of different graphs. It has applications in object tracking, scene graph discovery, simultaneous localization and mapping, and structure-from-motion. Existing methods in GM focus on exploring and exploiting the bi-level affinities between graphs, specifically the linear node-to-node affinity and the quadratic edge-to-edge affinity. However, these methods assume that the annotated keypoint pairs are correctly associated, which is not always the case due to factors such as poor recognizability and viewpoint differences between images. This results in a problem known as Bi-level Noisy Correspondence (BNC), which refers to both node-level and edge-level noisy correspondences. BNC can greatly degrade the performance of GM methods by hindering representation learning and causing alignment failures. In this paper, we propose a method called COntrastive Matching with MOmentum distillatioN (COMMON) to address the BNC challenge. COMMON incorporates both linear and quadratic geometrical information into a robust quadratic contrastive loss, which is enhanced with momentum distillation to penalize noisy correspondences. The proposed method effectively mitigates the negative effects of BNC and achieves improved results compared to state-of-the-art methods in real-world datasets.
