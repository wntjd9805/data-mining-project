Outliers can significantly impact the performance of computer vision tasks. Robust estimators are crucial in handling noise and distortions in imaging sensors. The RANSAC algorithm has been widely used as a robust estimator, but there is room for further improvement in sampling efficiency. In this paper, we propose BANSAC, a new sampling strategy for RANSAC that updates scoring weights using a dynamic Bayesian network. We introduce an adaptive sampling strategy and a simple stopping criterion based on the updated scores. Our experiments demonstrate that BANSAC outperforms existing methods in accuracy and efficiency. We implemented BANSAC in C++ within the OpenCV USAC framework.
