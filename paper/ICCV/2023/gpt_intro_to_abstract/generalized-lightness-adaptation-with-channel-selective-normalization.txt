Lightness adaptation is an important aspect of image processing, with applications such as low-light image enhancement, image retouching, and inverse tone mapping. While advanced neural network architectures have been developed for lightness adaptation, the generalization problem still exists and is rarely explored. Existing methods primarily focus on accurate image reconstruction but often underperform on wide-range scenes with different lightness conditions. Constructing a larger dataset with more lightness conditions is impractical, and existing models lack generalization and discrimination abilities. In this paper, we propose a mechanism called Channel Selection Normalization (CSNorm) to address the generalization problem. CSNorm selectively normalizes lightness-relevant channels while keeping other channels unchanged. This enhances the model's generalization ability without compromising reconstruction accuracy. CSNorm consists of an instance-level lightness normalization module and a differentiable gating module for channel selection. We also design an alternating training strategy to identify lightness-relevant channels. Our contributions include improving the generalization ability of lightness adaptation methods, proposing CSNorm for selective channel normalization, designing an alternate training strategy, and conducting extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of CSNorm in wide-range lightness scenarios.
