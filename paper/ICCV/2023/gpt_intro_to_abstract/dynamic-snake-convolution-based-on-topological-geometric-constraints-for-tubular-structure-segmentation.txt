Accurate segmentation of topological tubular structures is crucial in various fields, such as computational hemodynamics in clinical applications and route planning in remote sensing. However, the segmentation of these structures is challenging due to their thin and tortuous nature, as well as complex and variable global morphology. To address these difficulties, previous methods have focused on network-based approaches, feature-based methods, and loss-based methods. However, these methods have limitations in perceiving and maintaining the distinctive features and continuity of tubular structures. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called DSCNet, which includes a tubular-aware convolution kernel, multi-view feature fusion strategy, and topological continuity constraint loss function. Our framework aims to enhance the perception of thin tubular structures by focusing on their geometric structure, incorporating multiple perspectives for feature fusion, and applying topological continuity constraints during the segmentation process. Experimental results on 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately segmenting tubular structures.
