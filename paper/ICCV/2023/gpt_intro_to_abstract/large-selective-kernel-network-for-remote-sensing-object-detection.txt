Remote sensing object detection focuses on identifying and locating objects in aerial images. Recent research has aimed to accurately fit the orientation of detected objects using bounding boxes. Specialized detection frameworks and oriented box encoding methods have been developed for this purpose. However, few works have considered the strong prior knowledge present in aerial images, such as the need for contextual information and the different information requirements for various objects. This paper proposes a lightweight detection backbone called Large Selective Kernel Network (LSKNet) that dynamically adjusts the receptive field to effectively process the wide context of detected objects. This is achieved through a spatial selective mechanism that weights features processed by large depth-wise kernels and merges them. LSKNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular datasets and aligns with the observed priors. The proposed mechanism effectively leverages the prior information in aerial images for accurate remote sensing object detection.
