This paper introduces the HiLo framework, which aims to address the long-tail problem in Panoptic Scene Graph generation (PSG) by considering the relational semantic overlap. PSG involves generating scene graphs using panoptic segmentation masks and capturing relationships between subjects and objects. The long-tail problem arises due to an imbalance in relation categories, with certain relations occurring more frequently than others. Previous methods have treated this problem as equivalent to the long-tail problem in object-centric tasks and employed rebalancing techniques. However, in the relation-centric PSG task, a subject-object pair can have multiple relations with relational semantic overlap. The authors propose the HiLo framework, which simultaneously learns high and low-frequency relations and unifies their strengths using two novel consistency loss functions. The framework is applicable to any PSG method. Additionally, a one-stage end-to-end baseline is introduced, which enhances the interaction between mask and relation prediction in the transformer decoder layer. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and baseline, outperforming the state-of-the-art in both recall and mean recall on the PSG dataset and showing improvements on the VG dataset.
