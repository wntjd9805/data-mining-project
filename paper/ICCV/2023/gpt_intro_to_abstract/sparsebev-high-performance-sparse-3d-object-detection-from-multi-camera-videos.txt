Camera-based 3D object detection has seen significant advancements in recent years, providing lower deployment costs and the ability to detect long-range objects compared to LiDAR-based approaches. Previous methods can be divided into two paradigms: BEV-based methods and sparse query-based methods. While BEV-based methods have achieved remarkable progress, they suffer from high computation costs and complex view transformation operators. On the other hand, sparse query-based methods offer simpler structures and faster speeds but lag behind in performance. In this paper, we investigate whether fully sparse detectors can achieve similar accuracy to dense ones in 3D object detection. We propose SparseBEV, a fully sparse 3D object detector that surpasses the performance of dense counterparts. Our detector incorporates scale-adaptive self-attention, adaptive spatio-temporal sampling, and adaptive mixing to optimize feature aggregation, sampling locations, and feature decoding. We use pillars as query formulations to introduce better spatial priors. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that SparseBEV outperforms previous methods in terms of both speed and accuracy. Additionally, we can adjust the inference speed by reducing the number of decoder layers without re-training. Further enhancements, such as utilizing future frames, lead to even higher performance.
