This paper introduces a novel Hybrid Spectral Denoising Transformer (HSDT) for hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising. HSI is widely used in various fields but is often degraded by noise, requiring robust denoising algorithms. Traditional approaches exploit optimization schemes with handcrafted priors, while recent methods based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) eliminate the need for handcrafted regularizations but still lack the ability to capture global and local spectral-spatial correlations. Transformer architectures have been applied to HSI processing but suffer from limitations in capturing structured spectral dependencies and lack flexibility. In this paper, the authors propose HSDT, which effectively integrates spatial-spectral inductive bias and long-range spectral dependency modeling. HSDT utilizes a parallel Spectral-Spatial Separable Convolution (S3Conv) unit and a Guided Spectral Self-Attention (GSSA) to aggregate information across different bands. The authors also propose a Self-Modulated Feed-Forward Network (SM-FFN) with a novel self-modulated branch for enhancing informative regions. Experimental results show that HSDT outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low computational overhead. Overall, this paper presents a comprehensive approach to HSI denoising that captures both local and global spectral correlations.
