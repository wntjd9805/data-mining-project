Images are often affected by noise during observation and transmission, making image denoising an important task in improving the quality of digital images. Deep learning models have been introduced to address the problem of image denoising and have shown significant improvements over traditional methods. However, in real-world scenarios, only noisy images are available, making it challenging to apply supervised deep learning approaches. To handle this, self-supervised models have been developed based on available noisy images. These models make use of both external and internal information to denoise the images. In this paper, we propose Noise2Info, which estimates the upper bound of the noise standard deviation and dynamically updates the loss during model training. Our empirical study shows that Noise2Info outperforms other self-supervised methods and achieves comparable results to supervised methods. Additionally, Noise2Info is able to estimate the noise standard deviation solely based on noisy images, validating its effectiveness in practical image denoising scenarios.
