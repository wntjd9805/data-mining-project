Anomaly detection is a crucial task in the manufacturing industry, particularly in quality control through defect inspection. While supervised approaches are commonly used, they may not be feasible in practical applications due to the rarity of abnormal samples and the difficulty in obtaining accurate ground truth. Unsupervised approaches that detect abnormal samples using only abundant normal samples have gained popularity. Previous unsupervised approaches include embedding-based methods, synthetic anomaly-based methods, and reconstruction-based methods. However, these approaches have certain limitations and drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection method using a score-based model. Score-based models have been widely used in data generation, as they have the capability to produce high-quality samples. We leverage the inherent property of the score, a gradient of the log-likelihood, to detect anomalies. Specifically, we introduce the concept of score-based resilience to perturbations, where samples on the data manifold can be restored by the score while samples deviating from the manifold cannot. We quantify this resilience using a stochastic measure called restoration error. Our method requires no external knowledge or pre-trained models, and we show its effectiveness through experiments on public benchmark datasets for industrial anomaly detection.
