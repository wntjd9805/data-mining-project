Super-Resolution (SR) is a research topic focused on reconstructing high-resolution images from low-resolution observations. Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) techniques have seen significant advancements in recent years. However, SISR suffers from limitations in restoring image details from a single low-resolution image, especially for large-scale factors. Multi-Frame Super-Resolution (MFSR) provides a promising solution by utilizing multiple low-resolution images to reconstruct high-quality images, making it valuable for various applications. Despite progress in MFSR, challenges remain in fusing multiple low-resolution inputs and the lack of real-world datasets. This paper proposes the Federated Burst Affinity Network (FBAnet) to address these challenges. It also introduces a new real-world burst super-resolution dataset called RealBSR. FBAnet utilizes an alignment algorithm and a Federated Affinity Fusion (FAF) module to aggregate information from burst images and reconstruct high-resolution images. The contributions of the paper include the establishment of the RealBSR dataset, the proposal of FBAnet for real-world burst image super-resolution, and extensive experiments that demonstrate the superior performance of FBAnet compared to existing methods.
