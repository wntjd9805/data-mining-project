The goal of 3D object detection is to estimate oriented 3D boundary boxes and category labels of objects from a point cloud. However, existing methods heavily rely on expensive and time-consuming annotated 3D scene data. To address this issue, semi-supervised methods that use a combination of few labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data have gained attention. These methods can be categorized into consistency-based and pseudo-label based methods. While pseudo-label based methods have shown success, they often use global metric scores to select pseudo-labels, which may not accurately represent the localization quality of each side of the object. In this paper, we propose a novel side-aware method for semi-supervised 3D object detection. Our method incorporates a new 3D boundary box parameterization strategy, a quality estimation strategy, and a pseudo-label filtering strategy. The parameterization strategy divides the object boundary box into six independent sides, enabling localization quality estimation for each side. Our method assigns higher uncertainty to sides with lower localization quality and employs class-specific dynamic thresholds and a soft weight assignment strategy to select pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently improves baseline detector performance and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.
