Surface reconstruction from point clouds is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. Implicit methods, such as Marching Cubes, are commonly used to extract surfaces from implicit representations. However, these methods can result in over-smoothing and loss of detail. On the other hand, explicit methods based on computational geometry, construct meshes by triangulating the input point cloud, preserving sharp features and fine structures. Recently, learning-based explicit methods have been proposed, but they struggle with watertightness and inference of triangular connectivity. In this paper, we present DMNet, a local approach for surface reconstruction using the Delaunay triangulation. Our method encodes each tetrahedron and triangular facet individually, capturing both the morphological structure information and the neighborhood point distribution. We also design a Local Graph Iteration algorithm to process neighborhood information and incorporate edge features. To further improve the quality of reconstructed triangles, we propose a shape constraint loss. Additionally, we introduce an octree-based scaling strategy for handling large-scale data. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in capturing fine details, preserving sharp edges, and generalizing to data of varying densities. Our contributions include the integration of multi-geometry information, a tailored algorithm for Delaunay triangulation, and a robust local processing capability.
