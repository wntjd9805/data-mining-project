Ownership verification of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is essential to protect trained generators from unintentional leakage and theft. Existing methods assume the owner can query the suspicious model with specific inputs, but this black-box setting is challenged in generation tasks where the input is a randomized latent representation. This paper introduces a box-free ownership verification scheme for GANs that checks outputs only, without specifying inputs. The scheme utilizes the discriminator's representations to learn a network that encloses the distribution learned by the generator. The scheme is effective in verifying ownership, immune to popular removal attacks, and robust to other existing attacks. Experimental evaluations on two popular GAN applications and more than 10 GAN architectures demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed scheme. The contributions of this paper include identifying the limitation of black-box setting-based verification schemes, revealing the potential of the discriminator for capturing the generator's distribution, and introducing a box-free verification scheme that does not rely on specifying inputs or additional models.
