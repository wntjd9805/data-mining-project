Histopathology slide analysis is crucial for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and the adoption of digital histopathology slides has increased thanks to advancements in computer vision. However, the high resolution of whole slide images (WSIs) makes directly applying standard computer vision models challenging. To address this, WSIs are divided into smaller patches and labeled using annotations. However, obtaining precise and consistent annotations is difficult and expensive. To mitigate the impact of inaccurate annotations, noise-aware learning models have been developed, but they still rely on annotations. Annotation-free techniques have emerged as a promising solution, requiring only whole-slide labels. Weakly supervised learning has gained popularity, using slide-level labels instead of patch-level annotations. Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, which learn feature representations without labels, have also shown promise. SSL techniques utilizing multiple-instance learning have demonstrated the ability to match the performance of supervised methods. In SSL, contrastive-based methods may not be effective for histopathology image analysis, and knowledge-distillation-based methods focusing only on positive pairs may not capture global information. Clustering, an unsupervised learning approach, is also gaining attention. However, existing clustering methods for WSIs may not improve performance due to high cluster counts. In this paper, we propose CluSiam, a framework that combines SSL and clustering to learn effective representations and generate accurate cluster assignments for histopathology images. Our experiments show that CluSiam outperforms baselines and achieves improved clustering and classification performance. CluSiam offers an efficient and accurate method for clustering histopathology images without annotations or slide-level labels, surpassing the widely used K-Means clustering method in digital pathology.
