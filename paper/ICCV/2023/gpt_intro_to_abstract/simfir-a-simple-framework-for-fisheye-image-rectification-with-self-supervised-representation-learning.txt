Fisheye lenses are widely used in various applications such as video surveillance, autonomous driving, and robotics due to their wide field of view. However, the images captured by fisheye lenses are distorted, making them unsuitable for downstream analysis tasks. Rectifying fisheye images has thus become an important research topic. Classical methods estimate epipolar geometry or detect plumb lines, but have limitations in real-world applications. Recently, deep learning-based approaches have emerged as promising alternatives. However, these methods often ignore the intrinsic distortion characteristics of fisheye images. In this paper, we propose SimFIR, a new framework for fisheye image rectification based on self-supervised representation learning. SimFIR encodes the fine-grained distortion patterns in fisheye images by learning the associations between local image regions and their distinct distortion patterns. We introduce a unified distortion-aware pretext task and a classification supervision to optimize the network. Furthermore, we present a new pipeline for fisheye image rectification that utilizes a dense flow field for unwarping fisheye images of arbitrary resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art algorithms. Our method also exhibits strong generalization ability on real-world fisheye images. In summary, our contributions include the SimFIR framework for improving fisheye image rectification, a novel pipeline for unwarping fisheye images, and state-of-the-art performance in extensive experiments.
