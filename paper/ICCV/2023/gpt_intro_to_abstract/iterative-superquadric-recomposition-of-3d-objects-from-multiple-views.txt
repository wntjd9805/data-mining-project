This abstract summarizes the introduction of a computer science paper on 3D object decomposition and recomposition. The paper discusses the importance of equipping machines with perceptual grouping capabilities to improve their processing and interaction with the environment. It introduces the concept of decomposing 3D objects into simple shapes and highlights the usefulness of this representation in various applications. The paper explores previous works on training neural networks to predict semantically consistent part decompositions and proposes a new algorithm called ISCO that recomposes 3D shapes using superquadrics based on 2D views. The algorithm is shown to accurately reconstruct 3D shapes and identify semantic parts, outperforming previous instance-based approaches. The abstract concludes by summarizing the contributions of the paper, including tackling the problem of 3D shape abstraction, introducing ISCO as a self-supervised algorithm, and demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world applications.
