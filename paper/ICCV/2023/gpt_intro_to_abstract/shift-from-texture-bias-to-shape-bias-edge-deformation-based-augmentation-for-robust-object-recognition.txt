Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be susceptible to perturbation noises, which can lead to inaccurate predictions. Previous studies have focused on texture augmentation algorithms to enhance network robustness, but recent research suggests that CNNs have a bias towards object textures rather than shapes. To address this issue, some studies have aimed to reduce texture bias and improve network robustness by incorporating shape cues, such as edge maps, into the training process. However, these studies have primarily focused on fixed object shapes and may not fully leverage the benefits of shape diversity. Additionally, direct deformation augmentation on images can potentially damage object semantics, particularly at the image boundary. In response, this paper proposes a thin plate spline (TPS)-based edge map deformation strategy to augment the shape representation of training data, with the goal of enhancing shape bias in CNNs. The proposed approach extends the edge map to include broader boundary regions and incorporates additional supervision of de-noised texture cues and a shape-preservation loss to enhance the correlation between deformed shape and texture category. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves shape bias and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of network robustness under adversarial, backdoor, and common corruption attacks. This work contributes to the field by introducing a novel approach to enhance shape bias based on the augmentation of object edges and provides a semantic-meaningful generation paradigm for shape augmentation.
