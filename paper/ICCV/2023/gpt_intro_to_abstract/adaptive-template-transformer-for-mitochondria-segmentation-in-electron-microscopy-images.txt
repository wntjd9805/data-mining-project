The morphology of mitochondria plays a crucial role in cell physiology, and changes in their shape are associated with neurodegeneration, lifespan, and cell death. However, studying mitochondria morphology is challenging due to their small size. Electron microscopy (EM) allows for higher resolution imaging of mitochondria, but manual labeling of these images is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled automated segmentation of mitochondria, but existing methods have limitations in handling large appearance variations and scale variations. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Template Transformer (ATFormer) for mitochondria segmentation. The ATFormer incorporates a structural template learning module and a hierarchical attention learning mechanism to obtain adaptive and scale-aware classifiers for mitochondria segmentation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation methods in terms of accuracy.
