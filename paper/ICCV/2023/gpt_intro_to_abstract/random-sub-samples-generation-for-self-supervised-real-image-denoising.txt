Image denoising is an important task in low-level vision in order to improve the quality of noisy images. In recent years, learning-based methods have shown superior performance in image denoising. However, most of these approaches rely on paired image datasets, which can be challenging and time-consuming to collect for real-world images. Additionally, real images captured by cameras have noise that is signal-dependent and spatially correlated, making it difficult to accurately model the noise distribution. To overcome these challenges, unsupervised and self-supervised methods have been introduced, which do not require paired datasets for training. One such method is Blind-Spot Network (BSN), but it is limited to pixel-wise independent noise. Another method, AP-BSN, addresses the spatial correlation in real-world noise but has limited samples. To address these limitations, we propose a new approach that leverages perturbations and random sub-samples generation to enhance the training data for BSN. We also introduce a cyclic sampling difference loss and a new BSN framework. Our method shows highly competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising methods on real-world datasets.
