This paper addresses the problem of incorporating a rich prior into principled approaches to inverse problems in computational imaging. Previous work shows a tradeoff between using principled methods that require simple priors and using deep-learned priors that preclude precise analysis. Bayesian inference methods support a modular approach to inverse problems, but have been limited to simple priors and regularizers. On the other hand, deep learning solutions leveraging an implicit prior do not allow for principled analysis. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes employing a diffusion model as the prior in Bayesian inference for imaging. Specifically, a score-based diffusion model is used, which allows for exact probabilities. The main contribution of this paper is establishing score-based priors as an interface between modern deep learning and traditional inverse problem-solving, enabling proven, principled approaches to have access to learned, rich priors. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through experiments on denoising, deblurring, and interferometry problems in computational imaging. The results highlight the benefits of score-based priors in accurately quantifying uncertainty, especially in scientific applications such as black-hole imaging.
