This paper addresses the challenge of few-shot video classification (FSVC) by proposing a novel Representation Fusion and Promotion Learning (RFPL) framework. The framework consists of two modules: meta-action learning (MAL) and reinforced image representation (RIR). MAL introduces external knowledge from a global meta-action bank to enrich video representations within each individual task. RIR uses reinforcement learning to determine the importance of each frame in the FSVC task, emphasizing the influence of discriminative frames. The proposed RFPL framework can be integrated into existing FSVC methods to improve their performance. The contributions of this work include the development of the MAL module, the addressing of the negative effects of task-irrelevant frames, and the flexibility of the RFPL framework to be integrated with various FSVC methods.
