The paper discusses the generation of 3D human motions through natural language descriptions, also known as text-to-motion. This approach offers a user-friendly and intuitive interface for generating high-quality and flexible results. However, it poses challenges due to the diversity of language descriptions and the complexity of 3D human motion synthesis. Previous works have focused on generating motions conditioned on action labels or longer natural language descriptions. However, these methods have limitations in guiding detailed motion generation and handling large input sequences. To overcome these limitations, the paper proposes EMS, an Elaborative Motion Synthesis model that factors complex actions into atomic actions and generates natural and smooth 3D motion sequences. EMS consists of an atomic action generation subnet and a connection subnet. Both subnets are transformer-based variational auto-encoders. The paper also introduces a Natural Loss objective function and a synthetic dataset for training. Experimental results show that EMS outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of motion quality and performance metrics on benchmark datasets. The contributions of the paper include the proposal of EMS, the Natural Loss objective function, the synthetic dataset, and the demonstration of superior performance compared to previous methods.
