Object detection in computer vision has been extensively studied for many years. Traditional detectors in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be categorized as anchor-based or anchor-free methods. Anchor-based methods use densely tiled bounding boxes for classification and regression, while anchor-free methods rely on grid points in the 2D image plane. Detection can be performed in a single stage, two stages, or multiple cascade stages. Single-stage methods provide predictions directly without further modifications, offering simplicity and efficiency. Two- or multi-stage methods make iterative corrections based on previous results, resulting in better accuracy but requiring more parameters and calculations. Later stages in multi-stage methods are usually region-based, which focus on the local region within the bounding box, often implemented using RoI Align. However, these detectors are criticized for their complex pre- and post-design, such as anchor sizes, standards for positive and negative samples, and non-maximum suppression (NMS). DETR (DEtection TRansformer) simplifies the framework by using multi-stage transformer decoder layers to update learnable queries into object features, which can be decoded into bounding box predictions. The training process of DETR applies bipartite matching to determine positive and negative query samples dynamically, eliminating the need for NMS. However, DETR lacks efficiency due to the lack of inductive bias in the transformer decoder, motivating later works to incorporate bounding box positional encoding, iterative refinement, or local deformation into the decoder to improve training efficiency. Region-based methods, similar to DETR, treat object detection as a set prediction task and also adopt a multi-stage strategy. Sparse R-CNN is an example of a region-based method that utilizes RoI Align. Although region-based methods achieve accurate results and high data efficiency, their model sizes are larger than DETR-series, limiting their applications and causing degradation for small-scale datasets. This paper proposes RecursiveDet, a common cascade decoder structure built on dynamic conv for region-based detectors. By sharing decoder parameters and making the same module recursive in different stages, RecursiveDet reduces the model size while maintaining performance. Additionally, the paper introduces bounding box positional encoding and centerness-based positional encoding to improve the region-based detector's performance. Experimental results on the MS-COCO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of RecursiveDet in enhancing different end-to-end region-based detectors while reducing the model size.
