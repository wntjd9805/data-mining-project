Crowd counting is an important task in computer vision that aims to estimate the number of people in a crowd from an image. Existing approaches for crowd counting often use surrogate targets such as density maps, which provide the count by integrating the inferred density map. However, these approaches lack instance-level information, making it difficult to analyze the crowd at a high level.To address this limitation, some approaches focus on estimating fine-grained information about the crowd, such as head bounding boxes or single head points. However, these methods have their own drawbacks, such as unreliable box estimation or the need for post-processing to obtain person locations.In this paper, we propose a novel approach that formulates crowd counting as a decomposable point querying process. Our method allows the model to receive arbitrary points as input and reason whether each point corresponds to a person and where it is located. This provides an intuitive and universal modeling of crowds, making it suitable for various crowd-related tasks.To handle the challenge of determining the number of querying points, we introduce a decomposable structure called the point-query quadtree. This structure allows for data-dependent splitting, enabling dynamic processing of sparse and dense regions in the image.We instantiate our approach, called the Point Query Transformer (PET), based on the point-query quadtree. PET also incorporates progressive rectangle window attention, which performs the querying process within a local window for efficient inference.We evaluate our PET model on four crowd-counting benchmarks and demonstrate its effectiveness and versatility. PET achieves state-of-the-art performance on crowd counting and localization tasks, showing its applicability to different crowd-related tasks. Furthermore, PET provides interpretable point outputs, enhancing its intuitive nature.In summary, our contributions in this work are: showcasing the idea of decomposable point querying as a universal crowd modeling strategy, introducing the PET model with the point-query quadtree and progressive rectangle window attention, and demonstrating the effectiveness and interpretability of PET on various crowd-related tasks.
