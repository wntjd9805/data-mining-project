Abstract: The field of semantic segmentation in deep learning has experienced significant advancements, resulting in impressive progress. However, this success has come at the cost of substantial time and human efforts. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Cross Attention, which aims to address these challenges by leveraging query features and support foreground pixels. Our method improves upon existing techniques by introducing enhanced query feature representations and self-calibrated cross attention mechanisms. Through experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving superior segmentation accuracy compared to previous methods. Our findings highlight the potential of Cross Attention in significantly reducing the time and human efforts required for semantic segmentation tasks.
