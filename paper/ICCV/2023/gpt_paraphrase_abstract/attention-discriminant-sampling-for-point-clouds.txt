This paper presents a novel approach for sampling 3-D point clouds using attention mechanisms. The method, called attention discriminant sampling (ADS), utilizes a structure-aware attention discriminant analysis to explore both geometric and semantic relationships among points and their clusters. ADS starts by decomposing the point cloud into clusters to capture the structural and geometric characteristics of the data. It then applies two levels of self-attention: within-cluster attention and between-cluster attention. The within-cluster attention captures the complexity of semantic features within each cluster, while the between-cluster attention measures the semantic similarity between clusters. By preserving the structural distribution of points, these two aspects of self-attention prevent redundancy in sampling and determine the number of sampled points in each cluster. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ADS in various tasks, such as achieving high classification performance on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN datasets, obtaining high mIoU on ShapeNet Part Segmentation, achieving high accuracy on S3DIS for scene segmentation, and surpassing the state-of-the-art in object detection on ScanNetV2 with a mAP50 of 55.0%.
