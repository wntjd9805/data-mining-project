This study aims to develop an interactive AI assistant that can work together with humans in real-world scenarios. The researchers introduce HoloAssist, a dataset that consists of collaborative tasks performed by two individuals. One person wears a mixed-reality headset and completes the task, while the other person watches their first-person perspective video and guides them verbally. The dataset includes annotations for actions and conversations, allowing for insights into how human assistants correct mistakes, intervene in task completion, and ground their instructions to the environment. HoloAssist contains 166 hours of data from 350 pairs of instructors and performers. The researchers also create benchmarks for mistake detection, intervention type prediction, and hand forecasting, providing a detailed analysis. HoloAssist is expected to be a valuable resource for developing AI assistants that can effectively collaborate with humans in real-world settings.
