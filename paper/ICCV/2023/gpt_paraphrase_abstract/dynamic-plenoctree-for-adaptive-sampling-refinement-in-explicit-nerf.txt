The explicit neural radiance field (NeRF) is a highly efficient and fast method for rendering virtual scenes, making it valuable for applications like virtual reality and gaming. The PlenOctree (POT), a hierarchical octree representation, has become popular for its structural benefits. However, the fixed structure of POT is not ideal as scene complexity changes over time, requiring adjustments to the sampling distribution. To address this, we propose the dynamic PlenOctree (DOT), which adaptively refines the sample distribution to accommodate changing scene complexity. DOT introduces a hierarchical feature fusion strategy during the rendering process, identifying regions of interest and using sampling and pruning operations for rapid parameter learning. Compared to POT, DOT improves visual quality, reduces parameter count by over 55.15/68.84%, and provides higher FPS for NeRF-synthetic and Tanks & Temples datasets.
