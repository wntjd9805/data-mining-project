We propose a novel approach called class-incremental grouping network (CIGN) to address the challenge of continual learning in audio-visual tasks. Existing methods for image classification have focused on regularization or rehearsal-based frameworks, but they are limited to a single modality and cannot learn compact cross-modal representations. CIGN overcomes this limitation by learning category-wise semantic features and continually aggregating class-aware features using audio-visual class tokens and grouping. It also prevents forgetting parameters learned from previous tasks through class token distillation and continual grouping. We evaluate CIGN on three benchmarks and demonstrate its superior performance in audio-visual class-incremental learning. The code is available at https://github.com/stoneMo/CIGN.
