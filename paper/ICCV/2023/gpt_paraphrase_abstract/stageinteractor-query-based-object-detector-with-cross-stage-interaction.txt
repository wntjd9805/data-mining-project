Previous object detectors typically use dense grid points or preset anchors to make predictions. These detectors often employ one-to-many label assignment strategies during training. In contrast, recent query-based object detectors rely on a sparse set of learnable queries that are refined by decoder layers. Each layer independently applies a one-to-one label assignment for deep supervision during training. However, this vanilla one-to-one label assignment strategy requires detectors to possess strong fine-grained discrimination and modeling capabilities. To address this limitation, we propose a new query-based object detector called StageInteractor, which incorporates cross-stage interaction. During the forward pass, we introduce an efficient method to enhance modeling ability by reusing dynamic operators with lightweight adapters. Additionally, we design a cross-stage label assigner to improve the one-to-one label assignment. This assigner gathers training target class labels across stages and reallocates them to appropriate predictions at each decoder layer. On the MS COCO benchmark, our model outperforms the baseline counterpart by achieving a 2.2 AP improvement. With ResNet-50 as the backbone, 100 queries, and 12 training epochs, our model achieves a 44.8 AP. With longer training time and 300 queries, StageInteractor achieves 51.3 AP with ResNeXt-101-DCN and 52.7 AP with Swin-S.
