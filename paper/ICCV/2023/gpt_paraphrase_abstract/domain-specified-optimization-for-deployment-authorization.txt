This paper examines Deployment Authorization (DPA) as a way to limit the generalization capabilities of vision models in specific domains for the purpose of safeguarding intellectual property. However, current DPA advancements are mostly limited to fully supervised settings, which require access to annotated images from unauthorized domains. This makes DPA approaches impractical and costly for real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose Source-Only Deployment Authorization (SDPA), which assumes that only authorized domains are available during training, and the model's performance on unauthorized domains must be suppressed during inference. Inspired by distributional robust statistics, we introduce a lightweight method called Domain-Specified Optimization (DSO) for SDPA, which reduces the model's generalization within a divergence ball. DSO has theoretical guarantees on convergence and authorization performance. Additionally, we propose Target-Combined Deployment Authorization (TPDA) as a complement to SDPA, where partially accessible unauthorized domains are considered. We simplify the DSO method for TPDA into a perturbation operation on pseudo predictions, called Target-Dependent Domain-Specified Optimization (TDSO). Through extensive experiments on six image benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DSO and TDSO methods, achieving superior performance in both SDPA and TDPA settings.
