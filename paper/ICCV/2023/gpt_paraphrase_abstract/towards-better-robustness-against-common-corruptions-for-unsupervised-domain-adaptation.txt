This study focuses on achieving robustness in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), specifically addressing robustness against common corruption. While previous research has mainly focused on adversarial robustness, there is a lack of exploration in robustness against benign corruption. To address this, the study proposes a novel framework called Distributionally and Discretely Adversarial Regularization (DDAR). DDAR is designed to improve robustness against common corruption by using a min-max optimization approach with a distribution distance. The framework is theoretically grounded to ensure generalization over unknown corruption types. Additionally, the study demonstrates that the proposed regularization scheme effectively reduces the perceptual distance between natural data and common corruption, serving as a surrogate measure of robustness against common corruption. The optimization pipeline of DDAR incorporates an image discretization scheme that transforms out-of-distribution adversarial data into in-distribution data augmentation, enhancing the adversarial regularization. Through extensive experiments, the proposed method outperforms conventional unsupervised regularization mechanisms in terms of robustness against common corruption. It also significantly improves the robustness of existing UDA methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
