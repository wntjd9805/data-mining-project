We present a new approach for generating accurate sparse correspondences for highly non-rigid shapes using mixed-integer programming (MIP). Our method incorporates a projected Laplace-Beltrami operator (PLBO) that combines intrinsic and extrinsic geometric information to measure the quality of deformation caused by predicted correspondences. By integrating the PLBO with an orientation-aware regularizer, we formulate a novel MIP problem that can be solved optimally for many practical scenarios. Unlike previous techniques, our approach is invariant to rigid transformations and global scaling, does not require initialization, guarantees optimality, and can handle high-resolution meshes efficiently. We demonstrate superior performance on challenging 3D datasets with inconsistent meshing and also showcase its applicability to mesh-to-point-cloud matching.
