Federated learning is a secure method for protecting private data in collaborative learning. However, recent research on gradient inversion has raised concerns about the privacy of this approach. While previous studies focused on low-resolution images and small batch sizes, this study demonstrates the ability to reconstruct high-resolution, complex images with large batch sizes. The key to success lies in using an over-parameterized convolutional network to generate images before matching gradients. Practical experiments show that this algorithm achieves accurate image recovery, outperforming existing methods that struggle in more complex scenarios. Therefore, this study highlights the vulnerability of local participants in a federated learning system to potential data leakage. The source code for the proposed algorithm is available at https://github.com/czhang024/CI-Net.
