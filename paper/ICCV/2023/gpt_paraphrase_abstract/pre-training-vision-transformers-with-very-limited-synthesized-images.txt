Formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL) is a technique that involves pre-training vision transformers using synthetic images generated from mathematical formulas like fractals. Previous research has demonstrated that this approach can achieve competitive accuracy on various downstream tasks. These synthetic images are classified based on the parameters in the formula used to create them. In this study, we propose that the generation of different instances within the same category in FDSL can be seen as a type of data augmentation. To test this hypothesis, we replace the instances with data augmentation, thereby requiring only one image per category. Our experiments confirm that this one-instance fractal database (OFDB) performs better than the original dataset where instances were explicitly generated. Furthermore, we expand OFDB to include 21,000 categories and demonstrate that it performs on par with, or even surpasses, models pre-trained on the much larger ImageNet-21k dataset when fine-tuned on ImageNet-1k. While ImageNet-21k contains 14 million images, OFDB only consists of 21,000 images. This finding opens up new possibilities for pre-training vision transformers using smaller datasets.
