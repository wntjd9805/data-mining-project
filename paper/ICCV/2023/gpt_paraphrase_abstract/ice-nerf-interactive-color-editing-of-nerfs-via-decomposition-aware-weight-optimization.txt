Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have gained significant attention for their high-quality results in 3D scene reconstruction and rendering. However, editing NeRFs is challenging as accurately decomposing the desired area of 3D space and ensuring consistency from different angles is difficult. In this paper, we propose ICE-NeRF, an Interactive Color Editing framework that performs color editing using a pre-trained NeRF and a rough user mask. Our method performs color editing in under a minute using a partial fine-tuning approach. To address the challenges of NeRF editing, we introduce two techniques: Activation Field-based Regularization (AFR) and Single-mask Multi-view Rendering (SMR). AFR performs weight regularization during fine-tuning based on the assumption that not all weights have an equal impact on the desired area. SMR maps the 2D mask to 3D space and renders it from other views to generate multi-view masks. ICE-NeRF enables well-decomposed, multi-view consistent color editing and reduces processing time compared to existing methods.
