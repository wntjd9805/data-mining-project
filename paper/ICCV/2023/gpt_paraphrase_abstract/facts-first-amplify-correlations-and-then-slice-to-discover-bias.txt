Computer vision datasets often have misleading associations between relevant labels and irrelevant attributes, resulting in models learning shortcuts and performing poorly on data that does not conform to these associations. This study focuses on identifying these problematic data subsets to aid in mitigating bias. The proposed approach, called FACTS, involves amplifying correlations to establish a bias-aligned hypothesis using regularization, and then using mixture modeling to identify underperforming data subsets that exhibit distinct correlations. Despite its simplicity, FACTS significantly outperforms previous methods in identifying correlation bias. The code for FACTS is available at https://github.com/yvsriram/FACTS.
