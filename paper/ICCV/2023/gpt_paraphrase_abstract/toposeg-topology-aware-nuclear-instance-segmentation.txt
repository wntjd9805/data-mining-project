Nuclear instance segmentation plays a crucial role in medical science, particularly in cancer diagnosis. However, current methods often sacrifice structural information during nuclei boundary exploration, which hinders accurate quantitative morphology assessment. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel approach called TopoSeg, which leverages topological structure information to improve segmentation predictions, especially in cases where nuclei instances are densely touching or overlapping. TopoSeg incorporates a topology-aware module (TAM) that captures dynamic changes in topology structures within the probability maps of nuclei (inside, boundary, and background) and converts them into persistence barcodes, enabling the use of a topology-aware loss function. Additionally, we propose an adaptive topology-aware selection (ATS) strategy to effectively prioritize regions with high topological errors during the optimization process. Our experiments on three nuclear instance segmentation datasets demonstrate that TopoSeg outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code for TopoSeg is publicly available at https://github.com/hhlisme/toposeg.
