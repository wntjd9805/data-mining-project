Recent advancements in deep learning have resulted in impressive optical flow estimation models that can accurately generate local flows between consecutive frames. However, the estimation of long-range flows between frames that are far apart, especially in situations involving complex object deformation and significant motion occlusion, remains a difficult task. One potential solution to this problem is to accumulate local flows, either explicitly or implicitly, in order to obtain the desired long-range flow. However, the accumulation process can introduce errors and misalignments, which can reduce the effectiveness of this approach. In this paper, we propose a new recurrent framework called AccFlow, which utilizes a deformable module called AccPlus to recursively accumulate local flows in a backward manner. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive blending module along with AccPlus to address the occlusion effect caused by backward accumulation and rectify any accumulation errors. Importantly, our experiments demonstrate that backward accumulation is superior to conventional forward accumulation, which has not been explicitly established in previous research. To facilitate the training and evaluation of AccFlow, we have created a large-scale dataset called CVO, which provides ground-truth optical flow labels for both adjacent and distant frames. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of AccFlow in handling long-range optical flow estimation. The source code for AccFlow is available at https://github.com/mulns/AccFlow.
