We propose an Improved Auto-regressive Model (ImAM) for 3D shape generation that overcomes the limitations of existing Auto-Regressive (AR) models. AR models have been successful in generating 2D images by modeling joint distributions in the grid space. However, when extended to the 3D domain, they face challenges such as expensive computations on volumetric grids and ambiguous auto-regressive order along grid dimensions. To address these limitations, our approach utilizes discrete representation learning based on a latent vector instead of volumetric grids. This not only reduces computational costs but also preserves essential geometric details by learning the joint distribution in a more manageable order. Additionally, our model architecture is simple, allowing for easy extension from unconditional to conditional generation by incorporating various conditioning inputs like point clouds, categories, images, and texts.Extensive experiments demonstrate that ImAM is capable of synthesizing diverse and accurate shapes across multiple categories, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
