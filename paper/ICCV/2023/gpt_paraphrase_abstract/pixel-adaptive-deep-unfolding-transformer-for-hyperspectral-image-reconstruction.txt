Recent advancements in Hyperspectral Image (HSI) reconstruction have shown promising results using the deep unfolding framework, which divides the problem into a data module and a prior module. However, existing methods still struggle to adequately match HSI data due to several issues. Firstly, the fixed gradient descent step in the data module fails to account for the agnostic degradation of HSI at the pixel-level. Secondly, the prior module lacks sufficient support for the 3D nature of HSI cubes. Lastly, the stage interaction disregards the variations in features at different stages.   To address these challenges, this study proposes a Pixel Adaptive Deep Unfolding Transformer (PADUT) for HSI reconstruction. In the data module, a pixel adaptive descent step is employed to address the pixel-level agnostic degradation. The prior module incorporates the Non-local Spectral Transformer (NST) to emphasize the 3D characteristics of HSI and improve the recovery process. Additionally, the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to enhance the stage interaction by capturing the diverse expression of features at different stages and depths.   Experimental results using both simulated and real scenes demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to state-of-the-art HSI reconstruction methods.
