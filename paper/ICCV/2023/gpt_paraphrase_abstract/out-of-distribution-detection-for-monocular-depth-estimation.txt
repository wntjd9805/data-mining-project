This study focuses on addressing uncertainty in monocular depth estimation, specifically targeting the uncertainty arising from lack of knowledge rather than image noise. The authors propose a method for detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data, which refers to data not represented in the training distribution. Inspired by anomaly detection, they suggest using the reconstruction error to identify OOD images in an encoder-decoder depth estimation model. By training an image decoder solely on in-distribution data using features extracted from a fixed depth encoder, the authors are able to distinguish between in-distribution and OOD samples based on the high reconstruction error observed in the latter. The proposed method is evaluated using the NYU Depth V2 and KITTI benchmarks as in-distribution data and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing uncertainty estimation approaches. Importantly, this method does not require any modifications to the trained encoder-decoder depth estimation model.
