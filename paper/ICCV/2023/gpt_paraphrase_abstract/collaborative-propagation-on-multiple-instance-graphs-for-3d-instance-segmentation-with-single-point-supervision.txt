Instance segmentation on 3D point clouds has gained significant attention for its applications in scene understanding. However, existing methods rely on fully annotated data, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we propose RWSeg, a novel weakly supervised method that only requires labeling one point per object. Using these sparse weak labels, we introduce a unified framework with two branches to propagate semantic and instance information to unknown regions. This is achieved through self-attention and a cross-graph random walk method. Our approach includes the Cross-graph Competing Random Walks (CRW) algorithm, which promotes competition among different instance graphs to improve instance assignment accuracy in cases of closely placed objects. RWSeg generates high-quality pseudo labels at the instance level. Experimental results on ScanNet-v2 and S3DIS datasets demonstrate that our method performs comparably to fully supervised methods and significantly outperforms previous weakly supervised methods.
