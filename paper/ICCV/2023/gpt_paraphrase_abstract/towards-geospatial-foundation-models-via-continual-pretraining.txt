Geospatial technologies are increasingly important in various fields such as agriculture, urban planning, and disaster response. However, deep learning models for geospatial tasks have limitations in terms of performance and training cost. In this study, we propose a new approach to build effective geospatial models with minimal resources and carbon impact. We create a diverse dataset called GeoPile and explore the potential of continual pretraining using large-scale ImageNet-22k models. Our multi-objective continual pretraining paradigm combines the strong representations of ImageNet with the ability to learn in-domain features. Our approach surpasses previous state-of-the-art geospatial pretraining methods in a comprehensive evaluation on seven different tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/mmendiet/GFM.
