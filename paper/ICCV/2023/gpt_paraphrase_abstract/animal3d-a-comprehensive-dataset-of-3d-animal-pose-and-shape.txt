The lack of a comprehensive and diverse dataset with accurate 3D pose and shape annotations has hindered research in understanding animal behavior and its potential applications in wildlife conservation. To address this gap, we introduce Animal3D, the first extensive dataset for estimating mammal animal 3D pose and shape. Animal3D comprises 3379 images from 40 mammal species, annotated with 26 key-points and pose and shape parameters of the SMAL model. The annotations were meticulously labeled and checked to ensure high-quality results. Using the Animal3D dataset, we evaluate different models for shape and pose estimation, including supervised learning, synthetic to real transfer, and fine-tuning human pose estimation models. Our experiments reveal that predicting the 3D shape and pose of animals across species remains a challenging task, despite advancements in human pose estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate that synthetic pre-training can enhance model performance. Animal3D not only paves the way for future research in animal 3D pose and shape estimation but also provides a publicly available resource for the scientific community.
