Referring to the segmentation of objects in videos based on human instruction, current state-of-the-art methods typically use an offline approach where each video clip independently interacts with text embedding. While this approach is deemed necessary for video object segmentation, it lacks the ability to model temporal associations within each clip effectively. In this study, we challenge this existing belief and propose an online model called OnlineRefer that utilizes explicit query propagation to improve accuracy and ease of referring predictions for the current frame. Our approach leverages target cues that gather semantic information and position prior. Additionally, we extend our online model into a semi-online framework that is compatible with video-based backbones. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on four benchmarks: Refer-Youtube-VOS, Refer-DAVIS17, A2D-Sentences, and JHMDB-Sentences. Without any additional embellishments, our OnlineRefer model with a Swin-L backbone achieves impressive results, outperforming all other offline methods with 63.5 J&F and 64.8 J&F on Refer-Youtube-VOS and Refer-DAVIS17, respectively. The code for our method is publicly available at https://github.com/wudongming97/OnlineRefer.
