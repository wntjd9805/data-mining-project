Diffusion models have gained popularity for image restoration, particularly in terms of noise robustness. However, existing diffusion-based methods are trained on large amounts of data and perform well within their training distribution but struggle with distribution shift. This poses a problem for data-limited hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration. To address this issue, this study proposes a self-supervised diffusion model called Denoising Diffusion Spatio-Spectral Model (DDS2M). DDS2M infers the parameters of the proposed Variational Spatio-Spectral Module (VS2M) during the reverse diffusion process using only the degraded HSI, without additional training data. VS2M employs a customized variational inference-based loss function to enable untrained spatial and spectral networks to learn the posterior distribution, which aids in reversing the diffusion process. Due to its self-supervised nature and the diffusion process, DDS2M exhibits strong generalization ability for various HSIs compared to existing diffusion-based methods, as well as superior noise robustness compared to existing HSI restoration methods. Extensive experiments on HSI denoising, noisy HSI completion, and super-resolution across a variety of HSIs demonstrate the superiority of DDS2M over existing state-of-the-art methods.
