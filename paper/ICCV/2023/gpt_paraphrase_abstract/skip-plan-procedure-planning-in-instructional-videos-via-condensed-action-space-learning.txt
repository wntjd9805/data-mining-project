In this paper, we introduce Skip-Plan, a method for procedure planning in instructional videos. Traditional methods for procedure planning rely on predicting state-action pairs at each timestep and generating actions sequentially. However, this approach faces challenges with high-dimensional state supervision and errors accumulating in action sequences. To address these issues, we propose abstracting the procedure planning problem as a mathematical chain model. By skipping uncertain nodes and edges in action chains, we transform long and complex sequence functions into shorter but more reliable ones. This is achieved in two ways. Firstly, we skip intermediate state supervision and focus solely on action predictions. Secondly, we break down longer chains into multiple shorter sub-chains by skipping unreliable intermediate actions. This allows our model to explore various reliable sub-relations within an action sequence within a condensed action space. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Skip-Plan outperforms other methods in procedure planning on the CrossTask and COIN benchmarks.
