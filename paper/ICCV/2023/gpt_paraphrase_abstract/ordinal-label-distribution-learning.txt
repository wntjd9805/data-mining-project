Label distribution learning (LDL) has gained significant attention as a way to model ambiguity in tasks such as age estimation, where labels have an intrinsic order. However, the conventional LDL approach overlooks the sequential patterns of labels by optimizing in a per-label manner. To address this limitation, we propose a new paradigm called ordinal label distribution learning (OLDL). OLDL captures the sequential patterns of labels by considering spatial, semantic, and temporal order relationships. The spatial order represents the relative position between labels, using cross-label transformations based on spatial margins. The semantic order constructs correlations between labels to capture their different meanings. The temporal order reflects the dependency of labels on their order, utilizing cumulative distributions. We introduce CAD, QFD, and CJS as learning objectives and evaluation metrics for OLDL. Through comprehensive experiments on four tasks, we demonstrate the superiority of OLDL over existing LDL methods in both traditional and newly proposed metrics.
