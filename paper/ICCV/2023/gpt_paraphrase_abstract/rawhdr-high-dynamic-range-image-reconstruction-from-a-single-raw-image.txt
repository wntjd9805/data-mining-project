This study focuses on generating high dynamic range (HDR) images from low dynamic range (LDR) images. Current methods rely on degraded 8-bit LDR images captured by cameras, but this limits the ability to retrieve extremely high dynamic range scenes. The unique approach of this study is to utilize raw sensor data to generate HDR images and recover scene details in challenging regions. A model specifically designed for raw images is proposed, which includes learning exposure masks to distinguish between hard and easy regions in a high dynamic scene. Additionally, two important guidance techniques are introduced: dual intensity guidance, which uses more informative channels to guide less informative ones, and global spatial guidance, which extends scene specifics over a larger spatial domain. To validate the proposed approach, a large dataset of raw/HDR paired images is collected for training and testing. Empirical evaluations confirm the effectiveness of the raw-to-HDR reconstruction model and the newly captured dataset.
