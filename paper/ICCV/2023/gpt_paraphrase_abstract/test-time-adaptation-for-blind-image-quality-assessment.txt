The performance of blind image quality assessment (IQA) algorithms is often poor when there is a distribution shift between the training and testing scenarios. To address this issue, test time adaptation (TTA) techniques are studied to improve their performance during inference. However, existing auxiliary tasks and loss functions used for TTA may not be suitable for quality-aware adaptation of pre-trained models. This study proposes two new quality-relevant auxiliary tasks at the batch and sample levels to enable TTA for blind IQA. A group contrastive loss at the batch level and a relative rank loss at the sample level are introduced to make the model quality aware and adaptable to the target data. Experimental results demonstrate that even with a small batch of images from the test distribution, significant performance improvement can be achieved by updating the batch normalization statistics of the source model.
