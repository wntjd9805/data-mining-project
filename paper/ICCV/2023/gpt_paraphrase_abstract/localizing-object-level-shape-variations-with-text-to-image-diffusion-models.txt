This paper introduces a technique for generating a collection of images that showcase different variations in the shape of a specific object. Typically, text-to-image models do not allow users to focus on exploring a particular object in the image due to the global nature of the generation process. Generating plausible shape variations is a challenge as it requires controlling the object's shape while preserving its semantics. Accurately localizing the manipulation of an object's shape is also challenging. To address these challenges, the paper proposes a prompt-mixing technique that switches between prompts during the denoising process to produce a range of shape choices. Additionally, two techniques that utilize self-attention and cross-attention layers are introduced to localize the image-space operation. These localization techniques are found to be effective beyond just generating object variations. The effectiveness of the proposed method in generating object variations and the competence of the localization techniques are demonstrated through extensive results and comparisons.
