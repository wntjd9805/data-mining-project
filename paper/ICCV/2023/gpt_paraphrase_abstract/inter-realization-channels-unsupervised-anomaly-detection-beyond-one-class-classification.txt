Unsupervised anomaly detection and localization in images is a difficult problem that previous methods have tried to address through supervised one-class classification. However, we propose a new approach called Inter-Realization Channels (InReaCh) that is fully unsupervised. Our method leverages the assumption that training images represent the underlying image distribution, allowing us to associate and represent nominal patches across different realizations. By extracting high-confidence nominal patches from the training data and creating a nominal model, we can effectively detect and localize anomalies in new patches.We evaluate the performance of InReaCh on the MVTec AD dataset and achieve a precision of 99.9% in extracting nominal patches. In anomaly localization and detection, we achieve an AUROC of 0.968 and 0.923, respectively, even when the training data is corrupted. These results are competitive with the current state-of-the-art supervised one-class classification methods. Additionally, our model remains robust even when up to 40% of the training data contains anomalies, with negligible impact on performance.The shift to fully unsupervised training with InReaCh simplifies the process of creating datasets and opens up possibilities for various applications.
