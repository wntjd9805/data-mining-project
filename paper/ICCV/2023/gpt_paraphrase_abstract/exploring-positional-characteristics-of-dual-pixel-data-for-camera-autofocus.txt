Autofocus is a crucial feature in digital photography that ensures high-quality image capture. Current approaches rely on phase patterns from dual-pixel sensors to determine focus. However, dual-pixel data can be affected by various errors during image capture, such as lens shading or distortions caused by lens characteristics. These degradations are difficult to model using prior knowledge but are related to the pixel's spatial position on the image sensor. To address this, we propose a learning-based autofocus model that incorporates positional encodings (PE). Our method, called RoI-PE, encodes the spatial position of the focusing region-of-interest (RoI) on the imaging plane. By learning with RoI-PE, the model becomes more robust against spatially-correlated degradations. We also introduce lens-PE, which encodes the current focal position of the lens and significantly reduces computational complexity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using the proposed position encodings for automatic focusing based on dual-pixel data.
