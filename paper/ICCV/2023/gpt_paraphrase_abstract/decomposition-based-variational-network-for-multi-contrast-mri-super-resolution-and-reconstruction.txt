We propose a new method called MC-VarNet for multi-contrast MRI super-resolution and reconstruction. Unlike existing deep learning-based methods, our approach explicitly models the relationship between multi-contrast images. We decompose the reference image into a common component and a unique component, and only transfer the common component to the target image during the reconstruction process. By solving a variational model and converting it into a deep network, our method combines the interpretability of model-based approaches with the representation power of deep learning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, particularly in handling noisy and inconsistent reference images. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/lpcccc-cv/MC-VarNet.
