Limited-Angle Computed Tomography (LACT) is a 3D imaging technique used in various fields like security and medicine. However, the limited angle coverage in LACT often produces significant artifacts in the reconstructed images, posing a challenging imaging inverse problem. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as a class of deep generative models that utilize image denoisers to synthesize realistic images. In this study, we introduce DOLCE, the first framework that combines conditionally-trained diffusion models with explicit physical measurement models to solve imaging inverse problems. DOLCE achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in highly ill-posed LACT by alternating between data-fidelity and sampling updates of a diffusion model conditioned on the transformed sinogram. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that unlike existing methods, DOLCE can generate high-quality and structurally coherent 3D volumes using only 2D conditionally pre-trained diffusion models. Furthermore, we show that the same pre-trained DOLCE model achieves SOTA performance on diverse types of images in challenging real LACT datasets.
