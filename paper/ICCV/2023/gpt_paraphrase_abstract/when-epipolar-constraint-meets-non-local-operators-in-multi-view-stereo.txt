Learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) methods heavily rely on feature matching, which requires distinct and descriptive representations. To address this, non-local feature aggregation techniques such as Transformer have been applied. However, these techniques introduce significant computational overhead for MVS. In contrast, we propose a novel approach that constrains non-local feature augmentation within a pair of lines, inspired by the classic epipolar geometry. This constraint reduces the search space to the epipolar line in stereo matching and suggests that MVS matching should distinguish points lying on the same line. Building on this idea, we devise a line-to-point non-local augmentation strategy using an optimized searching algorithm to split the feature maps into epipolar line pairs. We then introduce an Epipolar Transformer (ET) to perform non-local feature augmentation among these line pairs. Our approach, called ET-MVSNet, achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance on benchmark datasets with high efficiency. The code for ET-MVSNet is available at https://github.com/TQTQliu/ET-MVSNet.
