The importance of pedestrian trajectory prediction in understanding human behavior is widely recognized. However, existing methods that achieve high performance rely on time-consuming post-processing techniques such as clustering, which neglects the impact of predicted trajectories on safety decisions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach called Trajectory Unified TRansformer (TUTR). TUTR integrates various components of trajectory prediction, including social interaction and multimodal trajectory prediction, into a transformer encoder-decoder architecture, eliminating the need for post-processing. Our approach leverages explicit global predictions and an implicit mode-level transformer encoder to capture the relationships between different motion modes. Additionally, TUTR employs a social-level transformer decoder to consider social interactions with neighboring pedestrians. By employing a dual prediction strategy, TUTR generates a range of diverse trajectories and their corresponding probabilities simultaneously, without requiring post-processing. Experimental results demonstrate that TUTR achieves state-of-the-art accuracy performance and significantly improves inference speed compared to previous methods that rely on post-processing. Specifically, TUTR achieves a 10× to 40× speedup compared to well-tuned state-of-the-art approaches.
