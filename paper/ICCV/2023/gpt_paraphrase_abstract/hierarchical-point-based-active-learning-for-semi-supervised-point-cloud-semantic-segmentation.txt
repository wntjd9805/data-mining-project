Fully-supervised methods with abundant labeled data have achieved impressive results in point cloud semantic segmentation. However, acquiring large-scale point cloud data with point-wise labels is labor-intensive. To overcome this challenge, several attempts have been made to explore 3D point cloud segmentation with limited annotations. One effective strategy is active learning, although it remains under-explored. Existing methods measure uncertainty for each pre-divided region, but they suffer from redundant information and require additional efforts for region division. This paper addresses this issue by introducing a hierarchical point-based active learning strategy. Uncertainty is measured for each point using a hierarchical minimum margin uncertainty module that considers contextual information at multiple levels. Additionally, a feature-distance suppression strategy is developed to select important and representative points for manual labeling. Furthermore, a semi-supervised segmentation framework is built to better utilize unlabelled data based on the active strategy. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNetV2 datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves performance comparable to fully-supervised baselines with minimal training data. Specifically, the framework achieves 96.5% and 100% performance with only 0.07% and 0.1% training data, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art weakly-supervised and active learning methods.
