Reconstructing objects and hands in 3D from a single RGB image is a complex task. Current methods rely on manually defined hand-object constraints in Euclidean space, which results in suboptimal feature learning. However, hyperbolic space, with its exponentially-growing space distance, preserves the geometric properties of meshes better than Euclidean space. This is because it amplifies the differences between features based on similarity. In this study, we propose a novel method called Dynamic Hyperbolic Attention Network (DHANet) for precise hand-object reconstruction in hyperbolic space. By leveraging the intrinsic properties of hyperbolic space, our method learns representative features by projecting mesh and image features into a unified hyperbolic space. This approach consists of two modules: dynamic hyperbolic graph convolution and image-attention hyperbolic graph convolution. These modules enable our method to learn mesh features with rich geometry-image multi-modal information and effectively model hand-object interactions. Our method presents a promising alternative for accurate hand-object reconstruction in hyperbolic space. Extensive experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms most state-of-the-art methods.
