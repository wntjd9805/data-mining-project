Semi-supervised learning (SSL) aims to utilize large amounts of unlabeled data in situations where obtaining labels is costly. However, in real-world scenarios, the unlabeled data often contains outliers that do not belong to any of the labeled classes. Existing methods for open-set SSL typically detect and filter out these outliers, but we have observed that this approach can lead to even worse performance when labeled data is extremely scarce. This is because the unreliable outlier detector may mistakenly exclude valuable inliers. To address this issue, we propose a novel open-set SSL framework called IOMatch. Our framework can jointly utilize inliers and outliers, even when distinguishing between them is difficult. We achieve this by using a multi-binary classifier alongside a standard closed-set classifier to generate unified open-set classification targets. These targets treat all outliers as a single new class. We optimize an open-set classifier using these targets as pseudo-labels for all unlabeled samples, including both inliers and outliers. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that IOMatch outperforms existing methods on various benchmark datasets and settings, despite its simple design. The code and models for IOMatch are available at https://github.com/nukezil/IOMatch.
