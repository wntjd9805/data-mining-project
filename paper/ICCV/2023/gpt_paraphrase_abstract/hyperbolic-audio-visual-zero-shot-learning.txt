Audio-visual zero-shot learning aims to classify samples comprising audio and video sequences from classes not seen during training. An analysis of the data reveals a high degree of hyperbolicity, suggesting the use of a hyperbolic transformation for curvature-aware geometric learning. This approach explores complex hierarchical data structures. The proposed method incorporates a unique loss function that aligns video and audio features in the hyperbolic space, and also utilizes multiple adaptive curvatures for hyperbolic projections. Experimental results demonstrate that our hyperbolic approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art method on three challenging datasets (VGGSound-GZSL, UCF-GZSL, and ActivityNet-GZSL), achieving significant improvements in harmonic mean (HM) performance (around 3.0%, 7.0%, and 5.3% respectively).
