Stereo matching is a challenging task when dealing with a wide range of disparities. Existing methods focus on local disparity space, resulting in slow convergence towards ground truth due to the lack of a global perspective. We observe that the dynamic cost volume encodes the disparity space as a single Gaussian distribution with a fixed and small variance, limiting the global view and update step. To address this, we propose a parameterized cost volume that utilizes multi-Gaussian distributions to encode the entire disparity space. Each pixel's disparity distribution is characterized by weights, means, and variances. Means and variances are used for sampling disparity candidates, while weights and means are used for calculating the disparity output. We compute these parameters through JS-divergence-based optimization using gradient descent in a feed-forward differential module. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach accelerates the runtime of RAFT-Stereo by 4 to 15 times, achieving real-time performance with comparable accuracy.
