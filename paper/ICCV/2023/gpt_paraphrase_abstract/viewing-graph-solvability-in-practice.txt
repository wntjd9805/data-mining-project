We introduce a new approach to understanding projective Structure-from-Motion, with a specific focus on the viewing graph. This graph consists of cameras as nodes and fundamental matrices as edges. Our proposal offers a practical technique for determining finite solvability, which involves assessing if a viewing graph leads to a limited number of camera configurations. Compared to previous methods, our formulation requires a significantly smaller number of equations (up to 400Ë†). Consequently, this is the sole approach in existing literature that can be utilized for analyzing large viewing graphs derived from real datasets, which may contain up to 300K edges. Additionally, we have developed an algorithm to identify maximal finite-solvable components.
