Current adversarial attacks on motion estimation, specifically optical flow, focus on optimizing small per-pixel perturbations that are unlikely to occur in real-world scenarios. However, adverse weather conditions pose a much more realistic threat. Therefore, this study introduces a new attack method for motion estimation that utilizes adversarially optimized particles to simulate weather effects such as snowflakes, rain streaks, or fog clouds. The attack framework is built upon a differentiable particle rendering system that integrates particles consistently across multiple time steps, in the 3D space, and with a photo-realistic appearance. By employing optimization techniques, the researchers successfully generate adversarial weather that significantly affects the accuracy of motion estimation. Surprisingly, methods that previously exhibited robustness against small per-pixel perturbations are found to be highly vulnerable to adversarial weather. On the other hand, incorporating non-optimized weather data into the training process enhances a method's resilience against weather effects and improves its generalizability, with minimal additional cost.
