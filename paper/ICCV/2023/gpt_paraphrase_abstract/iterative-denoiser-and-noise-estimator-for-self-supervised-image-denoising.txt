The field of image denoising has advanced with the help of powerful deep learning tools. However, these methods heavily rely on large-scale and high-quality training data, which limits their practicality in real-world scenarios. Researchers have been exploring self-supervised approaches to denoise images without paired data, but these methods suffer from the lack of noise prior information and inefficient feature extraction. In this paper, we present a self-supervised image denoising pipeline called DCD-Net. Our approach utilizes an iterative training strategy to optimize the denoiser and noise estimator, gradually improving denoising performance using only single noisy images without any noise prior. The proposed framework achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world image denoising benchmarks.
