DreamBooth3D is a novel approach that allows for the personalization of text-to-3D generative models using just a few casually captured images (3-6) of a subject. By combining advancements in personalizing text-to-image models (DreamBooth) with text-to-3D generation (DreamFusion), we address the challenge of personalized models overfitting to specific viewpoints. Our solution involves a three-stage optimization strategy that leverages the 3D consistency of neural radiance fields and the personalization capabilities of text-to-image models. This approach enables the production of high-quality, subject-specific 3D assets with text-driven modifications such as unique poses, colors, and attributes that are not present in the input images.
