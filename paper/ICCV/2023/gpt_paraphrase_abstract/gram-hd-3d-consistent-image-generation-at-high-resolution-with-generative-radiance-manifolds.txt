This study introduces a new approach to 3D-aware Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that can generate high-resolution images while maintaining strict 3D consistency. Previous methods either struggled with generating high-resolution images or compromised 3D consistency by relying on 2D CNNs for upsampling. The proposed method achieves super-resolution directly in the 3D space by applying 2D convolutions on a set of 2D radiance manifolds. Dedicated loss functions are also used for effective GAN training at high resolution. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of producing high-quality, 3D-consistent results. This approach represents a significant advancement towards bridging the gap between traditional 2D image generation and 3D-consistent free-view generation.
