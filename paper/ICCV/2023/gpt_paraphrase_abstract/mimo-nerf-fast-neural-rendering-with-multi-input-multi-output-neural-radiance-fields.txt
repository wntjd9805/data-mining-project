Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have achieved impressive results in generating novel views. However, their rendering process is slow due to the repetitive use of a single-input single-output multilayer perceptron (SISO MLP). To address this, we propose a multi-input multi-output NeRF (MIMO-NeRF) that replaces the SISO MLP with a MIMO MLP and conducts mappings in a group-wise manner, reducing the number of MLPs required. One challenge with this approach is the potential ambiguity in color and volume density for each point within a group. To mitigate this, we introduce a self-supervised learning method that regulates the MIMO-MLP using multiple reformulated MLPs, eliminating the need for pretrained models. Through comprehensive experiments, including comparative and ablation studies, we demonstrate that MIMO-NeRF achieves a good balance between speed and quality, with reasonable training time. Furthermore, we show that MIMO-NeRF is compatible with and complements previous advancements in NeRFs by applying it to two fast NeRF models, DONeRF and TensoRF.
