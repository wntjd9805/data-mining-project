This paper proposes a new attack mechanism called False negative and False positive attack (F&F attack) for multi-object tracking (MOT). MOT involves creating trajectories for objects without specific identification. The current approach in MOT is tracking-by-detection, where fooling detectors can be effective but inefficient as it requires attacks in multiple frames. Attacking association processes improves efficiency but lacks generalization due to model-specific design. The F&F attack mechanism perturbs input images to erase original detections and inject deceptive false alarms, integrating the association attack implicitly. This allows for effective identity switches in multi-object trackers by fooling detectors in only a few frames. The mechanism is flexible and can be deployed on various multi-object trackers and detectors. Experimental results on MOT17 and MOT20 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing attackers, highlighting the vulnerability of the tracking-by-detection paradigm to detection attacks.
