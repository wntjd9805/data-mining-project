Recently, the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) has improved the quality of single-image super-resolution (SISR) methods. However, natural images have a complex distribution in the real world, and a single classifier in the discriminator may struggle to distinguish between real and fake samples. This leads to the generation of undesirable noise and artifacts by the preceding SISR network. To address this issue, we propose a new framework called CAL-GAN, which is a content-aware local GAN. CAL-GAN tackles the challenge of processing large and complex distributions of real-world images by dividing them into smaller subsets based on similar contents. Our framework incorporates a mixture of classifiers (MoC) design, which assigns different super-resolved patches to expert classifiers that specialize in handling specific types of content. We also introduce novel routing and orthogonality loss terms to facilitate the learning of separable features by different classifiers. By feeding similar distributions to the corresponding specialized classifiers, CAL-GAN enhances the representation power of existing super-resolution models. It achieves state-of-the-art perceptual performance on standard benchmarks and real-world images without requiring modifications to the generator-side architecture. The source code for CAL-GAN is available at https://github.com/jkpark0825/CAL GAN.
