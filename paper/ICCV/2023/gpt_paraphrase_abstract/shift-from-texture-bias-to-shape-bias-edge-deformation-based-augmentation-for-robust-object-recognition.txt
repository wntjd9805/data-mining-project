Recent research has highlighted the vulnerability of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to perturbation noises. This vulnerability is partly due to the fact that well-trained CNNs rely heavily on object texture when making predictions. To address this issue, current studies have attempted to train CNNs to be more biased towards shape cues by using augmented samples with heavily perturbed textures. However, these methods often fail to create shape-biased networks due to a lack of diversity in the shape cues. In this paper, we propose a method called Shape Deformation-based Online Augmentation (SDbOA) to augment the training dataset with semantically meaningful shapes and samples. The augmented samples generated by SDbOA have two main advantages. Firstly, the increased diversity in shape variations allows networks to learn shape cues more effectively, promoting shape bias. Secondly, the use of semantic-meaningful shape augmentation samples, created by jointly regularizing the generator with object texture and edge-guidance soft constraint, improves robustness against noise. Extensive experiments under various perturbation noises demonstrate the superior performance of our shape-bias-motivated model compared to existing approaches.
