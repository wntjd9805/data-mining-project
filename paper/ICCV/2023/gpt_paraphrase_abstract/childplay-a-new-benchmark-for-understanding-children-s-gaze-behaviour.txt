Gaze behaviors, such as eye-contact and shared attention, play a crucial role in diagnosing developmental disorders in children. However, previous studies on these behaviors have been limited to private datasets and lab settings. Additionally, existing gaze prediction benchmarks primarily consist of instances with adults, making it difficult to apply models to scenarios involving young children. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing the first study on predicting the gaze target of children and interacting adults. The researchers introduce the ChildPlay dataset, which contains curated video clips of children playing and interacting with adults in uncontrolled environments. The dataset is annotated with detailed gaze information. The researchers also propose a new model for gaze target prediction that is grounded in geometry by identifying scene parts in the 3D field of view of the person. This model achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets and the ChildPlay dataset. The results highlight that predicting gaze target based on faces is much less accurate for children compared to adults. However, fine-tuning the models using child gaze annotations significantly improves the performance. The ChildPlay dataset is publicly available, and the code for the model will be released soon.
