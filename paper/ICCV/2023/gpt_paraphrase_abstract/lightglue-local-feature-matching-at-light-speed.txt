We present LightGlue, a deep neural network that can match local features in images. We have made improvements to SuperGlue, the current leading method in sparse matching, by reconsidering its design choices. These enhancements have made LightGlue more efficient, accurate, and easier to train. One important feature of LightGlue is its adaptability to different levels of difficulty in matching. It can quickly infer matches for image pairs that are easier to match due to larger visual overlap or limited appearance change. This opens up possibilities for using deep matchers in time-sensitive applications such as 3D reconstruction. The code and trained models for LightGlue are publicly available on GitHub at github.com/cvg/LightGlue.
