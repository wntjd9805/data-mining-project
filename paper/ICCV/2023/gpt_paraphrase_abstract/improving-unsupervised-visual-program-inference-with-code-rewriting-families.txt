This abstract discusses the use of code rewriting to enhance systems that infer programs from visual data. The authors introduce a framework called Sparse Intermittent Rewrite Injection (SIRI) for unsupervised bootstrapped learning. SIRI applies code rewrite operations sparsely to a dataset of training programs and injects the improved programs back into the training set. The authors also present a family of rewriters for visual programming domains, including parameter optimization, code pruning, and code grafting. They demonstrate that using SIRI with these rewriters improves performance in terms of better reconstructions and faster convergence rates compared to methods that do not utilize rewriters or use them without optimization. Additionally, the authors show that their family of rewriters can effectively enhance the output of SIRI predictions during test time. In the domain of 2D and 3D constructive solid geometry (CSG), their approach outperforms or matches the reconstruction performance of recent domain-specific neural architectures while generating more concise programs that require fewer primitives.
