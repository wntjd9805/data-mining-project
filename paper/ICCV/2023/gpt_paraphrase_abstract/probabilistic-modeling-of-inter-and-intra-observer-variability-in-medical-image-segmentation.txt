Medical image segmentation is a complex task due to inconsistencies between different raters, even among medical experts. To address this challenge, we propose a new model called Pionono. Pionono captures the labeling behavior of each rater using a multidimensional probability distribution. It combines this information with image feature maps to generate probabilistic segmentation predictions. The model is trained using variational inference and can be optimized end-to-end. Pionono outperforms existing models like STAPLE, Probabilistic U-Net, and confusion matrix-based models. Remarkably, Pionono produces multiple segmentation maps that align with expert opinions, providing valuable insights for diagnosis. We validate the effectiveness and efficiency of Pionono through experiments on real-world cancer segmentation datasets. This makes Pionono a robust tool for accurate medical image analysis.
