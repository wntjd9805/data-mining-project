We extensively assess several algorithms for machine learning in a federated setting and examine their effectiveness for various image classification tasks. We address several previously overlooked concerns, such as the impact of limited image diversity in the datasets on learning outcomes, the decision of utilizing a pre-trained feature extraction "backbone," and the evaluation of learner performance beyond classification accuracy. After conducting numerous experiments in diverse scenarios, we discover that vertically decomposing a neural network consistently yields superior results compared to conventional reconciliation-based approaches.
