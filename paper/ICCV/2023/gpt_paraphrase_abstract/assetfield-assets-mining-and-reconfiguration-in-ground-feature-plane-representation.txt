We propose AssetField, a novel neural scene representation that uses object-aware ground feature planes to represent indoor and outdoor environments. This approach allows for the construction of an asset library using template feature patches in an unsupervised manner. Unlike existing methods, our representation enables natural visualization of the scene in a bird-eye view, allowing for various object editing operations without the need for object masks. Additionally, group editing is enabled for scenes with recurring items, reducing repetitive work on individual objects. AssetField achieves competitive performance in novel-view synthesis and generates realistic renderings for new scene configurations.
