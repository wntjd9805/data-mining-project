This paper introduces a new approach for multi-label image classification that focuses on capturing the correlation among labels. Existing research primarily relies on statistical label co-occurrence or semantic similarity, but fails to consider the relationship between label co-occurrence and image scenes. To address this, the proposed framework incorporates scene-aware label graph learning, which learns visual representations for labels while also perceiving their co-occurrence relationships across different scenes. The framework can detect scene categories of images without manual annotations and maintains a global co-occurrence matrix for each scene category during training. These matrices guide the interactions among label representations in a graph propagation manner, leading to more accurate label prediction. The framework is evaluated on public benchmarks and demonstrates superior performance.
