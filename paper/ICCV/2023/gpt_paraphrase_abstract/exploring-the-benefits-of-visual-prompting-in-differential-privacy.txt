The technique of Visual Prompting (VP) is a powerful and emerging method that enables efficient adaptation to downstream tasks by using a well-trained frozen source model. This study investigates the advantages of incorporating VP into neural network classifiers with differential privacy (DP). The researchers explore and integrate VP with canonical DP training methods, demonstrating its simplicity and efficiency. The results show that when combined with PATE, a leading DP training method that utilizes knowledge transfer from a group of teachers, VP achieves the best trade-off between privacy and utility while minimizing the consumption of privacy budget. Additionally, experiments are conducted on cross-domain image classification with a significant domain gap to further highlight the benefits of VP in DP. The study also includes comprehensive ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness and contribution of VP under DP considerations.
