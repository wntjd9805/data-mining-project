Coordinate networks are commonly utilized in computer vision for their ability to represent signals as compressed and continuous entities. However, the use of first-order optimizers for training these networks can impede their application in real-time scenarios due to slow training speed. Recent studies have employed shallow voxel-based representations to expedite training, albeit at the cost of memory efficiency. This research proposes a solution that utilizes second-order optimization methods to significantly reduce training times for coordinate networks while preserving their compressibility. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of this approach across various signal modalities, encompassing audio, images, videos, shapes, and neural radiance fields (NeRF).
