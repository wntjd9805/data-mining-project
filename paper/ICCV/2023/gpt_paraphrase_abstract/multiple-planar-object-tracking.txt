Tracking the location and pose of multiple planar objects (MPOT) is a challenging task, especially when occlusion occurs. To address this challenge, we propose a tracking framework that combines appearance perception and occlusion reasoning. Inspired by amodal perception in humans, we develop a dual-branch network to track the visible part of planar objects and an occlusion area localization strategy to infer the invisible part. We also introduce a two-stream attention network to refine the predictions. To overcome the lack of data in this field, we create the MPOT-3K dataset, which includes 3,717 planar objects from 356 videos with extensive annotations. This dataset covers various motion patterns and indoor/outdoor scenes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the MPOT-3K dataset and other single planar object tracking datasets. The code and MPOT-3K dataset are publicly available for further research.
