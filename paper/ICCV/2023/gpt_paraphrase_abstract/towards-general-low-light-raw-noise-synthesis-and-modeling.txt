Synthesizing low-light raw noise is a fundamental challenge in computational photography and image processing. Existing methods use physics-based models to generate noise, but these models fail to capture the complex and varying nature of signal-independent noise in low-light conditions across different camera sensors. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approach that combines physics-based and learning-based methods to generate both signal-dependent and signal-independent noise. This approach allows our model to learn different noise characteristics for different ISO levels and generalize to various sensors. We also introduce a multi-scale discriminator called Fourier transformer discriminator (FTD) to accurately distinguish noise distribution. Furthermore, we have created a new dataset for training and benchmarking called low-light raw denoising (LRD). Our qualitative validation demonstrates that the noise generated by our model closely resembles real noise in terms of distribution. Additionally, extensive denoising experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on different sensors. Overall, our proposed method can generate noise at different ISO levels using a single learned noise model. The visualization and quantitative metric (Kullback-Leibler divergence) confirm that the synthetic noise distribution closely matches the distribution of real noise. High ISO levels often result in excessive noise that hampers image denoising, making our method particularly valuable in addressing this challenge.
