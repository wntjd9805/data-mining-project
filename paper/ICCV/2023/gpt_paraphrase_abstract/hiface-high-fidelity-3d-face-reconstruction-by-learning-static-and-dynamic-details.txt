This paper focuses on the development of a method called HiFace for high-fidelity 3D face reconstruction. Existing methods struggle to separate the static and dynamic details of facial surfaces, resulting in unrealistic reconstructions. HiFace addresses this issue by explicitly modeling the static and dynamic details. The static detail is represented as a linear combination of a displacement basis, while the dynamic detail is modeled as the linear interpolation of two displacement maps with polarized expressions. The authors employ various loss functions and utilize synthetic and real-world datasets to simultaneously learn the coarse shape and fine details, enabling HiFace to reconstruct highly realistic 3D shapes with animatable details. Extensive experiments showcase that HiFace achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and accurately recovers both the static and dynamic details.
