Seed area generation for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) typically begins with the computation of Class Activation Maps (CAMs) using multi-label classification networks. However, CAMs generated from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have different issues, with CNNs being prone to under-activation and Transformers being prone to over-activation. Consequently, the existing strategies for refining CAMs are not suitable for both types of networks. To address this, we propose a Unified optimization paradigm for Seed Area GEneration (USAGE) that can be applied to both CNNs and Transformers. USAGE involves optimizing an objective function comprising two terms: a generation loss, which controls the shape of seed areas using a temperature parameter based on a deterministic principle specific to each network type, and a regularization loss, which ensures consistency between seed areas generated by self-adaptive network adjustments from different views to correct false activation. Experimental results demonstrate that USAGE significantly improves seed area generation for both CNNs and Transformers, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 4.1% on PASCAL VOC. Additionally, using the seed areas generated by USAGE on Transformers, we achieve state-of-the-art results for WSSS on both PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets.
