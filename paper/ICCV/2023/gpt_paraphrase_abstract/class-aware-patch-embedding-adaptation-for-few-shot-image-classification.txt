The abstract discusses the limitations of few-shot learning algorithms that rely on comparing image patches. It highlights the problem of irrelevant meanings associated with patches when observed independently. To address this issue, the proposed method, called Class-aware Patch Embedding Adaptation (CPEA), aims to learn "class-aware embeddings" of image patches. The CPEA integrates patch embeddings with class-aware embeddings to make them class-relevant. It also defines a dense score matrix to quantify the similarity between paired images based on class-relevant patch embeddings. The visualization results demonstrate that CPEA effectively concentrates patch embeddings by class. The experiments conducted on four benchmark datasets show that CPEA outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The source code for CPEA is available at the given GitHub link.
