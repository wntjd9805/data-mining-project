The under-display camera (UDC) offers a full-screen display without notches or punched holes, but it suffers from image degradation due to the semi-transparent nature of the display. This study focuses on restoring UDC images by addressing the scattering effect caused by the display. The scattering effect is modeled as a homogeneous scattering medium, and an improved image formation pipeline is developed to create a realistic UDC dataset. To mitigate the scattering effect, a two-branch restoration network is designed. The scattering branch uses channel-wise self-attention to estimate scattering parameters from degraded images, while the image branch uses CNN to recover clear scenes, guided by the scattering branch. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to existing UDC restoration techniques. The source code and dataset are available at the provided GitHub link.
