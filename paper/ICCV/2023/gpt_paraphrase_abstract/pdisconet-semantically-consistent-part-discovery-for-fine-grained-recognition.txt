Fine-grained classification often involves identifying specific parts of objects, such as the shape of a bird's beak or the patterns on its wings. To ensure that a fine-grained classification model focuses on these important details, we propose a new approach called PDiscoNet. This approach aims to discover object parts by using only image-level class labels and incorporating certain priors. These priors encourage the parts to be discriminative, compact, distinct from each other, equivariant to rigid transforms, and informative in at least some images.  To encode these priors, we introduce appropriate losses and utilize two techniques: part-dropout and part feature vector modulation. Part-dropout involves dropping entire part feature vectors at once to prevent a single part from dominating the classification process. Part feature vector modulation ensures that the information from each part is distinct from the perspective of the classifier.  Our experimental results on CUB, CelebA, and PartImageNet datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous methods in terms of part discovery performance. Importantly, our approach does not require additional hyper-parameter tuning and does not penalize the classification performance. For those interested, the code for PDiscoNet is available at https://github.com/robertdvdk/part_detection.
