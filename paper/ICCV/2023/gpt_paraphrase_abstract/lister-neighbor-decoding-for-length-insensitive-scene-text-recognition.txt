Most existing methods for scene text recognition (STR) are only effective on short or seen-length text and cannot recognize longer text or perform length extrapolation. This limitation is problematic because the lengths of the text to be recognized are often unknown in real-world applications. In this paper, we propose a method called Length-Insensitive Scene Text Recognizer (LISTER) to address this issue. LISTER includes a Neighbor Decoder that uses a novel neighbor matrix to obtain accurate character attention maps regardless of text length. Additionally, a Feature Enhancement Module is designed to model long-range dependency at a low computation cost, enhancing the feature map progressively through iterations with the neighbor decoder. Our LISTER algorithm is the first to achieve effective length-insensitive scene text recognition. Extensive experiments show that LISTER outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks for STR, particularly in recognizing long text and extrapolating length.
