The objective of this study is to transfer a Transformer-based image compression codec from human perception to machine perception without the need for fine-tuning. We introduce a transferable framework called TransTIC, which incorporates a prompt generator to inject instance-specific prompts to the encoder and task-specific prompts to the decoder, inspired by visual prompt tuning. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses other approaches in transferring the base codec to various machine tasks. This work is the first to utilize prompting in the low-level image compression task.
