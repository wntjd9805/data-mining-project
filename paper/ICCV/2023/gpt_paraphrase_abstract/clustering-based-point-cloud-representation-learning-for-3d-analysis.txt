Point cloud analysis is a challenging task due to the irregular geometries and variations in depth, viewpoint, and occlusion. While current studies focus on adapting neural networks to handle these complexities, they overlook the importance of learning an appropriate point embedding space that considers both discriminative semantics and challenging variations. In response, we propose a clustering-based supervised learning approach for point cloud analysis. Unlike the prevalent scene-wise training paradigm, our algorithm conducts within-class clustering on the point embedding space to discover latent yet representative subclass patterns across scenes. These patterns are then used to modify the embedding space, respecting the distribution of the entire training dataset and enhancing robustness to variations. Our algorithm seamlessly integrates with modern point cloud segmentation networks during training without additional overhead during testing. We evaluate our approach with various 3D network architectures and observe significant improvements on well-known point cloud segmentation datasets, such as SemanticKITTI and S3DIS, achieving gains in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). Moreover, our algorithm demonstrates its effectiveness in 3D detection, with notable gains in mean Average Precision (mAP) on the KITTI dataset.
