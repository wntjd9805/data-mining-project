Unsupervised anomaly detection is a well-researched topic in industrial applications where obtaining anomalous data is challenging. One approach to this problem is reconstruction-based anomaly detection, which can be suitable when external knowledge, such as additional datasets or pre-trained models, is not available. However, reconstruction-based methods have limited effectiveness in detecting anomalies. Recently, a score-based model called a denoising diffusion model has shown excellent performance in generating high-quality samples.In this study, we propose a novel unsupervised anomaly detection technique that utilizes the score-based model. Our method demonstrates promising performance without the need for external knowledge. The score, which represents the gradient of the log-likelihood, possesses a unique property that makes it suitable for anomaly detection. It can instantly restore samples on the data manifold, even if they are randomly perturbed. We refer to this ability as score-based perturbation resilience. Conversely, samples that deviate from the manifold cannot be restored in the same manner. The variation in resilience based on the sample's position can serve as an indicator to distinguish anomalies. We establish this concept from a geometric standpoint.Our method outperforms previous approaches that do not utilize external knowledge on three benchmark datasets for industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, on the MVTec AD dataset, we achieve an image-level AUROC of 97.7% and a pixel-level AUROC of 97.4%.
