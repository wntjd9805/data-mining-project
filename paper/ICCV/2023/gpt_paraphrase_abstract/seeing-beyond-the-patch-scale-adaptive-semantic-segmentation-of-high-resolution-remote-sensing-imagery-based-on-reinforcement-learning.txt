Patch-based methods in remote sensing imagery analysis have limitations in capturing information beyond the sliding window, leading to semantic inconsistencies in segmentation results. To overcome this challenge, we propose GeoAgent, a dynamic scale perception framework that adaptively captures scale context information outside the image patch based on different geo-objects. Each image patch in GeoAgent is represented by a global thumbnail and a location mask, providing context and guiding spatial relationships. Scale selection is performed by a Scale Control Agent (SCA) using a feature indexing module to enhance location distinction. The SCA switches the patch scale and context branch of a dual-branch segmentation network that extracts and fuses multi-scale patch features. GeoAgent adjusts network parameters based on rewards received for selected scales. Experimental results using publicly available datasets and our dataset WUSU demonstrate that GeoAgent outperforms previous segmentation methods, particularly for large-scale mapping applications.
