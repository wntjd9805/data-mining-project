False negatives (FN) in 3D object detection, such as missing predictions of pedestrians, vehicles, or obstacles, can pose dangers in autonomous driving. This issue is not well-studied in current 3D detection methods. To address this, we propose Hard Instance Probing (HIP), a pipeline that identifies false negatives in multiple stages and guides models to focus on challenging instances. For 3D object detection, we implement this approach as FocalFormer3D, a simple yet effective detector that excels at identifying difficult objects and improving prediction recall. FocalFormer3D employs a multi-stage query generation to discover hard objects and a box-level transformer decoder to efficiently distinguish objects from numerous candidates. Experimental results on the nuScenes and Waymo datasets confirm the superior performance of FocalFormer3D. It achieves a 70.5 mAP and 73.9 NDS on the nuScenes detection benchmark, as well as a 72.1 AMOTA on the nuScenes tracking benchmark, ranking first on the nuScenes LiDAR leaderboard.
