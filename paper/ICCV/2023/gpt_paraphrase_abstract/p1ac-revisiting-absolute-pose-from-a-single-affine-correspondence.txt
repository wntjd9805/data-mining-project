Traditionally, affine correspondences have been used to improve feature matching across wide baselines. While recent research has utilized affine correspondences to solve relative camera pose estimation problems, less attention has been given to their application in absolute pose estimation. In this study, we present the first comprehensive solution to estimating the pose of a calibrated camera using a single observation of an oriented point and an affine correspondence. Our approach, named P1AC, offers the advantage of requiring only one correspondence, which greatly reduces the complexities involved in robust estimation compared to the conventional point-based approach, known as P3P. P1AC offers a general solution that eliminates restrictive assumptions made in previous works, making it applicable to large-scale image-based localization. We propose a minimal solution to the P1AC problem and evaluate its performance on synthetic data, demonstrating its numerical stability and effectiveness in handling various types of noise. Furthermore, we compare P1AC to the widely used P3P algorithm on standard image-based localization benchmarks, revealing that P1AC achieves more accurate results.
