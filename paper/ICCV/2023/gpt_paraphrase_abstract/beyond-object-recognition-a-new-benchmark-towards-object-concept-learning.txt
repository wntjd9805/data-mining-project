Understanding objects is a fundamental aspect of AI, particularly in the field of embodied AI. Although deep learning has achieved great success in object recognition, current machines struggle to acquire higher-level knowledge about objects, such as their attributes and potential uses. To address this issue, we propose a challenging task called Object Concept Learning (OCL) which aims to advance object understanding. OCL requires machines to not only identify the affordances of objects but also provide a reasoning for why these affordances exist based on the object's attributes. To facilitate OCL, we have developed a comprehensive knowledge base with detailed annotations for three levels of object concepts: category, attribute, and affordance. Additionally, we have established clear causal relationships among these levels. By examining the causal structure of OCL, we have developed a baseline model called Object Concept Reasoning Network (OCRN). OCRN utilizes concept instantiation and causal intervention to infer the three levels of object knowledge. In experimental evaluations, OCRN demonstrates effective inference of object knowledge while accurately following the causal relationships.
