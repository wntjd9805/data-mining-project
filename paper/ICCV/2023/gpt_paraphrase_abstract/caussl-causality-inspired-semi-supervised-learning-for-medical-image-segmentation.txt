Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been successful in medical image segmentation by improving data efficiency with limited annotations. However, there are concerns about the theoretical foundation of SSL segmentation. To address this, a novel causal diagram is proposed to provide a theoretical foundation for mainstream SSL segmentation methods. This causal diagram considers two additional intermediate variables that were previously neglected. Building on this diagram, a causality-inspired SSL approach called CauSSL is introduced to enhance SSL for medical image segmentation. The importance of algorithmic independence between networks or branches in SSL is emphasized, along with a novel statistical quantification and optimization process to enhance independence. CauSSL can be integrated into existing SSL methods, resulting in consistent improvements in three challenging medical image segmentation tasks. The code for CauSSL is publicly available at: https://github.com/JuzhengMiao/CauSSL.
