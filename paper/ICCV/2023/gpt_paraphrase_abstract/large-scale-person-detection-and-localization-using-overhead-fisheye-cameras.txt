This article focuses on developing person positioning solutions using overhead fisheye cameras, as opposed to localizing tourist photos taken with perspective cameras. These solutions offer advantages such as a large field of view, low cost, anti-occlusion, and a non-intrusive work mode. However, there is a lack of research in this area due to limited data availability. To address this, the authors present LOAF, the first large-scale overhead fisheye dataset for person detection and localization. LOAF includes diverse scenes, human poses, densities, and locations, and contains the largest number of annotated pedestrian bounding boxes with ground-truth location information. To approach localization, a fisheye person detection network is built using a rotation-equivariant training strategy to exploit fisheye distortions and predict radius-aligned human boxes. The actual locations of the detected persons are then calculated using a numerical solution on the fisheye model and camera altitude data. Extensive experiments on LOAF demonstrate the superiority of the fisheye detector compared to previous methods, and show that the fisheye positioning solution can accurately locate all persons within the field of view with an accuracy of 0.5 m and within 0.1 s.
