The softmax loss, commonly used in deep face recognition, does not provide a clear threshold to distinguish positive sample-to-class pairs from negative ones. To address this issue, we propose the Unified Cross-Entropy (UCE) loss, which ensures that positive sample-to-class similarities are always greater than negative ones. By incorporating margins, our UCE loss enhances the performance of face recognition models. We evaluate our approach, called UniFace, using various public datasets (MFR, IJB-C, LFW, CFP-FP, AgeDB, and MegaFace) and compare it to state-of-the-art methods such as SphereFace, CosFace, ArcFace, and Partial FC. Experimental results demonstrate that UniFace outperforms these methods, achieving the highest TAR@MR-All in the academic track of the ongoing MFR challenge. The code for UniFace is publicly available.
