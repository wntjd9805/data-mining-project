In this study, our focus is on acquiring knowledge of descriptive geometry and motion features from sequences of 4D point clouds. Current research in this field typically involves developing generic 4D learning tools without taking advantage of the fact that a 4D sequence originates from a single 3D scene with localized dynamics. Recognizing this, we propose a method to learn coordinate frames specific to regions that transform in conjunction with the underlying geometry. These frames allow us to separate geometry and motion, enabling a more effective reconstruction of the geometric features in the feature space for 4D learning. To achieve this, we introduce a rotation equivariant network with a frame stabilization strategy to learn these region frames. Additionally, we devise a frame-guided 4D learning approach to enhance spatial-temporal feature learning. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods on various 4D understanding benchmarks.
