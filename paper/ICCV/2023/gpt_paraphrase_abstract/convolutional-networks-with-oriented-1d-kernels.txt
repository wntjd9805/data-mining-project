This study explores the possibility of using 1D convolutions instead of 2D convolutions in ConvNets for computer vision tasks. The researchers find that a ConvNet composed entirely of 1D convolutions can achieve similar performance to one using 2D convolutions in ImageNet classification. They discover that using oriented 1D kernels, which are not limited to horizontal or vertical orientations, is crucial for achieving high accuracy. The experiments demonstrate that oriented 1D convolutions can replace 2D convolutions and enhance existing architectures with large kernels, resulting in improved accuracy without significantly increasing computational costs. The researchers also develop a highly optimized custom CUDA implementation of oriented 1D kernels, specifically designed for depthwise convolution. The benchmarks show that this custom implementation outperforms native horizontal convolutions for any arbitrary angle. The code for this implementation is available on GitHub at https://github.com/princeton-vl/Oriented1D.
