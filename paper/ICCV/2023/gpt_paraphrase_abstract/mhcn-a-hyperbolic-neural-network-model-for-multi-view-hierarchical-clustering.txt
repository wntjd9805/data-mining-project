This paper presents a new approach called Multi-view Hierarchical Clustering Network (MHCN) to address the limitations of existing methods in multi-view hierarchical clustering. MHCN combines hierarchical feature learning and comprehensive representation learning across multiple views to improve the efficiency of clustering. The proposed method uses hyperbolic autoencoders to uncover tree-like structures among the views and maps the latent space onto the Poincar√© ball. The hyperbolic embeddings are then regularized to achieve multi-view representation learning and ensure a well-balanced hierarchy for better interpretability. Experimental results on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that MHCN achieves state-of-the-art hierarchical clustering performance and provides meaningful clustering results.
