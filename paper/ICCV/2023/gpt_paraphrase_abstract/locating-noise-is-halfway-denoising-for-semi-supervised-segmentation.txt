This study explores the use of self-training in semi-supervised semantic segmentation, where a teacher model generates pseudo masks to leverage a large collection of unlabeled images. The main challenge lies in the noisy labels produced by the pseudo masks, which hinder performance. Unlike previous approaches that focus on pixel-level noise, this work proposes a method called Uncertainty-aware Patch CutMix (UPC) that identifies patch-wise noisy regions as a more effective way to handle noise. The UPC method first estimates the uncertainty of per-pixel predictions for the pseudo masks of unlabeled images. It then splits the uncertainty map into patches and calculates patch-wise uncertainty. The top-k most uncertain patches are selected to generate uncertain regions. Finally, these uncertain regions are replaced with reliable ones from labeled images. Extensive experiments conducted on Pascal VOC and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that UPC significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the study shows that UPC is robust even when faced with out-of-distribution unlabeled images, such as MSCOCO.
