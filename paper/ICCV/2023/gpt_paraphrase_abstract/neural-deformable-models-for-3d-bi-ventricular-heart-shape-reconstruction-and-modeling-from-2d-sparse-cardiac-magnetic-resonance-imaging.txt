We propose a new method called the neural deformable model (NDM) for reconstructing and modeling the 3D bi-ventricular shape of the heart using sparse 2D cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging data. Our approach utilizes blended deformable superquadrics, which are parameterized by geometric functions and can deform globally and locally. Global geometric functions and deformations capture overall shape features, while local deformations, represented as neural diffeomorphic point flows, recover fine details of the heart shape. Unlike traditional iterative optimization methods, NDMs can be trained to learn geometric functions, global and local deformations from a shape distribution manifold. Our NDM can densify sparse cardiac point clouds of any scale and automatically generate high-quality triangular meshes. It also allows for implicit learning of dense correspondences between different heart shape instances, enabling accurate cardiac shape registration. Additionally, the parameters of NDM are intuitive and can be easily used by physicians without complicated post-processing. Experimental results on a large CMR dataset demonstrate the superior performance of NDM compared to conventional methods.
