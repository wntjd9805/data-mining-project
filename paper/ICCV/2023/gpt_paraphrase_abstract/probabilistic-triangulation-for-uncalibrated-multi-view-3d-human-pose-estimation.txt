The task of estimating 3D human pose has long been a challenge in computer vision and graphics. While multi-view methods have made significant progress, they are hindered by the laborious calibration processes they require. These existing methods are limited to fixed camera positions and lack the ability to generalize to uncalibrated scenes. This paper introduces a new approach called the Probabilistic Triangulation module, which can be incorporated into a calibrated 3D human pose estimation method to extend its applicability to uncalibrated scenarios.  The main idea behind this module is to utilize a probability distribution to represent the camera pose and update it iteratively using 2D features instead of relying on the camera pose itself. Specifically, a distribution for the camera pose is maintained and updated iteratively by calculating the posterior probability through Monte Carlo sampling. This enables direct back-propagation of gradients from the 3D pose estimation to the 2D heatmap, allowing for end-to-end training.  Extensive experiments conducted on the Human3.6M and CMU Panoptic datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other uncalibration methods and achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art calibration methods. This indicates that our approach strikes a balance between estimation accuracy and generalizability.  The code for our method is available at https://github.com/bymaths/probabilistic triangulation.
