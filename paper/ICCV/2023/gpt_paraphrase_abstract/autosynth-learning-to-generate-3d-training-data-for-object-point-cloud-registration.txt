The quality and quantity of training data are crucial in deep learning, but collecting and annotating real data is challenging and time-consuming. Synthetic datasets are an alternative, but they are limited in categories and require expertise to design. To address this, we propose AutoSynth, a method that automatically generates 3D training data for point cloud registration. AutoSynth curates an optimal dataset by exploring a vast search space of diverse 3D shapes at a low cost. We generate synthetic 3D datasets using shape primitives and use meta-learning to search for the best training data for 3D registration on real point clouds. To make the search manageable, we replace the point cloud registration network with a smaller surrogate network, resulting in a significant speed improvement. We validate our approach by implementing it with two different point cloud registration networks and comparing the performance with the widely used ModelNet40 dataset. Our results demonstrate that a neural network trained on our searched dataset consistently outperforms the one trained on ModelNet40 dataset.
