Generating diverse new images for unseen categories with limited data is a challenging task in few-shot image generation. Existing methods struggle to balance quality and diversity. To address this, we propose Hyperbolic Attribute Editing (HAE), a simple and effective method. HAE operates in hyperbolic space, capturing the hierarchy among images using data from seen categories. By moving the latent code of a given image in the Poincar√© disk with a fixed radius, HAE can generate images of unseen categories. The hyperbolic space enables control over the semantic diversity of the generated images by adjusting the radius. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that HAE can generate high-quality and diverse images with limited data while providing a controllable and interpretable editing process. The code for HAE is available at https://github.com/lingxiao-li/HAE.
