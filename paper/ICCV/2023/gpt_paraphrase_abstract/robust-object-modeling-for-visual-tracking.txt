Recent tracking frameworks have incorporated object modeling as a crucial component. Transformer attention is commonly employed in popular trackers to extract template features either separately or interactively with the search region. However, when template learning is done separately, there is a lack of communication between the template and search regions, leading to difficulties in extracting discriminative target-oriented features. Conversely, interactive template learning generates hybrid template features that may introduce potential distractors from the cluttered search regions. To combine the benefits of both methods, we propose a robust object modeling framework for visual tracking called ROMTrack. This framework simultaneously models the inherent template and hybrid template features, enabling the suppression of harmful distractors by combining the inherent features of target objects with guidance from the search regions. Additionally, the hybrid template allows the extraction of target-related features, resulting in a more resilient object modeling framework. To further enhance robustness, we introduce novel variation tokens that represent the ever-changing appearance of target objects. These variation tokens are adaptable to object deformation and appearance variations, significantly boosting overall performance with minimal computation. Experimental results demonstrate that our ROMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.
