This paper examines the current state of Incremental Learning (IL) methods and highlights the need for a comprehensive evaluation that includes energy consumption and computational load, in addition to accuracy metrics. The authors address the research gap between IL research and industrial projects by introducing a new dataset called InVar-100, which simulates visual environments in industrial setups. They also incorporate explainability using class activations to interpret model predictions. Their approach, RECIL, aims to provide insights into the practical application of IL methods in real-world scenarios, with a focus on energy efficiency. The ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between Incremental Learning and Green AI and promote the use of IL methods in practical settings. The code and dataset used in this study are available for further exploration.
