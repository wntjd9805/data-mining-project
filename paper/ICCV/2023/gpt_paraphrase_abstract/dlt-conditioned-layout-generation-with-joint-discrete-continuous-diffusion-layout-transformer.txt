Generating visual layouts is a crucial aspect of graphic design, particularly in applications involving user interaction. However, applying diffusion models to natural layouts that consist of a combination of discrete (class) and continuous (location, size) attributes presents a challenge. To address this problem, we propose DLT, a transformer-based model that utilizes a flexible conditioning mechanism to generate layouts based on specific subsets of component attributes. Our approach outperforms existing generative models on various layout generation datasets and different conditioning settings. We also validate the effectiveness of our conditioning mechanism and the joint continuous-diffusion process. This process can be applied to a wide range of mixed discrete-continuous generative tasks. For more information, please visit our project webpage: https://wix-incubator.github.io/DLT. Figure 1 provides an overview of our Joint Discrete-Continuous diffusion process for layout generation, where the diffusion process is applied to both the continuous attributes (size and location) and the discrete attributes (class) of the components. The reverse diffusion model can be conditioned on any desired subset of attributes.
