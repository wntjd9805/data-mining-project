Semi-supervised learning (SSL) addresses the issue of missing labels by utilizing unlabeled data effectively. However, current SSL methods mainly focus on traditional settings and neglect a practical and challenging scenario known as label MissingNot At Random (MNAR). MNAR involves labeled and unlabeled data belonging to different class distributions, leading to biased label imputation and a decline in SSL model performance. To tackle this, we propose a method called Pseudo-Rectifying Guidance (PRG) based on class transition tracking for MNAR. PRG utilizes class-level guidance information obtained through Markov random walk on a dynamically created graph constructed from the class tracking matrix. By integrating historical information of class distribution and class transitions, PRG ensures unbiased assignment of pseudo-labels to all classes. This improves the quality of pseudo-labels for both popular and rare classes in MNAR. Our experiments demonstrate the superior performance of PRG compared to the latest SSL approaches that incorporate bias removal solutions. The code and model weights for PRG are available at https://github.com/NJUyued/PRG4SSL-MNAR.
