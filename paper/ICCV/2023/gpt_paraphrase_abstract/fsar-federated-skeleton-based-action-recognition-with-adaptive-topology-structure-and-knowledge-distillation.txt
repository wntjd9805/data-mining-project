Current skeleton-based action recognition methods typically follow a centralized learning approach, which raises privacy concerns when dealing with human-related videos. Federated Learning (FL) has gained attention for its ability to preserve privacy. However, applying FL methods directly to skeleton videos leads to unstable training. In this paper, we identify the heterogeneous human topology graph structure as a key factor hindering training stability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel paradigm called Federated Skeleton-based Action Recognition (FSAR). FSAR allows the construction of a globally generalized model without accessing sensitive local data. We introduce an Adaptive Topology Structure (ATS) that separates generalization and personalization by learning a domain-invariant topology shared across clients, and a domain-specific topology decoupled from global model aggregation. Additionally, we explore Multi-grain Knowledge Distillation (MKD) to align shallow block-wise motion features and mitigate discrepancies between clients and the server caused by distinct updating patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that FSAR surpasses state-of-the-art FL-based methods while ensuring privacy protection.
