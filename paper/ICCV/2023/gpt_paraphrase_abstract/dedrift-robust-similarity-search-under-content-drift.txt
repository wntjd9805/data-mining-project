The distribution of content on media sharing sites changes over time due to various factors. This "content drift" affects the accuracy and efficiency of large-scale similarity search tools. To address this issue, we examine the impact of content drift on nearest neighbor search in embedding space. We study real-world image and video datasets with temporal information and develop DEDRIFT, a method that updates embedding quantizers to adapt indexing structures in real-time. DEDRIFT significantly reduces accuracy degradation caused by content drift and is much faster than full index reconstruction.
