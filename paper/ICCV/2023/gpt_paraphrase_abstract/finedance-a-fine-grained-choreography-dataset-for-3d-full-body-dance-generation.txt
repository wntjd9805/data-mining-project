Generating dance sequences that accurately match music is a difficult task due to limited datasets and the complexity of hand motion and dance genres. To overcome these challenges, we present FineDance, a dataset consisting of 14.6 hours of music-dance pairs with detailed hand motions, 22 dance genres, and precise posture. FineDance is the largest dataset of its kind and addresses the issue of monotonous and unnatural hand movements through a full-body dance generation network. This network utilizes the diffusion model for diverse generation capabilities and expert nets to solve unrealistic movements. To improve genre-matching and long-term stability, we propose a Genre&Coherent aware Retrieval Module. We also introduce a new metric, Genre Matching Score, to evaluate the degree of genre-matching between dance and music. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, we demonstrate the high quality of FineDance and the advanced performance of FineNet. The FineDance Dataset and additional qualitative samples can be accessed on our website.
