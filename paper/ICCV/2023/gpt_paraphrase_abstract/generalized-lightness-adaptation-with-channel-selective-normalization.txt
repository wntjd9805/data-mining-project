Lightness adaptation is crucial for image processing to prevent visual deterioration. However, existing methods often fail to generalize well to unknown lightness conditions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel algorithm called Channel Selective Normalization (CSNorm). CSNorm selectively normalizes lightness-relevant channels while leaving other channels unchanged, improving feature generalization and discrimination. We employ an alternating training strategy to optimize CSNorm, effectively identifying lightness-relevant channels. Our CSNorm-equipped model only needs to be trained on one lightness condition and can be effectively generalized to unknown conditions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CSNorm in enhancing the generalization ability of existing lightness adaptation methods. The code for CSNorm is available at https://github.com/mdyao/CSNorm.
