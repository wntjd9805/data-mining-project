Pseudo-labeling plays a crucial role in semi-supervised instance segmentation, where unannotated images are utilized to generate instance masks and classes for subsequent training. However, the existing pipelines often filter out valuable information in pseudo-labels due to discrepancies in class and mask quality. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new framework called pseudo-label aligning instance segmentation (PAIS). In PAIS, we introduce a dynamic aligning loss (DALoss) that adjusts the weights of semi-supervised loss terms based on class and mask score pairs. Through extensive experiments on the COCO and Cityscapes datasets, we demonstrate that PAIS is a promising framework for semi-supervised instance segmentation, especially when there is a scarcity of labeled data. Notably, even with only 1% labeled data, PAIS achieves impressive mean average precision (mAP) scores of 21.2 (based on Mask-RCNN) and 19.9 (based on K-Net) on the COCO dataset, outperforming the current state-of-the-art model, NoisyBoundary, by a significant margin of over 12 points.
