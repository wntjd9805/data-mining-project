The deployment of deep neural networks for mesh processing is becoming increasingly popular. However, these networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can impair their functionality. It is important to explore these vulnerabilities in order to develop secure 3D-based applications. Previous research has focused on semantic-level attacks, but mesh surfaces have complex geometric attributes that also need to be considered. We propose a novel framework for a geometric adversarial attack on a 3D mesh autoencoder. This involves using an adversarial input mesh to deceive the autoencoder into reconstructing a different geometric shape. Our method perturbs a clean shape in the spectral domain, leveraging the spectral decomposition of the mesh and other mesh-related properties to produce visually credible results that consider the delicacy of surface distortions.
