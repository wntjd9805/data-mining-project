This paper presents a new framework for estimating optical flow that achieves a good trade-off between performance and efficiency. The proposed approach separates global motion learning from local flow estimation, treating them as distinct stages. The authors offer two key insights: firstly, the computationally expensive multi-scale 4D cost-volume based recurrent flow decoder is unnecessary for handling small displacements, allowing for the use of lightweight methods in both stages without sacrificing performance. Secondly, they emphasize the importance of dense and robust global matching for flow initialization and fast convergence during refinement. To address this, they introduce the EMD-Flow framework, which explicitly separates global motion estimation from the refinement stage. Two novel modules, Multi-scale Motion Aggregation (MMA) and Confidence-induced Flow Propagation (CFP), are proposed to handle the challenges of dense matching in a global manner and generate a dense initial flow. A lightweight decoding module is also incorporated to handle small displacements, resulting in an efficient yet reliable flow estimation framework. Comprehensive experiments on standard optical flow benchmarks demonstrate the superior balance between performance and runtime of the proposed framework.
