The demand for an authentic face restoration system is increasing in various computer vision applications such as image enhancement, video communication, and portrait photography. While advanced face restoration models can recover high-quality faces from low-quality ones, they often fail to generate realistic and detailed features that users prefer. To address this issue, we propose IDM, an Iteratively learned face restoration system based on denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs). We define the criteria for an authentic face restoration system and argue that denoising diffusion models possess this property due to their intrinsic iterative refinement and extrinsic iterative enhancement. Intrinsic learning preserves the content and gradually refines high-quality details, while extrinsic enhancement cleans the data and further improves the restoration process. Our approach demonstrates superior performance in blind face restoration tasks. Furthermore, we find that the authentically cleaned data obtained from our restoration system is beneficial for image generation tasks in terms of training stabilization and sample quality. Without modifying the models, we achieve better results than state-of-the-art methods in FFHQ and ImageNet generation using either GANs or diffusion models.
