We propose Dataset Reinforcement, a strategy that enhances the accuracy of models trained on a dataset without requiring additional training. Our strategy combines data augmentation and knowledge distillation, based on extensive analysis of CNN and transformer models. We create reinforced versions of ImageNet, CIFAR-100, Flowers-102, and Food-101 datasets. Models trained on the reinforced ImageNet dataset show improved accuracy, robustness, and calibration, with better performance in tasks like segmentation and detection. For example, ResNet-50's accuracy improves by 1.7% on ImageNet validation set, 3.5% on ImageNetV2, and 10.0% on ImageNet-R. The Expected Calibration Error also reduces by 9.9%. Object detection using Mask-RCNN on MS-COCO dataset shows a mean average precision improvement of 0.8%. Similar gains are observed for MobileNets, ViTs, and Swin-Transformers. MobileNetV3 and Swin-Tiny models exhibit up to 20% improved robustness on ImageNet-R/A/C. Additionally, models pretrained on reinforced ImageNet and fine-tuned on CIFAR-100, Flowers-102, and Food-101 achieve up to 3.4% improved accuracy.
