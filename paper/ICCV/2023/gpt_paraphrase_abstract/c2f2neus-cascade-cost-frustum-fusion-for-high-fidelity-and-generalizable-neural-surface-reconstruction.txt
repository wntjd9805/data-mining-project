This paper presents a novel integration scheme that combines the multi-view stereo (MVS) framework with neural implicit surface (NIS) representations, specifically focusing on the few-shot/sparse view setting. The proposed method overcomes the limitations of both MVS and NIS by utilizing per-view depth estimation and cross-view fusion from MVS, as well as a common coordinate volume from NIS. To improve geometry estimation, the method constructs per-view cost frustums and fuses cross-view frustums to estimate implicit signed distance functions, addressing artifacts caused by noise and holes in surface reconstruction. A cascade frustum fusion strategy is applied to capture global-local information and ensure structural consistency. Additionally, cascade sampling and a pseudo-geometric loss are used to strengthen integration between the two frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves robust surface reconstruction and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.
