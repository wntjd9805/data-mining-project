Current out-of-distribution (OOD) detection methods have made progress in identifying OOD samples in static distributions. However, these methods are not applicable to real-world systems that experience continuous variations in distributions. To address this, we propose a continuously adaptive out-of-distribution (CAOOD) detection model that can quickly adapt to new arriving distributions. We develop meta OOD learning (MOL) to learn a well-initialized OOD detection model during the training process. In testing, MOL ensures OOD detection performance by adapting to new distributions with a few adjustments. Extensive experiments on various OOD benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in maintaining ID classification accuracy and OOD detection performance in continuously shifting distributions.
