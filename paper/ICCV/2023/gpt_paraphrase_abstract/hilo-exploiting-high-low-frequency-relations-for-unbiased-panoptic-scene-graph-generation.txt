Panoptic Scene Graph generation (PSG) is a recently introduced task in image scene comprehension that aims to segment the image and extract triplets of subjects, objects, and their relationships to create a scene graph. This task presents two main challenges. Firstly, there is a long-tail problem in the distribution of relation categories, where biased methods tend to favor high-frequency relations. To address this, existing unbiased methods rebalance the data/loss to prioritize low-frequency relations. Secondly, a subject-object pair can have multiple semantically overlapping relationships. While existing methods favor one relationship over the others, our proposed HiLo framework allows different branches of the network to specialize in low and high frequency relations, ensuring consistency and combining the results. We believe we are the first to propose an explicitly unbiased PSG method. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our HiLo framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PSG task. Additionally, we apply our method to the Scene Graph Generation task, which predicts boxes instead of masks, and observe improvements compared to all baseline methods. The code for our framework is available at https://github.com/franciszzj/HiLo.
