In this study, we introduce a novel approach called Hierarchical Prior Mining for Non-local Multi-View Stereo (HPM-MVS) to address the problem of recovering 3D geometry from a set of 2D images in computer vision. We highlight the importance of considering non-local structured information in low-textured areas for accurate geometry recovery. To leverage non-local information, we propose several techniques within our HPM-MVS framework. First, we introduce a Non-local Extensible Sampling Pattern (NESP) that allows us to adaptively adjust the size of sampled areas, avoiding locally optimal solutions. This enables us to capture more comprehensive information during the stereo matching process. Second, we propose a new method to exploit non-local reliable points and construct a planar prior model using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) approach. This helps us generate potential hypotheses for regions where prior construction is challenging, enhancing the accuracy of the 3D model reconstruction.Finally, our HPM framework enables us to mine extensive non-local prior information at different scales, aiding in the recovery of 3D models. This approach strikes a balance between capturing fine details and handling low-textured areas, resulting in improved performance.We validate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on benchmark datasets, ETH3D and Tanks & Temples. The results demonstrate superior performance and strong generalization capability. To facilitate further research and implementation, we provide the code for our method on GitHub (https://github.com/CLinvx/HPM-MVS).
