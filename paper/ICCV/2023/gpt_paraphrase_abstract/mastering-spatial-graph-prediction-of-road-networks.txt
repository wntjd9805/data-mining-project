To accurately predict road networks from satellite images, a comprehensive understanding of the network's structure is necessary. In this study, we propose a graph-based framework that incrementally adds new edges to a partially generated graph, capturing high-level information about the network topology. To address misalignment issues and optimize complex, non-continuous metrics, we employ a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that suggests modifications to maximize a cumulative reward. Unlike standard supervised techniques that are limited to commonly used surrogate losses, our framework offers more flexibility to encode problem-specific knowledge. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate improved performance and enhanced reasoning about the graph topology when utilizing a tree-based search. Additionally, our approach outperforms others in handling occluded examples and produces predictions that align better with the statistical properties of the ground dataset.
