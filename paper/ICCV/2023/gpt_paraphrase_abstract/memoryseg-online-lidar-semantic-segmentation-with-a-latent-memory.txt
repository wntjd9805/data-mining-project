Many studies have focused on semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds using a single scan of the environment. However, leveraging the temporal stream of observations can provide valuable contextual information in regions with poor visibility or sparse observations, and also reduce redundant computation. This paper introduces a new framework that exploits information from past frames to improve predictions in real-time. The framework utilizes a memory network to store, update, and retrieve past information, and incorporates a regularizer to penalize prediction variations in the neighborhood of the point cloud. Previous methods incorporating memory in range view representations have failed to handle occlusions and changes in the scene as nearby agents move. In contrast, our framework builds a sparse 3D latent representation of the surroundings, overcoming these limitations. The proposed framework is evaluated on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods.
