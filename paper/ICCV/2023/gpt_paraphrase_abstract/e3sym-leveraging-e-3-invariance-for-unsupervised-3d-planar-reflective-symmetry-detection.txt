Detecting symmetrical properties is a fundamental task in analyzing 3D shapes. When dealing with a 3D model that exhibits planar symmetries, each point has a corresponding mirror point in relation to a symmetry plane, and these correspondences remain unchanged regardless of any Euclidean transformation. Our proposed method, E3Sym, aims to detect planar reflective symmetry in an unsupervised and end-to-end manner by utilizing E(3) invariance. E3Sym establishes strong point correspondences by extracting E(3) invariant features from a lightweight neural network, which are then used to predict dense symmetries. We also introduce a new and efficient clustering algorithm to aggregate the dense predictions and identify sets of detected symmetries. This allows for the detection of any number of planar symmetries while ensuring differentiability for end-to-end training. Additionally, our method can infer reasonable planar symmetries from incomplete shapes, which is a challenging task for existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that E3Sym is highly effective and robust, surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art methods.
