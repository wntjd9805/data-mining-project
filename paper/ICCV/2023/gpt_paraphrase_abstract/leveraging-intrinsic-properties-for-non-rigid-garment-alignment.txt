We propose a novel method for aligning real-world 3D garment data, which has applications in texture learning, physical parameter estimation, and generative modeling. Current methods struggle to align details due to incorrect matches and rigid constraints. Intrinsic methods based on functional maps produce high-quality correspondences but are unreliable for non-isometric garment deformations. To address this, we present a two-stage method that combines intrinsic manifold properties with neural deformation fields in both 3D and intrinsic spaces. The coarse stage uses intrinsic properties to define a manifold deformation field, which is refined with a second neural deformation field for higher accuracy. We evaluate our method using our captured garment dataset and achieve accurate alignment for wrinkle-level and texture-level details, even for difficult garment types like long coats.
