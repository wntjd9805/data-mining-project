This paper presents a new approach for performing single-view 3D style transfer, specifically focusing on birds. Existing methods for single-view 3D transfer do not cover birds, so our proposed method aims to generate a unique 3D object with both shape and texture transfer using two single-view images. We introduce a shape transfer generator consisting of a dual residual gated network (DRGNet) and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The DRGNet extracts image features using a shared coordinate gate unit, while the MLP generates spatial coordinates for constructing a 3D mesh. Additionally, we introduce a semantic UV texture transfer module that utilizes semantic UV segmentation to ensure consistency in the meaning of transferred regions. This module can be adapted to other approaches. Finally, our method constructs a novel 3D bird using a differentiable renderer. Experimental results on the CUB dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-view 3D style transfer. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/wrk226/creative_birds.
