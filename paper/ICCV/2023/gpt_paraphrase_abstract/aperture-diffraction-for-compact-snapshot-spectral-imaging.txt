We present a compact and cost-effective imaging system called Aperture Diffraction Imaging Spectrometer (ADIS). This system uses an imaging lens with an ultra-thin orthogonal aperture mask and a mosaic filter sensor, requiring no additional physical space compared to regular RGB cameras. We introduce a novel optical design where each point in the object space is multiplexed to discrete encoding locations on the mosaic filter sensor using diffraction-based spatial-spectral projection engineering. The orthogonal projection ensures a weakly calibration-dependent data format, enhancing modulation robustness. To address the issue of diffraction degeneration, we propose the Cascade Shift-Shuffle Spectral Transformer (CSST), which is capable of solving a sparsity-constrained inverse problem and reconstructing volume from 2D measurements with a large amount of aliasing. We evaluate our system by explaining the imaging optical theory and reconstruction algorithm, and we demonstrate experimental imaging results achieved through a single exposure. Our system achieves sub-super-pixel spatial resolution and high spectral resolution imaging. The code for our system is available at https://github.com/Krito-ex/CSST.
