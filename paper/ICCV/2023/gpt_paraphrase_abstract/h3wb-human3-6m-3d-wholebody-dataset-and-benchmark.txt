We introduce a benchmark for accurately estimating the 3D pose of the entire human body, including face, hands, body, and feet. Currently, deep networks are trained separately on specific body parts due to the lack of a fully annotated 3D whole-body dataset. To address this issue, we present the Human3.6M 3D WholeBody (H3WB) dataset, which provides whole-body annotations using the COCO Wholebody layout. The dataset includes 133 whole-body keypoint annotations on 100K images, made possible by our new multi-view pipeline. We propose three tasks: lifting 3D whole-body pose from 2D complete or incomplete poses, and estimating 3D whole-body pose from a single RGB image. We also report baselines from popular methods for these tasks. Additionally, we provide automated 3D whole-body annotations for the TotalCapture dataset and experimentally demonstrate that when used with H3WB, it improves performance.
