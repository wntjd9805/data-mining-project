We introduce NeRF-Det, a new approach for indoor 3D detection using RGB images. Unlike existing methods, our approach effectively models scene geometry by leveraging NeRF in an end-to-end manner. By incorporating geometry priors and connecting the detection and NeRF branches through a shared MLP, we improve the generalizability of NeRF-MLP and generate geometry-aware volumetric representations for 3D detection. Our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches on the ScanNet and ARKITScenes benchmarks. We provide detailed analysis to explain the workings of NeRF-Det, which can generalize well to unseen scenes for object detection, view synthesis, and depth estimation tasks without the need for per-scene optimization. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/NeRF-Det.
