Deep learning has achieved impressive results in medical imaging classification tasks, largely due to the availability of large-scale datasets with manually annotated clean labels. However, manual annotation is expensive, so new medical imaging classification problems may have to rely on machine-generated noisy labels extracted from radiology reports. Although many Chest X-Ray (CXR) classifiers have been developed using datasets with noisy labels, their training procedures are generally not robust to noisy-label samples, resulting in suboptimal models. Additionally, CXR datasets are mostly multi-label, making it difficult to adapt current multi-class noisy-label learning methods.   In this study, we propose a novel approach for noisy multi-label CXR learning. Our method detects and re-labels noisy samples in the dataset to be used in training common multi-label classifiers. We optimize a bag of multi-label descriptors (BoMD) to enhance their similarity with semantic descriptors generated by language models from multi-label image annotations. Our experiments on noisy multi-label training sets and clean testing sets demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness in various CXR multi-label classification benchmarks, including a new benchmark we propose to systematically evaluate noisy multi-label methods.
