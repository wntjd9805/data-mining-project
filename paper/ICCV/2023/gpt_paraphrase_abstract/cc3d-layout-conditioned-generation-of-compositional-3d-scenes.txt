This work presents CC3D, a novel conditional generative model that can generate complex 3D scenes based on 2D semantic scene layouts using single-view images. Unlike existing 3D GANs that focus on single objects, CC3D is designed to generate scenes with multiple objects by considering the compositional nature of 3D scenes. The approach employs a 2D layout-based method for 3D synthesis and incorporates a new 3D field representation with a stronger geometric bias. This results in an efficient and high-quality 3D GAN that allows for more control over the generation process. Evaluation on synthetic 3D-FRONT and real-world KITTI-360 datasets demonstrates that CC3D generates scenes with superior visual and geometric quality compared to previous works.
