This paper aims to go beyond a one-dimensional scale of skin tone to measure apparent skin color in computer vision. The authors highlight the bias against women with darker skin tones in gender classification systems, as demonstrated in the Gender Shades study by Buolamwini and Gebru. To evaluate skin color bias in computer vision systems, researchers and practitioners have commonly used the Fitzpatrick skin type classification. However, this scale only focuses on the range of skin tone from light to dark. To provide a more comprehensive measure, the authors introduce the hue angle, which ranges from red to yellow. By applying this hue dimension to images, they uncover additional biases related to skin color in computer vision datasets and models. In order to assess fairness, the authors propose multidimensional skin color scales that consider both skin tone and hue.
