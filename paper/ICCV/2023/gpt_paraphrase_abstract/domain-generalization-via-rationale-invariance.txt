This paper presents a novel approach to address the challenge of domain generalization, which involves maintaining reliable results in unseen environments. The focus of our design is on the decision-making process in the final classifier layer. Our proposal involves considering the element-wise contributions to the final results as the rationale for decision-making and representing this rationale for each sample as a matrix. We argue that for a well-generalized model, the rationale matrices for samples belonging to the same category should be similar, indicating that the model relies on domain-invariant clues to make decisions and thereby ensuring robust results. To implement this concept, we introduce a rationale invariance loss as a simple regularization technique that only requires a few lines of code. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that this approach achieves competitive results across various datasets, despite its simplicity.
