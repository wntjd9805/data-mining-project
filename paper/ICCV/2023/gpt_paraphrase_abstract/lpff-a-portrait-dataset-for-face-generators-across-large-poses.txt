The performance of existing face generators is excellent for small to medium poses, but they struggle to produce realistic results for large poses. The distorted rendering results of 3D-aware generators indicate that the generated 3D face shapes are not representative of real 3D faces. These issues stem from the pose imbalance in the training dataset. To address this, we introduce LPFF, a high-quality dataset consisting of 19,590 real large-pose portrait images from Flickr. We use this dataset to train a 2D face generator capable of processing large-pose face images, as well as a 3D-aware generator that can generate realistic human face geometry. Additionally, we propose a new FID measure to evaluate the 3D-level performance of pose-conditional 3D-aware generators. Through this measure and other experiments, we demonstrate that LPFF enables 2D face generators to expand their latent space and better handle large-pose data, while also improving view consistency and achieving more realistic 3D reconstruction results for 3D-aware face generators.
