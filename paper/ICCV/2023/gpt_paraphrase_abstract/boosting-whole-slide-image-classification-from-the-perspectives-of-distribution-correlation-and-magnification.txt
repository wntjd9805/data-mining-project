This study addresses three important issues in bag-based multiple instance learning (MIL) methods for Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification. Firstly, it tackles the problem of positive bags with a low positive instance ratio being influenced by a large number of negative instances. Secondly, it aims to fully model the correlation between local and global features of pathology images. Lastly, it focuses on the lack of effective information interaction between different magnifications.   To address the first issue, the researchers propose a bag filter that effectively increases the positive instance ratio of positive bags. For the second issue, they introduce a novel window-based Transformer architecture called PiceBlock to model the correlation between local and global features of pathology images. Lastly, they propose a dual-branch architecture to process different magnifications and design an information interaction module called Scale Mixer for efficient information interaction between them.  The researchers conducted extensive experiments on four clinical WSI classification tasks using three datasets. The proposed MILBooster framework achieved new state-of-the-art performance on all these tasks. The codes for MILBooster will be made available at https://github.com/miccaiif/MILBooster.
