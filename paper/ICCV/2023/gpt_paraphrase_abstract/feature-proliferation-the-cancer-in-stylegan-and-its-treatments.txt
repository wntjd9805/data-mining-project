Despite the success of StyleGAN in generating images, the quality of the synthesized images is not always perfect. The truncation trick, a commonly used post-processing technique, is effective in improving image quality but has a drawback of reducing the diversity of synthesized images and sacrificing distinct image features. To address this issue, this paper explores the mechanism of StyleGAN and discovers a phenomenon called Feature Proliferation, which describes how specific features reproduce during the image synthesis process. It is likened to "cancer" due to its proliferating and malignant nature, causing image artifacts in StyleGAN. To mitigate Feature Proliferation, the paper proposes a novel feature rescaling method that identifies and adjusts risky features. Unlike the truncation trick, the proposed method operates in a lower-level feature space, preserving more useful image features and being less destructive. Experimental results support the validity of the claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature rescaling method.
