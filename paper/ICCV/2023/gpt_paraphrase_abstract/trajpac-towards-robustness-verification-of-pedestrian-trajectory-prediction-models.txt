Developing safe autonomous vehicles requires robust pedestrian trajectory forecasting. However, previous studies on trajectory forecasting have not fully addressed important issues. This work aims to tackle these problems by providing formal definitions for two types of robustness: label robustness and pure robustness. Additionally, we propose a probably approximately correct (PAC) framework for robustness verification, which considers all points in a disturbance interval. This framework not only identifies potential counterexamples but also offers interpretable analyses of existing methods. To demonstrate our approach, we utilize a prototype tool called TRAJPAC. Using TRAJPAC, we assess the robustness of four state-of-the-art trajectory prediction models (Trajectron++, MemoNet, AgentFormer, and MID) on trajectories from the ETH/UCY dataset and the Stanford Drone Dataset. Furthermore, we experimentally investigate various factors that could impact robustness performance.
