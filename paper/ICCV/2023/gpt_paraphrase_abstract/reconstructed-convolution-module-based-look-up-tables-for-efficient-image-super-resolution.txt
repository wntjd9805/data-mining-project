LUT-based methods have been effective in single image super-resolution (SR) tasks. However, these methods have overlooked the limited receptive field (RF) size in LUT, which is caused by the interaction of space and channel features in vanilla convolution. Increasing the RF size typically requires a linear increase in LUT size. To address this issue, we propose a new Reconstructed Convolution (RC) module that separates channel-wise and spatial calculations. This module utilizes n2 1D LUTs to maintain an n × n receptive field, which is significantly smaller than the previously used n × nD LUTs. Our RC module generates a LUT with less than 1/10000 storage compared to the SR-LUT baseline. The proposed RC-LUT method can enlarge the RF size by 9 times compared to the current state-of-the-art LUT-based SR method, and it achieves superior performance on five benchmark datasets. Additionally, the efficient and robust RC module can be integrated as a plugin to enhance other LUT-based SR methods. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/liuguandu/RC-LUT.
