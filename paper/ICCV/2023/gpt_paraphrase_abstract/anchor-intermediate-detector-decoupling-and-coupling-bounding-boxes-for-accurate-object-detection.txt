Anchor-based object detection methods have been widely used, but accurately predicting the boundary offset of each individual anchor box is challenging. This paper introduces a new strategy called Box Decouple-Couple (BDC) that utilizes multiple boxes to generate prediction boxes instead of treating each box as an independent entity. The BDC strategy decouples the corner points of overlapping boxes and selects the most accurate corner pairs based on their scores. To implement this strategy, a novel model called the Anchor-Intermediate Detector (AID) is proposed, which consists of two head networks: an anchor-based head and an anchor-free Corner-aware head. The Corner-aware head assigns scores to the corners of each bounding box to facilitate the coupling of corner points. Experimental results on the MSCOCO dataset demonstrate that the proposed AID method outperforms the baseline RetinaNet and GFL methods by approximately 2.4 and 1.2 average precision (AP) respectively, without any additional enhancements.
