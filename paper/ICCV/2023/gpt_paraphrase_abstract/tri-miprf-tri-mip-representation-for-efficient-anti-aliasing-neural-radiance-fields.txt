The trade-off between quality and efficiency is a challenge in neural radiance fields (NeRF). While some methods offer detailed renderings, they require days for training, while others provide quick reconstructions but suffer from blurring or aliasing. To address this issue, we propose a novel Tri-Mip encoding that combines instant reconstruction with anti-aliased high-fidelity rendering. By factorizing the 3D feature spaces into three orthogonal mipmaps, we can efficiently perform 3D area sampling using 2D pre-filtered feature maps. This approach significantly improves rendering quality without sacrificing efficiency. We also introduce a cone-casting rendering technique that samples anti-aliased 3D features with the Tri-Mip encoding, considering both pixel imaging and observing distance. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and reconstruction speed while reducing the model size by 25% compared to Instant-ngp. The code for our method is available at the project webpage: https://wbhu.github.io/projects/Tri-MipRF.
