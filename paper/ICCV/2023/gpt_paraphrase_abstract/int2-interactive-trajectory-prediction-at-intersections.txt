Motion forecasting is a crucial aspect of autonomous driving systems. One of the most difficult problems in motion forecasting is predicting the future trajectories of interacting agents. To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset called INT2, which focuses on interactive trajectory prediction at intersections. INT2 consists of 612,000 scenes, each lasting 1 minute, and contains a massive amount of data totaling up to 10,200 hours. The agent trajectories in the dataset are labeled using a high-performance offline temporal detection and fusion algorithm, with additional inspection by human judges to ensure quality. The dataset also includes vectorized semantic maps and traffic light information. Notably, INT2 presents an interesting challenge of domain mismatch, as rush-hour and non-rush-hour segments within each intersection are treated as different domains. We evaluate the performance of the best open-sourced interactive trajectory prediction method on INT2 and Waymo Open Motion, considering both in-domain and cross-domain settings. The dataset, as well as the code and models used, are publicly accessible on GitHub.
