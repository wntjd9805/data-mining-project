The study introduces a benchmark dataset called X-VoE that evaluates the understanding of intuitive physics in AI agents. This dataset is based on the Violation of Expectation (VoE) paradigm from developmental psychology and sets a higher standard for assessing intuitive physics models. Each scenario in X-VoE consists of three settings that test the models' comprehension of events and their explanations. In addition to model evaluation, the study presents a learning system that captures physics dynamics and infers hidden object states from visual sequences without explicit labels. Experimental results show that the model aligns with human common sense and can visually explain VoE events by reconstructing hidden scenes. The implications of the findings are discussed, and future research directions are outlined. Overall, X-VoE aims to advance AI with human-like intuitive physics capabilities.
