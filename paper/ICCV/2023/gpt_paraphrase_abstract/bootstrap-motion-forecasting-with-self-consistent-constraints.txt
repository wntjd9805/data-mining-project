We introduce a new framework called MISC (Motion forecasting with Self-consistent Constraints) for predicting future vehicle trajectories. MISC incorporates spatial and temporal information from the past to improve accuracy. One key aspect of MISC is the Dual Consistency Constraints, which regulate predicted trajectories by considering spatial and temporal perturbations during training. Additionally, we address the challenge of modeling multi-modality in motion forecasting by implementing a self-ensembling scheme that provides accurate teacher targets, enabling self-constraints with multi-modality supervision. By incorporating explicit constraints from multiple teacher targets, we observe notable enhancements in prediction performance. Our extensive experiments on the Argoverse motion forecasting benchmark and WaymoOpen Motion dataset demonstrate that MISC outperforms existing methods significantly. Furthermore, we show that our proposed strategies can be easily integrated into other motion forecasting approaches, consistently improving their prediction performance.
