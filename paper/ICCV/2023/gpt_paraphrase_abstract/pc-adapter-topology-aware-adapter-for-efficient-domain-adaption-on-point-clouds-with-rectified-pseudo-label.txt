Understanding point clouds captured from the real world is difficult due to shifts in data distribution caused by variations in object scales, sensor angles, and self-occlusion. Previous approaches have used self-supervised learning, self-training, and adversarial training to address this issue, but these methods are computationally expensive. To overcome this, we focus on the challenges of point cloud data in domain shift scenarios and highlight the importance of the global geometry of the source data and the trends of target pseudo-labels, which are biased towards the source label distribution. Based on our findings, we propose a domain adaptation method called PC-Adapter, which preserves the global shape information of the source domain using an attention-based adapter, while learning the local characteristics of the target domain through another adapter equipped with graph convolution. We also introduce a novel pseudo-labeling strategy that adjusts confidence scores using class-wise confidence distributions to consider relative confidences and mitigate classifier bias. Our method outperforms baseline approaches on benchmark datasets such as PointDA, GraspNetPC, and PointSegDA in various domain shift scenarios.
