We present a novel framework called DiffusionDet that addresses object detection by utilizing a denoising diffusion process. This process involves transforming noisy boxes into accurate object boxes. In the training stage, the model learns to reverse the diffusion process by allowing object boxes to diffuse from ground-truth boxes to a random distribution. During inference, the model refines a set of randomly generated boxes in a progressive manner to produce the final output results. One notable feature of our approach is its flexibility, which allows for the dynamic generation of boxes and iterative evaluation. Extensive experiments conducted on standard benchmarks demonstrate that DiffusionDet outperforms established detectors. For instance, when evaluated with more boxes and iteration steps in a zero-shot transfer setting from COCO to CrowdHuman, DiffusionDet achieves AP gains of 5.3 and 4.8.
