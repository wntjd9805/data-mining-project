This paper introduces a new way of representing hand-object interaction called ContactGen. ContactGen consists of three components: a contact map, a part map, and a direction map. The contact map shows the location of contact between the hand and the object, the part map indicates which part of the hand is in contact, and the direction map reveals the direction of contact within each part. To predict ContactGen for a given object, we propose a conditional generative model and utilize model-based optimization to generate a range of feasible grasps. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating diverse and realistic human grasps for different objects.
