The paper introduces a new algorithm called Sim-MatchV2 for semi-supervised image classification in computer vision. The algorithm focuses on consistency regularizations between labeled and unlabeled data from a graph perspective. It treats the augmented view of a sample as a node, where each node contains a label and its corresponding representation. Nodes are connected by edges based on the similarity of their representations. The algorithm proposes four types of consistencies: node-node, node-edge, edge-edge, and edge-node. Additionally, feature normalization is found to be effective in reducing gaps in feature norms between different augmented views, improving the algorithm's performance. Sim-MatchV2 is evaluated on various semi-supervised learning benchmarks and achieves state-of-the-art performance on ImageNet with 1% and 10% labeled examples.
