We present a new approach to interactive class-agnostic object counting, where a human user can provide feedback to improve the accuracy of a counter. Our framework consists of a user-friendly visualizer for gathering feedback and an efficient mechanism for incorporating it. In each iteration, we generate a density map to display the current prediction result and segment it into non-overlapping regions with a verifiable number of objects. The user can give feedback by selecting a region with counting errors and specifying the estimated range of objects within it. To enhance the counting result, we introduce an adaptation loss that encourages the visual counter to output a predicted count within the user-specified range. For effective adaptation, we propose a refinement module that can be used with any density-based visual counter, and only the parameters in the refinement module are updated during adaptation. Our experiments on two challenging class-agnostic object counting benchmarks, FSCD-LVIS and FSC-147, demonstrate that our method can reduce the mean absolute error of several state-of-the-art visual counters by approximately 30% to 40% with minimal user input.
