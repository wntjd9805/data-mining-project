The Deep Image Prior (DIP) has revealed that certain network architectures naturally produce smooth images and are resistant to noise, known as spectral bias. This property makes DIP suitable for image denoising. However, there are two practical challenges to consider: architectural design and noise fitting. Current methods rely on manual design or extensive search to find suitable architectures due to a limited understanding of how architectural choices impact denoising outcomes. In this study, we demonstrate that unlearnt upsampling is the primary factor driving the denoising effect in DIP from a frequency perspective. This discovery allows for the identification of appropriate architectures for each image without the need for laborious search. Extensive experiments show that these estimated architectures outperform existing methods with significantly fewer parameters, up to 95% reduction. This under-parameterization makes the resulting architectures less susceptible to noise fitting.
