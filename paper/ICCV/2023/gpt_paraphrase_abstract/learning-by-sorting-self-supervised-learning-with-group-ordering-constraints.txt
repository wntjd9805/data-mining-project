Contrastive learning, which aims to learn representations from unlabeled data, relies on minimizing the distance between positive data pairs (e.g., views from the same images) and maximizing the distance between negative data pairs (e.g., views from different images). This study introduces a new approach called Group Ordering Constraints (GroCo) that improves upon the contrastive learning objective. GroCo leverages the idea of sorting the distances of positive and negative pairs and computes the loss based on the number of positive pairs with a larger distance than the negative pairs, indicating incorrect ordering. The GroCo loss is based on differentiable sorting networks, allowing training with sorting supervision by matching a differentiable permutation matrix to a ground truth permutation matrix. By applying this method to groupwise pre-ordered inputs of multiple positive and negative pairs, the GroCo loss emphasizes strong positives and negatives, leading to better optimization of the local neighborhood. The proposed formulation is evaluated on various self-supervised learning benchmarks and demonstrates improved results compared to traditional contrastive learning, competitive performance in linear probing, and outperforms existing methods in k-NN performance.
