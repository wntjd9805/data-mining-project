We propose a novel few-shot anomaly detection strategy for industrial scenarios that addresses the issues of data efficiency and generalization across products. Existing methods are often data-hungry and limited to one-model-one-category, which limits their effectiveness. Our approach involves using a few normal samples as a reference to reconstruct the normal version of a defective query sample. We achieve this through a regression with distribution regularization technique that optimally transforms support to query features, ensuring the reconstructed result is visually similar to the query sample while maintaining the properties of normal samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches in terms of image and pixel-level AUROC performances in 2 to 8-shot scenarios. Remarkably, even with a small number of training samples (less than 8 samples), our method achieves competitive performance compared to vanilla AD methods trained with extensive normal samples. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/FzJun26th/FastRecon.
