Despite the growth of the 3D point cloud generation community, there is still a lack of effective methods for intuitive user control in the generation process. This limitation hinders the overall usefulness of these methods. To address this, we propose a solution called DiffFacto. DiffFacto is a new probabilistic generative model that learns the distribution of shapes with part-level control. Our approach involves decomposing shapes into parts, as this provides an intuitive way of controlling the generation process. We introduce a factorization technique that models independent part style and part configuration distributions. Additionally, we present a unique cross diffusion network that enables us to generate coherent and plausible shapes based on our proposed factorization. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is capable of generating novel shapes with multiple axes of control. It achieves state-of-the-art part-level generation quality and produces plausible and coherent shapes. Furthermore, our approach facilitates various downstream editing applications such as shape interpolation, mixing, and transformation editing.
