A predictive method for body adaptation benefits in a set of unlabelled inputs is discussed in this study. Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) involves updating an image classification system incrementally with new classes in each learning session. Previous approaches to CIL have updated both the classification head and feature extractor body in each session. This research introduces a baseline method called First Session Adaptation (FSA) to evaluate the effectiveness of existing CIL approaches and assess the contributions of head and body adaptation. FSA only adapts the pre-trained neural network body in the first learning session and keeps it fixed thereafter, while a head based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is added on top of the adapted body for exact updates through CIL. FSA does not rely on memorizing examples from previous sessions. The efficacy of FSA is demonstrated through experiments on 22 image classification datasets, considering different heads and body adaptation techniques in high/low-shot offline scenarios. Results show that the LDA head performs well and supports CIL without additional modifications. Featurewise Layer Modulation (FiLM) adapters are found to be highly effective in few-shot settings, while full-body adaptation is preferable in high-shot settings. Various CIL settings, including high-shot and few-shot, are empirically investigated and FSA is shown to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in 15 out of 16 settings. FSA with FiLM adapters particularly excels in few-shot scenarios. These findings suggest that current approaches to continuous body adaptation are not yielding expected results. Additionally, a proposed measure is introduced, but no details about the measure are provided in the abstract.
