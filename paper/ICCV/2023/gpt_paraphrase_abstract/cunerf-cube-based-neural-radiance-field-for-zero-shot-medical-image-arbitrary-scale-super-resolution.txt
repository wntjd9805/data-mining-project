Cube-based Neural Radiance Field (CuNeRF) is a novel framework for medical image arbitrary-scale super-resolution (MI-ASSR) that addresses the limitations of existing methods. These limitations include the reliance on high-resolution (HR) volumes and limited generalization ability. CuNeRF overcomes these limitations by generating medical images at arbitrary scales and free viewpoints in a continuous domain without the need for HR volumes.  Unlike existing methods, CuNeRF does not require knowledge of the corresponding HR volume. Instead, it focuses on building a continuous volumetric representation from each low-resolution (LR) volume. This is achieved through differentiable modules, including cube-based sampling, isotropic volume rendering, and cube-based hierarchical rendering.  Extensive experiments on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) modalities demonstrate that CuNeRF can synthesize high-quality super-resolution (SR) medical images. CuNeRF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing images with better visual verisimilitude and fewer artifacts. Additionally, CuNeRF is more applicable in practical scenarios compared to existing methods.  In summary, CuNeRF is a zero-shot MI-ASSR framework that enables the generation of high-quality SR medical images at arbitrary scales and viewpoints. It overcomes limitations of existing methods and demonstrates superior performance in terms of visual quality and applicability.
