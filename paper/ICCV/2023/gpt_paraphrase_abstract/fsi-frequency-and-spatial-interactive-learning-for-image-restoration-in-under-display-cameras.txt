Under-display camera (UDC) systems aim to eliminate the screen notch and provide a more immersive user experience. However, the use of light-emitting diodes in the display causes diffraction and degradation of the incident light, posing a significant challenge. Existing models address this issue by focusing on spatial diffraction and neglecting the periodic distribution of diffraction in the frequency domain, which leads to unsatisfactory results. This paper presents a novel approach called Frequency and Spatial Interactive Learning Network (FSI) to effectively handle diffraction in UDC images. The FSI incorporates Frequency-Spatial Joint (FSJ) modules for feature learning and a color transform module for color enhancement. The FSJ module includes a frequency learning block that utilizes Fourier transform to eliminate spectral bias, a spatial learning block that uses a multi-distillation structure to compensate for the lack of local details, and a dual transfer unit to facilitate interactive learning between different domains. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on three commonly used UDC benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FSI over existing models.
