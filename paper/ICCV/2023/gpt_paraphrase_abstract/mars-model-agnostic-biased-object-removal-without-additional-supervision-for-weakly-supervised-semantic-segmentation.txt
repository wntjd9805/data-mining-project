Weakly-supervised semantic segmentation is a method that aims to reduce the cost of labeling by training models using weak supervision, such as image-level class labels. However, existing approaches struggle with accurate localization maps and false predictions in class-related backgrounds. These approaches also require additional supervision to identify and remove biased objects, limiting their applicability to real-world datasets with multiple labels and complex relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a fully-automatic and model-agnostic framework called MARS (Model-Agnostic biased object Removal without additional Supervision). MARS utilizes unsupervised techniques to eliminate biased objects in pseudo labels by matching them with backgrounds in the same dataset. Surprisingly, our experiments show that MARS achieves new state-of-the-art results on popular benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014, by consistently improving the performance of various weakly-supervised semantic segmentation models by at least 30% without requiring additional supervision.
