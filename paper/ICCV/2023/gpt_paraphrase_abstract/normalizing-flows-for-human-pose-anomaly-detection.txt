Video anomaly detection is a challenging problem due to the numerous parameters involved, such as appearance, pose, camera angle, and background. In order to address this issue, we narrow down the problem to detecting anomalies in human pose, reducing the influence of factors like appearance. Focusing solely on pose also helps mitigate bias against minority groups. Our approach operates directly on sequences of human pose graphs and is remarkably lightweight, with around 1,000 parameters. It can be run on any machine capable of pose estimation without requiring significant additional resources. We utilize a normalizing flows framework, leveraging the compactness of pose representation, and extending it to accommodate the unique characteristics of spatio-temporal pose data. Our algorithm is versatile and can handle both unsupervised training data consisting only of normal examples and a supervised setting with labeled normal and abnormal examples. We achieve state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets for anomaly detection: the unsupervised ShanghaiTech dataset and the recent supervised UBnormal dataset.
