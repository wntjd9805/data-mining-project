Learning-based deep image registration methods have outperformed traditional methods in terms of performance metrics and inference time, thanks to advancements in computing hardware and deep-learning architectures. However, these methods tend to prioritize improving metrics like Dice, neglecting other important model behaviors for registrations, especially in medical imaging. This study examines these behaviors in popular learning-based deep registrations through a sanity-checking approach. The investigation reveals that existing registrations often suffer from low inverse consistency and the inability to discriminate identical pairs due to over-optimized image similarities. To address these issues, a novel regularization-based sanity-enforcer method is proposed. This method applies two sanity checks on the deep model to simultaneously reduce inverse consistency errors and enhance its discriminative power. The study also provides theoretical guarantees for the sanity-checked image registration method. Experimental results support the theoretical findings, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in improving model sanity without compromising performance.
