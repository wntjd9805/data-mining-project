RGBBaseOurs presents a solution to the challenging task of inferring depth for transparent or mirror surfaces using neural networks. This approach does not rely on ground-truth annotation and instead utilizes a simple pipeline. By inpainting transparent or mirror objects in images and applying a monocular depth estimation model, reliable pseudo labels are generated. These labels can then be used to fine-tune existing monocular or stereo networks, enabling them to effectively handle transparent or mirror surfaces. Experimental results on the Booster dataset demonstrate the significant enhancements achieved by this straightforward method.
