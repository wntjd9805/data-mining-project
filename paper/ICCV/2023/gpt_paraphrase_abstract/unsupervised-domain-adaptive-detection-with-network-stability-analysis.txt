The aim of domain adaptive detection is to improve the performance of a detector on an unlabeled target domain by using knowledge from a labeled source domain. This study proposes a novel framework for achieving unsupervised domain adaptive detection through stability analysis. Inspired by the concept of stability in control theory, the framework treats discrepancies between domains as disturbances and introduces a Network Stability Analysis (NSA) framework. NSA considers various types of disturbances, including image-level and instance-level perturbations, and performs external and internal consistency analysis using teacher-student models. By integrating NSA into Faster R-CNN, the study achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the potential of NSA for domain adaptive detection. The NSA framework is designed for general purposes and can be applied to other detection models besides the one used in the study. The code for NSA is available at https://github.com/tiankongzhang/NSA.
