Calibration-based techniques have been widely used for denoising RAW images in extremely low-light conditions. However, these methods have several drawbacks: 1) the calibration process is time-consuming and requires a lot of effort, 2) it is challenging to transfer denoisers between different cameras, and 3) the difference between synthetic and real noise is amplified by high digital gain. To address these limitations, we propose a calibration-free pipeline called Lighting Every Darkness (LED), which is applicable to any camera sensor and digital gain settings. Instead of performing calibration and repetitive training, our method can adapt to a specific camera using a few-shot paired data and fine-tuning. Moreover, we introduce well-designed structural modifications during both stages to reduce the domain gap between synthetic and real noise, without incurring any additional computational cost. By utilizing only 2 pairs of additional digital gain (totaling 6 pairs) and 0.5% iterations, our approach outperforms other calibration-based techniques in terms of denoising performance.
