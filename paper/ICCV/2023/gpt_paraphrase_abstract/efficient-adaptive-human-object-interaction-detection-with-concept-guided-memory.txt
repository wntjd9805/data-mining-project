This study focuses on detecting and understanding the relationships between humans and objects, known as Human Object Interaction (HOI) detection. The traditional approach of training supervised models from scratch for this task faces challenges such as performance drop for rare classes and the computational cost and time required to handle long-tailed distributions of HOIs in complex scenes. To address these challenges, the researchers propose an HOI detector called ADA-CM, which can be trained with long-tailed labeled data and leverage existing knowledge from pre-trained models. ADA-CM operates in two modes: the first mode allows for tunability without learning new parameters, while the second mode incorporates an instance-aware adapter mechanism to boost performance with a lightweight set of parameters. The proposed method achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art models on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets, while requiring less training time. The code for ADA-CM is available at https://github.com/ltttpku/ADA-CM.
