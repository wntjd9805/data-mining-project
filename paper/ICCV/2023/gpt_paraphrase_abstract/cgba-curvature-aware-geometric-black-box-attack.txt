We introduce a novel approach called CGBA (Curvature-Aware Geometric Black-Box Attack) for crafting adversarial examples efficiently. Existing decision-based black-box attacks often require a large number of queries and suffer from inefficiency and convergence issues. Our CGBA attack conducts a boundary search along a semicircular path on a restricted 2D plane, ensuring successful finding of a boundary point regardless of its curvature. This attack is effective for arbitrary decision boundaries and especially efficient in exploiting low curvature to create high-quality adversarial examples. However, decision boundaries tend to have higher curvature under targeted attacks. Therefore, we develop a variant called CGBA-H, specifically adapted for targeted attacks. We also design an algorithm to obtain a better initial boundary point, enhancing the targeted attack's performance at the cost of some extra queries. We evaluate our proposed methods on well-known classifiers using ImageNet and CIFAR10 datasets, and our CGBA and CGBA-H attacks outperform state-of-the-art non-targeted and targeted attacks, respectively.
