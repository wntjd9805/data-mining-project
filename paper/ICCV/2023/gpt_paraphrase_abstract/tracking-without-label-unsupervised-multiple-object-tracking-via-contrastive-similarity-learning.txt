Unsupervised learning is a difficult task because it lacks labeled data. Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) is even more challenging without label supervision due to factors like object interference and occlusion. This paper proposes an Unsupervised Contrastive Similarity Learning method called UCSL, which exploits the latent consistency of sample features across video frames. UCSL consists of three contrast modules: self-contrast, cross-contrast, and ambiguity contrast. The self-contrast module leverages intra-frame direct and inter-frame indirect contrast to obtain discriminative representations by maximizing self-similarity. The cross-contrast module aligns cross-frame and continuous-frame matching results, reducing the negative effect caused by object occlusion. Lastly, the ambiguity contrast module matches ambiguous objects with each other to improve the certainty of subsequent object association implicitly. In experiments on existing benchmarks, our method surpasses other unsupervised methods by utilizing limited assistance from ReID head and achieves higher accuracy than many fully supervised methods.
