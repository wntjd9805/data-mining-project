White-box approaches for retouching images are necessary to enhance their visual appeal. However, users have different retouching methods based on their individual preferences. Existing methods use global filters, which lack fine-grained retouching capabilities. In contrast, colorists use region-specific enhancements in traditional tools like Davinci Resolve. To address this, we propose RSFNet, a white-box framework for photo retouching that uses parallel region-specific filters. RSFNet generates filter arguments and attention maps for each region simultaneously, allowing for a diverse range of filter classes. Unlike cascading filters, RSFNet uses linear summations, making training easier. Our experiments show that RSFNet achieves state-of-the-art results, providing aesthetic appeal and improved user convenience for white-box retouching.
