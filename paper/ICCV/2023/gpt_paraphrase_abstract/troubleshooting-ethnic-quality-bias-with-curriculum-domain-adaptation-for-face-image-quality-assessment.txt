This paper introduces a novel framework called Ethnic-Quality-Bias Mitigating (EQBM) to address the challenges faced in Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA). The existing methods in FIQA focus on formulating quality relationships within the training set, which leads to a generalization problem caused by ethnic quality bias between the training and test sets. Domain adaptation is a potential solution to mitigate this bias, but treating FIQA as a regression task limits its effectiveness due to the challenge of feature scaling in transfer learning. Additionally, ensuring source risk is also problematic as there is a lack of ground-truth labels for the source domain in FIQA. To overcome these challenges, the EQBM framework is proposed. Instead of using scalar regression, Likert-scale quality probability distributions are computed as source domain annotations. An easy-to-hard training scheduler is designed based on inter-domain uncertainty, intra-domain quality margin, and a ranking-based domain adversarial network. This enhances the effectiveness of transfer learning and reduces the source risk in domain adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EQBM significantly mitigates the quality bias and improves the generalization capability of FIQA across different races and datasets.
