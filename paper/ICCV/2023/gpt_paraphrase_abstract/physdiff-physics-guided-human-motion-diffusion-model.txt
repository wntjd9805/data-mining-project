Denoising diffusion models have the potential to generate realistic human motions, but existing models often produce physically implausible motions with artifacts. This limits their real-world application. To address this, we propose a physics-guided motion diffusion model (PhysDiff) that incorporates physical constraints into the diffusion process. We introduce a physics-based motion projection module that uses a physics simulator to project the denoised motion to a physically plausible motion. This projected motion is then used to guide the diffusion process in the next step. By iteratively using physics, our model pulls the motion towards a physically plausible space, resulting in improved motion quality and increased physical plausibility. Experiments on large-scale human motion datasets show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art motion quality and significantly improves physical plausibility.
