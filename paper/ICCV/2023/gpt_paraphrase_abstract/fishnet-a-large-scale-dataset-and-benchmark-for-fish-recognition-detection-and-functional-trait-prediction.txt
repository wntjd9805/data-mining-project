Aquatic species play a vital role in maintaining ecosystem functioning, and it is crucial to preserve their biodiversity. However, human activities such as over-fishing, climate change, and coastal development pose significant threats to aquatic biodiversity. To address this challenge, there is a need for automatic aquatic species monitoring systems that can aid researchers and policymakers in understanding changes in aquatic ecosystems and taking appropriate actions for conservation. Unfortunately, the development of such systems is hindered by the lack of large-scale diverse aquatic species datasets. Existing datasets are limited in terms of species coverage and lack functional trait data, limiting their application. In response to this need, we present FishNet, a comprehensive dataset consisting of 94,532 well-organized images representing 17,357 aquatic species classified by biological taxonomy. Additionally, we introduce three benchmarks (fish classification, fish detection, and functional trait prediction) inspired by ecological research requirements to facilitate the development of aquatic species recognition systems and promote further research in aquatic ecology. The FishNet dataset has the potential to encourage the creation of more accurate and effective tools for monitoring and protecting aquatic ecosystems, thus contributing to the conservation of aquatic biodiversity. The dataset and code will be made available at https://fishnet-2023.github.io/.
