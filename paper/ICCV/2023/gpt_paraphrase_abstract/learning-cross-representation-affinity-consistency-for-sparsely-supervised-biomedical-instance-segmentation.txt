This paper presents a new approach to sparsely supervised biomedical instance segmentation using cross-representation affinity consistency regularization. The proposed framework utilizes two networks to enforce consistency between explicit and implicit affinity maps, capturing both feature-level discrimination and pixel-level boundary structure. Highly confident regions from each affinity map are selected as pseudo labels to supervise the other map for affinity consistency learning. A pseudo-label noise filtering scheme is introduced to identify the highly confident regions. Experimental results on four biomedical datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework compared to common semi-supervision. This is the first demonstration of the effectiveness of sparse instance-level supervision on 3D volumetric datasets. The code for the framework is available at https://github.com/liuxy1103/CRAC.
