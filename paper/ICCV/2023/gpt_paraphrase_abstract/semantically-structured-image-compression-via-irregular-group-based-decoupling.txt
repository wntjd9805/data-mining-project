Image compression techniques traditionally focus on compressing rectangular images for human consumption. However, this approach often results in transmitting redundant content for downstream applications. To address this issue, previous studies have proposed structuring the bitstream semantically, allowing for selective transmission and reconstruction to meet specific application requirements. However, these methods divide the input image into multiple rectangular regions based on semantics, ignoring the potential for information interaction between them. This leads to wasted bitrate and distorted reconstruction of region boundaries. In this paper, we propose a solution that decouples an image into multiple groups with irregular shapes using a customized group mask. Each group can then be compressed independently. By describing the image at a finer granularity, our group mask allows for significant bitrate savings by reducing the transmission of redundant content. To ensure accurate selective reconstruction, we introduce the concept of a group-independent transform that maintains independence among distinct groups. This is achieved through our proposed Group-Independent Swin-Block (GI Swin-Block). Experimental results demonstrate that our framework effectively structures the bitstream with minimal cost, while also delivering superior performance in terms of visual quality and supporting intelligent tasks.
