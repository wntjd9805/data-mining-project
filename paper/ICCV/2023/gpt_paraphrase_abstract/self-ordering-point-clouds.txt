This paper explores the problem of selecting representative subsets of points in a 3D point cloud using a point-wise ordering approach. Previous research on this challenging problem has relied on difficult-to-obtain point and cloud labels. In contrast, we propose a self-supervised method called self-ordering, which involves learning point-wise ordering in 3D point clouds without the need for external labels. We also introduce the first end-to-end trainable network that achieves self-supervised point-wise ordering. Our network incorporates a novel differentiable point scoring-sorting strategy and utilizes a hierarchical contrastive scheme to generate self-supervision signals. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the scalability and superior performance of our method, even surpassing supervised ordering methods across multiple datasets and tasks, including the zero-shot ordering of point clouds from unseen categories.
