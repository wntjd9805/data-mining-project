Pan-sharpening is a technique used to enhance the spatial resolution of low-resolution multispectral images by utilizing high-resolution panchromatic images. However, previous research in pan-sharpening has mainly focused on the frequency domain, limiting the improvement of model performance. In this study, we propose a new approach called the Pyramid Dual Domain Injection Pan-sharpening Network, which combines spatial and frequency domain information to reconstruct missing high-frequency details. Our network consists of a spatial guidance pyramid sub-network and a frequency guidance pyramid sub-network, which work together to capture both local spatial information and global frequency domain information. This enables the model to generate high-quality pan-sharpening results by leveraging multi-scale dual-domain information. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on multiple datasets, demonstrating its strong generalization ability for real-world scenes.
