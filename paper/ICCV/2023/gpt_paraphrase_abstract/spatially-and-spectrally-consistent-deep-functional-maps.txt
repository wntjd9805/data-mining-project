In this study, the researchers investigate the usefulness of cycle consistency in Deep Functional Maps, a widely used method for non-rigid shape matching. They demonstrate that, under certain conditions, the learned maps are already cycle consistent when represented in the spectral domain. However, they also identify a discrepancy where spectrally consistent maps may not necessarily be spatially or point-wise consistent. To address this issue, the researchers propose a novel design for unsupervised Deep Functional Maps that enforces the harmony of learned maps in both the spectral and point-wise representations. By leveraging cycle consistency, their framework achieves state-of-the-art results in mapping shapes, even when significant distortions are present. Additionally, their method independently estimates maps in both the spectral and spatial domains, effectively reducing overfitting in network training and improving generalization performance and accuracy across various challenging tests involving near-isometric and non-isometric datasets.
