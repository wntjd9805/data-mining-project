The focus on generating 3D human motions from textual descriptions has increased due to its wide applications. Previous works treated actions as single entities and could only generate short sequences for simple motions. In contrast, our proposed model, EMS, is an elaborative motion synthesis model that generates natural and smooth motion sequences for long and complicated actions. It achieves this by breaking actions down into groups of atomic actions. EMS also understands atomic-action level attributes such as motion direction, speed, and body parts. It allows users to generate sequences of complex actions by combining unique sequences of known atomic actions with independent attribute settings and timings. We evaluated our method on the KIT Motion-Language and BABEL benchmarks, and it outperformed all previous state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin.
