Cooperation between vehicles and infrastructure is crucial for improving the safety of autonomous driving. However, there are two main challenges in collaborative perception: fusion accuracy and communication bandwidth. Previous fusion methods have attempted to balance accuracy and bandwidth by transmitting features, but they often encounter issues with feature alignment and domain gaps. Additionally, these methods still do not meet the required bandwidth standards for industrial applications.To address these challenges, we propose TransIFF, a framework that utilizes transformers for instance-level feature fusion. TransIFF effectively reduces bandwidth usage, aligns domain gaps between vehicle and infrastructure features, and improves the robustness of feature fusion, leading to high accuracy in cooperative perception. TransIFF consists of three components: a vehicle-side network, an infrastructure-side network, and a vehicle-infrastructure fusion network. The vehicle-side and infrastructure-side networks generate instance-level features independently. The infrastructure-side features are then transmitted to the vehicles, significantly reducing communication bandwidth usage. In the vehicle-infrastructure fusion network, we employ a Cross-Domain Adaptation (CDA) module to align feature domains and a Feature Magnet (FM) module to adaptively fuse instance features and achieve robust feature fusion.TransIFF has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the widely used real-world vehicle-infrastructure cooperative benchmark, DAIR-V2X. It achieves an impressive 59.62% AP (average precision) with a minimal bandwidth consumption of only 212 bytes.
