Partially annotated images are commonly used in multi-label classification, but they present a challenge due to the presence of unknown labels. This imbalance between positive and negative labels in partially annotated images negatively affects the performance of supervised learning for known labels. Existing methods mainly focus on obtaining sufficient image annotations and do not address the label imbalance during the supervised training phase.   To address this issue, we propose a novel self-training framework called saliency regularization (SR). The main idea behind SR is to model the saliency of class-specific maps and enhance the saliency of object regions that correspond to the known labels. Additionally, we introduce consistency regularization to leverage unlabeled information and complement the unknown labels using SR. This approach effectively mitigates the negative dominance caused by label imbalance and achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely used datasets such as Pascal VOC 2007, MS-COCO, VG-200, and OpenImages V3.
