Accurate estimation of 3D hand pose is crucial for understanding human interactions with the world. However, existing methods often struggle to generate realistic hand poses when the hand is occluded or blurred. In videos, hand movements provide valuable information about occluded or blurred parts. To address this, we propose the Deformer framework, which leverages visual cues before and after occlusion or blurring for robust hand pose estimation. We found that simply applying the transformer self-attention mechanism is insufficient due to distorted hand features caused by motion blur or occlusions. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a Dynamic Fusion Module that predicts hand deformation and warps hand mesh predictions from nearby frames to enhance estimation accuracy. Additionally, we discovered that estimation errors are unevenly distributed across hand parts, with fingertips having higher errors than the palm. To mitigate this, we introduce a new loss function called maxMSE that adjusts the weight of each vertex to prioritize critical hand parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 10% and exhibits greater robustness to occlusions (over 14%).
