This paper addresses the challenges of diffractive blur and low light levels in under-display cameras (UDCs). The authors propose a solution by incorporating phase masks on display panels. Specifically, they insert two micro-lens arrays in front of and behind the display panel. The first phase mask concentrates light on transparent areas of the display, allowing more light to pass through. The second phase mask reverses the effect of the first one. The folding height of each micro-lens is optimized to improve the quality of point spread functions (PSFs) and reduce chromatic aberration. The design is evaluated using a physically-accurate simulator based on Fourier optics. The results show that the proposed design doubles the light throughput and improves the invertibility of PSFs. The authors also discuss the impact of their design on display quality, demonstrating that implementation with polarization-dependent phase masks does not compromise display quality.
