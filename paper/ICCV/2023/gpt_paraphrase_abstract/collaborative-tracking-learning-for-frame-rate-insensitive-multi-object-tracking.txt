We propose a method called ColTrack for multi-object tracking (MOT) at low frame rates. Existing MOT methods struggle with low-frame-rate videos due to location and appearance changes between frames. ColTrack addresses this issue by using collaborative tracking learning in a query-based end-to-end approach. Multiple historical queries of the same target are used to track it with richer temporal descriptions. An information refinement module is inserted between temporal blocking decoders to fuse temporal clues and refine features. Additionally, a tracking object consistency loss guides the interaction between historical queries. Experimental results show that ColTrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale datasets in high-frame-rate videos and MOT17. Moreover, it has a significant advantage over existing methods in low-frame-rate videos, allowing for faster processing speeds while maintaining high performance. The code for ColTrack is available at https://github.com/yolomax/ColTrack.
