We introduce a new type of neural fields that utilize radial bases for signal representation. Unlike current neural fields that use grid-based representations with fixed neural feature positions, our approach incorporates flexible radial bases with adaptable kernel positions and shapes. This allows for better fitting of target signals and higher spatial adaptivity. To enhance the capacity of radial basis functions, we propose combining them with multi-frequency sinusoid functions, enabling representation of finer details without additional parameters. By combining adaptive radial bases with grid-based ones, our hybrid approach inherits both adaptivity and interpolation smoothness. We have devised weighting schemes to effectively adapt radial bases to different signal types. Experimental results on 2D image and 3D signed distance field representation demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy and compactness compared to previous approaches. When applied to neural radiance field reconstruction, our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality with a small model size and comparable training speed.
