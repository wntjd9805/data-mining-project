Fine-grained and instance-level recognition methods are typically trained and assessed on specific domains, using a separate model for each domain. However, this approach is not feasible for real large-scale applications. In this study, we tackle the challenge of universal image embedding, where a single model is trained and applied across multiple domains. To facilitate research in this area, we create a new extensive public benchmark by utilizing existing domain-specific datasets. This benchmark includes 241k query images, 1.4M index images, and 2.8M training images from 8 different domains and 349k classes. We establish appropriate metrics, training procedures, and evaluation protocols for future research advancements. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive experiments on this benchmark, revealing that existing approaches and simple extensions yield inferior performance compared to models trained separately for each domain. Additionally, we organize a public research competition, incorporating industrial datasets, which attracts over 1k teams worldwide. This competition generates numerous intriguing research ideas and findings, which we elaborate on in this paper.
