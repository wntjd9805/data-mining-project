Current deep learning methods for depth completion rely on large stacked layers to predict dense depth maps from sparse input data. While these methods have significantly advanced the task, their high computational complexity limits their practical use. To address this, we propose a lightweight deep network framework called the Long-short Range Recurrent Updating (LRRU) network. Instead of learning complex feature representations, LRRU initially fills the sparse input to obtain an approximate dense depth map. It then iteratively updates this map using spatially-variant kernels learned from RGB images and the depth map itself. These kernels dynamically adjust to capture long-to-short range dependencies. By starting with a coarse but complete depth map, LRRU reduces the burden of directly regressing the dense depth from sparse data. Our method effectively refines the initial map to an accurate depth map with fewer learnable parameters and faster inference time. Experimental results demonstrate that our LRRU variants achieve state-of-the-art performance across different parameter settings. Specifically, the LRRU-Base model outperforms other approaches on the NYUv2 dataset and ranks first on the KITTI depth completion benchmark.
