A new pose estimation algorithm called Check-erPose is proposed in this paper to improve the estimation of the 6-DoF pose of a rigid object from a single RGB image. The algorithm addresses three main aspects. Firstly, it densely samples 3D keypoints from the surface of the object and finds their 2D correspondences progressively in a 2D grid. This approach is more effective compared to previous methods that conduct dense sampling in the image space. Secondly, a compact binary code representation is designed for the 3D-to-2D correspondences, which allows for progressive refinement and converts the regression problem to a classification problem, resulting in improved efficiency. Thirdly, a graph neural network is utilized to model the interactions among the sampled 3D keypoints, enhancing the reliability and accuracy of the correspondences. Evaluation on popular object pose estimation benchmarks shows that Check-erPose significantly improves the accuracy of correspondence-based methods and achieves state-of-the-art performances.
