We present a new approach called scalable Hyperbolic Hierarchical Clustering (sHHC) that addresses the limitations of existing hierarchical clustering methods. These methods struggle with scalability when dealing with large datasets and also have issues with the discrete encoding of hierarchies. In contrast, sHHC learns continuous hierarchies in hyperbolic space, allowing for efficient and high-quality hierarchical clustering. Our approach significantly reduces the runtime required for clustering.  Furthermore, we showcase the effectiveness of sHHC in a cross-modal self-supervision task. By using the continuous hierarchies derived from sound and vision data, we construct hierarchical pseudo-labels. These labels enable us to optimize a network for activity recognition, achieving competitive performance compared to recent self-supervised learning models. These results highlight the potential of Hyperbolic Hierarchical Clustering for Self-Supervised Learning.
