This paper introduces a new method for semantic segmentation of point clouds in autonomous driving datasets. Traditional techniques rely on sparse 3D convolutions to handle large amounts of data efficiently. However, this paper proposes an alternative method, called WaffleIron, that achieves state-of-the-art performance without using sparse convolutions. Instead, WaffleIron utilizes MLPs and dense 2D convolutions, which were previously considered unsuitable for large-scale 3D perception. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of WaffleIron on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets and believe it is a strong alternative to sparse convolution-based backbones, especially in frameworks and hardware where sparse convolutions are not readily available. The code for WaffleIron is provided on GitHub at https://github.com/valeoai/WaffleIron.
