We present a novel technique, called the curvature similarity extractor (CSE), which aims to enhance local feature matching between images. The CSE method calculates the curvature of the local 3D surface patch for each identified feature point in a manner that is independent of the viewpoint. This is accomplished by fitting quadrics to predicted monocu-lar depth maps. The extracted curvature is then utilized as an additional signal for feature matching using popular matchers such as SuperGlue and LoFTR. Furthermore, the CSE approach enables seamless joint training by connecting the matcher and depth predictor networks. Through extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets, we consistently observe that CSE significantly improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, fine-tuning the depth prediction network further enhances the accuracy of our proposed approach. Notably, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet dataset, highlighting the efficacy of integrating 3D geometric information into feature matching.
