Despite recent advancements in 3D body reconstruction methods, acquiring accurate and sufficient 3D supervisions for training remains challenging. To address this issue, we propose KNOWN, a framework that leverages body knowledge and uncertainty modeling to compensate for the lack of 3D supervisions. KNOWN utilizes a comprehensive set of generic body constraints derived from established body knowledge, allowing 3D reconstruction models to be trained without actual 3D data. Additionally, existing methods often use images from multiple datasets during training, leading to data noise and imbalance. KNOWN tackles these problems through a novel probabilistic framework that models both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Aleatoric uncertainty is incorporated into a robust Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) training loss, while epistemic uncertainty is used to guide model refinement. Experimental results demonstrate that KNOWN outperforms previous weakly-supervised approaches in body reconstruction, particularly on challenging minority images.
