This paper introduces DPS-Net, a neural network designed to improve stereo depth estimation in textureless scenes. The network utilizes both geometric knowledge and polarimetric information from two polarimetric stereo images. To leverage the multi-domain similarity between the images, RGB and polarization correlation volumes are constructed. The network also addresses ambiguities in the polarization images by incorporating the iso-depth cost. Additionally, a cascaded dual-GRU architecture is employed to update the disparity and fuse the correlation features and iso-depth cost effectively. The authors also present new synthetic and real polarimetric stereo datasets for evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that DPS-Net outperforms existing stereo depth estimation methods.
