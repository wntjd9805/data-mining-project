This study focuses on weakly-supervised action localization, where the goal is to recognize and locate action instances in untrimmed videos using only video-level labels. While current models rely on multiple instance learning (MIL) and achieve good results in classification, they struggle with localization. This is because they primarily rely on video-level classification to identify temporal regions, overlooking the variations in feature semantics over time. To address this issue, the researchers propose a novel attention-based hierarchically-structured latent model. The model consists of two components: an unsupervised change-points detection module that identifies change-points in video features based on their rates of change, and an attention-based classification model that selects the change-points of the foreground as boundaries. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated on two benchmark datasets, THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-v1.3. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and achieves comparable performance to fully-supervised methods.
