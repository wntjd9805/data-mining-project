Many machine learning techniques use the inversion of a neural network during inference to solve inverse problems in computer vision, robotics, and graphics. However, this approach often involves navigating a complex and non-convex loss landscape, which leads to instability and slow optimization. To address this issue, we propose a method that learns a more efficient loss landscape for gradient descent, resulting in significant improvements and faster inversion processes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in various generative and discriminative tasks, such as GAN inversion, adversarial defense, and 3D human pose reconstruction.
