Pseudo-Labeling (PL) is a crucial method in semi-supervised 3D object detection. It involves using pseudo-labels generated by a teacher model to supervise the student model in the detection process. However, this approach can lead to misclassified labels and inaccurate box predictions, resulting in suboptimal detection performance. In this paper, we propose a new perspective on PL by treating it as a noisy learning problem. Instead of using vanilla pseudo-labels, we introduce a noise-resistant instance supervision module to improve generalization. We soften the classification targets by considering the quality of pseudo-labels and the learning ability of the network, and transform the regression task into a probabilistic modeling problem. Additionally, we incorporate dense pixel-wise feature consistency constraints to mitigate the negative impact of noisy labels, taking inspiration from self-supervised learning techniques. Our proposed framework, NoiseDet, is a simple yet effective solution for semi-supervised 3D object detection. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks such as ONCE and Waymo demonstrate that NoiseDet outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches by a significant margin. Notably, on the ONCE dataset, NoiseDet achieves state-of-the-art performance across different dataset scales. For instance, it improves the baseline performance of NoiseyStudent from 55.5 mAP to 58.0 mAP and further reaches 60.2 mAP with enhanced pseudo-label generation.
