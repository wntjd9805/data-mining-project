The Chamfer distance (CD) is a commonly used metric for measuring the dissimilarity between point clouds in point cloud completion tasks and is also used as a loss function in deep learning. However, CD is known to be sensitive to outliers, which can lead to suboptimal models. Unlike previous research that focuses on addressing this issue in Euclidean space, we propose a simple yet effective metric called Hyperbolic Chamfer Distance (HyperCD) that calculates CD in hyperbolic space. During backpropagation, HyperCD assigns higher weights to matched point pairs with smaller Euclidean distances. This preserves good point matches and allows for gradual updates to bad matches, resulting in improved completion results. Our experiments on benchmark datasets (PCN, ShapeNet-55, and ShapeNet-34) demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and visualization shows that HyperCD significantly enhances surface smoothness.
