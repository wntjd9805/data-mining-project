Training a box-based detector network has been proven to improve the localization performance of weakly supervised and unsupervised methods. In addition, we demonstrate that these detectors can be used to enhance the original network, paving the way for further advancements. To achieve this, we train the detectors based on the network output rather than the image data and utilize appropriate loss backpropagation. Our research shows a significant enhancement in phrase grounding for the "what is where by looking" task, as well as various techniques for unsupervised object discovery.
