Smartphone photography has gained popularity, but fitting high-quality camera systems into limited space is a challenge for manufacturers. As a result, there is a high demand for powerful mobile camera systems. Despite advancements in computer vision, assessing camera system quality is still a laborious and manual process. This paper presents the Smartphone Camera Quality Assessment Dataset (SQAD), which consists of natural images captured by 29 devices. SQAD defines camera system quality based on six widely accepted criteria: resolution, color accuracy, noise level, dynamic range, Point Spread Function, and aliasing. The dataset is created through thorough examinations in a controlled laboratory environment, providing objective metrics for quality assessment and overcoming subjective opinion scores used previously. Additionally, this paper introduces the task of automatic camera quality assessment and trains deep learning-based models using the collected data to accurately predict the quality of arbitrary photos. The SQAD dataset, codes, and pre-trained models are made available at https://github.com/aiff22/SQAD.
