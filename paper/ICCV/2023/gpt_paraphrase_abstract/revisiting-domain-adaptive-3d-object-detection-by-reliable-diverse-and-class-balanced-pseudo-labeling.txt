Unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) is crucial for domain-adaptive 3D object detection. However, existing methods face challenges in multi-class settings due to low-quality pseudo labels and class imbalance. To address this, we propose the ReDB framework, which aims to detect all classes simultaneously. Our approach generates Reliable, Diverse, and class-Balanced pseudo 3D boxes to guide self-training in a different target domain. To handle environmental discrepancies, we introduce cross-domain examination (CDE) that assesses the correctness of pseudo labels by comparing predictions in a source environment. To handle object shift, we design an overlapped boxes counting (OBC) metric to downsample pseudo-labeled objects uniformly across different geometric characteristics. To tackle inter-class imbalance, we progressively augment target point clouds with a class-balanced set of pseudo-labeled target instances and source objects. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that our ReDB approach significantly outperforms existing methods, improving mAP by 23.15% on the nuScenes â†’ KITTI task.
