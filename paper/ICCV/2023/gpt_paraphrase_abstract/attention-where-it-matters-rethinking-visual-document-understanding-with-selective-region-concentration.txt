We propose SeRum, a new document understanding model that extracts meaningful information from document images. Unlike current approaches that are computationally expensive, SeRum uses a content-aware token merge module to decode visual tokens of interest, improving attention to regions of interest and decoding speed. We also designed pre-training tasks to enhance the model's understanding and local awareness. Experimental results show that SeRum achieves top performance in document understanding tasks and competitive results in text spotting tasks. SeRum is a significant step forward in enabling efficient and effective end-to-end document understanding.
