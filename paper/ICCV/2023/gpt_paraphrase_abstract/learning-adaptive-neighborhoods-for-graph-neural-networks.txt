Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are commonly used for learning on graph structured data. However, they often assume a given graph structure, which can be problematic when the input graph is noisy or unavailable. To address this, one approach is to construct or learn a latent graph structure. Existing methods for learning graph structures typically fix the node degree for the entire graph, which is not optimal. In this study, we propose a new end-to-end differentiable graph generator that allows each node to select both its neighborhood and size. This module can be easily integrated into existing pipelines that involve graph convolution operations, replacing the predetermined adjacency matrix with a learned one. We apply our module to trajectory prediction, point cloud classification, and node classification pipelines, and demonstrate improved accuracy compared to other structure-learning methods across various datasets and GCN backbones. The code for our method will be made publicly available.
