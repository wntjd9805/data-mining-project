Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the visibility of low-light images by recovering illumination. However, conventional LLIE methods often fail to produce satisfactory results due to neglecting noise interference. In contrast, deep learning-based LLIE methods focus on learning a mapping function between low-light and normal-light images, surpassing conventional methods. Nonetheless, these deep learning-based methods have yet to fully utilize the guidance provided by auxiliary priors from normal-light images in the training dataset. To address this issue, our paper introduces a brightness-aware network that incorporates normal-light priors using brightness-aware attention and residual-quantized codebook. Our approach seeks to enhance low-light images in a more natural and realistic manner by utilizing a query module to obtain reliable normal-light features and fusing them with low-light features through a fusion branch. Moreover, we propose a brightness-aware attention module to enhance the network's robustness to different brightness levels. Extensive experiments conducted on both real-captured and synthetic data demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art LLIE methods.
