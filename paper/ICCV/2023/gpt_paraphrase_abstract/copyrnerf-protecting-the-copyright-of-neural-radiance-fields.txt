The paper discusses the importance of copyright protection for Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) models, which have the potential to be a significant representation of media. The authors propose a method to protect the copyright of NeRF models by replacing the original color representation with a watermarked color representation. They also design a distortion-resistant rendering scheme to ensure robust message extraction in 2D renderings of NeRF. The proposed method aims to maintain high rendering quality and bit accuracy while directly protecting the copyright of NeRF models. The authors provide a project page for more information on their proposed solution.
