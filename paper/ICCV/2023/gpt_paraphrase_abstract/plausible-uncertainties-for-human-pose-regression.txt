Human pose estimation (HPE) is crucial for understanding scenes in various safety-critical domains that involve human-machine interaction, such as autonomous driving and semi-automated work environments. To avoid costly mistakes, it is important to anticipate failures in model predictions by judging the accuracy of the applied models. In this study, we propose a simple human pose regression framework to examine the behavior of two established methods for estimating both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties: maximum a-posteriori (MAP) estimation with Monte-Carlo variational inference and deep evidential regression (DER). Initially, we evaluate the quality of the predicted variances produced by both methods and whether they accurately capture the expected model error. Our initial assessment reveals that both methods suffer from overconfidence, a common issue in deep probabilistic models. To address this, we introduce an additional recalibration step to extract reliable confidence intervals. We then focus on deep evidential regression, which, to our knowledge, is comprehensively applied for the first time to the HPE problem. Experimental results demonstrate that DER performs as expected, even in challenging and adverse conditions typically encountered in HPE, and the predicted uncertainties align with their intended aleatoric and epistemic sources. Importantly, DER achieves smooth uncertainty estimates without the need for expensive sampling steps, making it a promising choice for uncertainty estimation on resource-limited platforms.
