Deep neural networks (DNNs) used for recognizing 3D point clouds are susceptible to adversarial examples, which poses a threat to their practical application. While efforts have been made to address this issue, the diverse nature of adversarial examples in 3D point clouds makes them more difficult to defend against compared to 2D images. Attackers can manipulate the point cloud by adding, shifting, or removing points to generate adversarial examples, making existing defense strategies ineffective against unseen attacks.   This paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the robustness of point cloud defenses against adversarial attacks. The benchmark provides a detailed understanding of the impact of different defense and attack methods. The authors also compile various defense techniques used in point cloud adversarial defenses and conduct extensive experiments to identify an effective combination of these techniques.   Furthermore, the paper proposes a hybrid training augmentation approach that incorporates different types of point cloud adversarial examples into the adversarial training process, resulting in significantly improved robustness. By combining these defense techniques, a more robust framework is constructed, achieving an average accuracy of 83.45% against various attacks. This demonstrates its ability to enable robust learners. The codebase for this research is open-sourced and available at https://github.com/qiufan319/benchmark_pc_attack.git.
