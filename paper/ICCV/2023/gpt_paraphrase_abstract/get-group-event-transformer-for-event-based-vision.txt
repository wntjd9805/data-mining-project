Event cameras are a type of innovative sensor that has gained attention. However, existing event-based designs focus on spatial information and neglect important event properties like time and polarity. To address this, we propose a new vision Transformer backbone called Group Event Transformer (GET). GET separates temporal-polarity information from spatial information during feature extraction. We introduce a new event representation called Group Token, which groups events based on timestamps and polarities. GET utilizes the Event Dual Self-Attention block and Group Token Aggregation module to effectively communicate and integrate features in both spatial and temporal-polarity domains. GET can be combined with different downstream tasks by connecting it with various heads. Our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in event-based classification and object detection datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Peterande/GET-Group-Event-Transformer.
