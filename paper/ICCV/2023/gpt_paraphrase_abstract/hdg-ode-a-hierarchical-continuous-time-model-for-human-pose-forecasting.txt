Human pose estimation is a crucial task in various real-world applications. Although progress has been made in extracting 2D poses from static images, challenges still remain, particularly in dealing with occlusion and recovering 3D poses in multi-person scenarios. Current approaches often rely on discrete-time models and estimate joint locations using sparse graphs. In this study, we propose a new framework called HDG-ODE to forecast 3D poses from 2D skeleton representations in videos. Our framework utilizes ordinary differential equations (ODEs) as a continuous-time model to predict joint positions at any given time. To handle the structural properties of skeleton data and the irregularity caused by occlusion, we introduce dynamic graph convolution as the basic operator. Additionally, to address the computational complexity resulting from the sparsity of the pose graph, our model adopts a hierarchical structure, where the encoding process at the observation timestamp is performed sequentially, while the propagation between observations is conducted in parallel. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, which outperforms other methods while requiring fewer parameters.
