This study introduces DQTrack, a comprehensive framework for camera-based 3D multi-object tracking. Existing query-based approaches have attempted to handle both identity-agnostic detection and identity-aware tracking within a single embedding, but this approach has led to subpar performance due to conflicts in representation. To overcome this limitation, the authors propose decoupling the single embedding into separate object and track queries. Unlike previous methods, this decoupled-query paradigm employs task-specific queries while maintaining a streamlined pipeline without complex post-processing. Additionally, the framework incorporates learnable association and temporal update mechanisms to enable differentiable trajectory association and frame-by-frame query updates. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the superiority of DQTrack over previous tracking-by-detection and learning-based methods.
