Advancements in deep learning have greatly enhanced the performance of computer vision applications. However, the challenge of discovering new categories in an incremental learning scenario remains, as there is a lack of prior knowledge about the number and nature of these categories. Existing methods for novel category discovery are limited because they rely on labeled datasets and prior knowledge about the number and proportion of new categories. To overcome these limitations and better reflect real-world situations, this paper presents a novel unsupervised approach for incremental learning that discovers new categories in unlabeled datasets without prior knowledge. The proposed method involves fine-tuning the feature extractor and proxy anchors on labeled datasets, then separating samples into old and new categories and clustering them in the unlabeled dataset. Additionally, a proxy anchors-based exemplar generates representative category vectors to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on fine-grained datasets in real-world scenarios.
