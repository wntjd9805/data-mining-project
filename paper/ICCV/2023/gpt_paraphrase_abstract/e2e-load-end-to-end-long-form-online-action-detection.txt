In recent times, there has been a growing interest in feature-based methods for Online Action Detection (OAD). However, these methods have a limitation in their fixed backbone design, which hinders their ability to take full advantage of a trainable backbone. This paper introduces a novel end-to-end learning network that addresses this issue by incorporating a backbone network design that enhances both effectiveness and efficiency.Our proposed model utilizes a shared initial spatial model for all frames and maintains an extended sequence cache, enabling low-cost inference. We also introduce an asymmetric spatiotemporal model that caters to both long-form and short-form modeling. Additionally, we propose an innovative and efficient inference mechanism that accelerates extensive spatiotemporal exploration.To validate the performance and efficiency of our method, we conducted comprehensive ablation studies and experiments. The results are remarkable, as we achieved an end-to-end learning OAD of 17.3 (+12.6) frames per second (FPS) with significantly improved mean Average Precision (mAP) scores on THMOUSâ€™14, TVSeries, and HDD datasets.The source code for our proposed method is available at https://github.com/sqiangcao99/E2E-LOAD.
