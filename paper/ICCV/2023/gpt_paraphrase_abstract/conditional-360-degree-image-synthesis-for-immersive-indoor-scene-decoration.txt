This paper focuses on the problem of adding decorative elements to 360-degree images of indoor scenes. The authors propose a method that uses a 360-degree object layout generator to learn furniture arrangements in the input image. This object layout is then used to condition a generative adversarial network to synthesize new images of the scene with different decorations. To improve the model's generation capability, a scene emptier is developed to remove the generated furniture and create an empty scene for the model to learn a cyclic constraint. The model is trained on the Structure3D dataset and achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing generalization ability on the Zillow indoor scene dataset. A user study confirms the immersive experiences provided by the realistic image quality and furniture layout in the generated results. The implementation of the method is available at https://github.com/kcshum/neural_360_decoration.git.
