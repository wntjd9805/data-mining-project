This paper introduces the Tangent Sampson error as a generalization of the classical Sampson error in two-view geometry. The Tangent Sampson error allows for arbitrary central camera models and only requires local gradients of the distortion map at the original correspondences, resulting in a negligible increase in computational cost when used in RANSAC or local refinement. It effectively approximates the true-reprojection error for a wide variety of cameras, including those with extremely wide field-of-view lenses. Experimental results demonstrate that the Tangent Sampson error outperforms competing approaches in both model scoring in RANSAC and non-linear refinement of the relative camera pose.In two-view geometry, the epipolar constraint is used to constrain the geometry, ensuring that the 2D-2D correspondence can be triangulated exactly. However, when the measurement of the correspondence is inexact, it is important to measure how close the correspondence is to being consistent with a given epipolar geometry. This measurement is used for determining inlier matches during robust estimation and as a loss to be minimized when refining an initial estimate of the essential matrix.Under the assumption of i.i.d. Gaussian noise, the maximum likelihood estimate of the closest consistent correspondence, often referred to as the gold-standard estimate, is found by minimizing the squared reprojection error.Overall, this paper presents the Tangent Sampson error as a useful tool for evaluating and refining camera pose estimates in two-view geometry, providing improved performance compared to existing approaches.
