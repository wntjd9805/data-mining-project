High-speed cameras are commonly used for slow-motion analysis, but their fixed bandwidth limits the camera's spatial and temporal resolutions. To address this issue, compressive high-speed imaging systems have been developed, which encode the signal optically and use a reconstruction process to recover the video. This study introduces a new approach for compressive high-speed imaging by temporally coding the camera's point-spread function (PSF). By rotating a diffraction grating in front of the camera, the sensor captures an image blurred by a continuously rotating PSF. The researchers also propose a reconstruction algorithm based on deconvolution to reconstruct videos from these measurements. Compared to previous methods, their approach achieves better light efficiency and can handle a wider range of scenes. Additionally, their mechanical design allows for flexible temporal resolution, potentially enabling capture at 192 kHz, which is much higher than previous works. The researchers demonstrate a prototype of this system and its applications in motion capture and particle image velocimetry (PIV).
