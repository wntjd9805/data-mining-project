In practical situations, standard visual recognition systems may encounter two main challenges: misclassifying known classes and exhibiting excusable errors on images of unknown classes. To address these shortcomings, a flexible visual recognition approach is needed. This approach involves predicting multiple classes when there is uncertainty between choices and refraining from making predictions when the input falls completely outside the training distribution. However, there are two key challenges in implementing this approach. Firstly, the uncertainty in predictions needs to be quantified separately as confusion, which represents uncertainty between classes, and ignorance, which characterizes out-of-distribution samples. Secondly, both confusion and ignorance should be comparable across samples to enable effective decision-making. This paper proposes a solution to explicitly model these two sources of uncertainty using Subjective Logic. By treating recognition as an evidence-gathering process, confusion is defined as conflicting evidence, while ignorance is seen as the absence of evidence. By predicting Dirichlet concentration parameters for singletons, comprehensive subjective opinions that encompass confusion and ignorance can be obtained through combining additional evidence. Through a series of experiments involving synthetic data analysis, visual recognition, and open-set detection, the effectiveness of our methods in quantifying the two sources of uncertainty and facilitating flexible recognition is demonstrated.
