We propose a novel scheme called DRAW to defend against nefarious image manipulation by protecting the original RAW files captured by cameras. Our approach involves the use of a lightweight Multi-frequency Partial Fusion Network (MPF-Net) that is compatible with devices with limited computing resources. This network incorporates invisible watermarks as a protective signal into the RAW data, allowing the protection capability to be transferred to the final RGB images regardless of the Image Signal Processing (ISP) pipeline used. Furthermore, our method is resilient to post-processing operations such as blurring or compression. In the event of image manipulation, we can accurately identify the forged areas using a localization network. We conducted extensive experiments on popular RAW datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. We believe that this technique could be implemented in future cameras as an option for image protection, effectively curbing image manipulation at its source.
