We propose a Group-wise Contrastive Learning (GCL) scheme to register distant outdoor LiDAR point clouds for autonomous vehicles. The challenge lies in the small overlapping area and significant differences in point densities. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, we establish that contrastive positives should be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) to train density-invariant feature extractors. To address this, we introduce a training scheme that encourages similarity among the features of multiple point clouds in the same spatial location (positive groups), avoiding sampling bias and conforming to the i.i.d. principle. Our fully-convolutional feature extractor outperforms state-of-the-art methods, enhancing the registration recall of distant scenarios by 40.9% on the KITTI benchmark and 26.9% on the nuScenes benchmark. The code for our proposed method is available at https://github.com/liuQuan98/GCL.
