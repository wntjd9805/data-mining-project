We investigate the collective representation of lines connected to points, specifically the collection of image tuples derived from a fixed set of cameras observing a changing 3D point-line relationship. We establish a mathematical expression for the quantity of complex critical points in the triangulation problem, which seeks to determine a 3D point-line relationship from images with noise. Our formula is applicable to any number of images and gauges the inherent complexity of this triangulation process. Moreover, we perform numerical experiments utilizing homotopy continuation methods, comparing various approaches to triangulating such relationships. Our experimental setup demonstrates that leveraging the incidence relations leads to significantly faster point reconstruction while maintaining comparable accuracy.
