Previous methods for 3D plane recovery from a single image often tackle subtasks such as plane detection, segmentation, parameter estimation, and depth estimation separately. This approach may limit performance. In this paper, we introduce PlaneRecTR, a Transformer-based architecture that integrates all these subtasks into a unified framework. Inspired by the success of query-based learning, our approach achieves improved reasoning among semantic entities. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that our unified learning approach outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The code for PlaneRecTR is available at https://github.com/SJingjia/PlaneRecTR.
