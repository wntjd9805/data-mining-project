This paper proposes a new algorithm called recursive video lane detector (RVLD) for detecting road lanes in videos. The algorithm consists of two components: an intra-frame lane detector (ILD) and a predictive lane detector (PLD). The ILD is designed to locate lanes in a single still frame, while the PLD utilizes information from the previous frame to detect lanes in the current frame. This is achieved by estimating a motion field and warping the previous output to align with the current frame. The warped information is then used to refine the feature map and improve the accuracy of lane detection. Experimental results demonstrate that RVLD outperforms existing detectors on video lane datasets. The source code for RVLD is publicly available at https://github.com/dongkwonjin/RVLD.
