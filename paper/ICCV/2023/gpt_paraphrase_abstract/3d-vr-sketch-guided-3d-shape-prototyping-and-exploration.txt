We propose a 3D shape generation network that can create realistic 3D shapes based on 3D VR sketches. Our aim is to simplify the labor-intensive and time-consuming process of 3D shape modeling, making it accessible to novices without art training. To handle potential sketch ambiguity, our method generates multiple 3D shapes that align with the structure of the original sketch. We have carefully designed our method, training the model gradually and using multi-modal 3D shape representation to overcome limited training data. To ensure the realism of the generated shapes, we utilize normalizing flow to model the distribution of the latent space. Additionally, we introduce a dedicated loss function that helps maintain fidelity to the input sketch throughout the training process.
