This study focuses on image-based 3D object detection and addresses the issue of unfair evaluations and comparisons due to the adoption of different training recipes and tricks by different methods in the field. To tackle this problem, the researchers develop a modular-designed codebase and establish unified training standards for the community. Additionally, an error diagnosis toolbox is designed to provide detailed characterization of detection models. By utilizing these tools, the current methods are analyzed extensively under various settings, including a discussion on conflicting conclusions regarding KITTI-3D and nuScenes datasets, which have resulted in different dominant methods for these datasets. The aim of this research is to support future studies in image-based 3D object detection. The codes developed in this work can be accessed at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/3dodi.
