Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using deep neural networks to directly infer 3D geometry from posed images, without the need for optimization at test time. This approach has shown great promise and efficiency. However, the reconstructed geometry, which is typically represented as a 3D truncated signed distance function (TSDF), often lacks fine geometric details. To address this issue, we propose three effective solutions to improve the fidelity of inference-based 3D reconstructions.Our first solution is a resolution-agnostic TSDF supervision strategy. This strategy provides the network with a more accurate learning signal during training, avoiding the interpolation issues observed in previous work with TSDF.Secondly, we introduce a depth guidance strategy that utilizes multi-view depth estimates. This strategy enhances the scene representation and allows for the recovery of more accurate surfaces.Lastly, we develop a novel architecture for the final layers of the network. This architecture conditions the output TSDF prediction on high-resolution image features, in addition to coarse voxel features. This enables the reconstruction of fine details with sharper accuracy.Our proposed method, FineRecon1, produces smooth and highly accurate reconstructions. It demonstrates significant improvements across multiple depth and 3D reconstruction metrics.
