This paper presents a robust 3D detector called Cross Modal Transformer (CMT) for end-to-end 3D multi-modal detection. CMT directly generates accurate 3D bounding boxes without the need for explicit view transformation. It achieves spatial alignment of multi-modal tokens by encoding 3D points into multi-modal features. Despite its simple design, CMT demonstrates impressive performance, achieving a state-of-the-art NDS score of 74.1% on the nuScenes test set while maintaining fast inference speed. Additionally, CMT exhibits strong robustness even in the absence of LiDAR. The code for CMT is available at https://github.com/junjie18/CMT.
