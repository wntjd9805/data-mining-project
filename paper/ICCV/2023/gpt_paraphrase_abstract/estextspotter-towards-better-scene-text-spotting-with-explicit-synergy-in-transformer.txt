In recent years, there has been a shift towards Transformer-based frameworks in end-to-end scene text spotting approaches. However, these methods often adopt an implicit synergy strategy with shared query, which limits the potential of text detection and recognition tasks. This paper argues for the importance of explicit synergy that considers the distinct characteristics of text detection and recognition in order to improve text spotting performance. To address this, a new model called Explicit Synergy-based Text Spotting Transformer framework (ESTextSpotter) is introduced. ESTextSpotter achieves explicit synergy by modeling discriminative and interactive features for text detection and recognition within a single decoder. The conventional shared query is decomposed into task-aware queries for text polygon and content, allowing for explicit interaction between the queries while preserving discriminative patterns. Additionally, a task-aware query initialization scheme is proposed to ensure stable training. Experimental results show that ESTextSpotter outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods. The code for this model is available at https://github.com/mxin262/ESTextSpotter.
