This research paper focuses on addressing the issue of matching instability in DEtection TRansformers (DETR) across different decoder layers. The instability is caused by a problem of multi-optimization paths, particularly evident in the one-to-one matching design of DETR. To tackle this problem, the study proposes the use of positional metrics (such as IOU) exclusively for supervising the classification scores of positive examples. Based on this principle, two effective modifications are introduced: the position-supervised loss and the position-modulated cost, which integrate positional metrics into DETR's classification loss and matching cost, respectively. The proposed methods are tested on various DETR variants and consistently demonstrate improvements over the baselines. When combined with DINO, the methods achieve impressive results on the COCO detection benchmark, with 50.4 and 51.5 AP using ResNet-50 backbones under 1× and 2× training settings (12 and 24 epochs, respectively), setting a new record under the same setting. Additionally, a performance of 63.8 AP is achieved on COCO detection test-dev with a Swin-Large backbone. The code for the proposed methods will be made available at https://github.com/IDEA-Research/Stable-DINO.
