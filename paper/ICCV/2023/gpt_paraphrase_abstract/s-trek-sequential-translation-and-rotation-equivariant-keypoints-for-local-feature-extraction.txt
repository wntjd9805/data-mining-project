This study introduces S-TREK, a new local feature extractor that combines a deep keypoint detector with a lightweight deep descriptor extractor. The keypoint detector is designed to be equivariant to both translation and rotation. The S-TREK keypoint detector is trained using a reinforcement learning framework, where a sequential procedure is used to maximize a reward related to keypoint repeatability. The descriptor network is trained using a "detect, then describe" approach, where the descriptor loss is only evaluated at locations where keypoints have been selected by the trained detector. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of S-TREK, which often outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of repeatability and quality of pose recovery, particularly for in-plane rotations.
