Weakly-supervised temporal action localization (WTAL) is a challenging task in which most existing methods rely on pretrained networks from other datasets, resulting in suboptimal performance for WTAL. To address this issue, researchers have developed feature enhancement modules that improve the performance of the localization module by modeling the temporal relationship between snippets. However, these methods overlook the fact that ambiguous snippets can provide contradictory information, which decreases the discriminability of linked snippets. To tackle this problem, we propose the Discriminability-Driven Graph Network (DDG-Net). Our approach explicitly models both ambiguous and discriminative snippets using well-designed connections to prevent the transmission of ambiguous information and enhance the discriminability of snippet-level representations. Furthermore, we introduce a feature consistency loss to prevent feature assimilation and encourage the generation of more discriminative representations by the graph convolution network. Through extensive experiments on the THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.2 benchmarks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DDG-Net, achieving new state-of-the-art results on both datasets.
