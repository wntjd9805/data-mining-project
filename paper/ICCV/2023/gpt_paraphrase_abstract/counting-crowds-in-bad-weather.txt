Crowd counting has gained attention in computer vision for its applications in image understanding. Although various methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance, they struggle in adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow. This is because the visual appearance of crowds in these scenarios differs significantly from clear weather images in standard datasets. This study presents a robust crowd counting method for adverse weather scenarios. Instead of a two-stage approach involving image restoration and crowd counting modules, our model learns effective features and adaptive queries to handle large appearance variations. By incorporating weather queries, the model can adapt to weather conditions and optimize crowd counting simultaneously. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm under different weather types. The source code is available on our project page.
