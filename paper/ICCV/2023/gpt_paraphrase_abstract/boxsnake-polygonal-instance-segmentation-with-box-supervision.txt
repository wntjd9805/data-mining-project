Box-supervised instance segmentation has gained attention for its use of simple box annotations instead of costly mask or polygon annotations. However, existing models in this area primarily focus on mask-based frameworks. In this study, we introduce a new end-to-end training technique called BoxSnake, which achieves effective polygonal instance segmentation using only box annotations. Our method incorporates two loss functions: a point-based unary loss that ensures coarse-grained segmentation by constraining the bounding box of predicted polygons, and a distance-aware pairwise loss that encourages the predicted polygons to align with object boundaries. Compared to weakly-supervised methods based on masks, BoxSnake narrows the performance gap between predicted segmentation and the bounding box and exhibits significant superiority on the Cityscapes dataset.
