This paper presents SKiT, a rapid Key informationTransformer designed for phase recognition in videos. Unlike previous methods that utilize complex models to capture long-term temporal information, SKiT accurately identifies high-level stages of videos using a efficient key pooling operation. This operation retains important key information by recording the maximum value from the beginning up to the current video frame, with a time complexity of O(1). Experimental results from Cholec80 and AutoLa-paro surgical datasets demonstrate that our model can recognize phases in real-time. SKiT outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an accuracy of 92.5% and 82.9% on Cholec80 and AutoLa-paro, respectively, while being eight times faster (7ms v.s. 55ms) than LoViT, which uses Prob-Sparse for capturing global information. It is important to note that SKiT's inference time remains constant and independent of the input length, making it a reliable choice for preserving significant global information that appears in long surgical videos, crucial for phase recognition. In conclusion, we propose an effective and efficient model for surgical phase recognition that leverages key global information. This model is valuable for performing real-time surgical recognition on lengthy surgical videos.
