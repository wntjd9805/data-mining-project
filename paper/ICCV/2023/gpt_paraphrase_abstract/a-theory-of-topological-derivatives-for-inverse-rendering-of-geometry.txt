We present a new theoretical framework for differentiable surface evolution, which allows for discrete changes in topology. This framework utilizes topological derivatives to optimize image functionals. Unlike previous methods that rely on sparse silhouette gradients for topology changes, our theory derives topological derivatives that relate the introduction of vanishing holes and phases to changes in image intensity. This enables us to perturb shapes differentiably by creating holes or introducing phases. We validate our theory through optimization of closed curves in 2D and surfaces in 3D, revealing limitations of current methods and enabling improved applications such as image vectorization, vector-graphics generation from text prompts, single-image reconstruction of shape ambigrams, and multiview 3D reconstruction.
