We introduce XVO, a semi-supervised learning method for training generalized monocular Visual Odometry (VO) models. Unlike traditional approaches that focus on a known calibration within a single dataset, XVO learns to estimate relative pose without relying on known camera parameters. We optimize the motion estimation model by self-training from a large amount of diverse dash camera videos on YouTube. Our main contributions are twofold: first, we show the benefits of semi-supervised training for learning a general-purpose direct VO regression network; second, we demonstrate the use of multi-modal supervision, including segmentation, flow, depth, and audio prediction tasks, to improve the generalization of the VO task. We find that audio prediction significantly improves the semi-supervised learning process, especially for highly dynamic and out-of-domain video data. Our proposed teacher network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI benchmark, even without multi-frame optimization or knowledge of camera parameters. Furthermore, XVO demonstrates off-the-shelf knowledge transfer across diverse conditions on KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse without the need for fine-tuning.
