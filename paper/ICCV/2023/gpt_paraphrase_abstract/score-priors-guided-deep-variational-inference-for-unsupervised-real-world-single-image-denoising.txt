Real-world denoising of single images is crucial in computer vision. Existing methods based on Bayesian inversions combined with score priors have proven effective, but they are limited to white Gaussian noise. Additionally, applying these methods to real-world denoising requires explicit training of score priors on the target domain and complex sampling procedures for posterior inference, making them impractical. To overcome these limitations, we propose ScoreDVI, a deep variational inference approach guided by score priors for practical real-world denoising. Score priors are extracted from minimum MSE Non-i.i.d Gaussian denoisers and variational samples, allowing us to optimize the variational image posterior by adaptively applying cheap score priors to denoising. We also introduce a Non-i.i.d Gaussian mixture model and variational noise posterior to model real-world noise, enabling the fusion of multiple image priors and variational image posteriors on a pixel-wise level. Furthermore, we develop a noise-aware prior assignment strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight of image priors during optimization. Our method outperforms other single image-based real-world denoising methods and achieves comparable performance to dataset-based unsupervised methods.
