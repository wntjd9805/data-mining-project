Learning per-point semantic features from the hierarchical feature pyramid is crucial for semantic segmentation of point clouds. However, previous methods have encountered challenges such as ambiguous region features and ineffective refinement of per-point features, resulting in information loss and ambiguous semantic identification. To address these issues, we propose Retro-FPN, a model that treats per-point feature prediction as a retrospective refining process. Retro-FPN traverses all pyramid layers to explicitly extract semantic features for each point, utilizing a retro-transformer to summarize semantic contexts from the previous layer and refine the features in the current stage. This allows for point categorization to be conditioned on local semantic patterns. The retro-transformer consists of a local cross-attention block and a semantic gate unit. The cross-attention block retrospectively summarizes the semantic pattern from the previous layer, while the gate unit incorporates the summarized contexts and refines the current semantic features. Retro-FPN is a pluggable neural network compatible with hierarchical decoders, and its integration with three representative backbones, including both point-based and voxel-based methods, demonstrates significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art backbones. Our design is validated through comprehensive experiments on widely used benchmarks. The source code for Retro-FPN is available at https://github.com/AllenXiangX/Retro-FPN.
