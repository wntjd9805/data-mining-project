Current federated learning (FL) methods operate under the unrealistic closed-set scenario, where both training and testing classes belong to the same set. This limitation causes the global model to struggle in recognizing unseen classes as 'unknown'. To address this issue, we introduce a new problem called federated open-set recognition (FedOSR), which aims to develop an open-set recognition (OSR) model within the federated paradigm. This model should be able to classify known classes while also detecting unknown classes.In this study, we propose the FedPD algorithm, which utilizes parameter disentanglement to tackle two main challenges in FedOSR. These challenges include the interference between closed-set and open-set knowledge across different clients and the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity within clients. The FedPD framework consists of two modules: local parameter disentanglement (LPD) and global divide-and-conquer aggregation (GDCA). The LPD module separates an OSR model into a closed-set subnetwork and an open-set subnetwork based on the importance of the task, effectively preventing interference between the two sets. On the other hand, the GDCA module partitions the two subnetworks into specific and shared parts and aligns the corresponding parts through optimal transport to eliminate parameter misalignment.Through extensive experiments on various datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed FedPD method.
