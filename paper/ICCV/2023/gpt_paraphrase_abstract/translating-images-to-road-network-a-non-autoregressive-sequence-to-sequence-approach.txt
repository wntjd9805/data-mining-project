Generating high-definition maps requires the extraction of road networks, which involves accurately identifying the location and connections of road landmarks. However, this task is challenging due to the conflicting nature of the Euclidean (location-based) and non-Euclidean (topological connectivity-based) structures of road data. Existing methods struggle to effectively integrate these two types of data, but our work proposes a solution. We introduce the concept of a RoadNet Sequence, which is an integer series that represents both Euclidean and non-Euclidean data domains. Instead of solely relying on autoregressive dependencies, we develop a non-autoregressive sequence-to-sequence approach that leverages both autoregressive and non-autoregressive dependencies. This approach improves efficiency and accuracy in generating road networks. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the superiority of our RoadNet Sequence representation and non-autoregressive approach compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
