This study focuses on improving the accuracy of local lane graph estimates for autonomous driving. Currently, autonomous agents use object detection and online BEV lane graph extraction methods to understand their surroundings. However, these methods have limitations in accurately estimating lane graphs. To address this issue, the authors propose a new architecture and loss formulation that leverages 3D object detection outputs. The proposed method assigns objects to centerlines by treating centerlines as cluster centers and objects as data points. This allows for a probability distribution to be assigned to each object, indicating its relationship to the cluster centers. By directly supervising the relationship between lanes and objects, the proposed method achieves better performance in lane graph estimation compared to existing methods. Extensive experiments confirm the significant improvements achieved by integrating the outputs of existing 3D object detection methods into the proposed approach. Importantly, the proposed method can be used with any detection method during testing, as it relies on detection outputs rather than intermediate representations. The authors plan to make the code publicly available for further research and development.
