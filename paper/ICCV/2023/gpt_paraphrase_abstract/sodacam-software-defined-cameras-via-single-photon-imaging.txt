We introduce a novel concept called reinterpretable cameras, which surpass the capabilities of traditional cameras through advanced post-processing techniques. Our project, called "SoDaCam," offers reinterpretable cameras that operate at the level of individual photons, utilizing photon-cubes obtained from single-photon devices. These photon-cubes represent the spatial and temporal detection of photons as a series of binary frames, with frame rates of up to 100 kHz. By applying simple transformations to the photon-cube or projecting it in different ways, we can replicate the functionalities of various imaging systems. These functionalities include exposure bracketing, flutter shutter cameras, video compressive systems, event cameras, and even cameras that undergo motion during exposure. What makes our photon-cube projections unique is that they can be defined through software and are only limited by computational capabilities and shot-noise. This flexibility allows us to introduce new capabilities to the emulated cameras. Additionally, our projections enable camera-specific compression of photon-cubes, which we demonstrate using a novel compute architecture designed specifically for single-photon imaging.
