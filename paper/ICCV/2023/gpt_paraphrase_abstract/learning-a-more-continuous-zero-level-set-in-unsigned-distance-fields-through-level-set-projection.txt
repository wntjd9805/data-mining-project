New methods have been developed for representing shapes with open surfaces using unsigned distance functions (UDFs). These methods involve training neural networks to learn UDFs and reconstruct surfaces based on the gradients around the zero level set of the UDF. However, these networks struggle to learn the zero level set accurately, as it is not differentiable. This leads to significant errors in the unsigned distances and gradients around the zero level set, resulting in fragmented and discontinuous surfaces. To address this issue, we propose a solution that involves learning a more continuous zero level set in UDFs through level set projections. Our approach is based on the observation that non-zero level sets are smoother and more continuous than the zero level set. We use gradient constraints to pull the non-zero level sets onto the zero level set, aligning the gradients across different level sets and correcting unsigned distance errors on the zero level set. This results in a smoother and more continuous unsigned distance field. We conducted comprehensive experiments on surface reconstruction for point clouds, real scans, and depth maps, as well as unsupervised point cloud upsampling and unsupervised point normal estimation using the learned UDF. Our results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods. The code for our approach is available at https://github.com/junshengzhou/LevelSetUDF.
