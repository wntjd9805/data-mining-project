This paper proposes a three-stage network to effectively remove specular highlights from single object-level images. Previous methods have shown some progress in this area, but their performance is still limited, especially for real images with complex specular highlights. The proposed network first decomposes the input image into albedo, shading, and specular residue components to estimate a coarse specular-free image. Then, it refines the coarse result to reduce visual artifacts like color distortion. Finally, the tone of the refined result is adjusted to closely match the tone of the input image. To support network training and quantitative evaluation, a large-scale synthetic dataset of object-level images is introduced, encompassing various objects and lighting conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed network generalizes well to unseen real object-level images and can even produce satisfactory results for scene-level images with multiple background objects and complex lighting.
