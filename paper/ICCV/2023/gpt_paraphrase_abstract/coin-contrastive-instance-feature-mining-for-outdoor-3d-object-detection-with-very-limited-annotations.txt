The recent focus has been on 3D object detection using sparse annotations. However, existing detectors struggle with limited annotations. To address this, we propose a new method called CoIn, which involves Contrastive Instance feature mining. We introduce a Multi-Class contrastive learning module (MCcont) to improve feature discrimination. Additionally, we propose a feature-level pseudo-label mining framework consisting of an instance feature mining module (InF-Mining) and a Labeled-to-Pseudo contrastive learning module (LPcont). These modules utilize latent instances in feature space to train detectors with limited annotations. Our experiments on KITTI, Waymo, and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the performance of baseline detectors (Center-Point, Voxel-RCNN, and CasA) under limited annotations. By combining CoIn with an iterative training strategy, we introduce CoIn++, which achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods with only 2% annotations in the KITTI dataset.
