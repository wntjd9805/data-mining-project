Group affect refers to the emotional response experienced by a group in reaction to an external stimulus. This emotional response plays a significant role in shaping group behavior and outcomes. However, existing methods for recognizing group affect often overlook the emotional meaning in group dynamics and fail to consider the contextual relevance of faces and objects in group-level images.To address this gap, we propose a solution that incorporates the concept of the Most Important Person (MIP), which represents the most notable face in a crowd and carries emotional significance. Our approach, called the Dual-branch Cross-Patch Attention Transformer (DCAT), utilizes both the global image and the MIP as inputs. First, we learn informative facial regions from the MIP and global context separately. Then, we introduce the Cross-Patch Attention module to merge the features of the MIP and global context to complement each other.Through experimentation on various datasets such as GAF 3.0, GroupEmoW, and HECO, our proposed method outperforms existing techniques. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of our model by successfully applying it to a different group affect task, group cohesion, and achieving comparable results.Table 1 presents different strategies for selecting faces in the image. The "3Random" strategy randomly selects three faces from the detected faces, while the "3MIPs" strategy selects the top three faces based on their importance ranking. The evaluation on the GroupEmoW dataset shows that the "3MIPs" strategy achieves the highest accuracy of 87.46%.Figure 1 illustrates a comparison between using the MIP and all faces in terms of feature maps. The yellow box represents the region corresponding to the MIP. It can be observed that utilizing the MIP captures more relevant and informative features compared to using all faces.In conclusion, our proposed approach effectively incorporates the concept of the Most Important Person to enhance the recognition of group affect. The use of the Dual-branch Cross-Patch Attention Transformer proves to be advantageous in capturing meaningful emotional cues from group-level images.
