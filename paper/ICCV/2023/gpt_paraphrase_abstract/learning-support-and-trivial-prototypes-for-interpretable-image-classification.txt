This paper introduces a new method called ST-ProtoPNet to improve the classification accuracy of Prototypical Part Network (ProtoPNet) models. ProtoPNet methods associate predictions with a set of training prototypes, referred to as "trivial prototypes," which are trained to be far from the classification boundary in the feature space. This paper argues that the discrepancy between ProtoPNet and Support Vector Machine (SVM) theory, where support vectors are located close to the classification boundary, can lead to inferior classification accuracy in ProtoPNet models. To address this, the authors propose learning support prototypes that lie near the classification boundary, as suggested by SVM theory. The ST-ProtoPNet model combines these support prototypes with the trivial prototypes to achieve more effective classification. Experimental results on three datasets show that ST-ProtoPNet achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, the proposed support prototypes are better localized in the object of interest rather than the background region.
