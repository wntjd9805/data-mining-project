Photometric stereo is a method used to reconstruct detailed surface shapes from images taken under different lighting conditions. However, current real-world datasets mainly focus on evaluating photometric stereo for surfaces with non-Lambertian reflectance and bulging shapes of a certain height. Since the recovery of shape details is a key advantage of photometric stereo compared to other 3D reconstruction techniques, we introduce a new real-world dataset called DiLiGenT-Î . This dataset consists of 30 scenes with nearly planar surfaces that have rich surface details. The purpose of this dataset is to evaluate recent photometric stereo methods specifically for their ability to estimate shape details across a variety of materials and to identify challenges in estimating surface normals and recovering surface details for translucent materials on near-planar surfaces. By making this dataset publicly available, we hope to inspire further research in this field. The dataset can be accessed at https://photometricstereo.github.io/diligentpi.html.
