State-of-the-art techniques for detecting lanes on roads rely on specific knowledge of lane characteristics, such as straight lines and parametric curves. However, these methods struggle to handle lanes with complex topologies, such as dense, forked, or curved lines. Recently, dynamic convolution-based approaches have shown promise by using features from key locations on a lane line as convolutional kernels to detect the lines. While this reduces reliance on specific knowledge, it fails to capture the global structure of long and thin lane lines, resulting in inaccurate detection of complex topologies and sensitivity to occlusion and lane intersections. To address these limitations, we propose a transformer-based architecture for lane detection. Our method generates dynamic convolutional kernels for each lane line using a transformer, enabling them to capture the lane line's global structure from the entire feature map. This improves their ability to handle occlusions and complex topologies. We evaluate our method on three lane detection benchmarks and achieve state-of-the-art performance, with an F1 score of 63.40 on OpenLane and 88.47 on CurveLanes, surpassing previous methods by 4.30 and 2.37 points, respectively.
