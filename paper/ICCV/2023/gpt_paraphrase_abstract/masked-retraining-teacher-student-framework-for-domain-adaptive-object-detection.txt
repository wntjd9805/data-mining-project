Domain adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) is a technique that allows an object detector to learn from a labeled domain (source) and generalize its knowledge to an unlabeled domain (target) without annotation. Existing approaches use a teacher-student framework, where the student model is supervised by pseudo labels generated by a teacher model. However, these methods face challenges due to limited pseudo boxes with incorrect predictions caused by the domain shift, which can mislead the student model and lead to sub-optimal results. To address this issue, we propose a Masked Retraining Teacher-student framework (MRT). MRT incorporates a masked autoencoder and selective retraining mechanism on a detection transformer. Specifically, we design a customized masked autoencoder branch that masks the multi-scale feature maps of target images and reconstructs features using the student model's encoder and an auxiliary decoder. This enables the student model to capture target domain characteristics and become a more data-efficient learner, leveraging the limited number of pseudo boxes effectively. Additionally, we employ a selective retraining mechanism that periodically re-initializes certain parts of the student parameters with refined weights from the masked autoencoder. This allows the model to escape from local optima biased towards incorrect pseudo labels. We evaluate our method on three DAOD benchmarks and demonstrate its effectiveness through experimental results. Our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of object detection accuracy.
