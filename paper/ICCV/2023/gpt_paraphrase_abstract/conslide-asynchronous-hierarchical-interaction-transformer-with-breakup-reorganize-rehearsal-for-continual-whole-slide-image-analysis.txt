The use of whole slide image (WSI) analysis in medical imaging has become increasingly important for automated and objective diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutic-response prediction. However, the ever-evolving clinical environment presents challenges for WSI analysis models. To address these challenges, we propose the FIRST continual learning framework called ConSlide. ConSlide tackles issues related to enormous image size, hierarchical structure utilization, and catastrophic forgetting through progressive model updating on multiple sequential datasets. The framework consists of three key components: the Hierarchical Interaction Transformer (HIT) to model and utilize the hierarchical structural knowledge of WSI, the Breakup-Reorganize (BuRo) rehearsal method for WSI data replay using an efficient region storing buffer and WSI reorganizing operation, and an asynchronous updating mechanism that encourages the network to learn generic and specific knowledge during the replay stage, based on a nested cross-scale similarity learning (CSSL) module. We evaluated ConSlide on four public WSI datasets from TCGA projects and found that it outperformed other state-of-the-art methods in a fair WSI-based continual learning setting, achieving a better trade-off between overall performance and forgetting on previous tasks.
