This paper presents a novel approach to illumination planning in photometric stereo. The goal is to find the optimal light configurations that balance accuracy in surface normal estimation and efficiency in image capturing. Previous methods based on handcrafted rules are unable to handle the complexity introduced by factors such as unknown shape and reflectance of the object, global illumination, and choice of photometric stereo backbones. To address this, the proposed method integrates a neural network and a generalized image formation model. Due to the vast search space for ground truth light configurations, it is impractical to supervise the illumination planning process directly. Therefore, reinforcement learning is employed to explore the light space in a photometric stereo-aware and reward-driven manner. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that using the 20-light configurations suggested by our approach yields comparable or even superior results compared to using lights from all available directions.
