The objective of this study is to develop a highly efficient offline LiDAR-based 3D object detection system. The authors observe that human annotators tend to annotate objects based on their trajectory and use temporal information to infer annotations for unclear objects. Taking inspiration from this, the authors propose a track-centric approach for their detector. The proposed system, called CTRL, includes a bidirectional tracking module and a track-centric learning module. This design allows the detector to accurately infer and refine the complete trajectory of an object once it is initially detected. The authors refer to this characteristic as "onCe de-tecTed, neveR Lost." Extensive experiments demonstrate the outstanding performance of their method, surpassing human-level annotation accuracy and previous state-of-the-art methods on the Waymo Open Dataset leaderboard, without the need for model ensemble. The code for the proposed system is available at https://github.com/tusen-ai/SST.
