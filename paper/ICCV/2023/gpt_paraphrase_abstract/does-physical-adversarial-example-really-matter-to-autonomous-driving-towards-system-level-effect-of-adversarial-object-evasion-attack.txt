Accurate perception is crucial for safe and secure autonomous driving. The security of autonomous driving perception has been extensively studied, with a focus on physical adversarial object evasion attacks. However, existing research only evaluates the effect of these attacks on individual AI components, rather than considering the entire system and its context. This raises the question of whether these attacks can effectively achieve system-level effects, such as traffic rule violations, in real-world autonomous driving scenarios. This study examines the effectiveness of existing designs, particularly for STOP sign-evasion attacks. The evaluation results reveal that none of the prior works can achieve system-level effects. Two limitations are identified: inconsistent object size distribution in pixel sampling and a lack of consideration for vehicle and autonomous driving system models. To address these limitations, a new attack design called SysAdv is proposed, which significantly improves system-level effects, increasing the violation rate by approximately 70%.
