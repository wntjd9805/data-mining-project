Fully-supervised methods for shadow removal produce high-quality results on public datasets but still leave behind some remnants of shadows. This is mainly due to the scarcity of large-scale shadow and shadow-free image pairs. Unsupervised methods can address this issue but their restoration quality is significantly lower than that of fully-supervised methods. In this study, we propose pretraining shadow removal networks on an image inpainting dataset as a solution to reduce shadow remnants. We demonstrate that a simple encoder-decoder network pretrained on inpainting data achieves competitive restoration quality compared to state-of-the-art methods using only 10% of shadow and shadow-free image pairs. Through analysis of network weights, we observe that inpainting pretraining improves restoration quality in non-shadow areas and enhances network generalization. Fine-tuning the network for shadow removal further enhances the ability to fill in details in shadow regions. Based on these findings, we propose a novel adaptive fusion network that combines shadow removal and image inpainting techniques. The network consists of two encoders to extract features from the shadow image and the shadow-masked image, an adaptive fusion block to combine these features, and a decoder to generate the desired shadow-free result. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, empowered with inpainting, outperforms all existing state-of-the-art methods.
