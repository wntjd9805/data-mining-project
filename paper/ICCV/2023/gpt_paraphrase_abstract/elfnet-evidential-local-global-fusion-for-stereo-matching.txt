We present the Evidential Local-global Fusion (ELF) framework for stereo matching, addressing the lack of uncertainty estimation and the underutilization of multi-scale and multi-view knowledge. Our approach incorporates both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties into the disparity estimation, resulting in a more reliable disparity map. By employing the normal inverse-Gamma distribution, we achieve intra evidential fusion of multi-level predictions and inter evidential fusion between cost-volume-based and transformer-based stereo matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively leverages multi-view information and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and cross-domain generalization. The code for our framework is available at https://github.com/jimmy19991222/ELFNet.
