This paper introduces a novel method called OCHID-Fi for occluded hand pose estimation (HPE) using Radio-Frequency-Vision (RF-vision). Traditional camera-based methods for HPE are limited by Line-of-Sight (LoS) and cannot capture occluded objects. OCHID-Fi utilizes wideband RF sensors found in smart devices to probe the 3D pose of the human hand and extract skeletal information behind obstacles. To address the challenge of labeling RF imaging, OCHID-Fi employs a cross-modality and cross-domain training process. It leverages a pre-trained camera-based HPE network and a synchronized camera/RF dataset to guide the training of its complex-valued RF-HPE network under LoS conditions. Additionally, OCHID-Fi utilizes adversarial learning to transfer knowledge learned from labeled LoS domain to unlabeled occluded domain, enabling generalization to unseen occluded scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OCHID-Fi achieves comparable accuracy to camera-based HPE methods under normal conditions, while maintaining this accuracy even in occluded scenarios. There is empirical evidence supporting the generalizability of OCHID-Fi to new domains.
