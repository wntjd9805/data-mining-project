We propose a new method for estimating the relative pose of a moving camera using 3D data. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not require prior knowledge of the motion plane, making it more versatile. Instead, we use geometric constraints to identify a unique planar motion solution from a set of motion estimates. We investigate different geometric cases resulting from our approach and evaluate its performance on synthetic data with varying levels of noise and motion types. We integrate our method into a RANSAC framework and demonstrate its robustness on standard benchmark sequences. The source code is available at https://github.com/jdibenes/gpm.
