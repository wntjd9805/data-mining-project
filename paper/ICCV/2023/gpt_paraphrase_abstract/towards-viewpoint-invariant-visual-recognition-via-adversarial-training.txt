Visual recognition models are not able to recognize objects from different viewpoints in the 3D world. The exploration of 3D viewpoint invariance is important and requires more attention. To address this issue, we propose a method called Viewpoint-Invariant Adversarial Training (VIAT) to enhance the viewpoint robustness of image classifiers. VIAT treats viewpoint transformation as an attack and formulates it as a minimax optimization problem. The inner maximization learns a Gaussian mixture distribution by generating diverse adversarial viewpoints using a new attack called GMVFool. The outer minimization trains a viewpoint-invariant classifier by minimizing the expected loss over the worst-case adversarial viewpoint distributions. We also introduce a distribution sharing strategy to improve generalization performance by leveraging the transferability of adversarial viewpoints across objects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of VIAT in improving the viewpoint robustness of different image classifiers using the diverse adversarial viewpoints generated by GMVFool.
