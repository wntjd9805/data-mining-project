Current approaches in weakly supervised person search focus on improving features by exploring person relations. However, the scale variation problem, where a person's images have different scales, is a more significant and understudied obstacle. Small-scale images provide less information about a person, affecting the accuracy of generated pseudo labels. Additionally, differing similarities between cross-scale images make matching more challenging. To address this, we propose a one-step framework, Self-similarity driven Scale-invariant Learning (SSL). By leveraging self-similarity, which indicates the same statistical properties across scales, we introduce a Multi-scale Exemplar Branch to guide the network in learning scale-invariant features through hard exemplar mining. To enhance feature discriminative power, we incorporate dynamic pseudo label prediction for progressive training. Experimental results on PRW and CUHK-SYSU datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in solving the scale variation problem, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
