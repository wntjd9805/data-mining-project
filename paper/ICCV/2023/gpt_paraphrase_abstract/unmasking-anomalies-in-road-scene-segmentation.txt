Traditionally, anomaly segmentation has been approached as a per-pixel classification problem. However, this method lacks consideration of contextual semantics, leading to uncertainty and false positives around object boundaries. In this study, we propose a new approach called Mask2Anomaly, which shifts from per-pixel classification to mask classification. Our method includes several innovative techniques to improve anomaly detection in masks. These techniques include a global masked attention module to focus on foreground and background regions, mask contrastive learning to maximize the margin between anomalies and known classes, and a mask refinement solution to reduce false positives. Mask2Anomaly achieves state-of-the-art results in both per-pixel and component-level evaluations, significantly reducing the average false positives rate by 60% compared to previous methods.
