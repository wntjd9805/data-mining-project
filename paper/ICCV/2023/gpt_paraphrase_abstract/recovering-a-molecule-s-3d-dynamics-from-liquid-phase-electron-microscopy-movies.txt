Current imaging techniques, such as cryo-EM, are limited in their ability to observe the dynamic behavior of biomolecules in real time due to the requirement of freezing the sample. However, a new technique called liquid-phase electron microscopy (liquid-phase EM) allows biomolecules to be studied in their native liquid environment, offering a unique opportunity to observe their dynamics. This paper introduces TEMPOR, a novel algorithm for liquid-phase EM that utilizes an implicit neural representation (INR) and a dynamical variational auto-encoder (DVAE) to reconstruct time series of molecular structures. The effectiveness of TEMPOR is demonstrated through the recovery of various motion dynamics from two simulated datasets, namely 7bcq and Cas9. Notably, this work represents the first endeavor to directly recover the 3D structures of temporally-varying particles from liquid-phase EM movies. The proposed approach holds great promise in advancing the study of molecules' 3D dynamics in the field of structural biology.
