We address the challenges of learning a feature point detector by combining a Shi-Tomasi detector, a stability score metric, and a neural network. Our method, NeSS-ST, utilizes the principled keypoints of the Shi-Tomasi detector and trains the neural network to select good feature points using the stability score. Unlike other methods, NeSS-ST does not require pre-labeling or reconstructed correspondence labels. We evaluate NeSS-ST on multiple datasets and demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance and generalization on downstream tasks.
