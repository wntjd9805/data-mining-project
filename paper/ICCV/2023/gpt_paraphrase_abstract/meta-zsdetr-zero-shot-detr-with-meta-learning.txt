This paper introduces Meta-ZSDETR, a novel method for zero-shot object detection that combines DETR and meta-learning. Unlike previous methods, Meta-ZSDETR directly predicts class-specific boxes using class-specific queries and filters them based on predicted accuracy. The model is trained using meta-contrastive learning, which includes a regression head for generating box coordinates, a classification head for predicting box accuracy, and a contrastive head for separating different classes in visual space. Extensive experiments on MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate that Meta-ZSDETR significantly outperforms existing zero-shot detection methods.
