The current approach used in end-to-end region-based object detectors, such as Sparse R-CNN, involves multiple cascade bounding box decoding stages. However, this method is inefficient as it requires independent model parameters for each stage, resulting in high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a more efficient approach by sharing parameters and implementing a recursive decoder. This recursive decoder can be further improved by using positional encoding (PE), which allows the detector to be aware of the precise locations and sizes of input bounding boxes. Additionally, we introduce centerness-based PE to distinguish the RoI feature element and dynamic convolution kernels at different positions within the bounding box. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive experiments and by building the full model on three popular region-based detectors. Our approach, RecursiveDet, achieves significant performance improvements with fewer model parameters and slightly increased computation cost.
