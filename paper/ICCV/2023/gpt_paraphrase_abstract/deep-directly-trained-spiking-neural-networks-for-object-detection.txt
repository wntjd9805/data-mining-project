We propose EMS-YOLO, a novel framework for directly training spiking neural networks (SNNs) for object detection. Unlike previous approaches that convert artificial neural networks (ANNs) to SNNs, EMS-YOLO trains a deep SNN using surrogate gradients specifically designed for object detection. EMS-ResNet, a full-spike residual block, is introduced to extend the depth of the directly-trained SNN while minimizing power consumption. Theoretical analysis confirms that EMS-ResNet avoids gradient vanishing or exploding. Our approach achieves superior results compared to ANN-SNN conversion methods, requiring only 4 time steps instead of at least 500 time steps. In terms of energy consumption, our model performs comparably to ANNs while consuming 5.83Ã— less energy on the COCO and Gen1 Datasets.
