This study focuses on domain adaptive semantic segmentation, which involves adapting a model trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Existing methods in this field primarily focus on selecting reliable predictions on the target data as pseudo-labels for category learning, while neglecting the useful relationships between pixels for relation learning. In this paper, we propose a framework called RelationTeacher (RTea) that utilizes pixel relations to effectively utilize unreliable pixels and learn generalized representations. Our framework establishes reasonable pseudo-relations on local grids and combines them with low-level relations in the image space, leveraging reliable local relations prior and available low-level relations prior. We then design a pseudo-relation learning strategy and optimize the class probability to ensure relation consistency by identifying the optimal sub-graph division. This approach enhances the model's certainty and prediction consistency on the target domain, while also reducing cross-domain inadaptation. Extensive experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code for implementing our approach can be found at https://github.com/DZhaoXd/RTea.
