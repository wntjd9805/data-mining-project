Accurately predicting the future behavior of road agents is crucial for safe planning in autonomous vehicles. In this study, we present a novel approach called MotionLM, which represents continuous trajectories as sequences of discrete motion tokens and treats multi-agent motion prediction as a language modeling task. Our model offers several advantages. Firstly, it does not require anchors or explicit optimization of latent variables to learn multimodal distributions. Instead, we employ a standard language modeling objective that maximizes the average log probability over sequence tokens. Secondly, our approach eliminates the need for post-hoc interaction heuristics, where individual agent trajectory generation occurs before interactive scoring. Instead, MotionLM generates joint distributions over interactive agent futures in a single autoregressive decoding process. Moreover, the model's sequential factorization allows for temporally causal conditional rollouts. By applying this approach, we achieve state-of-the-art performance for multi-agent motion prediction on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, ranking first on the interactive challenge leaderboard.
