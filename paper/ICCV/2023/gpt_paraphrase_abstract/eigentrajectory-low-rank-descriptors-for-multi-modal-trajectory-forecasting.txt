To predict trajectories accurately, it is important to capture complex social interactions and feasible future scenarios. Previous attempts at reducing dimensionality of output variables using parametric curve fitting techniques like BÂ´ezier curves and B-spline functions have been insufficient in accounting for socially acceptable human dynamics. In this study, we introduce EigenTrajectory (ET), a novel trajectory prediction method that utilizes a unique trajectory descriptor to create a compact space called ET space, which replaces Euclidean space in representing pedestrian movements. Firstly, we simplify the complexity of the trajectory descriptor through a low-rank approximation. Then, we transform the historical paths of pedestrians into ET space using spatio-temporal principle components, which are then inputted into existing trajectory forecasting models. The inputs, outputs, and social interactions are all aggregated within the corresponding ET space. Finally, we propose a trajectory anchor-based refinement approach to encompass all possible future scenarios within the ET space. Through extensive experiments on public benchmarks, we demonstrate that our EigenTrajectory predictor significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of existing trajectory forecasting models, indicating that our proposed descriptor effectively represents pedestrian behaviors. The code for our method is publicly available at https://github.com/inhwanbae/EigenTrajectory.
