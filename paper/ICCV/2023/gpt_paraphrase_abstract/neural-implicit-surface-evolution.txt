This study explores the application of smooth neural networks in modeling dynamic variations of implicit surfaces using the level set equation (LSE). The research extends the representation of neural implicit surfaces to the space-time R3R, allowing for continuous geometric transformations. These transformations include evolving initial surfaces based on vector fields, smoothing and sharpening using the mean curvature equation, and interpolating initial conditions.   The training of the neural network incorporates two constraints. The data term ensures that the initial condition fits the corresponding time instant, typically R3 0. The LSE term compels the network to approximate the geometric evolution dictated by the LSE, without requiring any supervision. Furthermore, the network can be initialized using previously trained initial conditions, resulting in faster convergence compared to the standard approach.
