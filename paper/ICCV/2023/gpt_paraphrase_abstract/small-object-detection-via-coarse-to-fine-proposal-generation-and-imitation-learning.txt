In recent years, object detection has seen significant advancements, but current detectors struggle to effectively detect small objects. The main challenge is the low overlap between the priors and object regions, which limits the sample pool for optimization and hampers recognition due to the lack of discriminative information. To address these issues, we propose CFINet, a two-stage framework designed specifically for small object detection. In the first stage, we introduce Coarse-to-fine RPN (CRPN) to generate sufficient and high-quality proposals for small objects. This is achieved through a dynamic anchor selection strategy and cascade regression. In the second stage, we enhance the conventional detection head with a Feature Imitation (FI) branch. This branch helps improve the region representations of size-limited instances by imitating successful examples. To optimize this branch, we devise an auxiliary imitation loss using supervised contrastive learning. When integrated with Faster RCNN, CFINet outperforms baseline detectors and other mainstream detection approaches on the SODA-D and SODA-A large-scale small object detection benchmarks.
