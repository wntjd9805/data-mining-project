Learning-based registration methods have been proven to be more effective and accurate than traditional methods for aligning large-scale 3D point clouds. These methods can be trained without supervision for problems involving locally rigid structures. However, existing approaches using self-supervision with regularization and point distance losses have been unsuccessful in tasks involving highly deformable structures, such as aligning pulmonary vascular trees for medical diagnostics. As a result, complex synthetic augmentation strategies have been necessary to obtain reliable supervision.  In this study, we introduce a new technique called Differentiable Volumetric Rasterisation of point Clouds (DiVRoC) that addresses these limitations and provides an efficient and accurate loss function for large-scale deformable 3D registration. DiVRoC significantly reduces the computational complexity of measuring point cloud distances for high-resolution data containing over 100k 3D points. It can also be used to extrapolate and regularize sparse motion fields, both as a loss function in a self-training setting and as an objective function in instance optimization.  DiVRoC can be seamlessly integrated into geometric registration networks, including PointPWC-Net and other graph CNNs. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the challenging PVT dataset in three different settings, without the need for training with manual ground truth. These settings include unsupervised metric-based learning, self-supervised learning with pseudo labels generated through self-training, and optimization-based alignment without learning.
