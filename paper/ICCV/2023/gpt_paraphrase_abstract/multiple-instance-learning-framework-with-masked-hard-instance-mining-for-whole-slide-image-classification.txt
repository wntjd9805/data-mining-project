The classification of whole slide images (WSI) is often approached as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. Existing MIL methods tend to focus on identifying salient instances using attention mechanisms, leading to a bias towards easy-to-classify instances and neglecting difficult ones. However, it has been shown that including hard examples can improve the accuracy of discriminative boundary modeling. To address this, we propose a novel MIL framework called masked hard instance mining (MHIM-MIL). MHIM-MIL utilizes a Siamese structure with a consistency constraint to explore potential hard instances. By employing various instance masking strategies based on attention scores, MHIM-MIL uses a momentum teacher to implicitly identify and train on hard instances for the student model. This counter-intuitive strategy allows the student to learn a better discriminative boundary. Additionally, the student updates the teacher using an exponential moving average (EMA), which in turn identifies new hard instances for subsequent training iterations and stabilizes the optimization process. Experimental results on the CAMELYON-16 and TCGA Lung Cancer datasets demonstrate that MHIM-MIL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and training cost.
