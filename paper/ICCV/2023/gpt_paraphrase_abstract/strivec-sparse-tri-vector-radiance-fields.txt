We propose a new neural representation called Strivec, which models a 3D scene as a radiance field using sparsely distributed and compactly factorized local tensor feature grids. Our approach builds on the tensor decomposition technique used in TensoRF to model the tensor grids. However, instead of using a global tensor, we utilize a cloud of local tensors and apply the CP decomposition to factorize each tensor into triple vectors that express local feature distributions and encode a local neural field. We also incorporate multi-scale tensor grids to identify commonalities in geometry and appearance and leverage spatial coherence through the tri-vector factorization at different scales. The final radiance field properties are determined by aggregating neural features from multiple local tensors across all scales. We strategically distribute our tri-vector tensors around the scene surface, which is discovered through a fast coarse reconstruction process that takes advantage of the sparsity of the 3D scene. Our model demonstrates superior rendering quality while utilizing fewer parameters compared to previous methods like TensoRF and Instant-NGP.
