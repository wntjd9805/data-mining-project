We investigate the production of 3D-aware full-body human avatars with high-quality textures and geometries. The main challenges in this field are generating realistic garment details and performing high-resolution rendering. To address these challenges, we propose GETAvatar, a generative model that creates animatable human avatars with explicit textured 3D meshes and photo-realistic appearance. Our approach involves designing an articulated 3D representation and incorporating realistic surface details from 2D normal maps of 3D scan data. By using a rasterization-based renderer, we can efficiently generate high-resolution images. Experimental results demonstrate that GETAvatar outperforms existing methods in both appearance and geometry quality. Notably, GETAvatar achieves faster image generation at higher resolutions compared to previous approaches. The code and models are available at https://getavatar.github.io/.
