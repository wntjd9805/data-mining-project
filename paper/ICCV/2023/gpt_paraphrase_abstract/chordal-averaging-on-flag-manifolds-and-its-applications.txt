This paper introduces a novel algorithm for computing the flag-mean and flag-median of a set of points on a flag manifold using the chordal metric. The flag manifold is a mathematical space consisting of nested subspaces of a vector space that increase in dimension. It encompasses various matrix spaces such as Stiefel and Grassmanians, making it applicable to a wide range of computer vision problems. To address the challenge of computing first order flag statistics, the problem is transformed into one involving auxiliary variables constrained to the Stiefel manifold, which represents orthogonal frames. By leveraging the stability and efficiency of Stiefel-manifold optimization, the flag-mean can be computed effectively. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in tasks such as Grassmann and rotation averaging, as well as principal component analysis.
