Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task in computer vision that can have a positive impact on society. Despite recent advancements in this field, the issue of privacy has been largely overlooked. It is crucial to incorporate ethical considerations into the development of artificial intelligence technologies, as privacy leakage in VAD can lead to biased decision-making based on personal information. This paper introduces TeD-SPAD, a privacy-aware framework for video anomaly detection that eliminates visual private information in a self-supervised manner. The proposed method utilizes a temporally-distinct triplet loss to enhance the discrimination of temporal features, complementing existing weakly-supervised VAD approaches. Experimental results on popular datasets demonstrate that TeD-SPAD achieves a favorable balance between privacy protection and utility in anomaly detection performance. Our anonymization model reduces private attribute prediction by 32.25% while only causing a marginal decrease of 3.69% in frame-level ROC AUC on the UCF-Crime anomaly detection dataset.
