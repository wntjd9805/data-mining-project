We introduce VADER, a method designed to combat the spread of misinformation through manipulated videos. VADER utilizes a visual descriptor and scalable search to match and roughly align video fragments with candidate videos. Additionally, a transformer-based alignment module is employed to refine the temporal localization of the query fragment within the matched video. A space-time comparator module is then used to identify manipulated regions in the aligned content, disregarding any changes caused by temporal misalignments or non-editorial alterations. By effectively matching videos to trusted sources, VADER allows for informed trust decisions regarding encountered content. The code and data for VADER can be found at https://github.com/AlexBlck/vader.
