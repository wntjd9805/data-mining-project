We present SAMPLING, a novel approach for synthesizing novel views from a single image in unbounded outdoor scenes. Existing methods excel in small scenes but struggle with large outdoor scenes. SAMPLING addresses this issue by introducing an adaptive-bins strategy for arranging planes in the multiplane images (MPI) representation. This strategy takes into account the varying depth distribution of outdoor scenes. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical refinement branch to capture intricate geometry and multi-scale details, resulting in high-quality synthesized views. Our method achieves significant performance improvements on the KITTI dataset for large-scale outdoor scenes and generalizes well to unseen scenes. The code and models are available at https://pkuvdig.github.io/SAMPLING/.
