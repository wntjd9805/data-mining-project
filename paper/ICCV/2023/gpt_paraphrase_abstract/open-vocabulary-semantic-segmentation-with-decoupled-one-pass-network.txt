Recently, there has been increasing interest in the open-vocabulary semantic segmentation problem. The most effective methods for this problem involve two-stream networks, with one stream generating proposal masks and the other performing segment classification using a pre-trained visual-language model. However, existing two-stream methods are inefficient because they require passing a large number of image crops through the visual-language model. To address this issue, we propose a network that only requires a single pass through the visual-language model for each input image.   Our approach involves two key innovations. First, we introduce a novel network adaptation technique called patch severance. This technique limits the negative interference between patch embeddings in the pre-trained visual encoder, improving overall performance. Second, we propose classification anchor learning, which encourages the network to focus on more discriminative features for classification.   Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. It achieves outstanding performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, while also being 4 to 7 times faster during inference. The code for our method can be found at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/CongHan0808/DeOP.git.
