Monocular and binocular self-supervised depth estimation are important tasks in computer vision, involving the prediction of scene depths from single images and stereo image pairs, respectively. Traditionally, these tasks have been addressed separately using different models. However, binocular models struggle to predict depth from single images, while monocular models generally have lower accuracy than binocular models. To address these limitations, we propose a novel network called TiO-Depth, which can handle both monocular and binocular depth estimation tasks and improve prediction accuracy. TiO-Depth utilizes a Siamese architecture, with each sub-network serving as a monocular depth estimation model. For binocular depth estimation, we introduce a Monocular Feature Matching module to incorporate stereo knowledge between the two images. The full TiO-Depth network is then used to predict depths. To further enhance the performance of TiO-Depth, we design a multi-stage joint-training strategy that combines the advantages of both monocular and binocular models. Experimental results on the KITTI, Cityscapes, and DDAD datasets demonstrate that TiO-Depth outperforms state-of-the-art methods in most cases for both monocular and binocular depth estimation. This validates the feasibility of a two-in-one network for solving these tasks. The code for TiO-Depth is available at https://github.com/ZM-Zhou/TiO-Depth pytorch.
