Supervised deep learning methods have shown excellent performance in image denoising, but their widespread use is hindered by the lack of paired noisy-clean images. Self-supervised denoising methods are also ineffective in real-world tasks due to their strict assumptions. To address this, we propose a novel self-supervised framework called Sampling Difference As Perturbation (SDAP) based on Random Sub-samples Generation (RSG) with a cyclic sample difference loss. We enhance the original blind spot network (BSN) by introducing perturbations to the training images, leading to improved performance. We also demonstrate that sampling difference can be considered as a perturbation for better results. Our proposed BSN framework, combined with the RSG strategy, achieves superior performance compared to other self-supervised denoising methods on real-world datasets.
