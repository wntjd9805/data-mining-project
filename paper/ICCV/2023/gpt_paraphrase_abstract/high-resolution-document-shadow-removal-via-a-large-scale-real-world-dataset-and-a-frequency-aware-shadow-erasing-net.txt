Shadows often appear in digital copies of documents captured using casual equipment, affecting their visual quality and readability. Unlike algorithms for natural shadow removal, document shadow removal algorithms need to preserve the details of fonts and figures in high-resolution input. However, previous methods have overlooked this issue and relied on approximate attention and small datasets, which may not be effective in real-world scenarios. In this study, we address the problem of high-resolution document shadow removal by using a larger-scale real-world dataset and a carefully-designed frequency-aware network. We collected over 7,000 pairs of high-resolution images of real-world documents, each with a resolution of 2462 Ã— 3699 pixels, under various lighting conditions. This dataset is ten times larger than existing datasets. Additionally, we decoupled the high-resolution images in the frequency domain and designed a network structure that effectively learns the low-frequency details and high-frequency boundaries. Our proposed method, powered by this network and dataset, outperforms previous methods in terms of visual quality and numerical results.
