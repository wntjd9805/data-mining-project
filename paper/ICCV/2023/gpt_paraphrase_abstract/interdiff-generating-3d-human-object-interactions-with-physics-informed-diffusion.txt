This paper introduces a new approach for predicting 3D human-object interactions (HOIs) that are realistic, vivid, and have long-term predictions. Previous research in HOI synthesis has focused on limited interactions with small or static objects, lacking comprehensive whole-body interactions with dynamic objects. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a framework called InterDiff, which consists of two main steps: interaction diffusion and interaction correction. In the interaction diffusion step, a diffusion model is used to encode the distribution of future human-object interactions. In the interaction correction step, a physics-informed predictor is introduced to correct denoised HOIs obtained in the diffusion step. The key insight of this approach is to incorporate prior knowledge that interactions involving contact points follow a simple pattern and can be easily predicted. Experimental results on multiple human-object interaction datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for this task.
