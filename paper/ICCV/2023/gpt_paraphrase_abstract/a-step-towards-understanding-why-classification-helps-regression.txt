Adding a classification loss to computer vision deep regression models has been proven to enhance their performance. This study aims to investigate the practical significance and benefits of incorporating a classification loss in these models. By conducting experiments on controlled dataset variations and data samplings, the researchers discovered that the impact of adding a classification loss is particularly pronounced when dealing with imbalanced data in regression tasks. They further elucidated these empirical findings by establishing a formal relationship between balanced and imbalanced regression losses. The researchers validated their conclusions on real-world imbalanced image datasets for depth estimation (NYUD2-DIR) and age estimation (IMDB-WIKI-DIR), as well as on the problem of imbalanced video progress prediction (Break-fast). The key takeaway from this study is that when performing regression on imbalanced data, incorporating a classification loss yields improved results.
