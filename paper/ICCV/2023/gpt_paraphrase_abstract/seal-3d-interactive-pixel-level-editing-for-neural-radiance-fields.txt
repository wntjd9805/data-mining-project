With the increasing popularity of neural radiance fields (NeRF) as implicit neural representations for 3D models, there is a strong demand for editing methods that can interact with these models for tasks such as post-processing and content creation. Previous approaches to NeRF editing have limitations in terms of flexibility, quality, and speed, as they do not provide direct editing response and instant preview. The main challenge lies in developing a locally editable neural representation that can accurately reflect editing instructions and update in real-time. To address this challenge, we propose a new interactive editing method and system called Seal-3D. Seal-3D allows users to edit NeRF models at a pixel-level and in a flexible manner, while providing a wide range of editing options and instant preview of the effects. To achieve these effects, we introduce a proxy function that maps editing instructions to the original space of NeRF models in the teacher model, and a two-stage training strategy for the student model involving local pretraining and global finetuning. We have built a NeRF editing system that demonstrates various editing types, and it is capable of producing compelling editing effects with an interactive speed of approximately 1 second.
