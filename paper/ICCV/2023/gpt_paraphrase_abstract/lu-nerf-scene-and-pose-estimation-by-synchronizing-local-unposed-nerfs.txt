NeRF models face a major challenge in their widespread deployment due to their reliance on accurate camera poses. To address this, there is a growing interest in extending NeRF models to optimize camera poses and scene representation simultaneously, offering an alternative to commonly used SfM pipelines that have known limitations. However, existing approaches for unposed NeRF have limitations, such as prior pose distribution or coarse pose initialization, which make them less effective in a general setting. In this study, we propose a new approach called LU-NeRF that jointly estimates camera poses and neural radiance fields without restrictive assumptions on pose configuration. Our approach works in a local-to-global manner, optimizing over local subsets of the data known as "mini-scenes." LU-NeRF accurately estimates local pose and geometry for this challenging few-shot task. The mini-scene poses are then aligned with a global reference frame through a robust pose synchronization step, allowing for a final global optimization of pose and scene. Our LU-NeRF pipeline outperforms previous unposed NeRF attempts without relying on restrictive pose assumptions. Unlike the baseline methods, our model can operate in the general SE(3) pose setting. Additionally, our results indicate that our model can complement feature-based SfM pipelines, as it performs favorably compared to COLMAP on low-texture and low-resolution images.
