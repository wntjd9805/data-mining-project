This study introduces a novel approach to unsupervised anomaly detection using a denoising model based on a generative diffusion model. Unlike previous methods that rely on inaccurate reconstruction results, our model introduces random noise to accurately detect and localize anomalies in images. By incorporating the KL divergence of the diffusion model, we obtain more reliable anomaly scores compared to traditional RGB-based scores. Additionally, we enhance the localization performance by reconstructing features from a pre-trained deep feature extractor. Furthermore, we propose a gradient denoising process to smoothly transform anomalous images into normal ones. Our denoising model surpasses existing reconstruction-based methods in terms of precise anomaly localization and high-quality normal image reconstruction on the MVTec-AD benchmark.
