We introduce FUS3D, a lightweight and fast system designed for real-time 3D object detection and tracking on edge devices. Our system combines 3D object detection and multi-object tracking into a single model that can be trained end-to-end. FUS3D is specifically optimized for analyzing indoor 3D human behavior, making it suitable for applications such as Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) or surveillance. The system is designed to run efficiently on edge devices, allowing for processing of sensitive data close to the sensor. Furthermore, FUS3D exclusively utilizes 3D depth imaging, which is less intrusive to privacy, making it well-suited for sensitive areas. While FUS3D performs best when used for joint detection and tracking, the detection stage can also function independently as a fast object detection model if needed. We extensively evaluated FUS3D on the MIPT dataset and demonstrated its superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of 3D object detection, multi-object tracking, and runtime.
