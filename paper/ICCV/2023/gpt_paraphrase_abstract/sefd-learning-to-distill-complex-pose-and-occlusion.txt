This paper proposes a novel approach called Skinned Multi-Person Linear (SMPL) Edge Feature Distillation (SEFD) for addressing the problem of estimating three-dimensional (3D) human mesh in complex poses and occluded situations. While previous methods have made improvements by using two-dimensional (2D) pose estimation with occlusion between humans, the challenge of occlusion from complex poses and other objects still persists. The proposed SEFD model tackles this issue by generating an SMPL overlapping edge similar to the ground truth, which contains information about the target person's boundary and occlusion. This is achieved without increasing the number of parameters compared to the baseline model. The model then performs feature distillation on a simple edge map. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments on various benchmarks, showing both qualitative and quantitative improvements. The results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 2.8% in mean per joint position error (MPJPE) and 1.9% in mean per vertex position error (MPVPE) on the 3DPW dataset, even in the presence of domain gap. Our method also outperforms existing methods on datasets such as 3DPW-OCC, 3DPW-PC, RH-Dataset, OCHuman, Crowd-Pose, and LSP dataset, where occlusion, complex pose, and domain gap are present. The code and occlusion & complex pose annotation for our method will be made available at the provided GitHub link.
