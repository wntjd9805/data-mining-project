Trajectory prediction is a critical task in developing autonomous driving systems to ensure safety. The challenge lies in generating consistent predictions without collisions. To tackle this, we propose Traj-MAE, an efficient masked autoencoder for trajectory prediction. Traj-MAE employs diverse masking strategies to pre-train the trajectory encoder and map encoder, enabling the capture of social and temporal information among agents and accounting for environmental factors at various levels of detail. To overcome the problem of catastrophic forgetting during pre-training, we introduce a continual pre-training framework that allows Traj-MAE to efficiently learn valuable and diverse information from different strategies. Our experiments in both multi-agent and single-agent scenarios show that Traj-MAE achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods and significantly outperforms our baseline model.
