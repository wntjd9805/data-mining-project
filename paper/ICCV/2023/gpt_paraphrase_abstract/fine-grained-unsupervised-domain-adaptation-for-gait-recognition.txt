Gait recognition is a promising technique for identifying pedestrians, but labeling datasets for fully supervised approaches is expensive. Unsupervised methods have shown promise, but they often forget source domain knowledge. This paper proposes a new approach that leverages the overlapping views of adjacent-view sequences to gradually learn cross-view and cross-dressing capabilities without pre-training on labeled data. The proposed framework involves offline clustering to transfer knowledge and generate pseudo-labels, followed by online training to distinguish features of source and target domains. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through experiments on public gait datasets.
