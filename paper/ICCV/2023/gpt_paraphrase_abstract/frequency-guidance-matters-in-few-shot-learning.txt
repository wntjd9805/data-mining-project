This paper explores the impact of different frequency components on few-shot learning tasks, which aim to recognize unseen classes with limited labeled support samples. While most existing few-shot learning methods focus on spatial information, this study emphasizes the importance of frequency representation in classification tasks. To improve the performance and generalizability of few-shot methods, a novel Frequency-Guided Few-shot Learning framework (FGFL) is proposed. This framework utilizes task-specific frequency components to adaptively mask corresponding image information. It incorporates a multi-level metric learning strategy, including a triplet loss involving original, masked, and unmasked images, as well as a contrastive loss between masked and original support and query sets, to extract more discriminative information. The proposed FGFL scheme is evaluated through extensive experiments on four benchmarks, covering various few-shot scenarios such as standard, cross-dataset, cross-domain, and coarse-to-fine annotated classification. Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the FGFL scheme effectively attends to class-discriminative frequency components, leading to improved few-shot learning performance and generalizability.
