This paper addresses the problem of estimating time-to-contact (TTC) using a single event camera, which has a high temporal resolution. Previous methods assume planar and fronto-parallel surfaces, but we relax this assumption by proposing an incremental event-based method that estimates the inverse depth and global motion. Our method is reliable and fast, and maintains a TTC map (TTCM) asynchronously, providing per-pixel TTC estimates. Additionally, our method can estimate per-event optical flow. We achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and runtime per event for TTC estimation, and competitive performance for optical flow estimation.
