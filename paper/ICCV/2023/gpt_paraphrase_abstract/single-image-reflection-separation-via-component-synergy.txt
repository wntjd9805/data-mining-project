The phenomenon of reflection superposition is complex and prevalent in the real world. To address this, previous models have developed simplified linear and nonlinear formulations. However, these models have their limitations. In this study, we propose a more comprehensive superposition model that introduces a learnable residue term. This term effectively captures residual information during decomposition, ensuring the separated layers are complete. Additionally, we have designed a network structure that includes a novel dual-stream interaction mechanism and a powerful decomposition network with a semantic pyramid encoder. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies on various real-world benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods.
