In this study, the researchers address the challenge of animating real-world fluids using only a still image. They propose a surface-based layered representation approach, which separates the scene into a fluid layer and a background layer with corresponding transparencies. By warping and combining only the fluid layer based on estimated fluid motions, they can generate an animated video. Instead of traditional motion estimation, they introduce a surface-only fluid simulation using a triangular mesh and a monocular depth estimator. This simulation incorporates classic physics theory and a learnable network to handle complex real-world image textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of their method for common fluid scenes and its improved robustness and reasonability for complex transparent fluid scenarios. Additionally, their surface-based layer representation and surface-only fluid simulation enable easy interactive editing such as adding objects and replacing textures. The code and dataset used in this work are publicly available.
