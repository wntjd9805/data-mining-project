Synthetic data has the potential to provide inexpensive and abundant training data when there is a scarcity of labeled real-world data. However, models trained on synthetic data perform poorly when tested on real-world data. This paper introduces a straightforward and effective augmentation strategy called Proportional Amplitude Spectrum Training Augmentation (PASTA) to enhance the generalization performance of synthetic-to-real (syn-to-real) models. PASTA modifies the amplitude spectra of synthetic images in the Fourier domain to create augmented views. The perturbation strategy in PASTA focuses on perturbing high-frequency components more than low-frequency ones. Through experiments in semantic segmentation, object detection, and object recognition tasks across five syn-to-real shifts, PASTA demonstrates superior performance compared to more complex state-of-the-art generalization methods while also complementing them.
