We present a technique for simplifying and abstracting complex indoor scenes by breaking them down into basic shapes called convexes. Our approach involves using a regression algorithm to parse the scene from RGBD input and generate a fixed number of convexes. Additionally, we can incorporate segmentations to enhance the decomposition process. To refine the output, we employ a descent method that adjusts the convexes for a more accurate fit, while also removing unnecessary primitives. By parsing the entire scene, we are able to evaluate the results using traditional depth, normal, and segmentation error metrics. Our evaluation demonstrates that the error introduced by our primitive representation is comparable to predicting depth from a single image.
