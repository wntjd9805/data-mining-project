In this paper, we address the challenge of generalization in image manipulation detection due to semantically related features. We propose SAFL-Net, a method that constrains a feature extractor to learn semantic-agnostic features by incorporating specific modules and auxiliary tasks. By applying constraints to the extracted features, we enable the encoder to learn manipulation trace features that are not biased by semantic information, thereby improving generalization capabilities. We ensure the consistency between the auxiliary boundary prediction task and the original region prediction task through a feature transformation structure. Experimental results on various public datasets and comparisons in multiple dimensions demonstrate the effectiveness of SAFL-Net for image manipulation detection.
