We introduce a new technique called NeTO for capturing the 3D shape of solid transparent objects from 2D images using volume rendering. Reconstructing transparent objects is challenging due to the way light behaves when passing through them. Existing methods designed for this task have limitations in optimization and preservation of fine details. In this paper, we propose using an implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) representation and optimizing it through volume rendering with a refractive ray tracing approach that considers self-occlusion. Our method can achieve high-quality reconstructions even with a limited number of views and accurately reconstruct self-occluded regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches and produces faithful reconstructions. For more information, visit our project page at https://www.xxlong.site/NeTO/.
