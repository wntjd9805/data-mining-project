We propose a method called NeRCo for enhancing low-light images. Existing methods face limitations such as unpredictable brightness degradation and noise, a gap between metric-favorable and visually-friendly versions, and limited training data. NeRCo addresses these limitations by recovering perceptually-friendly results in an unsupervised manner. It combines diverse degradation factors with a controllable fitting function to improve robustness. It also introduces semantic-oriented supervision using priors from a pre-trained vision-language model to encourage visually-friendly solutions. To reduce reliance on paired data and narrow down the solution space, a dual-closed-loop constrained enhancement module is developed and trained in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of NeRCo. The code for NeRCo is available at https://github.com/Ysz2022/NeRCo.
