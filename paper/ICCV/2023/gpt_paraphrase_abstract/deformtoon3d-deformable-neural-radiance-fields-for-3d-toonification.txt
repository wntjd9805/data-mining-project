This paper presents DEFORMTOON3D, a framework for 3D toonification that transfers artistic styles onto 3D faces with stylized geometry and texture. Fine-tuning a pre-trained 3DGAN on the artistic domain has limitations in the 3D domain, as it can deteriorate the original GAN latent space and hinder subsequent semantic editing. To overcome these challenges, DEFORMTOON3D decomposes 3D toonification into geometry and texture stylization subproblems. It introduces a StyleField that predicts conditional 3D deformation to align a real-space NeRF to the style space for geometry stylization. This formulation allows for convenient texture stylization through adaptive style mixing in the decoder of the pre-trained 3D GAN. The unique design of DEFORMTOON3D enables flexible style degree control and shape-texture-specific style swap. The framework achieves efficient training without real-world 2D-3D training pairs, instead using proxy samples synthesized from off-the-shelf 2D toonification models.
