FSS (Few-shot segmentation) is a technique used to segment a specific class using only a small number of labeled images. The current approach in FSS methods involves removing background features using a support mask to focus on the target class. However, this method creates a bottleneck in information flow in challenging FSS scenarios, such as when dealing with small targets or inaccurate boundaries. In response, we propose a new method called MSI (Maximize Support Set Information) that enhances support-set information by utilizing two complementary sources of features to generate highly correlated maps. We have integrated MSI into three existing strong FSS methods and conducted experiments on various FSS benchmarks. The results consistently demonstrate improved performance and faster convergence compared to the original methods.
