Semi-Supervised Temporal Action Localization (SS-TAL) aims to enhance the generalization ability of action detectors using unlabeled videos. However, a major challenge in this field is the presence of noisy pseudo labels, which introduce location biases and category errors that impede efficient learning. In this study, we extensively investigate this issue and propose a unified framework called Noisy Pseudo-Label Learning. Our approach addresses both location biases and category errors through three key components: Noisy Label Ranking, Noisy Label Filtering, and Noisy Label Learning. Noisy Label Ranking ranks pseudo labels based on semantic confidence and boundary reliability, while Noisy Label Filtering handles the class-imbalance problem caused by category errors. Finally, Noisy Label Learning penalizes inconsistent boundary predictions to enable noise-tolerant learning for heavy location biases. Our method effectively tackles label noise and improves the utilization of large amounts of unlabeled videos. Experimental results on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet v1.3 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, and the code is available at github.com/kunnxia/NPL.
