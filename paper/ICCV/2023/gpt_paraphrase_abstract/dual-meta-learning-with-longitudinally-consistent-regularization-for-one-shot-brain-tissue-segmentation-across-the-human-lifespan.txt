Brain tissue segmentation is crucial for both neuroscience and clinical research. However, segmenting brain tissue in longitudinal data poses challenges due to dynamic changes that occur in the brain throughout a person's lifespan. Previous studies have mainly focused on self-supervision techniques with regularizations, but these approaches lose their ability to generalize across different age groups when fine-tuning is performed. In this paper, we propose a dual meta-learning approach to address this issue and achieve consistent representations that persist during fine-tuning. Our method involves learning a plug-and-play feature extractor using meta-feature learning to extract anatomical representations that are consistent over time, as well as a well-initialized task head for fine-tuning using meta-initialization learning. Additionally, we introduce two class-aware regularizations to promote longitudinal consistency. We evaluate our method on the iSeg2019 and ADNI datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness. The code for our method is publicly available at https://github.com/ladderlab-xjtu/DuMeta.
