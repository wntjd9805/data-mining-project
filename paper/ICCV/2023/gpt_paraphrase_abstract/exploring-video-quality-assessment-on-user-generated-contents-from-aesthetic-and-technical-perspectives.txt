The rise of user-generated content (UGC) videos necessitates the development of effective algorithms for video quality assessment (VQA). However, the objective of the UGC-VQA problem is still unclear and can be approached from two angles: the technical perspective, which measures the perception of distortions, and the aesthetic perspective, which pertains to preference and recommendation of content. To comprehend how these perspectives impact overall subjective opinions in UGC-VQA, we conducted a large-scale study to gather human quality opinions on video quality, as well as perceptions from both aesthetic and technical perspectives. The resulting Disentangled Video Quality Database (DIVIDE-3k) confirmed that human quality opinions on UGC videos are unavoidably influenced by both aesthetic and technical perspectives. In light of this, we propose the Disentangled Objective Video Quality Evaluator (DOVER) to learn the quality of UGC videos based on these two perspectives. DOVER demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in UGC-VQA with high efficiency. Building on the perspective opinions in DIVIDE-3k, we further introduce DOVER++, the first approach to provide reliable quality evaluations from a single aesthetic or technical perspective. The code for DOVER can be found at https://github.com/VQAssessment/DOVER.
