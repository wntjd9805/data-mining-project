We present LDL, a speedy and reliable algorithm that utilizes line segments to localize a panorama on a 3D map. Unlike previous methods, LDL focuses on the sparse structural information of lines, which is resistant to changes in lighting conditions and allows for efficient computation. Our approach effectively analyzes the overall distribution of lines in panoramic images and 3D maps. LDL matches the distribution of lines using 2D and 3D line distance functions, decomposed along the principal directions of lines to enhance expressiveness. By comparing the distributional information, the distance functions provide initial estimates of the pose, which are further optimized using traditional local feature matching. Our pipeline exclusively relies on line geometry and local features, eliminating the need for costly additional training or correspondence matching. Despite this simplicity, our method demonstrates robust performance in challenging scenarios, such as changes in object layout, lighting variations, and large-scale scenes. Additionally, it achieves fast pose search times, terminating within milliseconds. We believe that our method offers a practical solution for line-based localization and complements the established point-based paradigm.
