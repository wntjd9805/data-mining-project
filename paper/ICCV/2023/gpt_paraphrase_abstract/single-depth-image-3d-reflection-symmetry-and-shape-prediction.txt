This paper introduces ISCNet, a method for shape completion using depth images that leverages reflective symmetry cues to enhance shape details. The accuracy of single depth-image shape completion methods is often influenced by the precision of the symmetry plane. To address this, ISCNet simultaneously estimates the symmetry plane and shape completion iteratively. This iterative process ensures that more complete shapes contribute to more reliable symmetry plane estimates and vice versa. Additionally, ISCNet operates in the image domain, enabling efficient high-resolution geometry reconstruction. The shape completion is performed using pairs of viewpoints reflected across the symmetry plane, predicted by a reinforcement learning agent. This approach improves robustness and explicitly utilizes symmetry. The effectiveness of ISCNet is demonstrated on various object categories, utilizing both synthetic and real-scanned datasets.
