We address the challenge of estimating a Manhattan frame, which consists of three orthogonal vanishing points and the unknown focal length of a camera. This estimation is aided by utilizing a prior vertical direction, which can be obtained from an Inertial Measurement Unit commonly found in consumer devices such as smartphones. Our approach involves conducting a comprehensive analysis of minimal line configurations and introducing two novel 2-line solvers. Unlike existing solvers, one of our solvers is not affected by singularities. Furthermore, we develop a new non-minimal method that operates on any number of lines to enhance performance in local optimization. By combining all solvers into a hybrid robust estimator, our method achieves improved accuracy even with a rough prior. We validate the efficacy of our approach through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods while maintaining comparable runtimes. Additionally, we showcase the applicability of our solvers for relative rotation estimation. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/cvg/VP-Estimation-with-Prior-Gravity.
