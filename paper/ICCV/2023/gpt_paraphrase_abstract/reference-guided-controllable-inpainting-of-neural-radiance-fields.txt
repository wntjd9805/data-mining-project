Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have gained popularity for view synthesis, leading to a demand for NeRF editing tools. This study focuses on inpainting regions in a manner that is consistent with the views and controllable. Instead of multiple inpainted views, only a single reference view is required, along with NeRF inputs and masks to identify unwanted regions in each view. By using monocular depth estimators, the inpainted view is back-projected to the correct 3D positions. A novel rendering technique, coupled with a bilateral solver, is then utilized to create view-dependent effects in non-reference views, ensuring that the inpainted region appears consistent from any view. For non-reference disoccluded regions, which cannot be supervised by the single reference view, a method based on image inpainters is devised to guide both the geometry and appearance. This approach outperforms NeRF inpainting baselines and offers the additional advantage of user control through a single inpainted image. For more information, please refer to our project page.
