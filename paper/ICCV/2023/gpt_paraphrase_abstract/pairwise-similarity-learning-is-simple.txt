This paper focuses on pairwise similarity learning (PSL), which is a broad and significant learning problem with applications in various fields such as face recognition, speaker verification, image retrieval, and person re-identification. The objective of PSL is to develop a similarity function that assigns higher scores to positive pairs (samples with the same label) compared to negative pairs (samples with different labels). The paper discusses the desired qualities of PSL and reviews existing methods that meet these criteria. Additionally, a new method called SimPLE is proposed, which is a straightforward approach that does not require feature/proxy normalization or angular margin, yet still performs well in open-set recognition. The SimPLE method is applied to challenging PSL tasks including face recognition, image retrieval, and speaker verification. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that SimPLE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods significantly.
