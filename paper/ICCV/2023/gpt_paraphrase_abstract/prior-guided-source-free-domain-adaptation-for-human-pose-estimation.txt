Domain adaptation methods for 2D human pose estimation often require continuous access to the source data during adaptation. However, this can be difficult due to various constraints such as privacy, memory, or computational limitations. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new approach called source-free domain adaptation for pose estimation. This approach aims to adapt a source model to a new target domain using only unlabeled target data. While there have been advancements in source-free methods for classification tasks, extending them to the regression task of pose estimation is not straightforward. In this paper, we introduce a method called Prior-guided Self-training (POST) that addresses this issue. POST is based on the popular Mean Teacher framework and utilizes prediction-level and feature-level consistency between a student and teacher model under certain image transformations. In the absence of source data, POST incorporates a human pose prior to guide the adaptation process and generate more accurate and anatomically plausible pose pseudo-labels. Despite its simplicity, our framework achieves significant performance improvements compared to directly applying the source model to the target data. Our extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that POST performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods that utilize source data for adaptation.
