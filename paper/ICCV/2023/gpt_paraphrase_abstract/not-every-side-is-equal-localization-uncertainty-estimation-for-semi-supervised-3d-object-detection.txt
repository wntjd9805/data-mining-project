This paper presents a novel approach to semi-supervised 3D object detection from point cloud data. The goal is to train a detector using a limited number of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. Existing methods focus on selecting high-quality pseudo-labels for training, but they treat each pseudo bounding box as a whole and assign equal importance to all sides, which negatively impacts model performance due to poor localization quality on many sides. Additionally, these methods filter out a significant number of low-quality pseudo-labels, which may contain some correct regression values useful for training. To address these issues, the proposed approach introduces a side-aware framework consisting of three key components: a 3D bounding box parameterization method, an uncertainty estimation module, and a pseudo-label selection strategy. These components work together to explicitly estimate the localization quality of each side and assign varying levels of importance during training. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms baseline models across different scenes and evaluation criteria. Furthermore, the approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets with varying labeled ratios. The motivation behind this work is illustrated in Figure 1, where it is shown that pseudo-labels with high intersection over union (IoU) may be incorrect on some sides, while pseudo-labels with low IoU may be correct on some sides. Existing methods fail to adequately consider side quality, whereas the proposed method effectively selects high-quality sides for model training.
