We propose a solution called σ-Adaptive Decoupled Prototype (σ-ADP) to address the issues faced by meta-learning-based few-shot detectors. These detectors currently use a single prototype in both the Region Proposal Network (RPN) and Detection Head (DH), which affects their performance in two ways: 1) the prototype's poor quality, and 2) the conflicting guidance provided by RPN and DH.   To generate a high-quality prototype, we prioritize salient features and reduce the impact of insignificant variations by considering both angle distance and magnitude dispersion (σ) across the samples. We also decouple the prototype into task-specific versions to provide precise information on "where to look" and "what to look for" in the query image.   Furthermore, our σ-ADP method gradually enhances the encoding network's generalization power during meta-training, enabling it to handle intra-class variations effectively. This means that a simple K-average pooling is sufficient to generate a high-quality prototype during meta-testing. We provide theoretical analysis to support the rationality of our approach.   Extensive experiments on Pascal VOC, MS-COCO, and FSOD datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it outperforms the baseline model by a significant margin, with improvements of up to approximately 5.0% AP50 and 8.0% AP75 on novel classes.
