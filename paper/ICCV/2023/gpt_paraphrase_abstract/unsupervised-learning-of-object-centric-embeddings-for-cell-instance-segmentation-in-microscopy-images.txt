This abstract discusses the importance of object segmentation in microscopy images for biomedical applications. The authors propose a method called object-centric embeddings (OCEs) that preserves the spatial offsets between image patches cropped from the same object. By learning these embeddings, individual objects can be delineated, resulting in instance segmentations. The authors demonstrate that OCEs can be learned through a self-supervised task that predicts the spatial offset between image patches, making it an unsupervised cell instance segmentation method. The method is evaluated on nine large-scale microscopy datasets, and the results show significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art baselines on six datasets and comparable performance on the remaining three datasets. If ground-truth annotations are available, this method can serve as a starting point for supervised training, reducing the amount of required ground-truth annotations significantly. The availability of the source code on GitHub enhances the practical applicability of the method.
