This abstract discusses the importance of precise perception in a driver's ability to navigate complex traffic scenes. The authors propose a geometry-aware representation called 3D Occupancy, which quantizes the physical 3D scene into a structured grid map with semantic labels per cell. This representation captures fine-grained details of critical obstacles and can be used for various driving tasks such as detection, segmentation, and planning. The authors introduce a pipeline called Oc-cNet that uses a cascade and temporal voxel decoder to reconstruct 3D occupancy. They also present OpenOcc, a benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness of this representation and their algorithm. Experimental results show significant performance improvements in tasks like motion planning, with collision rates reduced by 15%-58%. The authors argue that the use of 3D occupancy can better represent obstacles and avoid collisions compared to conventional 3D bounding boxes. They propose occupancy as a general scene descriptor for a wide range of driving tasks and highlight its superiority over previous alternatives.
