This study introduces a probabilistic framework for estimating 3D pose and shape using monocular RGB-based images. Due to factors like occlusions and truncations, multiple solutions are often possible. To address this, the framework optimizes the Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence between the data and model distribution, allowing for the consideration of multiple hypotheses. The formulation uncovers a link between pose entropy and the diversity of hypotheses, which has been overlooked in previous works. In addition to the best hypothesis metric, diversity is evaluated by factoring in visibility. An important feature of our framework is its label-friendliness, as it can be learned from only partial 2D keypoints. Experimental results on both ambiguous and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art multi-hypothesis approaches.
