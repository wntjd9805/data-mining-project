This paper introduces an efficient framework for learning skeleton sequences called Skeleton Sequence Learning (SSL). The current methods for action recognition using skeleton sequences require a large amount of labeled data and computationally expensive models for training. Additionally, these methods do not consider the fine-grained dependencies among different skeleton joints to pre-train an efficient skeleton sequence learning model that can generalize well across different datasets.To address these limitations, the authors propose the SSL framework. This framework includes an asymmetric graph-based encoder-decoder pre-training architecture called SkeletonMAE. SkeletonMAE utilizes a graph convolutional network to embed the skeleton joint sequence and reconstructs the masked skeleton joints and edges based on prior knowledge of human topology.The pre-trained SkeletonMAE encoder is then combined with the Spatial-Temporal Representation Learning (STRL) module to build the SSL framework. Experimental results demonstrate that SSL performs well across different datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised skeleton-based methods on FineGym, Diving48, NTU 60, and NTU 120 datasets. Furthermore, SSL achieves comparable performance to some fully supervised methods.The code for implementing the proposed framework is available at https://github.com/HongYan1123/SkeletonMAE.
