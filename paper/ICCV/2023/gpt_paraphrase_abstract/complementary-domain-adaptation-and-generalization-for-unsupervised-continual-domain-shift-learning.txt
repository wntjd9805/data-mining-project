Unsupervised continual domain shift learning is a significant challenge in real-world applications when labeled data is not available for new domains. Existing methods for domain adaptation and generalization are limited in addressing this issue, as they only focus on either adapting to a specific domain or generalizing to unseen domains, but not both.   To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a learning framework called Complementary Domain Adaptation and Generalization (CoDAG). CoDAG combines domain adaptation and generalization in a complementary manner to achieve three main goals: adapting to the current domain, generalizing to unseen domains, and preventing forgetting of previously seen domains. Importantly, CoDAG is model-agnostic, meaning it can be used with any existing domain adaptation and generalization algorithms.   The effectiveness and robustness of CoDAG in handling unsupervised continual domain shift learning are demonstrated through evaluations on several benchmark datasets. The results show that CoDAG outperforms state-of-the-art models in all datasets and evaluation metrics, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this challenging problem.
