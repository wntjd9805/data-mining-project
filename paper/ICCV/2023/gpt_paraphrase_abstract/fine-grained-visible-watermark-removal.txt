The objective of visible watermark removal is to eliminate watermarks from images and recover the original background image. This task is challenging due to the presence of diverse watermarks. Previous studies have developed dynamic networks to handle different types of watermarks, but they overlook the fact that a watermarked image may contain multiple local parts with distinct visual appearances. In this research, we propose an advancement from an image-specific dynamic network to a part-specific dynamic network. This new approach identifies multiple local parts within the watermarked region and adapts to handle them individually. Our proposed method is a query-based multi-task framework that utilizes part query embeddings in two branches to predict part masks and restore watermarked parts. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our fine-grained watermark removal network.
