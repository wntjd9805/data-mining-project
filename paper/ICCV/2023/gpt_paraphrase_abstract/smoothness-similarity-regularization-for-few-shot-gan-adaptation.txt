This study focuses on few-shot GAN adaptation, which involves adapting a pre-trained GAN model to a small dataset with limited training images. Existing methods work well when the pre-training dataset is structurally similar to the target dataset. However, these methods encounter training instabilities or memorization issues when the objects in the two domains have different structures. To address this limitation, the authors propose a new regularization technique called smoothness similarity regularization. This technique transfers the learned smoothness from the pre-trained GAN to the few-shot target domain, even if the two domains are structurally dissimilar. The proposed method is evaluated by adapting both unconditional and class-conditional GANs to various few-shot target domains. The results show that the proposed method outperforms previous few-shot GAN adaptation methods in cases where the source and target domains have different structures, while achieving similar performance to state-of-the-art methods for similar domains.
