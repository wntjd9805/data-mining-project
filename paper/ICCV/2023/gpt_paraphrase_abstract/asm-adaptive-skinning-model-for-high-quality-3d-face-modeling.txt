The parametric face model and 3D face reconstruction fields have been extensively researched, but a crucial question remains unanswered: how to customize the face model for specific reconstruction settings. We propose a new approach called the Adaptive Skinning Model (ASM), which focuses on multi-view uncalibrated image reconstruction. Unlike the commonly used data-dependent 3D Morphable Models (3DMM), ASM is a human-designed model that offers more compact and fully adjustable parameters. Our experiments show that ASM outperforms 3DMM in terms of capacity, model size, and ease of implementation for new topology. We achieve state-of-the-art results with ASM in multi-view reconstruction on the Florence MICC Coop benchmark. Our quantitative analysis emphasizes the importance of a high-capacity model to fully utilize abundant information from the multi-view input in reconstruction. Additionally, our model with physical-semantic parameters has practical applications, such as creating in-game avatars. Consequently, our work opens up new research avenues in parametric face modeling and facilitates future studies on multi-view reconstruction.
