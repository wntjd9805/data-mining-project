Gigapixel Whole Slide Images (WSIs) have great potential in aiding patient diagnosis and prognosis analysis in computational pathology. However, due to the high cost and time required for annotation, WSIs often have limited annotations, such as WSI-level Annotations (WA) and Limited Patch-level Annotations (LPA). Currently, Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) utilizes WA, while LPA assigns pseudo-labels to unlabeled data. While pseudo-labels can guide MIL, the unreliable predictions from LPA introduce noise. Additionally, WA-supervised MIL training faces challenges due to the semantic misalignment between instances and bag-level labels. To address these issues, we propose a framework called Learning from Noisy Pseudo Labels for promoting Multiple Instance Learning (LNPL-MIL), which incorporates both types of weak annotations. We introduce the Super-Patch-based LNPL (SP-LNPL) method to reduce false positives in the noisy pseudo-labels and select more accurate key instances. In MIL, we propose the Transformer aware of instance Order and Distribution (TOD-MIL) to enhance the correlation between instances and mitigate semantic misalignment in the bag. Our LNPL-MIL achieves state-of-the-art performance in Tumor Diagnosis and Survival Prediction, with significant improvements in AUC and C-Index. Ablation study and visualization analysis confirm the effectiveness of our approach.
