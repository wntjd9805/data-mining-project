Semi-supervised learning has gained attention in large-scale land cover mapping, but existing methods overlook the potential to address class imbalance and fail to utilize hard samples during training. To address these issues, we propose a unified Class-Aware Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation framework. This framework includes three key components: 1. A class-aware unlabeled data selection method that balances towards minority classes to create a better semi-supervised learning dataset.2. A Class-Balanced Cross Entropy loss that considers annotation bias and class bias to re-weight the loss at both sample and class levels, alleviating class imbalance.3. The Class Center Contrast method, which utilizes labeled and unlabeled data by decomposing the feature embedding space and employing embedding centers for hard and easy samples of each class per image in the contrast loss.Our proposed method improves mean accuracy and mIoU by 4.28% and 1.70%, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art class-balanced pseudo-labeling methods on the large-scale Sentinel-2 dataset with 24 land cover classes.
