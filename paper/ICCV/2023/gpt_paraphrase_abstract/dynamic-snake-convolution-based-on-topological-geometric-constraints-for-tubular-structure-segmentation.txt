Accurate segmentation of tubular structures such as blood vessels and roads is critical for ensuring accuracy and efficiency in various applications. However, this task is complicated by factors such as thin local structures and variable global morphologies. In this study, we leverage the specific characteristics of tubular structures to enhance perception in three stages: feature extraction, feature fusion, and loss constraint. To accurately capture the features of tubular structures, we propose a dynamic snake convolution that adaptsively focuses on slender and tortuous local structures. This allows for more precise feature extraction. Additionally, we introduce a multi-view feature fusion strategy that incorporates features from multiple perspectives, ensuring the retention of important information from different global morphologies. To further improve the segmentation, we propose a continuity constraint loss function based on persistent homology. This constraint helps maintain the topological continuity of the segmentation. Experimental results on 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that our approach, called DSCNet, outperforms several existing methods in terms of accuracy and continuity in tubular structure segmentation. Our codes are publicly available for access. The challenges of this task are illustrated using examples from a 3D heart vascular dataset and a 2D remote road dataset, which highlight the difficulties posed by fragile local structures and complex global morphology. While standard convolutional kernels are designed to extract local features, they are not efficient in focusing on thin tubular structures. Deformable convolutional kernels have been developed to address geometric deformations of different targets, but they still struggle with the challenges mentioned earlier.
