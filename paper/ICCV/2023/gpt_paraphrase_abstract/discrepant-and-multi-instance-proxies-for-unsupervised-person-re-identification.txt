Recent unsupervised person re-identification methods often use a cluster uni-proxy for contrastive learning. However, this approach is prone to bias and confusion due to the variance within classes and similarity between classes. As a result, the learned features lack compactness within classes and separation between classes in the embedding space. To address this issue and accurately represent cluster information while learning discriminative features, we propose the use of discrepant cluster proxies and multi-instance proxies. Each cluster proxy focuses on representing a specific part of the information, and multiple discrepant proxies collaborate to represent the entire cluster comprehensively. Additionally, multi-instance proxies are utilized to accurately represent fine-grained information within the instances of the cluster. By employing these discrepant cluster proxies, we construct a cluster contrastive loss that utilizes the proxies as hard positive samples to reduce intra-class variance by pulling instances of a cluster closer together. Simultaneously, an instance contrastive loss is constructed using global hard negative sample mining in the multi-instance proxies to decrease inter-class similarity by pushing away truly indistinguishable classes. Extensive experiments conducted on Market-1501 and MSMT17 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of performance.
