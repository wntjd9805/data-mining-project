We introduce a new approach called IntrinsicNeRF that combines inverse rendering and neural rendering methods to synthesize novel views in object-specific and room-scale scenes. To address the under-constrained nature of intrinsic decomposition, we propose a distance-aware point sampling and adaptive reflectance iterative clustering optimization method. This allows IntrinsicNeRF to be trained unsupervised and produce multi-view consistent intrinsic decomposition results. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical clustering method to handle the incorrect clustering of adjacent instances with similar reflectance. This method supports real-time applications like recoloring and illumination variation. Through extensive experiments and editing samples, we demonstrate that IntrinsicNeRF can achieve consistent intrinsic decomposition results and high-quality novel view synthesis in challenging sequences.
