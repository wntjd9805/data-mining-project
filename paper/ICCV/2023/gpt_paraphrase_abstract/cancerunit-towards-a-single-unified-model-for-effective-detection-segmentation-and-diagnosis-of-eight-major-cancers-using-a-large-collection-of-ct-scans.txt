Radiologists are able to detect and diagnose multiple diseases in different organs in clinical practice, but most medical AI systems focus on single organs and a limited number of diseases. This restricts the clinical application of AI. To address this limitation, we developed a model called CancerUniT, which can simultaneously detect tumors and diagnose their characteristics for eight major cancers in CT scans. CancerUniT is a query-based Mask Transformer model that predicts multiple tumors. We divided the object queries into organ queries, tumor detection queries, and tumor diagnosis queries, and established hierarchical relationships among them. This architecture helps in learning tumor representations across different organs and enables the resolution of complex multi-organ cancer image reading tasks. CancerUniT was trained using a large dataset of CT images from 10,042 patients with eight types of cancers and non-cancerous tumors, all confirmed by pathology and annotated by radiologists. In testing, CancerUniT demonstrated strong performance in tumor detection, surpassing both multi-disease methods and a combination of eight single-organ expert models. Our goal is to detect, segment, and diagnose cancer and non-cancerous conditions in eight major organs using CT scans. This brings us closer to developing a universal, high-performance cancer screening tool that can have a significant impact on mortality rates for these cancers.
