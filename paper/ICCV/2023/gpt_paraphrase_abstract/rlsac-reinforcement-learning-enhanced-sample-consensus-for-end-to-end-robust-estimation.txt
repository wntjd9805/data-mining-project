Robust estimation is a difficult task that involves estimating model parameters in noisy environments. Traditional consensus-based algorithms for robust estimation rely on repeated sampling, but they do not effectively utilize data features and historical information. In this study, we propose a new approach called RLSAC, which combines reinforcement learning with sample consensus to achieve end-to-end robust estimation. RLSAC uses a graph neural network to incorporate both data and memory features in order to guide the sampling process. The feedback from downstream tasks is used as the reward for unsupervised training, eliminating the need for feature differentiation. Additionally, RLSAC includes a state transition module that encodes both data and memory features. Our experiments show that RLSAC can effectively learn from features and gradually improve hypothesis exploration. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that RLSAC can be easily applied to other robust estimation tasks based on consensus sampling. To our knowledge, RLSAC is the first method to utilize reinforcement learning for consensus sampling in the context of end-to-end robust estimation. The code for RLSAC is publicly available at https://github.com/IRMVLab/RLSAC.
