This study introduces a method for learning a generative model of High Dynamic Range (HDR) images from Low Dynamic Range (LDR) images in an unsupervised manner. The approach involves training a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate HDR images that appear indistinguishable from real LDR images when projected under various exposures. The projection from HDR to LDR is achieved using a camera model that accounts for exposure and camera response function. The proposed method, called GlowGAN, is capable of synthesizing photorealistic HDR images in challenging scenarios such as landscapes, lightning, and windows, where previous supervised models produce overexposed images. Additionally, the study introduces the novel application of unsupervised inverse tone mapping (GlowGAN-ITM) that surpasses existing supervised learning models in reconstructing overexposed regions without the need for HDR images or paired multi-exposure images for training.
