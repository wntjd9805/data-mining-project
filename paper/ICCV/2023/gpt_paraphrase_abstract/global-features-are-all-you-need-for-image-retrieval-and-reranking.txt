Conventional image retrieval systems follow a two-stage approach, using global features for initial retrieval and local features for reranking. However, the scalability of this method is limited due to the high storage and computation costs associated with local feature matching in the reranking stage. This paper introduces a novel approach called SuperGlobal, which exclusively utilizes global features for both stages, improving efficiency without compromising accuracy. SuperGlobal enhances the retrieval system by focusing on global feature extraction and reranking processes. For feature extraction, the study identifies sub-optimal performance when combining the widely-used ArcFace loss and Generalized Mean (GeM) pooling methods. To address this, several new modules are proposed to enhance GeM pooling. In the reranking stage, a new method is introduced to update the global features of the query and top-ranked images by refining features with a small set of images, making it highly computationally and memory efficient. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements compared to the state of the art on standard benchmarks. Notably, on the Revisited Oxford+1M Hard dataset, the single-stage results of SuperGlobal show a 7.1% improvement, while the two-stage approach achieves a 3.7% gain with a remarkable 64,865 times speedup. The two-stage system surpasses the current single-stage state-of-the-art by 16.3%, providing a scalable and accurate alternative for high-performing image retrieval systems with minimal time overhead.
