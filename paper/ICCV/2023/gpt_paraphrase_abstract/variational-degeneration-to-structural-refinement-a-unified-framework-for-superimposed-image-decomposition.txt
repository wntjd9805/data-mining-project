This paper presents a unified framework for decomposing mixed images into individual layers, addressing the challenge of structural distortions caused by complex degradation patterns. The framework utilizes a degeneration representation in the latent space to capture the intrinsic relationship between the mixed image and the degradation pattern. Additionally, the framework incorporates structural guidance refinement to mitigate content confusion resulting from structure distortion. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing image separation frameworks and achieves competitive results in related applications such as image deraining, reflection removal, and shadow removal. These findings validate the generalization of the framework.
