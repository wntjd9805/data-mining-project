Despite the advancements in Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) for 2D image recognition, there is still a limitation when it comes to recognizing objects in a 3D environment. This is because discriminative information is not only present in visible regions but also in unseen views. Efficient and accurate recognition in such scenarios requires inferring critical perspectives with minimal observations. In this study, we propose the concept of multi-view active fine-grained visual recognition (MAFR) to address this challenge. We collect a fine-grained vehicle dataset and conduct a pilot experiment to validate the need for MAFR. To achieve efficient recognition with active view selection, we propose a policy-gradient-based framework with a dynamic exiting strategy. Our experiments show that our proposed method surpasses previous multi-view recognition approaches and can enhance existing FGVC methods and neural networks in a 3D environment.
