This paper introduces a novel trajectory prediction model called FlowChain, which is designed to meet the requirements of safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles and social robots. FlowChain is a stack of conditional continuously-indexed flows (CIFs) that offer both fast computation and accurate probability density estimation. Unlike generative models that rely on approximations like kernel density estimation, FlowChain allows for analytical probability density computation, resulting in faster computation times. Additionally, FlowChain is more accurate than Gaussian mixture-based models because it makes fewer assumptions on the estimated density. FlowChain also enables rapid updates of estimated probability densities by incorporating the latest observed position and reusing the flow transformations and log-det-jacobians that represent the motion trend. This update process takes less than one millisecond due to the reduced computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowChain achieves state-of-the-art trajectory prediction accuracy compared to previous methods. Moreover, FlowChain outperforms other models in terms of both accuracy and speed of density estimation. The code for FlowChain is publicly available for access at https://github.com/meaten/FlowChain-ICCV2023.
