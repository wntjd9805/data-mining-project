We introduce ClothesNet, a comprehensive dataset of 3D clothing objects with detailed annotations. This dataset includes approximately 4400 models across 11 categories, with annotations for clothing features, boundary lines, and keypoints. ClothesNet is designed to support various computer vision and robot interaction tasks. With this dataset, we establish benchmark tasks for clothing perception such as classification, boundary line segmentation, and keypoint detection. Additionally, we develop simulated clothing environments for robotic interaction tasks like rearranging, folding, hanging, and dressing. Our experiments in real-world scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of ClothesNet.
