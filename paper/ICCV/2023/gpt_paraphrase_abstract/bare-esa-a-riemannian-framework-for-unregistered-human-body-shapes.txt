We introduce BaRe-ESA, a new approach for representing, interpolating, and extrapolating human body scans. Unlike existing methods, BaRe-ESA works directly on unaligned meshes without the need for establishing point-to-point correspondences or assuming a consistent mesh structure. Our technique utilizes a latent space representation with a Riemannian metric, which is associated with an invariant higher-order metric on the surface space. Through experiments on the FAUST and DFAUST datasets, we demonstrate that BaRe-ESA significantly outperforms previous solutions in terms of shape registration, interpolation, and extrapolation. Additionally, we showcase the efficiency and power of our model in applications such as motion transfer and random generation of body shape and pose.
