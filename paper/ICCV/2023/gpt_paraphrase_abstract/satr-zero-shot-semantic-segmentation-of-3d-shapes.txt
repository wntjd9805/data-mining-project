The task of zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D shapes is examined using 2D image recognition models. Surprisingly, it is found that modern zero-shot 2D object detectors are more effective for this task compared to text/image similarity predictors and zero-shot 2D segmentation networks. The key discovery is that accurate 3D segmentation maps can be obtained from multi-view bounding box predictions by utilizing the topological properties of the underlying surface. To accomplish this, the Segmentation Assignment with Topological Reweighting (SATR) algorithm is developed and evaluated on ShapeNetPart and the proposed FAUST benchmarks. SATR achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing a baseline algorithm by 1.3% and 4% in average mIoU on the FAUST coarse and fine-grained benchmarks, respectively, and by 5.2% in average mIoU on the ShapeNetPart benchmark. The source code and data will be publicly released, and further information can be found on the project webpage: https://samir55.github.io/SATR/.
