The problem of inferring topological principles in structured reconstruction is often caused by the lack of holistic geometry clues in low-level features. To address this issue, we propose a frequency-domain feature learning strategy called F-Learn. By leveraging frequency analysis, F-Learn enables the compact description of massive signals and facilitates the learning of structure geometry. This strategy can be easily integrated into a deep reconstructor with minimal modifications due to its parsimonious design. Experimental results demonstrate that F-Learn effectively enhances structure awareness in geometric primitive detection and topology inference, leading to significant improvements in structured reconstruction performance. The code and pre-trained models for F-Learn are available at https://github.com/Geo-Tell/F-Learn.
