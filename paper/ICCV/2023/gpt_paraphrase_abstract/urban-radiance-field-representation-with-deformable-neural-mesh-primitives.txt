Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have been successful in recent years, but they often require significant resources due to ray marching-based rendering. In this study, we introduce Deformable Neural Mesh Primitive (DNMP) as an efficient way to construct urban-level radiance fields. DNMP is a neural variant of classic mesh representation, combining the efficiency of rasterization-based rendering with the powerful neural representation capability for realistic image synthesis. It consists of connected deformable mesh vertices with paired vertex features to capture geometry and radiance information. To optimize and reduce storage requirements, we encode the shape of each primitive from a low-dimensional latent space, while rendering colors are decoded from vertex features using a view-dependent MLP. DNMP offers several advantages for urban scene representation, including high-quality rendering for novel view synthesis and low computational costs. Our method achieves leading performance in urban scenarios with fast rendering and low memory usage. We also present a lightweight version that is significantly faster than traditional NeRFs.
