We propose a framework, called ViWS-Net, for restoring videos affected by adverse weather conditions. Existing methods can only handle one type of adverse weather, while our framework can handle all types. We achieve this by using a weather-agnostic video transformer encoder and a long short-term temporal modeling mechanism. We also introduce a weather discriminator to suppress weather-specific information in pixel features. Finally, we use a messenger-driven video transformer decoder to predict the clean target frame of the input videos. Experimental results show that our ViWS-Net outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in restoring videos affected by any weather condition.
