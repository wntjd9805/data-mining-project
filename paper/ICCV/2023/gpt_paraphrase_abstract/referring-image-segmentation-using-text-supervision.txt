This paper presents a new approach to Existing Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) that eliminates the need for expensive pixel-level or box-level annotations. Instead, the authors leverage the information provided by referring texts to localize the target object. They propose a weakly-supervised RIS framework that formulates the target localization problem as a classification process. Positive and negative text expressions are used to differentiate between target and non-target objects. The framework introduces three key innovations. First, a bilateral prompt method is proposed to address the domain discrepancy between visual and linguistic features, improving the classification process. Second, a calibration method is introduced to reduce background noise and enhance the correctness of response maps for target object localization. Third, a positive response map selection strategy is proposed to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for training a segmentation network. The authors also propose a new metric to measure localization accuracy. Experimental results on four benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves promising performances compared to fully-supervised RIS methods and outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods in related areas.
