Unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval has gained significant attention due to its practical value. However, existing methods are limited to domains seen during training, which restricts their applicability. In this study, we propose a novel approach called domain-generalized unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval (DG-UCDIR) to enable image retrieval between any two unseen domains in an unsupervised manner. To enhance the model's domain generalizability, we introduce a two-stage domain augmentation technique for generating diverse training data. DG-UCDIR also addresses the challenges of unsupervised cross-domain image retrieval, where domain-agnostic and semantic-aware feature representations need to be learned without external supervision. To tackle this, we propose a new cross-domain contrastive learning strategy that uses phase images to mitigate the domain gap. Extensive experiments using PACS and Domain-Net datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
