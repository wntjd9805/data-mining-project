This paper addresses the limitations of single-image super-resolution (SISR) in reconstructing high-quality images with limited information. The authors propose a large-scale real-world burst super-resolution dataset called RealBSR, which aims to faithfully reconstruct image details from multiple frames. They introduce a Federated Burst Affinity network (FBAnet) that investigates pixel-wise displacements among images using a homography alignment and a Federated Affinity Fusion (FAF) strategy. The fused representations are then decoded using a Transformer-based module. The authors conduct experiments on two versions of their datasets and show that FBAnet outperforms existing burst SR methods, producing visually-pleasing images with fine model details. The dataset, codes, and models are publicly available at the given GitHub link.
