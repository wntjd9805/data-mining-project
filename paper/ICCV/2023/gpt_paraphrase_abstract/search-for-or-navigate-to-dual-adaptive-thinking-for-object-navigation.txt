When we encounter a specific object in an unfamiliar setting, we are faced with the decision to either search for it or navigate to it. Prior to seeing the target, we rely on our past experiences to search for it. Once we have visually identified the target, we can then navigate to it by recalling its location. However, current object navigation techniques primarily focus on improving the "search for" phase by utilizing object association, while neglecting the significance of the "navigate to" phase. In light of this, this study proposes a dual adaptive thinking (DAT) approach that adjusts thinking strategies in different stages of navigation. Dual thinking encompasses both search thinking, based on object association ability, and navigation thinking, based on target location ability. To enhance navigation thinking, we introduce a target-oriented memory graph (TOMG) to store historical target information, and a target-aware multi-scale aggregator (TAMSA) to encode the relative position of the target. We evaluate our methods using the AI2-Thor and RoboTHOR datasets. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by significantly improving the overall success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL), particularly in the "navigate to" phase.
