Current methods for predicting motion typically involve training a deep model using data from a specific source domain and then applying it to different subjects. However, this approach is suboptimal because it does not account for privacy concerns and the unique characteristics of the test subject, which are not seen during training. As a result, the pre-trained model struggles to adapt to these unseen characteristics, leading to unreliable predictions. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called Helper-Predictor Test-Time Personalization (H/P-TTP), which aims to create a general representation of out-of-source subjects to improve prediction accuracy. This is achieved through explicit and implicit augmenters, where the former introduces noisy sequences to enhance robustness, and the latter generates novel-domain data using adversarial learning. By extracting cross-subject invariant knowledge, the helper updates the predictor to achieve domain-generalizable learning. During test time, the predictor is further optimized to personalize its capabilities for specific properties of new individuals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that H/P-TTP significantly improves existing models for various unseen subjects.
