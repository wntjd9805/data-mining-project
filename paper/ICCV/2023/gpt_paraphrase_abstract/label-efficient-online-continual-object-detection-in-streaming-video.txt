Humans effortlessly acquire and transfer knowledge while watching continuous video streams, retaining previously learned experiences. However, existing methods for continual learning (CL) in video streams require fully annotated labels for effective learning. This study focuses on the Label-Efficient Online Continual Object Detection (LEOCOD) problem in streaming video. The authors propose an easily adaptable module called Efficient-CLS, which can enhance existing CL algorithms for object detection in video streams, reducing the need for data annotation and model retraining. The authors demonstrate that their method achieves significant improvement with minimal forgetting across all supervision levels on challenging CL benchmarks for real-world videos. Notably, even with only 25% annotated video frames, their method outperforms state-of-the-art CL models trained with 100% annotations on all frames.
