This paper introduces OxfordTVG-HIC, a large-scale dataset designed for generating and understanding humor. Humor is a complex cognitive construct that is subjective and context-dependent, making it difficult to generate and interpret. Evaluating deep-learning methods' ability to process abstract and subjective information can be done through humor generation and understanding tasks. However, due to limited data, there has been limited exploration in humor-related generation tasks like captioning. To address this gap, OxfordTVG-HIC provides approximately 2.9 million image-text pairs with humor scores, allowing for the training of a generalizable humor captioning model. Unlike existing captioning datasets, OxfordTVG-HIC offers a diverse range of emotions and semantics, resulting in examples that are out-of-context and conducive to generating humor. Additionally, offensive content has been excluded from the dataset. The paper also demonstrates how OxfordTVG-HIC can be utilized to evaluate the humor of generated texts. By analyzing the trained models, the study identifies the visual and linguistic cues that influence humor prediction and generation. These cues align with the benign violation theory of humor in cognitive psychology.
