This study addresses the challenge of accurately predicting the interactions between traffic participants in complex real-world environments for autonomous vehicles. The researchers propose a model called GameFormer, which utilizes hierarchical game theory to formulate the interaction prediction problem. The model incorporates a Transformer encoder to effectively capture the relationships between different elements in the scene. It also introduces a novel hierarchical Transformer decoder structure that iteratively refines the interaction process by utilizing prediction outcomes from previous levels and the shared environmental context. The study also introduces a learning process that regulates an agent's behavior at the current level based on other agents' behaviors from the preceding level. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, the researchers conduct extensive experiments using large-scale real-world driving datasets. The results demonstrate that the GameFormer model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting interactions in the Waymo interaction prediction task. The model also outperforms various baseline methods in jointly reasoning about the motion plan of the ego agent and the behaviors of multiple agents in open-loop and closed-loop planning tests. Additionally, the researchers evaluate the efficacy of the model on the nuPlan planning benchmark, where it achieves leading performance.
