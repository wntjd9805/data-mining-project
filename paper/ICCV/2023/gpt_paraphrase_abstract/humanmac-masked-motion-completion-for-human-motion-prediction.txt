Human motion prediction is a well-known problem in computer vision and computer graphics with various practical applications. Existing methods have achieved good results by using an encoding-decoding approach. However, these methods still have limitations such as complex loss constraints, cumbersome training processes, and difficulty in predicting different categories of motions. To address these issues, we propose a new framework that works in a masked completion fashion. In the training stage, we develop a motion diffusion model that generates motions from random noise. In the inference stage, we use a denoising procedure to make motion predictions based on observed motions, resulting in more continuous and controllable predictions. Our framework has several advantages, including the use of only one loss in optimization and end-to-end training. It also effectively handles the prediction of different categories of motions, which is crucial for realistic tasks like animation. We conduct comprehensive experiments on benchmarks and the results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework.
