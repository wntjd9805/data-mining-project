We propose a new model-driven deep unfolding framework for pan-sharpening that addresses the lack of transparency and interpretability in deep neural networks. Unlike existing solutions, our framework utilizes masked autoencoders (MAE) with spatial masking and spatial-spectral masking strategies to provide content reasoning and constrain spatial-spectral consistency. By embedding these pre-trained MAEs into the unfolding architecture, we improve the interpretability and representation capability of the network. Our framework explicitly integrates the holistic learning process with the physical mechanism of pan-sharpening. Experimental results on multiple satellite datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code for our framework will be made available at https://manman1995.github.io/.
