Open-world instance segmentation is a challenging task where the goal is to segment all objects in an image, even those that have not been seen before. Existing models have focused on closed-world scenarios and have not been explored for open-world settings. In this study, we propose a method called SWORD that utilizes the Transformer for open-world instance segmentation. Firstly, we introduce a stop-gradient operation before the classification head, which prevents novel objects from being mistaken as background and allows the network to benefit from heuristic label assignment. Additionally, we add IoU heads to identify novel objects. Secondly, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework that enhances the representation of objects and background. We maintain a universal object queue to obtain object centers and dynamically select positive and negative samples for contrastive learning.Unlike previous works that only focus on average recall, we consider both average recall and average precision. Our method, SWORD, achieves state-of-the-art performance in various open-world scenarios, including cross-category and cross-dataset generalizations. For example, in the VOC to non-VOC setup, our method achieves new state-of-the-art results of 40.0% on ARb 100 and 34.9% on ARm 100. In the COCO to UVO generalization, SWORD outperforms previous models by 5.9% on APm and 8.1% on ARm 100.
