Deep metric learning is essential for finding a function that can effectively represent data in both training and testing scenarios, even with unknown classes. However, the limited number of training samples hinders the model's ability to generalize to new tasks. While adding more training samples can help, determining their labels is a significant challenge. To address this issue, we propose Hybrid Species Embedding (HSE), a technique that utilizes mixed sample data augmentations to create hybrid species and provide additional training signals. Our experiments demonstrate that HSE surpasses several state-of-the-art methods in improving the metric Recall@K on the CUB-200, CAR-196, and SOP datasets. This approach presents a novel solution to overcome the limitations of deep metric learning.
