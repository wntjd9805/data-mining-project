Event-based cameras are well-suited for estimating motion along lines in a scene due to their strong response to edges. However, accurately determining camera displacement based on events remains a challenge. This is because the extraction of line features and the estimation of dynamics are closely linked when using event cameras, and there is currently no precise model available for describing the complex structures created by lines in the space-time volume of events. To address this issue, we have developed a correct non-linear parameterization for these structures, which we call eventails. We have applied this parameterization to event-based linear motion estimation, incorporating known rotation from an Inertial Measurement Unit. With this approach, we have introduced a novel minimal 5-point solver that simultaneously estimates line parameters and linear camera velocity projections. These estimates can be combined into a single averaged linear velocity when considering multiple lines. Our solver has been tested on both synthetic and real data, and it consistently generates more stable relative motion estimates compared to other methods. Additionally, it captures more inliers than clustering based on spatio-temporal planes. Notably, our method achieves a 100% success rate in estimating linear velocity, while existing closed-form solvers only achieve between 23% and 70%. The proposed eventails contribute to a better understanding of spatio-temporal event-generated geometries, and we believe they will serve as a fundamental component of future event-based motion estimation algorithms.
