We propose a new approach for correcting rolling shutter (RS) effects in single images using a deep homography mixture motion model. RS effects are common in CMOS sensors and are caused by exposure delays in a row-wise manner. Previous methods for RS correction often require multiple frames, which can lead to data quality issues. Few approaches focus on correcting RS effects in single images, and those that do often rely on complex designs or trajectory estimation. In our work, we take a simpler approach by learning the deep homography mixture motion between an RS image and its corresponding global shutter (GS) image, without imposing strict restrictions on image features or requiring a large solution space. We demonstrate that dividing the image into blocks using a Gaussian weight of block scanlines is effective for the RS setting. Instead of learning the motion mapping directly, we learn coefficients that combine multiple motion bases to achieve the correction motion. These motion bases are learned from consecutive frames of natural videos beforehand. Our experiments show that our method outperforms existing single RS correction methods both statistically and visually, in both synthesized and real RS images. The code and dataset for our method are available at https://github.com/DavidYan2001/Deep_HM.
