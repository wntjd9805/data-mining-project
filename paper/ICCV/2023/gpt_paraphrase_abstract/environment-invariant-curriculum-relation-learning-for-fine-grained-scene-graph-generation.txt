The task of scene graph generation (SGG) involves identifying predicates based on subject-object pairs. However, current datasets suffer from two types of imbalances: class imbalance in predicted predicates and context imbalance in subject-object pairs, posing challenges for SGG. Existing methods mainly address the predicted predicate imbalance, neglecting the subject-object pair imbalance, leading to unsatisfactory results. To tackle both imbalances, we propose a new method called Environment Invariant Curriculum Relation learning (EICR). EICR can be seamlessly integrated with existing SGG methods. Specifically, we address the subject-object pair imbalance by constructing different distribution environments and training a model that is invariant to environmental changes. We then employ a class-balanced curriculum learning strategy to address the predicate imbalance by balancing the different environments. Extensive experiments on VG and GQA datasets demonstrate that our EICR framework serves as a general strategy for various SGG models, yielding significant improvements.
