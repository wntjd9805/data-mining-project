Urban modeling from LiDAR point clouds is a significant subject in computer vision, computer graphics, photogrammetry, and remote sensing. 3D city models have various applications in smart cities, autonomous navigation, urban planning, and mapping. However, current datasets for 3D modeling primarily focus on common objects like furniture or cars. The lack of building datasets hinders the application of deep learning technology to specific domains like urban modeling. This paper presents an urban-scale dataset comprising over 160,000 buildings, along with corresponding point clouds, mesh, and wireframe models. The dataset covers 16 cities in Estonia, spanning approximately 998 square kilometers. The performance of state-of-the-art algorithms, both handcrafted and deep feature-based methods, is extensively evaluated. The experimental results reveal challenges in Building3D, such as high intra-class variance, data imbalance, and large-scale noises. Building3D is the first and largest urban-scale building modeling benchmark, enabling a comparison of supervised and self-supervised learning methods. The authors believe that Building3D will facilitate future research in urban modeling, aerial path planning, mesh simplification, and semantic/part segmentation.
