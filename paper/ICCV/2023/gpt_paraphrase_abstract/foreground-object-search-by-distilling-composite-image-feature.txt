A new method called DiscoFOS is proposed for foreground object search (FOS). FOS aims to find compatible foreground objects for a given background image to create realistic composite images. Previous approaches have used a discriminator to predict the compatibility of composite images, but this approach is time-consuming. DiscoFOS addresses this issue by distilling composite features. The discriminator is used as a teacher network, while the student network employs two encoders to extract foreground and background features. The interaction output between the encoders is enforced to match the composite image feature from the teacher network. Additionally, two datasets (S-FOSD and R-FOSD) are contributed for the FOS task, consisting of synthetic and real composite images respectively. Extensive experiments on these datasets demonstrate the superiority of DiscoFOS over previous methods. The dataset and code can be accessed at https://github.com/bcmi/Foreground-Object-Search-Dataset-FOSD.
