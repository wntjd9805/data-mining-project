This study introduces a new approach called Sparse Instance Conditioned Network (SICNet) for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Existing methods either focus on predicting multi-modal trajectories based on goals or instances, but fail to consider the intermediate process or the stochasticity of pedestrian motions. SICNet aims to strike a balance between these two approaches by learning comprehensive sparse instances through a mask generated by a long short-term memory encoder. These sparse instances are stored and retrieved using a memory mechanism, allowing SICNet to decode observed trajectories and make future predictions based on the stored sparse instances. Additionally, a memory refinement module is designed to reduce memory recall errors by refining the retrieved sparse instances. Experimental results on ETH-UCY and SDD datasets demonstrate that SICNet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies further validate the superiority of SICNet compared to goal-conditioned and instance-conditioned approaches.
