Previous video object segmentation techniques used decoded features to extract conditional kernels for segmentation. However, this approach led to significant feature drift, impacting the accuracy of the segmentation. To address this issue, we propose the Spectrum-guided Multi-granularity (SgMg) approach, which directly segments encoded features and utilizes visual details to optimize the masks. Additionally, we introduce Spectrum-guided Cross-modal Fusion (SCF) to enhance multimodal representation through intra-frame global interactions. Furthermore, we extend SgMg to enable multi-object video object segmentation, allowing for the simultaneous segmentation of multiple objects in a video. Our experiments demonstrate that SgMg outperforms the closest competitor by 2.8% points on Ref-YouTube-VOS and achieves state-of-the-art performance on four video benchmark datasets. Moreover, our extended SgMg achieves satisfactory performance while running approximately three times faster. The code for this approach is available at https://github.com/bo-miao/SgMg.
