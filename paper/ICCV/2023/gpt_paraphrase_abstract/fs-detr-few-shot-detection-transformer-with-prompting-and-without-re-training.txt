This research focuses on Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD), which involves detecting instances of a novel class using only a few examples. The goal is to develop an FSOD system that can be used without fine-tuning at test time, can handle multiple novel objects simultaneously, and achieves comparable accuracy to closed systems. To address these requirements, the authors propose a novel approach called few-shot detection transformer (FS-DETR) that utilizes visual prompts during testing and predicts pseudo-class embeddings. The system not only offers more flexibility than existing methods but also demonstrates improved accuracy compared to methods that do not require fine-tuning and even outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning based methods on popular benchmarks such as PASCALVOC and MSCOCO.
