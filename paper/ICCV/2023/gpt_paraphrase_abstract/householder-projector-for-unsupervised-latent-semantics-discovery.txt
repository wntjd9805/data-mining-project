Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), including StyleGANs, have the ability to generate diverse content by manipulating latent codes. However, existing methods for discovering latent semantics have limitations. One approach uses eigenvectors of the projection matrix to represent interpretable directions, but this matrix is non-orthogonal and has a large number of eigenvectors, leading to entangled semantics and meaningless variations. To address these issues, we propose the Householder Projector, a flexible and low-rank orthogonal matrix representation for the projection matrix. This ensures that the eigenvectors correspond to disentangled and interpretable semantics, while also ensuring that each identified direction has meaningful variations. We integrate this projector into pre-trained StyleGAN models and evaluate its performance on various benchmarks. With minimal fine-tuning, our projector helps StyleGANs discover more disentangled and precise semantic attributes without sacrificing image quality. The code for our approach is publicly available.
