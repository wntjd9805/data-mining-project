Recent studies have utilized the attention mechanism to achieve artistic style transfer by mapping local patches of a style image to corresponding patches in a content image. However, due to the lack of semantic correspondence between arbitrary content and artworks, the attention module often misuses specific local patches from the style image, resulting in disharmonious and repetitive artifacts. To address this limitation and achieve flawless artistic style transfer, we focus on improving the attention mechanism and capturing the rhythm of patterns that define the style. In this paper, we propose a new metric called pattern repeatability, which measures the repetition of patterns in the style image. Based on this metric, we introduce Aesthetic Pattern-Aware style transfer Networks (AesPA-Net) that identify the optimal balance between local and global style expressions. Additionally, we propose a novel self-supervisory task to encourage the attention mechanism to learn precise and meaningful semantic correspondence. Finally, we introduce the patch-wise style loss to transfer the intricate rhythm of local patterns. Through qualitative and quantitative evaluations, we demonstrate the reliability of the proposed pattern repeatability metric, which aligns with human perception, and the superiority of our framework. The source code and pre-trained weights for our model are available at Kibeom-Hong/AesPA-Net.
