The availability of large-scale face databases has played a crucial role in advancing face recognition research in recent years. However, due to legal and ethical concerns, many of these databases have been retracted, raising concerns about the future of face recognition research. Synthetic datasets have emerged as a potential alternative to address privacy issues. However, existing synthetic datasets used for training face recognition models suffer from limitations in representing diverse identities, resulting in lower accuracy compared to models trained on authentic data. To address this issue, this paper introduces IDiff-Face, a novel approach that uses conditional latent diffusion models to generate synthetic identities with realistic variations for face recognition training. Extensive evaluations show that our synthetic-based approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 98.00% accuracy on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark, surpassing recent synthetic-based solutions (95.40%) and approaching the accuracy of authentic-based face recognition (99.82%).
