Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have gained attention for their ability to accelerate training and evaluation of 3D scenes. However, effectively utilizing the spatial sparsity of these scenes remains a challenge. Existing solutions rely on prior knowledge of object shape or repeated model evaluations, which are costly and inefficient. To address this, we propose HollowNeRF, a compression solution that automatically sparsifies the feature grid during training. Instead of compressing dense features, HollowNeRF trains a coarse 3D saliency mask that guides efficient feature pruning. It uses an ADMM pruner to sparsify the saliency mask, improving rendering quality while using fewer parameters compared to existing solutions. HollowNeRF achieves comparable rendering quality to Instant-NGP but with only 31% of the parameters. Additionally, it can achieve a PSNR accuracy gain of up to 1dB using only 56% of the parameters.
