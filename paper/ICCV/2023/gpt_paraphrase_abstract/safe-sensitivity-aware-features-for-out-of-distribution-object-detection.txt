We present a solution to the issue of detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) objects in the field of object detection. Our approach involves utilizing residual convolutional layers with batch normalization, which generate Sensitivity-Aware Features (SAFE). These SAFE features consistently exhibit strong capabilities in distinguishing between in-distribution and out-of-distribution detections. We extract SAFE vectors for each detected object and train a multilayer perceptron on a surrogate task that involves distinguishing between adversarially perturbed and clean in-distribution examples. This approach eliminates the need for realistic OOD training data, computationally expensive generative models, or retraining the base object detector. Our SAFE method surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art OOD object detectors on various benchmarks by significant margins. For instance, on the OpenImages dataset, it reduces the False Positive Rate (FPR95) by an impressive 30.6% absolute, decreasing it from 48.3% to 17.7%.
