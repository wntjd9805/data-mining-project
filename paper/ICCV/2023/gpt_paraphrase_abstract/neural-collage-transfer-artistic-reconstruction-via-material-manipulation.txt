This study introduces a novel approach to creating collages using reinforcement learning. While existing techniques can replicate a target image in collage style, they are limited by their stroke-by-stroke nature. Despite the popularity of collages, there has been limited research on this art form. To address this gap, the authors propose a method that does not require demonstrations or collage artwork data. They develop a collage Markov Decision Process (MDP) that enables the agent to work with various materials. They also introduce a model-based soft actor-critic to alleviate the training burden caused by the complex dynamics of collages. Additionally, they employ techniques such as active material selection and complexity-based multi-scale collage to handle images of any size and enhance the aesthetic appeal of the results. Experimental results demonstrate that their trained agent effectively selects and pastes materials to recreate the target image as a collage, achieving higher evaluation scores for content and style compared to pixel-wise generation methods.
