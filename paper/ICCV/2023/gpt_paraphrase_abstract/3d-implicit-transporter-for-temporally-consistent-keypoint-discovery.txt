Keypoint detection methods in 2D and 3D tasks lack temporal consistency, relying solely on geometric alignment. The Transporter method was developed to address this issue in 2D data by incorporating both spatial and temporal information. However, applying this method directly to 3D point clouds is not feasible due to their structural differences from 2D images. To overcome this, we propose the first 3D version of the Transporter, which utilizes a hybrid 3D representation, cross attention, and implicit reconstruction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on 3D articulated objects and non-rigid animals (humans and rodents), showing that the learned keypoints maintain spatio-temporal consistency. Furthermore, we introduce a closed-loop control strategy that utilizes these keypoints for 3D object manipulation, showcasing its superior performance. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/zhongcl-thu/3D-Implicit-Transporter.
