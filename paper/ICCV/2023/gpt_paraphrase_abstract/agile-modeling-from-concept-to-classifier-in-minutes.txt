The use of computer vision techniques for complex and subjective concepts is increasing. While crowdsourcing has been successful for objective tasks, it struggles with subjective tasks that involve substantial subjectivity. Creating a classifier for a subjective concept is challenging for users who are not machine learning experts and do not have the time to label numerous examples. In response to this, we propose Agile Modeling, a process that allows users to create computer vision models for subjective concepts through real-time interactions. We develop a prototype for image classification and conduct a user study with 14 participants, which shows that users can create classifiers with minimal effort in less than 30 minutes. We compare this user-driven process with traditional crowdsourcing and find that the crowd's interpretation often differs from the user's, particularly for subjective concepts. Additionally, we conduct simulations to scale our experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of the Agile Modeling approach in training classifiers for large categories like ImageNet21k.
