This abstract discusses the importance of point cloud registration in various applications. It highlights the challenges of using existing real datasets, which require laborious and expensive annotations and may not provide accurate camera poses. Synthetic datasets, on the other hand, primarily focus on object-level registration and may not generalize well to real scenes. To address these issues, the authors propose a new approach called SIRA-PCR for 3D point cloud registration. They first create a synthetic scene-level dataset using physically-based and random strategies to arrange diverse objects. Then, they develop a sim-to-real adaptation framework that considers variations in sensing mechanisms and layout placements. This framework includes an adaptive re-sample module to simulate patterns found in real point clouds. The authors claim that their work is the first to explore sim-to-real adaptation for point cloud registration. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SIRA-PCR on both indoor and outdoor datasets. The code and dataset for this approach will be made available on GitHub.
