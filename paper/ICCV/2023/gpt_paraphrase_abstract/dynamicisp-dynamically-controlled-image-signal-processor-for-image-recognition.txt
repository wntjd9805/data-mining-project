Image Signal Processors (ISPs) have a significant impact on image recognition tasks and the overall quality of captured images. However, manually tuning the parameters of ISPs is a labor-intensive process and often leads to sub-optimal results. In the existing literature, two approaches have been explored: machine learning-based parameter tuning and deep neural network (DNN)-based ISP techniques. The former is lightweight but lacks expressive power, while the latter is computationally expensive for edge devices.In order to address these challenges, we propose a solution called "DynamicISP." This approach incorporates multiple classical ISP functions and dynamically adjusts the parameters of each frame based on the recognition results of the previous frame. By doing so, our method efficiently controls the parameters of multiple ISP functions and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in single and multi-category object detection tasks, all while maintaining low computational cost.Overall, our proposed DynamicISP technique offers an effective solution for optimizing ISP parameters in image recognition tasks. It strikes a balance between computational efficiency and expressive power, leading to improved performance compared to existing methods.
