Efficient edge device detectors are often optimized for parameters or speed, but not necessarily for energy consumption. This paper aims to address this issue by designing detectors that strike a balance between energy efficiency and performance. The authors analyze various convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify low-energy architectures, including the selection of activation functions, convolution operators, and feature fusion structures. These details, which have been overlooked in previous work, have a significant impact on the energy consumption of detectors. Additionally, the authors propose a new detector called FemtoDet, which is driven by energy considerations. FemtoDet is further improved by optimizing convolutions and training strategies. A new instance boundary enhancement (IBE) module is developed to optimize convolution operations, overcoming the limitations of CNNs in handling diverse spatial representations. A recursive warm-restart (RecWR) technique is also proposed to optimize the training strategy and address the sub-optimization issue in lightweight detectors. The experiments demonstrate that FemtoDet, with only 68.77k parameters, achieves competitive results on the PASCAL VOC dataset and Qualcomm Snapdragon 865CPU platforms in terms of average precision (AP50), energy consumption, and frame rate (FPS). The proposed method is also evaluated on the COCO and TJU-DHD datasets, showing competitive performance in different scenes.
