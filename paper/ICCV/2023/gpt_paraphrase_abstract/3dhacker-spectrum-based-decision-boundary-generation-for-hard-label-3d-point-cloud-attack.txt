Recently, the vulnerability of 3D point cloud models has gained attention in applications like autonomous driving and robot navigation due to the availability of depth sensors. Existing 3D adversarial attacks either rely on the white-box setting, where they update coordinate perturbations iteratively based on gradients, or the black-box setting, where they estimate gradients using model logits. However, these methods are not practical for real-world scenarios where model details are not available. To address this challenge, we propose a new 3D attack method called 3D Hard-label attacker (3DHacker). In this method, we generate adversarial samples solely using the knowledge of class labels. 3DHacker constructs a class-aware model decision boundary by fusing point clouds of different classes and projecting them onto the decision boundary via binary search. To limit the perturbation size, an iterative optimization strategy is introduced to move the intermediate sample along the decision boundary. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that 3DHacker outperforms existing 3D attacks in terms of attack performance and adversary quality, even in the challenging hard-label setting.
