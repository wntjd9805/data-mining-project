We propose a new method called DPF-Net for reconstructing structures in an unsupervised manner. Existing methods struggle to capture consistent geometric details across diverse shapes within the same category. To overcome this, DPF-Net utilizes a Deformable Primitive Field (DPF) representation, allowing for high-quality shape reconstruction using parameterized geometric primitives. Our approach consists of two stages: a primitive generation module and a primitive deformation module. The primitive generation module estimates the orientation, position, and size parameters of the geometric primitives, while the primitive deformation module predicts a dense deformation field to recover shape details. By leveraging the strong shape prior encoded in the parameterized primitives, DPF-Net is able to extract high-level structures and consistently recover fine-grained shape details. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of DPF-Net for structural reconstruction and shape segmentation across diverse shapes in three object categories.
