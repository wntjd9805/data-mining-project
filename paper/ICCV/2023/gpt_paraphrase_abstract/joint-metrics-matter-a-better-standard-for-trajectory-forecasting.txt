Current trajectory forecasting methods primarily use single-agent metrics, such as Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), to evaluate their performance. However, these metrics do not accurately capture the collective behavior of multiple interacting agents. Relying solely on marginal metrics can result in unrealistic predictions, such as trajectories that collide or diverge for individuals who are clearly moving together as a group. Consequently, methods optimized for marginal metrics provide overly optimistic estimations of performance, hindering progress in trajectory forecasting research.To address the limitations of marginal metrics, we present a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting methods using multi-agent metrics. Specifically, we introduce Joint Average Displacement Error (JADE), Joint Final Displacement Error (JFDE), and collision rate as joint metrics for evaluation. Through quantitative evidence and qualitative examples from the ETH/UCY and Stanford Drone datasets, we highlight the importance of joint metrics over marginal metrics.Furthermore, we propose a new loss function that incorporates joint metrics. When applied to a state-of-the-art trajectory forecasting method, this loss function achieves a 7% improvement in JADE/JFDE on the ETH/UCY datasets compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. Additionally, optimizing for joint metrics leads to a natural improvement in interaction modeling, as evidenced by a 16% decrease in mean collision rate on the ETH/UCY datasets compared to the previous state-of-the-art method.To facilitate further research, we provide the code for our evaluation metrics at github.com/ericaweng/joint-metrics-matter.
