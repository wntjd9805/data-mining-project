In recent years, there has been a growing interest in SceneGraph Generation (SGG), which is a task focused on understanding visual scenes by predicting entity relationships. This task typically involves using a relation encoder-decoder pipeline on top of an object encoder-decoder backbone. However, current SGG methods have a drawback: they tend to lose important information about the local-level cues of the entities during the relation encoding process. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called Vision rElationTransfOrmer (VETO), which includes a novel local-level entity relation encoder.Additionally, we have observed that many existing SGG methods claim to be unbiased but still exhibit bias towards either head or tail classes. In order to overcome this bias, we introduce a learning strategy called Mutually Exclusive ExperT (MEET), which captures important relation features without favoring either head or tail classes.Our experiments on the VG and GQA datasets demonstrate that the combination of VETO and MEET significantly improves predictive performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods, with a performance boost of up to 47%. Furthermore, our approach is also much smaller in size, being approximately 10 times smaller than existing methods.
