A new approach called Deep Feature Deblurring Diffusion (DFDD) is proposed in this paper to address the challenge of un-supervised out-of-distribution object detection (OOD-OD). The goal of OOD-OD is to detect unseen OOD objects without using any auxiliary OOD data. The main challenge is to accurately detect OOD objects while not affecting the detection of known in-distribution (ID) objects. This challenge can be framed as a diffusion problem for deep feature synthesis. The proposed DFDD approach consists of forward blurring and reverse deblurring processes. In the forward process, Gaussian Blur is gradually applied to the extracted features, retaining important input-relevant information. This process synthesizes virtual OOD features that are close to the classification boundary between ID and OOD objects, thereby improving the detection performance of OOD objects. The reverse process uses a dedicated deblurring model to recover the lost details from the forward process. Both the deblurred features and original features are used for training, enhancing the discrimination ability. The method is evaluated on various tasks including OOD-OD, open-set object detection, and incremental object detection, and it outperforms baseline methods.
