Rain is a major obstacle in computer vision, degrading image quality and visibility. While there have been advancements in deraining methods, the focus has been primarily on daytime scenarios. Nighttime deraining presents unique challenges due to non-uniform local illuminations from artificial light sources, which affect the appearance of rain streaks. Existing deraining methods struggle to effectively handle these diverse rain streak appearances. This paper emphasizes the significance of rain streak location information in nighttime deraining. The authors propose a Rain Location Prior (RLP) that is learned from rainy images using a recurrent residual model. This learned prior contains location information of rain streaks and significantly enhances the performance of deraining models when injected into them. To further improve the effectiveness of the learned prior, a Rain Prior Injection Module (RPIM) is introduced to modulate the prior before injection, prioritizing features within rain streak areas. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by approximately 1dB and effectively improves deraining model performance. Additionally, the method is evaluated on real night rainy images, showcasing its ability to handle real-world scenarios with fully synthetic data for training. This research represents a significant advancement in nighttime deraining and underscores the importance of location information in addressing this challenging problem.
