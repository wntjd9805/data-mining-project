This paper introduces a new approach for positive-unlabeled learning (PU learning) in hyperspectral remote sensing imagery (HSI). PU learning aims to build a binary classifier using positive and unlabeled data, which has wide applications in earth vision. However, when limited labeled HSI data is available, the optimization process may be dominated by the unlabeled data, leading to overfitting of neural networks. To address this issue, the authors propose a Taylor variational loss that reduces the influence of the gradient from unlabeled data through Taylor series expansion. This helps the network strike a balance between overfitting and underfitting. Additionally, a self-calibrated optimization strategy is designed to stabilize the training process. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through experiments on 7 benchmark datasets, consisting of a total of 21 tasks.
