Cross-modal Unsupervised Domain Adaptation aims to address the lack of annotation in unknown domains by leveraging the complementarity of 2D-3D data. However, existing methods in this field require access to target samples during training, limiting their applicability to specific target domains. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approach called BEV-DG, which focuses on cross-modal learning under a bird's-eye view for domain generalization of 3D semantic segmentation.  Domain generalization is particularly challenging because the model cannot access the target domain during training, necessitating the use of cross-modal learning to bridge the domain gap. In the case of 3D semantic segmentation, where each point needs to be classified, existing cross-modal learning methods perform direct point-to-point mappings, which can be sensitive to misalignment between pixels and points in projections.  To address this challenge, our approach aims to optimize domain-irrelevant representation modeling through cross-modal learning under a bird's-eye view. We introduce a technique called BEV-based Area-to-area Fusion (BAF) to enable cross-modal learning under the bird's-eye view perspective, which is more tolerant to misalignment at the point level. Additionally, we propose BEV-driven Domain Contrastive Learning (BDCL) to model domain-irrelevant representations, leveraging cross-modal learning under the bird's-eye view.  We evaluate our approach on three different 3D datasets and compare it against state-of-the-art competitors. In all three domain generalization settings, BEV-DG outperforms the existing methods by a significant margin. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in improving the generalization capabilities of 3D semantic segmentation models.  In summary, our proposed BEV-DG approach leverages cross-modal learning under a bird's-eye view to address the limitations of existing methods in unsupervised domain adaptation. Through techniques such as BAF and BDCL, we achieve superior performance in domain generalization for 3D semantic segmentation.
