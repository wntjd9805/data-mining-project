This abstract introduces a novel ensemble framework for robust point cloud classification. The framework is designed to handle partial and noisy data often obtained from consumer-type 3D sensors. The proposed framework utilizes three different sampling strategies: two local strategies based on patches and curves, and a global strategy of random sampling. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in addressing various local and global degradations. They show that their framework significantly improves the robustness of top classification networks. The experimental results using the ModelNet-C database show that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on unaugmented and augmented data. The mean CorruptionError (mCE) is 0.64 for unaugmented data and 0.50 for augmented data. The authors analyze and explain their results through diversity analysis. The code for their framework is available on GitHub. The figure provided illustrates the concept of the ensemble, with random, patch, and curve sampling mechanisms. The authors conclude that such ensembles are highly robust to different types of corruptions.
