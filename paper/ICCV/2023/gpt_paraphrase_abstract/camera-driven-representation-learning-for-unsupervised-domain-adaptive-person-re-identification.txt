We introduce a new method for unsupervised domain adaptation in person re-identification. Our approach, called camera-driven curriculum learning (CaCL), utilizes camera labels of person images to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. We divide the target domain dataset into subsets based on camera labels and train our model initially on a single subset. Gradually, we incorporate more subsets into the training process according to a curriculum sequence determined by a camera-driven scheduling rule. The scheduling rule considers the maximum mean discrepancies between each subset and the source domain, prioritizing subsets closer to the source domain. For each curriculum sequence, we generate pseudo labels for person images in the target domain and train a re-identification model in a supervised manner. However, we observe that the pseudo labels are biased towards cameras, causing person images from the same camera to have the same pseudo labels, even if they belong to different individuals. To address this camera bias issue, we introduce a camera-diversity (CD) loss that encourages person images with the same pseudo label but captured across different cameras to contribute more to discriminative feature learning. This promotes the development of person representations that are robust to variations across cameras. Experimental results on standard benchmarks, including real-to-real and synthetic-to-real scenarios, demonstrate the effectiveness of our CaCL framework. We visualize the features extracted from person images in different domains using a re-identification model trained on the source domain, revealing the bias towards camera labels in the model trained on a single domain. To mitigate this bias, we establish a camera-driven curriculum and compute cluster-wise weights to encourage the inclusion of images from various cameras during the adaptation process.
