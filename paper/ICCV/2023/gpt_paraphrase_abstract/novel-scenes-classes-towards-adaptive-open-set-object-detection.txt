Domain Adaptive Object Detection (DAOD) is the process of transferring an object detector to a new domain without labeled data. However, in real-world scenarios, new domains often contain objects from novel classes that are not accounted for in current research. To address this limitation, we introduce Adaptive Open-set Object Detection (AOOD), which considers both novel scenes and novel classes. Combining existing cross-domain and open-set approaches is not optimal for AOOD due to their reliance on low-order information, such as confidence scores, which is insufficient for handling the two dimensions of novel information. To overcome this challenge, we propose a new framework called Structured Motif Matching (SOMA) for AOOD. SOMA leverages motifs, statistically significant subgraphs, to model high-order relationships and learns with high-order patterns. It consists of two components: Structure-aware Novel-class Learning (SNL) and Structure-aware Transfer Learning (STL). SNL uses an instance-oriented graph to capture class-independent object features from different base classes and employs a high-order metric to match the most significant motif for motif-guided novel-class learning. In STL, a semantic-oriented graph is used to model class-dependent relationships across domains, and unlabeled objects are matched with high-order motifs to align the cross-domain distribution with structural awareness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SOMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in AOOD. The code for SOMA is available at https://github.com/CityU-AIM-Group/SOMA.
