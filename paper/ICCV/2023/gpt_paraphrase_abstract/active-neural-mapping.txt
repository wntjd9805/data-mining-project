We propose a solution to the problem of active mapping using a continually-learned neural scene representation called Active Neural Mapping. Our approach involves actively identifying the target space to be explored and efficiently moving the agent to minimize map uncertainty in an unfamiliar environment. We investigate the weight space of the continually-learned neural field and show that neural variability can be used to measure the uncertainty of the neural map. By combining this with continuous geometric information, the agent can find a traversable path and gradually acquire knowledge of the environment. This paper introduces an online active mapping system with a coordinate-based implicit neural representation, and experiments conducted in realistic environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
