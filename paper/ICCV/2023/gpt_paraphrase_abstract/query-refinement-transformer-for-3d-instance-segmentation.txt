The aim of 3D instance segmentation is to identify and label object instances in a scene using binary foreground masks. However, the diverse shapes and categories of object instances, combined with the sparse and irregular nature of point clouds, create challenges in sampling queries. Additionally, noise background queries can interfere with accurate segmentation. To address these issues, we propose a method called QueryFormer. Our approach involves using a query initialization module to optimize the query distribution, ensuring comprehensive coverage and minimal repetition. We also employ an affiliated transformer decoder to suppress noise background queries and enable foreground queries to focus on discriminative parts for accurate segmentation. Through extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets, we demonstrate that QueryFormer outperforms existing 3D instance segmentation methods.
