Existing scale-aware algorithms in object counting have not effectively addressed the problem of scale variation. These algorithms typically involve cooperative learning across multiple resolutions, which may not be optimal for extracting the most discriminative features from each scale. To address this issue, we propose a new method called STEERER (SelecTivE inhERitance lEaRning). STEERER selects the most appropriate scale for patch objects to enhance feature extraction and only inherits discriminative features from lower to higher resolutions in a progressive manner. The key components of STEERER are a dedicated Feature Selection and Inheritance Adaptor (FSIA), which selectively forwards scale-customized features at each scale, and a Masked Selection and Inheritance Loss (MSIL) that ensures high-quality density maps across all scales. Our experiments on nine datasets involving counting and localization tasks demonstrate the exceptional scale generalization ability of STEERER. The code for STEERER is available at https://github.com/taohan10200/STEERER.
