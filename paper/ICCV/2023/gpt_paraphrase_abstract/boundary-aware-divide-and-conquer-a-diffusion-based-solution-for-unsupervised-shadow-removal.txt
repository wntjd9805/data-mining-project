Recently, deep learning techniques have shown impressive results in removing shadows from images. However, most of these methods require a large number of annotated shadow and shadow-free image pairs for training, which is time-consuming and may result in models that do not generalize well. Shadows only cause partial degradation in images, while the non-shadow regions contain valuable structural information that can be utilized for unsupervised learning.   In this study, we present a new unsupervised approach to shadow removal using a diffusion-based solution. We separately model the shadow, non-shadow, and boundary regions. We utilize a pretrained unconditional diffusion model combined with non-corrupted information to generate a natural shadow-free image. The diffusion model effectively restores the clear structure in the boundary region by incorporating adjacent non-corrupted contextual information. However, it fails to address the inner shadow area because of the lack of non-corrupted contexts. To overcome this, we introduce a Shadow-Invariant Intrinsic Decomposition module that exploits the underlying reflectance in the shadow region to maintain structural consistency during the diffusive sampling process.  Extensive experiments conducted on publicly available shadow removal datasets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms existing unsupervised methods and even achieves comparable results to some supervised methods.
