Different hardware, sequences, or scan parameters can result in noticeable differences in MRI images of the same contrast. This creates a domain gap that needs to be bridged through image harmonization in order to successfully process the images using conventional or deep learning-based analysis. Existing methods, including deep learning approaches, often require datasets from multiple domains for training and may still fail when applied to unseen domains. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new concept called 'Blind Harmonization' which only utilizes target domain data for training but can still harmonize images from unseen domains. We developed BlindHarmony, which uses an unconditional flow model trained on target domain data to achieve blind harmonization. The harmonized image is optimized to have a correlation with the input source domain image while ensuring that the latent vector of the flow model is close to the center of the Gaussian distribution. BlindHarmony was evaluated on simulated and real datasets and compared to conventional methods. It demonstrated significant performance on both datasets, indicating its potential for future use in clinical settings. The source code for BlindHarmony is available at: [GitHub link].
