This paper proposes a Multi-object Mask-box Integrated framework for unified Tracking and Segmentation (MITS) in Visual Object Tracking (VOT) and Video Object Segmentation (VOS). Existing studies on joint tracking and segmentation lack compatibility between box and mask initialization and prediction, and focus mainly on single-object scenarios. To overcome these limitations, the authors introduce a unified identification module that supports both box and mask reference for initialization. They also propose a pinpoint box predictor for accurate multi-object box prediction, which improves target-oriented representation learning. The MITS framework processes all target objects simultaneously from encoding to propagation and decoding, providing a unified pipeline for VOT and VOS. Experimental results demonstrate that MITS achieves state-of-the-art performance on VOT and VOS benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms the best prior VOT competitor by approximately 6% on the GOT-10k test set and significantly enhances box initialization performance on VOS benchmarks. The code for MITS is available at https://github.com/yoxu515/MITS.
