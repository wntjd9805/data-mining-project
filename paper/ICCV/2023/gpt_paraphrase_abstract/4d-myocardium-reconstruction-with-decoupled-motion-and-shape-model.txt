We present a 4D reconstruction method for estimating the shape and motion state of the myocardium using cine magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging. CMR imaging is typically limited to 2D slices with large spacing, making it challenging to reconstruct the shape and motion between slices. To overcome this challenge, our method decouples motion and shape estimation and utilizes a neural motion model and an end-diastolic (ED) shape model. The ED shape model can learn a continuous boundary and guide the motion model without the need for ground truth deformation. The motion model allows for canonical input of the shape model by deforming points from any phase to the ED phase. We also introduce a novel 4D myocardial dataset and validate our method on publicly available datasets, demonstrating superior reconstruction performance and potential clinical applications.
