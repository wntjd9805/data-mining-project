The field of multi-object tracking has recently shown renewed interest in the tracking-by-detection method due to its simplicity and strong priors, which eliminate the need for complex design and constant monitoring required by tracking-by-attention approaches. In this study, we aim to extend tracking-by-detection to multi-modal settings where different types of information, such as 2D motion cues, visual appearance, and pose estimates, need to be combined to compute a comprehensive cost. We focus on a case study where a rough estimate of 3D information is available and needs to be merged with traditional metrics like the Intersection over Union (IoU). Existing approaches use simple rules or complex heuristics to balance the contribution of each cost, but they require careful tuning of hyperparameters on a separate set and assume the costs to be independent, which is not the case in reality. To address these issues, we propose a probabilistic formulation that treats the cost of a candidate association as the negative log-likelihood obtained from a deep density estimator. This estimator is trained to model the conditional joint probability distribution of correct associations. Our experiments, conducted on simulated and real benchmarks, demonstrate that our approach consistently improves the performance of various tracking-by-detection algorithms.
