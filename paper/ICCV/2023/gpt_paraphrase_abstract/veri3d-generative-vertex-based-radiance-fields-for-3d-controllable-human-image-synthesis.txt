Recent advancements in unsupervised learning of 3D-aware generative adversarial networks have shown promising results in learning human generative models using neural articulated radiance fields. However, these models lack generalization ability and controllability compared to parametric human models. They struggle to perform well when generalizing to novel poses and shapes and lack part controllability. To address these issues, we propose VeRi3D, a generative human vertex-based radiance field parameterized by vertices of the parametric human template, SMPL. In our approach, each 3D point is mapped to the local coordinate system defined on its neighboring vertices. We utilize the corresponding vertex feature and local coordinates to map the point to color and density values. Our simple approach allows for the generation of photorealistic human images with free control over camera pose, human pose, shape, and enables part-level editing.
