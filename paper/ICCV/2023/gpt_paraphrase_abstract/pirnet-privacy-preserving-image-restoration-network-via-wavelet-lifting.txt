The popularity of cloud-based multimedia services has grown in recent years, but it also raises concerns about client privacy. To address this issue, image encryption has been used as a defense mechanism. However, encrypted images often appear different from natural images, making them vulnerable to attackers. To tackle this problem, we propose a new method called PIRNet, which focuses on privacy-preserving image restoration in the steganographic domain. Our method has significant advantages in terms of invisibility and security compared to existing methods. We introduce a wavelet-based Invertible Hiding network to conceal a secret image within a stego image. Then, a Lifting-based Secure Restoration network is used to restore the image in the steganographic domain. Throughout the entire restoration process, the secret image remains hidden, ensuring client privacy. Additionally, the stego image closely resembles the cover image, making it difficult for attackers to detect. Our experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of PIRNet in privacy-preserving image restoration tasks such as denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution.
