The importance of light in human well-being is often overlooked in computer vision tasks that focus solely on pixels. To address this issue, we have developed the Laval Photometric Indoor HDR Dataset, which is the first large-scale dataset of high dynamic range 360◦ panoramas that are calibrated for photometry. Our main contribution is the calibration of an existing uncalibrated HDR Dataset. We achieved this by simultaneously capturing RAW bracketed exposures with a professional photometric measurement device for various scenes under different lighting conditions. By using these measurements, we established calibration coefficients that can be applied to the HDR images. The resulting dataset provides a comprehensive representation of indoor scenes, showcasing a wide range of illuminance, color, and different types of light sources. We utilized this dataset to introduce three novel tasks: predicting per-pixel luminance, per-pixel color, and planar illuminance from a single input image. Additionally, we captured a smaller photometric dataset using a commercial 360◦ camera to explore generalization across different cameras. We are confident that the release of our datasets and associated code will generate interest in the community for physically accurate light estimation.
