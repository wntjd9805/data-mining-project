The token interaction operation is a crucial component in MLP-based models that facilitates the exchange and aggregation of information between different spatial locations. However, the effectiveness of token interaction is heavily reliant on the spatial resolution of the feature maps, limiting the model's expressive capability, especially in deep layers where the features are down-sampled to a smaller spatial size. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel approach called Strip-MLP that enhances the power of token interaction in three ways. Firstly, we introduce a new MLP paradigm known as the Strip MLP layer, which enables tokens to interact with other tokens in a cross-strip manner. This allows tokens in a row or column to contribute to information aggregation in adjacent but different strips of rows or columns. Secondly, we propose the Cascade Group Strip Mixing Module (CGSMM) to address the performance degradation caused by small spatial feature size. This module facilitates more effective token interaction within and across patches, regardless of the feature's spatial size. Lastly, we present a Local Strip Mixing Module (LSMM) based on the Strip MLP layer, which enhances token interaction power in the local region. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Strip-MLP significantly improves the performance of MLP-based models on small datasets and achieves comparable or even superior results on ImageNet. Specifically, Strip-MLP models achieve an average Top-1 accuracy increase of 2.44% on Caltech-101 and 2.16% on CIFAR-100 compared to existing MLP-based models.
