This paper investigates a common problem in graph matching called Bi-level Noisy Correspondence (BNC), which includes node-level noisy correspondence (NNC) and edge-level noisy correspondence (ENC). NNC occurs when keypoints in images are inaccurately annotated, resulting in mismatched nodes. ENC is the contamination of edge-to-edge correspondence due to noisy node-to-node correspondence. To address the BNC challenge, we propose Contrastive Matching with Momentum Distillation, a method that utilizes a robust quadratic contrastive loss. This approach effectively explores node-to-node and edge-to-edge correlations by customizing a graph matching quadratic contrastive learning paradigm. Additionally, it adaptively penalizes noisy assignments based on confidence estimates from a momentum teacher. Experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness of our model compared to 12 competitive baselines. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/XLearning-SCU/2023-ICCV-COMMON.
