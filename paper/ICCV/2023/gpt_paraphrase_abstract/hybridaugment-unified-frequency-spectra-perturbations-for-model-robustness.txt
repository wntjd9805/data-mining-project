Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) often struggle with generalization when faced with changes in distribution. Previous research has explored the issue of generalization from a frequency-centric perspective, suggesting that humans and CNNs may focus on different frequency components of an image. In light of these findings, we propose two data augmentation methods: HybridAugment and HybridAugment++. HybridAugment is a simple yet effective technique that aims to reduce CNNs' reliance on high-frequency components of images. By doing so, it enhances the robustness of CNNs while maintaining high clean accuracy. Building upon this approach, HybridAugment++ introduces a hierarchical augmentation method that unifies various frequency-spectrum augmentations. In addition to reducing reliance on amplitude components, HybridAugment++ promotes the use of phase information. This unification leads to competitive or even superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of clean accuracy, corruption benchmarks, adversarial robustness, and out-of-distribution detection across datasets such as CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, ImageNet-C, CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C.Importantly, both HybridAugment and HybridAugment++ can be implemented with just a few lines of code and do not require extra data, ensemble models, or additional networks.
