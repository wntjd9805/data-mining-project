This paper introduces a new benchmark dataset called Real-CE for the task of Scene Text Image Super-resolution (STISR). Most existing STISR works focus on recovering English texts, but this dataset emphasizes the restoration of structurally complex Chinese characters. The Real-CE dataset consists of 1,935/783 real-world low-resolution (LR) to high-resolution (HR) text image pairs, containing a total of 33,789 text lines. The dataset also includes detailed annotations such as detection boxes and text transcripts. Additionally, the paper proposes an edge-aware learning method that utilizes structural supervision in both the image and feature domains to effectively reconstruct the dense structures of Chinese characters. The proposed Real-CE benchmark is evaluated using various STISR models, with and without the edge-aware loss. The benchmark, along with the data and source code, is available at https://github.com/mjq11302010044/Real-CE.
