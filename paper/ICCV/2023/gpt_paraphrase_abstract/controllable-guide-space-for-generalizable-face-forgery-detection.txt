The current methods for detecting face forgery have performed well on known datasets but struggle with unknown domains. This has prompted researchers to focus on improving generalization. However, forgery-irrelevant information, such as background and identity, still affects different domain features, leading to unexpected clustering and limiting generalization. To address this issue, we propose a controllable guide-space (GS) method that enhances the discrimination of forgery domains, improving generalization. The guide-space is designed to separate forgery domains and increase the distance between real and forgery domains. We also use a decoupling module to reduce the interference of forgery-irrelevant correlations between domains. Additionally, we adjust the decision boundary manifold based on the clustering of domain features within the neighborhood for better discrimination. Extensive experiments in various settings confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art generalization.
