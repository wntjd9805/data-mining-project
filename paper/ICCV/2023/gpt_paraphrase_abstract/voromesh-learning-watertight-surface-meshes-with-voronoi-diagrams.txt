Finding a concise and learnable discrete representation of 3D surfaces is a challenging task, especially when it comes to polygon meshes. While polygon meshes are commonly used in geometry processing, their irregular and combinatorial structure often makes them unsuitable for learning-based applications. In this study, the authors introduce VoroMesh, which is a new and differentiable representation of water-tight 3D shape surfaces based on Voronoi diagrams. The boundary representation of VoroMesh is defined by the subset of Voronoi faces whose two associated generators have opposite occupancy. This results in a polygon mesh that approximates the target shape's boundary in a watertight manner. To learn the position of the generators, the authors propose a novel loss function called VoroLoss. VoroLoss minimizes the distance between ground truth surface samples and the closest faces of the Voronoi diagram, without requiring the explicit construction of the entire diagram. The authors demonstrate the geometric efficiency of VoroMesh by directly optimizing VoroLoss on the Thingi32 dataset, comparing it to axiomatic meshing algorithms and recent learning-based mesh representations. They also use VoroMesh in a learning-based mesh prediction task on the ABC dataset and show comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods, while ensuring closed output surfaces free of self-intersections.
