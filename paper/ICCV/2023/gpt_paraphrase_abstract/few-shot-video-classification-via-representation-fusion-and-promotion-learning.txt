This paper addresses two important issues in recent few-shot video classification (FSVC) works. Firstly, it is challenging to capture rich intrinsic action semantics from a limited number of support instances within each task. Secondly, redundant or irrelevant frames in videos can weaken the positive influence of discriminative frames. To overcome these challenges, the paper proposes a novel Representation Fusion and Promotion Learning (RFPL) mechanism consisting of two sub-modules: meta-action learning (MAL) and reinforced image representation (RIR). During the training stage, online learning is performed to establish a task-shared meta-action bank, enriching task-specific action representation by injecting global knowledge. Additionally, reinforcement learning is utilized to determine the importance of each frame and refine the representation. This approach maximizes the contribution of discriminative frames, enhancing the capture of similarity between support and query samples from the same category. The RFPL framework is highly flexible and can be integrated with existing FSVC methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RFPL significantly improves the performance of existing FSVC models when integrated with them.
