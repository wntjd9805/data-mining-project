Graph-based modeling has been successful in various real-world data types, but its application to computer vision tasks has been limited. The Vision Graph Neural Network (ViG) was introduced to address this limitation by dividing input images into patches and creating a graph based on pairwise connections. However, this approach leads to unnecessary edges and computational expenses. To overcome these limitations, we propose an enhanced version of ViG called the Vision HyperGraph Neural Network (ViHGNN). ViHGNN utilizes the power of hypergraphs to capture more complex inter-patch associations. We achieve this by using the Fuzzy C-Means method to establish and update the hypergraph structure during both training and inference phases, ensuring minimal computational burden. Our experiments demonstrate that ViHGNN outperforms existing models in image classification and object detection tasks, thanks to its ability to uncover higher-order relationships through the hypergraph structure learning module. The code for ViHGNN is publicly available at: https://github.com/VITA-Group/ViHGNN.
