The study focuses on understanding the 3D dynamics of the human body to analyze the impact of its interaction with the environment. However, accurately determining the 3D configurations from image observations is computationally intensive, and real-world measurements often suffer from noise and occlusion. To overcome these challenges, the researchers propose a solution that involves learning a latent distribution with strong temporal priors. They utilize a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) architecture with a transformer to train the motion priors using a large-scale motion dataset. By aligning feature spaces and utilizing pre-trained motion priors, they are able to efficiently recover complete mesh sequences of motion from noisy and partially observed data. The researchers demonstrate that their transformer-based autoencoder can handle missing frames and severe occlusion, thereby collecting spatio-temporal correlations resilient to various challenges. The proposed framework is generalizable and can be utilized to recover the full 3D dynamics of other subjects using parametric representations.
