This article introduces ORAN, an omnidirectional audio-visual navigation system designed to help a robot agent navigate through a new 3D environment based on sound cues. ORAN focuses on improving two key abilities necessary for this task: wayfinding and gathering audio-visual information. First, ORAN is trained using a confidence-aware cross-task policy distillation (CCPD) strategy. This approach transfers the well-trained point-to-point wayfinding skill from a large-scale Point-Goal task to ORAN, allowing it to excel in audio-visual navigation with fewer training samples. CCPD is also adaptable to the teacher policy's decision confidence, addressing the domain gap. Second, ORAN incorporates an omnidirectional information gathering (OIG) mechanism, which collects visual and acoustic observations from different directions before making decisions. This enhances ORAN's navigation performance and robustness. By combining CCPD and OIG, ORAN outperforms previous competitors, achieving first place in the Soundspaces Challenge 2022 and improving the Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) and Success Rate (SR) by 53% and 35% respectively.
