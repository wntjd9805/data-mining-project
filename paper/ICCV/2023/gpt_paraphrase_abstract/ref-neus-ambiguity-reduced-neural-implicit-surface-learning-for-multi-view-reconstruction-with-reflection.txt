Neural implicit surface learning has made significant advancements in multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, current methods struggle to accurately reconstruct reflective surfaces, leading to ambiguity. To address this problem, we propose Ref-NeuS, a method that reduces ambiguity by mitigating the impact of reflective surfaces. We employ an anomaly detector to estimate a reflection score, guided by multi-view context, to identify reflective surfaces. Additionally, we introduce a reflection-aware photometric loss that adapts to reduce ambiguity by modeling rendered color as a Gaussian distribution, with the reflection score representing the variance. Our model achieves high-quality surface reconstruction on reflective surfaces, surpassing existing methods by a significant margin. Furthermore, our model performs comparably well on general surfaces.
