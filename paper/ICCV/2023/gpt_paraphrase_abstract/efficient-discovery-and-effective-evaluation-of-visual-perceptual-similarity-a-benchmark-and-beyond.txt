Visual similarity discovery (VSD) is a crucial task in e-commerce, where the objective is to find images of different objects that are visually similar to a given image. However, the evaluation of VSD methods is often done using an identification-retrieval task, which may not accurately assess their performance. We believe that expert annotations are essential for a reliable evaluation. To address this, we have created a large-scale fashion visual similarity benchmark dataset containing over 110,000 expert-annotated image pairs. Additionally, we discuss the challenges faced during the dataset curation process and propose a new and efficient labeling procedure that can be applied to any dataset. Our analysis highlights the limitations and biases of this procedure and suggests metrics to mitigate these issues. While our main focus is on visual similarity in fashion, the methodologies we introduce have broader applications for discovering and evaluating perceptual similarity in various domains.
