Developing a reliable object detection system using LiDAR technology is crucial for autonomous driving. However, this requires a large number of precise 3D annotations, which can be time-consuming and computationally expensive. Active learning (AL) methods aim to reduce this annotation burden by selecting informative unlabeled data points for labeling. Current AL approaches prioritize uncertain and diverse point clouds, leading to increased labeling and reduced computational efficiency.To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy called kernel coding rate maximization (KECOR). This approach uses information theory to identify the most informative point clouds for labeling. Through a greedy search, we select point clouds that maximize the minimum number of bits needed to encode the latent features. To evaluate the selected samples, we construct a proxy network of the 3D detector head and compute the empirical neural tangent kernel (NTK) matrix using the outer product of Jacobians from all proxy layers.To accommodate both one-stage (SECOND) and two-stage detectors (PV-RCNN), we incorporate classification entropy maximization and strike a balance between detection performance and the total number of bounding boxes selected for annotation. We conduct extensive experiments on two 3D benchmarks and a 2D detection dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our approach. The results show that our method reduces box-level annotation costs by approximately 44% and computational time by 26% compared to the state-of-the-art AL method, without compromising detection performance.The source code for our approach is available at https://github.com/Luoyadan/KECOR-active-3Ddet.
