Existing embodied agents often struggle with navigating and interacting in their environment due to learning from imperfect planners or imitating experts. To address this issue, we propose CAPEAM (Context-Aware Planning and Environment-Aware Memory), which takes into account the consequences of actions. CAPEAM incorporates semantic context and the changed spatial arrangement and states of objects to improve visual navigation and object interaction. Through empirical evidence using a challenging instruction following benchmark, we demonstrate that the agent with CAPEAM achieves superior performance in both seen and unseen environments, surpassing state-of-the-art results by significant margins (up to +10.70% in unseen env.).
