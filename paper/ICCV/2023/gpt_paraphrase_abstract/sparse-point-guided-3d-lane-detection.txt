This paper presents a sparse point-guided approach for 3D lane detection that addresses the issue of valuable computation being bottlenecked and the high computation cost associated with building a high-resolution correspondence. The proposed method consists of a coarse-level lane detection and a fine-level sparse point refinement. In the coarse-level detection, a dense yet efficient correspondence is established between the front view and BEV space at a low resolution to compute coarse lanes. In the fine-level refinement, sparse points are sampled around the coarse lanes to extract local features from a high-resolution front-view feature map. The high-resolution local information provided by the sparse points refines the 3D lanes in the BEV space hierarchically from low to high resolution. The sparse points guide a more effective flow of information, resulting in a significant improvement of 3 points in overall F1-score and 6 points in challenging situations. Additionally, this approach reduces memory cost by almost half and speeds up computation by 2 times.
