The current methods for 2D-to-3D human pose lifting, which is essential for 3D human pose estimation, rely on graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to model the skeletal structure of the human body. However, these GCN-based methods do not take into account the interaction between joints in different joint synergies, such as maintaining balance. While some studies have incorporated limb information to learn movement patterns, the latent synergies among joints have been largely overlooked. In this study, we propose the Hop-wise GraphFormer with Intragroup Joint Refinement (HopFIR) architecture to address this issue. HopFIR consists of a hop-wise GraphFormer (HGF) module, which groups joints based on their k-hop neighbors and applies a hop-wise transformer-like attention mechanism to discover latent joint synergies, and an intragroup joint refinement (IJR) module, which leverages prior limb information to refine peripheral joints. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HopFIR significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods, achieving a mean per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 32.67 mm on the Human3.6M dataset. We also show that the proposed hop-wise attention mechanism can improve the performance of existing GCN-based methods, with SemGCN and MGCN experiencing improvements of 8.9% and 4.5% respectively.
