Pan-sharpening is a technique used to create a high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) image by combining the spectral information from a low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image with the texture details from a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image. However, existing deep learning methods for pan-sharpening only produce a single HRMS image, ignoring the diversity of possible HRMS images that can be generated from the LRMS and PAN images. To address this issue, we propose a flow-based pan-sharpening network called PanFlowNet. Instead of learning a deterministic mapping, PanFlowNet learns the conditional distribution of HRMS images given the LRMS and PAN images. We achieve this by transforming the unknown conditional distribution into a known Gaussian distribution using an invertible network. We then design an invertible Conditional Affine Coupling Block (CACB) and build the PanFlowNet architecture by stacking multiple CACBs. Through training PanFlowNet on a training set and maximizing the log-likelihood of the conditional distribution, we can predict diverse HRMS images. Experimental results demonstrate that PanFlowNet is capable of generating various HRMS images from an LRMS and PAN image. Furthermore, our method outperforms other state-of-the-art pan-sharpening methods both visually and quantitatively on different satellite datasets. The code for PanFlowNet is available on Github.
