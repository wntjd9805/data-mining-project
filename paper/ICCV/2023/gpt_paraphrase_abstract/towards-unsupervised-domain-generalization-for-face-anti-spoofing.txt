Generalizable face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods based on domain generalization (DG) have become popular due to their effectiveness in real-world applications. However, these DG methods heavily rely on labeled source data, which is often expensive and difficult to obtain. On the other hand, unlabeled face data is more easily accessible in various scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel approach called Unsupervised Domain Generalization framework for Face Anti-Spoofing (UDG-FAS) that takes advantage of large amounts of unlabeled data to learn generalizable features and improve the performance of FAS in low-data situations. However, learning intrinsic live/spoof features from complex facial information in an unsupervised manner is challenging, especially when dealing with cross-domain scenarios that involve domain shift. Existing unsupervised learning methods often learn features that are biased towards identity or specific domains, and fail to accurately identify spoof cues. To address this issue, we introduce a new module called Split-Rotation-Merge, which creates identity-agnostic local representations to capture intrinsic spoof cues. Additionally, we employ domain-specific normalization and merged local features to search for nearest neighbors in different domains, enabling the learning of a domain-invariant feature space. Notably, this is the first attempt to learn generalized FAS features in a fully unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UDG-FAS outperforms state-of-the-art methods on six diverse practical protocols.
