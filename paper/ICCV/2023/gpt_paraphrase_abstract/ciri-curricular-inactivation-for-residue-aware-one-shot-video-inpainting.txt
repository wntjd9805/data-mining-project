This paper addresses the problem of video inpainting, which involves filling in missing regions of a video. Annotating the inpainting target in dynamic scenes with camera or object movements is laborious and impractical. The authors propose a solution for one-shot video inpainting, where only one annotated first frame is provided. Instead of using object tracking to propagate the initial target to other frames, the authors introduce curricular inactivation as a more reliable mechanism for indicating the inpainting target. This method is robust to erroneous predictions in long-term video inpainting. Additionally, the authors present an iterative detect-and-refine approach for removing partially inpainted artifacts caused by inaccurate masks. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in one-shot video inpainting through extensive experiments on real-world datasets. It can also be integrated with traditional inpainting models, making it highly flexible. Video demonstrations and the code for the proposed method are available in the authors' supplement and GitHub repository.
