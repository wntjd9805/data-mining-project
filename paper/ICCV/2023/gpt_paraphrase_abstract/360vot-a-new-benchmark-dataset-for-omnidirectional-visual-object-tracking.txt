This paper focuses on the use of 360-degree images for visual object tracking and the challenges that arise from the distortion and unique attributes of such images. To address these challenges, the authors propose a novel approach using bounding field-of-view representations and introduce a general framework for 360-degree tracking that can be used with existing trackers. Additionally, the authors create a benchmark dataset called 360VOT, which includes 120 sequences with high-resolution frames and covers a wide range of scenarios and categories. The dataset also provides unbiased ground truth annotations and new metrics specifically designed for evaluating omnidirectional tracking performance. The authors conduct extensive evaluations of 20 state-of-the-art visual trackers and establish a new baseline for future comparisons.
