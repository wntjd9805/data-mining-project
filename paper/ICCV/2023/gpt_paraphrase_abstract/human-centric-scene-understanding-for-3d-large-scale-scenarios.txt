We have created a large-scale dataset called HuCenLife that focuses on human-centric scene understanding. This dataset includes diverse daily-life scenarios and is annotated with detailed information. It can be used for various 3D perception tasks such as segmentation, detection, and action recognition. We have also developed new modules specifically for LiDAR-based segmentation and action recognition, which perform well in large-scale human-centric scenarios. The dataset and code are available for researchers to use.
