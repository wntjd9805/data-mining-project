The generation of animated portraits using speech has gained increasing attention due to its creative and practical applications. The desired outcome is a video that accurately synchronizes the lip movement with the audio, displays natural facial expressions and head movements, and maintains a high-quality frame rate. This study introduces SPACE, a novel approach that utilizes speech and a single image to produce expressive and high-resolution videos with realistic head poses, eliminating the need for a reference video. The method employs a multi-stage process that combines the control of facial landmarks with the synthesis capabilities of a pretrained face generator. Additionally, SPACE enables the manipulation of emotions and their intensities. Through objective metrics evaluating image quality and facial motion, our technique surpasses previous methods and is strongly preferred by users in comparative assessments.
