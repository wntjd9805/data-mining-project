The lack of a large-scale dataset capturing diverse features in remote sensing images poses a challenge for developing generalizable computer vision methods. To address this, we introduce SATLASPRETRAIN, a comprehensive remote sensing dataset that combines Sentinel-2 and NAIP images with 302M labels across 137 categories and seven label types. We evaluate several baselines and a proposed method on SATLASPRETRAIN, revealing opportunities for improvement in processing image time series from different sensors and utilizing long-range spatial context. Importantly, pre-training on SATLASPRETRAIN significantly enhances performance on downstream tasks, with an average accuracy increase of 18% over ImageNet and 6% over the best baseline. The dataset, pre-trained model weights, and code can be accessed at https://satlas-pretrain.allen.ai/.
