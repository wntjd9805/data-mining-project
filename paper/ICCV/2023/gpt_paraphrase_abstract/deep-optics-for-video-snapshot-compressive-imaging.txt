This paper introduces a deep optics framework for video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) that addresses two key challenges in the field. The first challenge is the low dynamic range caused by high temporal multiplexing. To overcome this, the authors propose a new type of structural mask that enables motion-aware and full-dynamic-range measurement. The second challenge is the degradation of existing deep learning algorithms when applied to real systems. To address this, the authors develop an efficient network called Res2former, which uses Transformer to capture long-term temporal dependencies in video SCI reconstruction. Additionally, the authors incorporate sensor response into the forward model of video SCI to ensure realistic system training. The proposed framework is implemented on a digital micro-mirror device, and experimental results on synthetic and real data demonstrate its effectiveness. The authors consider this work to be a significant milestone for real-world video SCI and provide the source code and data for further exploration.
