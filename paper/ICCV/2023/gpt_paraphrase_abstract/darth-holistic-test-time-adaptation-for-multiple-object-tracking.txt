Multiple object tracking (MOT) is a crucial aspect of perception systems used in autonomous driving. It is essential for these systems to be robust and capable of adapting to unseen conditions to prevent life-threatening failures. However, no previous solution has been proposed to address the MOT adaptation problem in the face of domain shift during test-time conditions.  The complexity of MOT systems, which involve object detection and instance association, makes it challenging to adapt all its components. In this study, we investigate the impact of domain shift on appearance-based trackers and introduce a comprehensive framework called DARTH for test-time adaptation in MOT. Our approach includes a self-supervised fashion to adapt object detection through a detection consistency formulation. We also propose a novel patch contrastive loss to adapt instance appearance representations.  To assess the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on various domain shifts, such as sim-to-real, outdoor-to-indoor, and indoor-to-outdoor scenarios. Our approach significantly improves the performance of the source model on all metrics. For more detailed information, please visit our project page at https://www.vis.xyz/pub/darth.
