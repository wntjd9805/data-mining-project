This paper presents a novel learning strategy called AncLearn for accurately understanding indoor scenes. Current methods for grouping proposal features and sampling instance points often introduce a lot of noise to instance detection and mesh reconstruction. To address this issue, we propose AncLearn, which generates anchors that adaptively fit instance surfaces. This helps to separate noise from target-related features, resulting in reliable proposals during the detection stage. Additionally, AncLearn reduces outliers in object point sampling, providing well-structured geometry priors for reconstruction without the need for segmentation. We integrate AncLearn into a reconstruction-from-detection learning system called AncRec, which produces high-quality semantic scene models in a purely instance-oriented manner. Experimental results on the challenging ScanNetv2 dataset demonstrate that our shape anchor-based method consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of 3D object detection, layout estimation, and shape reconstruction. The code for our method will be made publicly available at https://github.com/Geo-Tell/AncRec.
