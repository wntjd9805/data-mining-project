Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) have shown promise in reducing the memory and compute costs of deep neural networks. However, they suffer from a decrease in quality due to the constraints of binary activations and weights. In order to address this accuracy drop, we propose a novel BNN design called INSTA-BNN (Binary Neural Network with INSTAnce-aware threshold). This design dynamically adjusts the quantization threshold based on input-dependent or instance-aware information, particularly higher-order statistics. INSTA-BNN is optimized to minimize overhead on real devices while considering various factors. Extensive studies have demonstrated that INSTA-BNN outperforms the baseline by 3.0% and 2.8% in the ImageNet classification task, achieving top-1 accuracies of 68.5% and 72.2% on ResNet-18 and MobileNetV1 models, respectively, with comparable computing costs.
