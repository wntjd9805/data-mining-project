Human Pose Estimation (HPE) is a widely used technique in various fields, such as motion analysis, healthcare, and virtual reality. However, the high cost of acquiring labeled real-world datasets poses a significant challenge for HPE. One solution is to train HPE models on synthetic datasets and then perform domain adaptation (DA) on real-world data. Unfortunately, existing DA methods for HPE overlook data privacy and security by utilizing both source and target data in the adaptation process.To address this issue, we propose a new task called source-free domain adaptive HPE, which aims to overcome the challenges of cross-domain learning in HPE without requiring access to source data during the adaptation process. We introduce a novel framework consisting of three models: the intermediate model, the source-protect module, and the target-relevant module. This framework considers the task from both source-protect and target-relevant perspectives.The source-protect module effectively preserves source information while resisting noise, ensuring data privacy and security during the adaptation process. The target-relevant module reduces the sparsity of spatial representations by constructing a novel spatial probability space. Additionally, we propose pose-specific contrastive learning and information maximization techniques based on this space.We conducted comprehensive experiments on several domain adaptive HPE benchmarks, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing approaches significantly.
