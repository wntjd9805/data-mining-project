We introduce a defense technique called TIJO (Trigger Inversion using Joint Optimization) to protect multimodal models from backdoor attacks. Previous research has shown successful backdoor attacks on multimodal models used for Visual Question Answering. These attacks utilize a dual-key backdoor trigger that is split between two modalities, requiring the trigger to be present in both the image and text for activation. In response, we propose TIJO, which defends against dual-key attacks by reverse-engineering the trigger in both modalities through joint optimization.However, achieving joint optimization in multimodal models presents challenges due to the disconnected nature of the visual pipeline. This pipeline involves an offline feature extractor that outputs features fused with the text using a fusion module. To address this, TIJO leverages the insight that trigger inversion should take place in the object detection box feature space instead of the pixel space.We demonstrate the effectiveness of TIJO on the TrojVQA benchmark. Our method significantly improves upon the state-of-the-art unimodal methods, increasing the Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.6 to 0.92 for multimodal dual-key backdoors. Additionally, TIJO also outperforms the unimodal baselines for unimodal backdoors. Through ablation studies and qualitative results, we provide insights into our algorithm, such as the critical importance of overlaying the inverted feature triggers on all visual features during trigger inversion.For those interested, a prototype implementation of TIJO is available at https://github.com/SRI-CSL/TIJO.
