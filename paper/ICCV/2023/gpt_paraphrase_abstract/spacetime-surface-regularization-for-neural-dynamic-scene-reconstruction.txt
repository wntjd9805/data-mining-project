We present a new algorithm called 4DRegSDF that aims to enhance the accuracy of neural rendering and reconstruction in dynamic scenes by regularizing the spacetime surface. The main concept behind our algorithm is to introduce local rigidity to the deformable Signed Distance Function (SDF) in order to ensure temporal coherency. Our approach involves three steps: (1) sampling points on the deformed surface by moving in the direction of steepest gradient along the SDF, (2) extracting surface geometry information (such as tangent plane or curvature) at each sampled point, and (3) adjusting the local rigidity at different timestamps. This allows our dynamic surface regularization to align the 4D spacetime geometry more accurately using 3D canonical space. Experimental results demonstrate that our 4DRegSDF algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both reconstruction and rendering quality when applied to both synthetic and real-world datasets.
