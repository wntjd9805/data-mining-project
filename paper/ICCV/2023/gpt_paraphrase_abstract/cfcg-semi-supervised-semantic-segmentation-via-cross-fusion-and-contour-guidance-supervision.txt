We present a new framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) called CFCG. Current SSSS methods use pseudo labeling and consistency regularization between multiple learners, but this approach has limitations. Firstly, the supervisions from a single learner are often noisy, leading to unreliable consistency regularization. Secondly, the existing reliability measurement based on pixel-wise confidence scores accumulates errors during training. To address these issues, our CFCG framework combines cross-fusion and contour guidance supervision. We use both image-level and feature-level perturbations to expand feature distribution and maximize the potential of consistency regularization. We introduce two modules to enable effective semi-supervised learning under coherent perturbations. The Cross-Fusion Supervision (CFS) mechanism enhances the quality of pseudo labels by leveraging multiple learners. The adaptive contour guidance module (ACGM) effectively identifies unreliable spatial regions in pseudo labels. Our CFCG framework achieves significant improvements in mIoU (+1.40%, +0.89% with a single learner and +1.85%, +1.33% with fusion inference) on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets under 1/8 protocols, surpassing previous methods and establishing a new state-of-the-art.
