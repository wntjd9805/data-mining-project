We have developed a new method called Factorized Inverse Path Tracing (FIPT) to overcome the limitations of previous inverse path tracing techniques used for estimating materials and lighting in indoor scenes. Path tracing is computationally expensive, and there are ambiguities between reflection and emission. Our FIPT approach addresses these challenges by utilizing a factored light transport formulation and identifying emitters through rendering errors. Our algorithm achieves faster and more accurate optimization of materials and lighting compared to previous methods, while also effectively resolving ambiguities. Through extensive experiments on synthetic scenes, we have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art inverse rendering and relighting techniques, particularly under complex illumination effects. Additionally, our FIPT approach speeds up the optimization process to less than an hour. We have also shown the robustness of our method to noisy inputs, as it allows for plausible relighting in real scenes. The source code for our method is available at the provided GitHub link.
