To address the visual inconsistency problem in composited images, image harmonization techniques aim to adjust the foreground pixels based on the background as a reference. However, existing methods that use local color transformation or region matching between foreground and background have limited performance across different foreground objects and scenes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach called the Global-aware Kernel Network (GKNet) that considers long-distance background references for harmonizing local regions. GKNet consists of two parts: harmony kernel prediction and harmony kernel modulation branches. The former incorporates a Long-distance Reference Extractor (LRE) to capture long-distance context and Kernel Prediction Blocks (KPB) to predict multi-level harmony kernels by combining global information with local features. Additionally, we introduce a Selective Correlation Fusion (SCF) module to better select relevant long-distance background references for local harmonization. The latter part uses the predicted kernels to harmonize foreground regions with both local and global awareness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in image harmonization, achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 39.53dB, which is 0.78dB higher than the best counterpart, and reducing the fractional mean square error (fMSE)/MSE by 11.5%/6.7% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The code for our method will be made available [insert link].
