The accurate segmentation of road lines and markings is crucial for autonomous driving. We have noticed that road lines and markings are often hidden due to factors such as moving vehicles, shadows, and glare. However, they have a consistent appearance and low shape variance within their class. In order to address these challenges, we introduce a module called Homography Guided Fusion (HomoFusion) that utilizes neighboring video frames to provide additional information for correctly classifying partially occluded road lines and markings. To make the process more computationally efficient, we propose a novel surface normal estimator that establishes spatial correspondences between sampled frames. This allows the HomoFusion module to update the representation of the occluded road lines and markings using a pixel-to-pixel attention mechanism. Our method surpasses other state-of-the-art lane mark segmentation models in terms of performance, requiring less than 9% of their parameters and computational complexity. By leveraging camera intrinsic data and assuming a ground plane, we have developed a lightweight network that achieves both speed and accuracy improvements. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of our HomoFusion approach by successfully applying it to the task of water puddle segmentation, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
