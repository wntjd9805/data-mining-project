Motion-blurred images often occur when there is fast camera or object movement, regardless of whether it is captured using a global shutter (GS) or a rolling shutter (RS). These two exposure modes result in different types of image degradation, leading to separate restoration approaches for GS and RS images. However, restoring these images is challenging, especially when only a single input image is available. In this paper, we introduce a new exposure mode called global reset release (GRR) shutter, which produces GS-like blur with row-dependent blur magnitude. We leverage this unique characteristic of GRR to explore latent frames within a single image and restore a clear image by utilizing these latent contexts. Our proposed method, called the residual spatially-compensated and spectrally-enhanced Transformer (RSS-T) block, is designed for row-dependent deblurring of a single GRR image. The RSS-T block incorporates hierarchical positional encoding to compensate for global positional context and enables order-awareness of the local pixel's position. Additionally, it utilizes a novel feed-forward network that combines spatial and spectral information to gain mixed global context. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art GS deblurring and RS correction methods when applied to single GRR input images.
