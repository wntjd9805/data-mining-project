We propose a novel approach called ES-SAformer for single hyperspectral image super-resolution (single-HSI-SR). Existing CNN-based methods have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies and interaction information between spectral features, leading to suboptimal utilization of spectral information and the presence of artifacts in the upsampled images. To address this, we introduce a robust similarity metric called the spectral correlation coefficient of the spectrum (SCC) and incorporate it into our model to enhance training. We also utilize a kernelizable attention technique to develop an efficient SCC-kernel-based self-attention (ESSA) mechanism that enlarges the receptive field without increasing computation complexity. This allows our model to effectively utilize spatial-spectral information from different scales and generate more natural high-resolution images. Our experiments show that ESSA outperforms existing methods in terms of visual quality and quantitative results, without the need for pre-training on large-scale datasets. The code for our approach will be made available at ESSAformer.
