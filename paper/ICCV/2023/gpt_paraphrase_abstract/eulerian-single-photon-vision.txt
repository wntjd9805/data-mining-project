Single-photon sensors are capable of measuring light signals at the most detailed level by detecting individual photons. However, they present two significant challenges: strong Poisson noise and high data acquisition rates, which also affect downstream computer vision tasks. Previous approaches have focused on solving the image reconstruction problem first and then using existing methods for subsequent tasks. However, these solutions are expensive and not scalable for the large volumes of data produced by single-photon sensors. In this study, we propose an alternative approach that bypasses the image reconstruction problem. Instead, we introduce computationally lightweight phase-based algorithms for edge detection and motion estimation tasks. These algorithms directly process the raw single-photon data as a 3D volume using a set of velocity-tuned filters. Our methods achieve significant speed-ups, surpassing two orders of magnitude compared to explicit reconstruction-based methods.
