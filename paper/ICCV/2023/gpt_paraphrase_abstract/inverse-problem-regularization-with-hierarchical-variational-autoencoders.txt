This paper introduces a novel approach to regularizing ill-posed inverse problems using a deep hierarchical variational autoencoder (HVAE) as an image prior. The proposed method combines the benefits of denoiser-based Plug & Play approaches and generative model-based approaches. By leveraging the properties of variational autoencoders (VAEs), we design an efficient algorithm that takes advantage of the convergence guarantees offered by Plug-and-Play (PnP) methods. Unlike previous methods, our approach is not limited to specialized datasets and can handle image restoration problems on natural images of any size. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PnP-HVAE method performs competitively compared to state-of-the-art denoiser-based PnP approaches and other restoration methods based on generative models.
