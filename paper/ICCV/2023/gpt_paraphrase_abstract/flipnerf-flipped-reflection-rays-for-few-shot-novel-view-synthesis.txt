FlipNeRF is a regularization method proposed in this work for few-shot novel view synthesis. It addresses the need for a dense set of multi-view images, which has hindered practical application progress in Neural Radiance Field (NeRF). FlipNeRF utilizes flipped reflection rays derived from input ray directions and estimated normal vectors. These flipped reflection rays serve as additional training rays, improving the accuracy of surface normal estimation and 3D geometry learning. By accurately estimating surface normals, depth estimation is enhanced, which is crucial for few-shot novel view synthesis. FlipNeRF also introduces Uncertainty-aware Emptiness Loss and Bottleneck Feature Consistency Loss to reduce floating artifacts and enhance feature-level consistency without the need for additional feature extraction. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in various benchmarks and scenarios.
