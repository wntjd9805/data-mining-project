We present GaPro, a novel method for instance segmentation on 3D point clouds using weak supervision. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on full supervision, which is time-consuming and costly. GaPro overcomes this limitation by using axis-aligned 3D bounding box supervision. Our approach involves generating pseudo labels from these bounding box annotations and training a 3D instance segmentation network. We also incorporate a self-training strategy to further improve performance. To generate pseudo instance masks, we utilize a Gaussian Process that handles overlaps and provides uncertainty values. Our experiments demonstrate that GaPro outperforms previous weakly supervised methods and is competitive with fully supervised methods. Additionally, we show the adaptability of our approach by using the pseudo labels to train other fully supervised methods.
