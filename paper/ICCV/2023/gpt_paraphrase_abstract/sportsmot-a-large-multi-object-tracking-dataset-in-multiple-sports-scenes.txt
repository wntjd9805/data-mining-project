This study introduces a new dataset called SportsMOT, which focuses on multi-object tracking (MOT) in sports scenes. MOT is important for collecting statistics and supporting applications like automatic tactical analysis. SportsMOT consists of 240 video sequences from basketball, volleyball, and football, with over 150K frames and 1.6M bounding boxes. The dataset has two key properties: fast and variable-speed motion, and similar yet distinguishable appearance. The authors benchmark various trackers and find that the main challenge in SportsMOT is object association. To address this, they propose a new framework called MixSort, which integrates motion-based and appearance-based association models. MixSort achieves state-of-the-art performance on SportsMOT and MOT17. The authors provide an in-depth analysis and insights into the dataset based on MixSort.
