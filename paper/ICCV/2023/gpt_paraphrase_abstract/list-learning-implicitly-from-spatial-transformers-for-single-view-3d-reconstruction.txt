Reconstructing the detailed geometry and topology of a 3D object from a single 2D image is a significant challenge in computer vision. Current solutions struggle with accurately capturing self-occluded geometry and faithfully reconstructing topological shape structures. To address this issue, we propose a new neural architecture called LIST. This architecture combines local and global image features to achieve precise reconstruction of the geometric and topological structure of a 3D object from a single image.Our approach involves using global 2D features to initially predict a rough shape of the target object. This coarse prediction serves as a foundation for higher-resolution reconstruction. By leveraging both local 2D features from the image and 3D features from the coarse prediction, we can accurately predict the signed distance between any point and the target surface using an implicit predictor.Importantly, our model does not rely on camera estimation or pixel alignment, allowing for unbiased reconstruction from the input-view direction. Through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art methods in reconstructing 3D objects from synthetic and real-world images.We have made our source code openly available to the research community [13].
