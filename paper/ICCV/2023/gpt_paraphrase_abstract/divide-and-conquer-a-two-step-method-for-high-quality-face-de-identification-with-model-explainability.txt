We introduce IDeudemon, a novel approach for face de-identification that aims to balance privacy and utility while maintaining explainability. Existing methods often struggle with a trade-off between privacy and utility, making the latent space hard to interpret. In contrast, IDeudemon adopts a "divide and conquer" strategy to protect identity and preserve utility gradually. In Step I, we obscure the 3D disentangled ID code, generated by a parametric NeRF model, to safeguard identity. In Step II, we incorporate visual similarity assistance and train a GAN with adjusted losses to retain image utility. Our approach leverages a powerful 3D prior and meticulous generative designs, resulting in natural identity protection, high-quality details, and robustness to various poses and expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IDeudemon outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.
