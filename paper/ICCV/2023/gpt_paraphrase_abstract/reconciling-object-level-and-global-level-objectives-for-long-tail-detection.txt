Large vocabulary object detectors often struggle with long-tailed label distributions, which hampers their ability to detect rarely seen categories. This is due to two main factors: misclassification of rare objects as frequent categories and the limitation on the number of detections per image. Existing methods primarily focus on improving object-level classification accuracy but overlook the global-level ranking task. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Reconciles Object-level and Global-level (ROG) objectives to address both problems. ROG is a multi-task learning framework that simultaneously trains the model to classify each object proposal individually and rank all confidence scores globally. We introduce a generalized average precision (GAP) loss to optimize the global-level score ranking across different objects. The GAP loss generates balanced gradients to rectify ranking errors for each category. Experimental results demonstrate the versatility and benefits of the GAP loss when integrated into advanced methods. The code for ROG is available at https://github.com/EricZsy/ROG.
