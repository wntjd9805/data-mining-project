The lack of diverse training data, inaccessible target data, and large domain shift pose challenges in generalizing to unseen image domains. To address this problem, data augmentation plays a crucial role in domain generalization methods. This study introduces Adversarial Bayesian Augmentation (ABA), an innovative algorithm designed to generate image augmentations in the single-source domain generalization setting. ABA combines adversarial learning and Bayesian neural networks to generate diverse data augmentations that assist the classifier in generalizing to unseen domains. The effectiveness of ABA is demonstrated in various domain shift scenarios, including style shift, subpopulation shift, and medical imaging settings. ABA surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, such as pre-specified augmentations, pixel-based, and convolutional-based augmentations. The code for ABA is available at https://github.com/shengcheng/ABA.
