Image distortion caused by atmospheric turbulence is a significant issue in long-range optical imaging systems. Previous research has explored various approaches, such as model-based methods and deep-learning techniques using synthetic data. However, these methods solely rely on synthetic data and ground truth pairs for training, which limits their adaptability to real-world turbulence conditions. In this paper, we propose the Physics-integrated Restoration Network (PiRN) to incorporate a physics-based simulator directly into the training process. This integration enables the network to separate the stochastic degradation from the underlying image. Additionally, we introduce PiRN with Stochastic Refinement (PiRN-SR) to overcome the limitations of deterministic models and bridge the gap between synthetic and real-world degradations. Our PiRN and PiRN-SR models significantly improve generalization to unknown turbulence conditions and achieve state-of-the-art restoration in terms of both pixel-wise accuracy and perceptual quality.
