Glaucoma, a leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, poses a challenge in accurate detection and forecasting of its progression due to limited labeled patients with state-of-the-art 3D retinal imaging data from optical coherence tomography (OCT). To tackle the scarcity of data, this study proposes two solutions. Firstly, a novel semi-supervised learning (SSL) model called pseudo supervisor is developed to effectively utilize unlabeled data. Unlike existing models, the pseudo supervisor optimizes the prediction of pseudo labels using unlabeled samples to enhance empirical generalization. The model is evaluated on two clinical tasks: glaucoma detection and progression forecasting, both unimodally and multimodally. The pseudo supervisor model outperforms existing SSL comparison models and achieves the best results on the publicly available LAG fundus dataset. Secondly, the Harvard Glaucoma Detection and Progression (Harvard-GDP) Dataset is introduced. This multimodal multitask dataset comprises data from 1,000 patients with OCT imaging data, along with labels for glaucoma detection and progression. It is the largest glaucoma detection dataset with 3D OCT imaging data and the first publicly available glaucoma progression forecasting dataset. The dataset includes detailed sex and racial analysis, which can be used for fairness learning studies by interested researchers. The released dataset is benchmarked using state-of-the-art supervised CNN and transformer deep learning models. The dataset and code are publicly accessible through the provided link.
