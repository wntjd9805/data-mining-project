SemARFlow is an unsupervised optical flow network designed for autonomous driving data. Traditional optical flow estimation is challenging in areas with occlusions, motion boundaries, and low-texture regions. To address this, SemARFlow incorporates additional information such as semantics and domain knowledge. It takes estimated semantic segmentation masks as inputs, which are used to improve the flow estimation. The additional information is injected into the encoder and a learned upsampler that refines the flow output. Furthermore, a semantic augmentation module provides self-supervision for learning flow and its boundaries for specific objects like vehicles, poles, and the sky. By incorporating semantic information, SemARFlow achieves a significant improvement in the KITTI-2015 optical flow test error rate, reducing it from 11.80% to 8.38%. The approach also demonstrates visible enhancements around object boundaries and improved generalization across datasets. The code for SemARFlow is publicly available at https://github.com/duke-vision/semantic-unsup-flow-release.
