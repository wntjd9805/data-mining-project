Siamese networks have been widely used as a benchmark framework for 3D LiDAR object tracking. These networks rely on a matching network to determine the similarity between a template and search region. In this paper, we propose a new approach called SyncTrack that eliminates the need for a separate matching network and synchronizes the feature extraction and matching processes in a single-branch framework. This synchronization is achieved through a dynamic affinity mechanism inspired by the Transformer model. We provide a theoretical analysis of the relevance of this synchronization. Additionally, we introduce a novel strategy called Attentive Points-Sampling (APST) that replaces the random or farthest points sampling method with sampling based on attentive relations between the template and search region. This strategy connects point-wise sampling with feature learning, leading to better aggregation of distinctive and geometric features for tracking with sparse points. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets (KITTI and NuScenes) demonstrate that SyncTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-time tracking.
