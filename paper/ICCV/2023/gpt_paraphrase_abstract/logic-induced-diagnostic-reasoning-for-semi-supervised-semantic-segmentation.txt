Recent advancements in semi-supervised semantic segmentation have relied heavily on the use of pseudo labeling to compensate for limited labeled data, without considering the valuable relational knowledge between semantic concepts. To address this issue, we introduce LOGICDIAG, a novel framework for neural-logic semi-supervised learning. Our key insight is that conflicts within pseudo labels, identified through symbolic knowledge, can serve as strong yet often overlooked learning signals. LOGICDIAG resolves these conflicts by reasoning with logic-induced diagnoses, allowing for the identification and correction of potentially erroneous pseudo labels, thereby mitigating the problem of error accumulation. We demonstrate the practical application of LOGICDIAG in the context of data-scarce segmentation scenarios, where we formalize the structured abstraction of semantic concepts using a set of logic rules. Extensive experiments conducted on three widely-used semi-supervised semantic segmentation benchmarks validate the effectiveness and versatility of LOGICDIAG. Additionally, LOGICDIAG highlights the promising possibilities that arise from the systematic integration of symbolic reasoning with prevalent statistical and neural learning approaches.
