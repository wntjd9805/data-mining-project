The generation of human-scene interactions (HSI) that can be naturally controlled has important applications in VR/AR content creation and human-centered AI. However, current methods for generating HSIs are unnatural and lack intuitive control, limiting their practical use. This study focuses on the challenging task of generating realistic and diverse HSIs from textual descriptions in a natural and controllable manner. The proposed approach, called Narrator, utilizes relationship reasoning and a conditional variation autoencoder to achieve this goal. Global and local spatial relationships in a 3D scene and a textual description are modeled using scene graphs, and an action mechanism is introduced to represent interactions at the level of body parts. The study also presents a multi-human generation strategy, which is the first exploration of controllable multi-human scene interaction generation. Extensive experiments and perceptual studies demonstrate that Narrator is capable of generating diverse interactions in a controllable manner and outperforms existing works.
