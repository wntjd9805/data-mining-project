In the real world, large-scale datasets often exhibit long-tailed distributions, with a few majority classes having abundant samples while most minority classes have very few. This leads to an imbalance in the hyperplanes, with a skew towards the minority classes. Traditionally, reweighting methods have been used to address this issue by adjusting the weights based on the number of samples in each class. However, we find that the number of samples alone is not sufficient to accurately measure the size of the spanned space for each class, especially for the majority class. The size of the majority class's spanned space is typically larger than the number of samples due to its high diversity. Therefore, using weights based solely on the number of samples still compresses the space of minority classes.In this paper, we propose a new approach to reweighting that takes into account the relationships between samples in addition to statistical numbers. We argue that these relationships are crucial for accurately depicting the spanned space. We estimate the effective area of each class by analyzing the distribution of its samples and treating them as identically distributed random variables. By analyzing the correlations between samples, we derive a simple and non-parametric formula to estimate the effective area. We then calculate the weight inversely proportional to the effective area of each class, which allows for fairer training. Importantly, these weights can be adaptively adjusted during training to make them more flexible.Experimental results on four long-tailed datasets demonstrate that our proposed weights outperform existing reweighting methods. Furthermore, our method also achieves better results on statistically balanced CIFAR-10/100 datasets. The code for our method is available online.
