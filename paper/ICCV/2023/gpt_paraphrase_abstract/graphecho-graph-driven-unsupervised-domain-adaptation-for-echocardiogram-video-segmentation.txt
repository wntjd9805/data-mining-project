The unsupervised domain adaption (UDA) for echocardiogram video segmentation is a crucial aspect of cardiac disease diagnosis. However, existing UDA segmentation methods are inadequate for this task as they fail to consider local information and the cyclical consistency of heartbeat. To address this, the authors of this paper present a new dataset called CardiacUDA and propose a novel method called GraphEcho for cardiac structure segmentation. GraphEcho consists of two modules, Spatial-wise Cross-domain Graph Matching (SCGM) and Temporal Cycle Consistency (TCC), which leverage prior knowledge of echocardiogram videos such as consistent cardiac structure across patients and centers, as well as heartbeat cyclical consistency. These modules effectively align global and local features from both source and target domains, resulting in improved UDA segmentation outcomes. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphEcho surpasses existing UDA segmentation methods. The authors plan to make their dataset and code publicly available. Overall, this study establishes a solid foundation for the segmentation of cardiac structures in echocardiogram videos.
