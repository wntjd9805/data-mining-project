This paper conducts a comprehensive investigation on the privacy concerns associated with the widespread use of face recognition technology. It focuses on protecting the visual information of face images and preventing unauthorized recovery of sensitive data. By exploiting the perceptual differences between humans and models, the proposed approach involves concealing visual information by removing low-frequency components that are detectable by humans. The paper addresses the challenge of reducing model-exploitable information while maintaining high recognition accuracy. It suggests training and inferring recognition models using randomly selected frequency components to resolve this dilemma. The outcome of this research is a new privacy-preserving face recognition method called PartialFace. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PartialFace effectively balances privacy protection and recognition accuracy. The code for implementing this method is available at the provided link.
