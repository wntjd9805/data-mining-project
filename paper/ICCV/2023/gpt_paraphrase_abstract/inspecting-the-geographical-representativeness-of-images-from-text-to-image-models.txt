Recent advancements in generative models have led to the creation of realistic and relevant images based on textual inputs. These models are widely used to generate numerous images every day and have the potential to significantly impact various domains like generative art, digital marketing, and data augmentation. Given their significant influence, it is crucial to ensure that the generated content represents diverse global artifacts and environments instead of disproportionately favoring specific regions. In this study, we assess the geographical representativeness of commonly used nouns (e.g., a house) generated by DALL·E 2 and Stable Diffusion models. We conducted a crowdsourced study involving 540 participants from 27 countries. For ambiguous inputs without country names, the generated images predominantly reflect the surroundings of the United States, followed by India. The images rarely represent the environments from other countries, with an average score of less than 3 out of 5. However, specifying the country names in the input improves the representativeness by an average of 1.44 points on a 5-point Likert scale for DALL·E 2 and 0.75 points for Stable Diffusion. Nevertheless, the overall scores for many countries still remain low, indicating the need for future models to be more inclusive of diverse geographical contexts. Additionally, we explore the possibility of quantifying geographical representativeness without conducting user studies.
