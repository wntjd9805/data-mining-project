This paper addresses the issue of correcting rolling shutter distortion in complex and dynamic scenes with heavy occlusion. Existing methods have two main limitations. Firstly, they struggle to accurately estimate the correction field due to the assumption of uniform velocity, resulting in significant correction errors when dealing with complex motion. Secondly, the severe occlusion in dynamic scenes makes it difficult for current solutions to achieve better image quality by aligning and combining multiple frames.To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that analytically models the curvilinear trajectory of pixels. This approach, called Quadratic Rolling Shutter (QRS) motion solver, accurately estimates the high-order correction field for each pixel. Additionally, we introduce a 3D video architecture called RSA2-Net to reconstruct high-quality occlusion frames in dynamic scenes. RSA2-Net effectively aligns and aggregates multi-frame context.We evaluate our method on various cameras and video sequences, and our results demonstrate its significant superiority over state-of-the-art techniques. Specifically, our method outperforms existing methods by +4.98, +0.77, and +4.33 in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) on the Carla-RS, Fastec-RS, and BS-RSC datasets, respectively.The code for our method is available at https://github.com/DelinQu/qrsc.
