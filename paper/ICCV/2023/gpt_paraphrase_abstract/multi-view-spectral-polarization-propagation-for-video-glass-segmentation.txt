This paper introduces a novel solution called PGVS-Net, which is capable of accurately segmenting glass objects in RGB-P video sequences. By utilizing both spatio-temporal polarization and color information, our method effectively eliminates the dependence on viewing angles and reduces intensity variations on glass objects. Our experiments demonstrate that PGVS-Net outperforms existing methods in both RGB-only video sequences and per-frame RGB-P single-image segmentation. To facilitate the training and evaluation of PGVS-Net, we also introduce a new dataset called PGV-117, which consists of 117 video sequences captured under different camera paths, lighting conditions, dynamics, and glass types.
