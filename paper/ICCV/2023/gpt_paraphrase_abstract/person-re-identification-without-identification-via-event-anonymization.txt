The widespread use of visual surveillance in public spaces poses a threat to individual privacy and requires significant resources. Recently, event cameras have been considered a solution to this privacy issue as they do not capture detailed visual information. However, deep learning architectures have now been able to reconstruct images from event cameras, reintroducing privacy concerns. In this study, we aim to protect the identity of human subjects by anonymizing event-streams. We propose a network architecture that is optimized for both preserving privacy and performing a downstream task, such as person Re-Identification (ReId). Our network learns to scramble events, degrading the images recovered by potential privacy attackers. We also introduce the first-ever event-based person ReId dataset to evaluate our approach. Through extensive experiments using simulated event data and our proposed dataset, we validate our approach. The code for our work is available at the given GitHub link.
