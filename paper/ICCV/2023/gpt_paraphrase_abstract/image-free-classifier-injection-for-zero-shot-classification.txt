Zero-shot learning models have demonstrated impressive performance in image classification for classes that were not seen during training. However, these models typically require specialized training methods and access to a training dataset when the need for zero-shot classification arises. This paper proposes a method called Image-free Classifier Injection with Semantics (ICIS) to equip pre-trained models with zero-shot classification capabilities without the use of image data. ICIS achieves this by injecting classifiers for new, unseen classes into pre-trained classification models post-hoc, using existing classifier weights and simple class-wise descriptors like class names or attributes. ICIS employs two encoder-decoder networks to reconstruct classifier weights from descriptors and vice versa, leveraging reconstruction and cosine losses for regularization. Importantly, ICIS can be trained and applied directly on top of pre-trained models at a low cost. Experimental results on benchmark zero-shot learning datasets demonstrate that ICIS produces unseen classifier weights that achieve strong zero-shot classification performance.
