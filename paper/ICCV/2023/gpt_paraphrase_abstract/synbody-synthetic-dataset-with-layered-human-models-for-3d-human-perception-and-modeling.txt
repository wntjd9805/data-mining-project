A new synthetic dataset called SynBody has been introduced in order to improve the diversity and quality of human models used in 3D human research. This dataset offers several attractive features: a clothed parametric human model that can generate a wide range of subjects, a layered human representation that provides high-quality 3D annotations for multiple tasks, and a scalable system for producing realistic data to support real-world tasks. The dataset consists of 1.2 million images with accurate corresponding 3D annotations, covering 10,000 human body models, 1,187 actions, and various viewpoints. It includes two subsets for human pose and shape estimation, as well as human neural rendering. Extensive experiments conducted on SynBody show that it significantly improves both SMPL and SMPL-X estimation. Additionally, the incorporation of layered annotations provides a valuable training resource for investigating the Human Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF).
