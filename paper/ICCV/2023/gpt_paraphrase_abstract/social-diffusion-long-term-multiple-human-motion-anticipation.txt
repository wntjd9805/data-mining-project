We present Social Diffusion, a new technique for predicting the movements and social interactions of multiple individuals in the short and long term. Predicting the motions of multiple people engaged in social activities is difficult due to the interdependencies between individuals. In this study, we utilize a diffusion model based on motion histories and causal temporal convolutional networks to forecast plausible motions for each person in a contextual manner. To ensure contextual plausibility, we employ an order-invariant aggregation function. Additionally, we introduce a novel evaluation protocol to assess the plausibility of social interactions, which we test on the Haggling dataset, a challenging dataset featuring a social activity where individuals take turns speaking and shift their attention. Our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art in terms of motion realism and contextual plausibility on four multi-person forecasting datasets.
