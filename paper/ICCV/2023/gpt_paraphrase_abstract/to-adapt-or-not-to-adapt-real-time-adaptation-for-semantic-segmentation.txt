This paper introduces HAMLET, a novel framework called Hardware-Aware Modular Least Expensive Training, designed for real-time domain adaptation in semantic segmentation. The objective is to address unexpected domain changes that occur during deployment, such as sudden weather events. The traditional brute-force adaptation method is not practical due to its high computational costs. HAMLET comprises two main components: a hardware-aware back-propagation orchestration agent (HAMT) and a specialized domain-shift detector (LT). These components work together to enable active control over the adaptation process, determining when and how the model should adapt. The key advantage of HAMLET is its ability to perform semantic segmentation and adapt in real-time, achieving a frame rate of more than 29 frames per second on a single consumer-grade GPU. This is made possible by the innovative hardware-aware approach implemented in the framework. Experimental results on the OnDA and SHIFT benchmarks demonstrate the promising trade-off between accuracy and speed achieved by HAMLET. The framework shows encouraging results in terms of both adaptation performance and computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-world applications.
