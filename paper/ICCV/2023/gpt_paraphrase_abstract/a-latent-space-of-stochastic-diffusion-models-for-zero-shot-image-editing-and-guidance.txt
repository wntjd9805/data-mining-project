This paper investigates the potential of defining a latent space in stochastic diffusion models, where Gaussian noises are added during the denoising process. Although this results in a latent space of higher dimensionality than the original image, we show that it can still be utilized in the same way as the latent space of deterministic diffusion models. We introduce CycleDiffusion, a method for zero-shot and unpaired image editing using stochastic diffusion models, which outperforms its deterministic counterpart. Additionally, we demonstrate the possibility of unified, plug-and-play guidance in the latent spaces of both deterministic and stochastic diffusion models. The code for our proposed method is publicly available.
