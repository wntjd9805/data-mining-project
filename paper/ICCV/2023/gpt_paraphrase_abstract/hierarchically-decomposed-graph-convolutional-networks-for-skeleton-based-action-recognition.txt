This paper introduces a novel architecture called Hierarchically Decomposed Graph Convolutional Network (HD-GCN) for skeleton-based action recognition. The authors address the challenge of generating adjacency matrices with semantically meaningful edges by proposing a hierarchically decomposed graph (HD-Graph). The HD-GCN decomposes joint nodes into sets to extract major structurally adjacent and distant edges, constructing an HD-Graph that captures the semantic spaces of a human skeleton. Additionally, an attention-guided hierarchy aggregation module is introduced to highlight the dominant hierarchical edge sets of the HD-Graph. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on four large datasets. Comparative experiments further demonstrate the effectiveness of the model. The code for the proposed HD-GCN is available at https://github.com/Jho-Yonsei/HD-GCN.
