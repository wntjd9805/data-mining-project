This paper introduces a novel approach for addressing image degradation caused by rain, which often includes a combination of rain streaks and raindrops. These diverse rain artifacts make it challenging to recover the original clean image. To effectively deal with this issue, it is essential to model the correlation relationship between these irregular rain degradations. The proposed method, named UDR-S2Former (Sparse Sampling Transformer based on Uncertainty-Driven Ranking), aims to learn and model degradation relationships in a global context, enabling the unified removal of complex rain scenes. UDR-S2Former offers three significant advantages compared to previous methods. Firstly, it can adaptively sample relevant information about image degradation to effectively model the underlying degradation relationships. Secondly, the explicit application of the uncertainty-driven ranking strategy allows the network to focus on degradation features and comprehend the reconstruction process. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that UDR-S2Former outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all benchmark datasets.
