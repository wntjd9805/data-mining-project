This paper presents a solution to the problem of real-time 6-DoF object tracking using an RGB video. Previous methods either relied on handcrafted features for optimization or used neural networks for pose prediction, but both approaches had limitations. In this study, a learning-based active contour model is proposed, which combines the strengths of both methods. The model utilizes an initial pose to project the object model onto the image plane, generating an initial contour. A lightweight network then predicts how the contour should move to align with the true object boundary, providing gradients for optimizing the object pose. The authors also introduce an efficient optimization algorithm to train the model end-to-end with pose supervision. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world object tracking datasets demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of pose accuracy, while also achieving real-time performance on mobile devices. The code for the model is available on the project page: https://zju3dv.github.io/deep_ac/.
