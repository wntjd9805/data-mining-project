The task of recognizing facial expressions is challenging due to the ambiguity of expressions. The presence of noisy labels significantly affects performance in real-world scenarios. To tackle this issue, we propose a new model called Landmark-Aware Net (LA-Net), which utilizes facial landmarks to mitigate the impact of label noise from two perspectives. Firstly, LA-Net utilizes landmark information to reduce uncertainty in expression space and improves the quality of training supervision by constructing the label distribution of each sample through neighborhood aggregation. Secondly, the model incorporates landmark information into expression representations using a devised expression-landmark contrastive loss. This enhances the expression feature extractor, making it less affected by label noise. Our method can be integrated with any deep neural network to improve training supervision without introducing extra inference costs. We conduct comprehensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic noisy datasets and demonstrate that LA-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance.
