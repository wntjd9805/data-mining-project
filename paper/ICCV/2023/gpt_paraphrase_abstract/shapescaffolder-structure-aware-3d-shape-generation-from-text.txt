We introduce ShapeScaffolder, a neural network that generates colored 3D shapes based on text input. Our approach aims to improve the quality of generated shapes by capturing finer text-shape connections. Unlike traditional methods that generate 3D shapes as a whole, we recognize that humans perceive both shape and text as having a structure. For example, a table is seen as comprising legs, a seat, and a back, while texts possess inherent linguistic structures that can be analyzed as dependency graphs. By considering the structure of shapes and texts, we believe we can enhance the text-shape connections and improve shape generation.However, the lack of explicit shape structure and the flexible nature of text structure pose challenges for learning across modalities. To overcome these challenges, we first construct structured shape implicit fields in an unsupervised manner. Then, we propose a part-level attention mechanism that aligns shape parts with textual graph nodes, enabling structural-level alignment between the two modalities. Finally, we employ a shape refiner to add more detail to the predicted structure, resulting in the final shapes.Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of shape fidelity and shape-text matching. Moreover, our methods enable part-level manipulation and improved part-level completeness.
