Improving the ability of deep learning models to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios is crucial in domains like healthcare and autonomous vehicles. Gradient-based regularizers have shown promising results in enhancing OOD generalization. However, our understanding of the role of Hessian and gradient alignment in domain generalization is still limited. To address this gap, we analyze the impact of the Hessian matrix and gradient of the classifier's head in domain generalization using the recent OOD theory of transferability. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the spectral norm between the Hessian matrices of the classifier's head across domains serves as an upper bound for the transfer measure, which represents the distance between target and source domains. We also examine the attributes that become aligned when we encourage similarity between Hessians and gradients. This analysis helps explain the success of various regularizers such as CORAL, IRM, V-REx, Fish, IGA, and Fishr, as they regularize either the classifier's head Hessian or gradient. Additionally, we propose two efficient methods, based on the Hessian Gradient Product (HGP) and Hutchinson's method (Hutchinson), to match the Hessians and gradients of the classifier's head without directly calculating Hessians. We validate the OOD generalization ability of these methods in different scenarios, including transferability, severe correlation shift, label shift, and diversity shift. Our results demonstrate that Hessian alignment methods achieve promising performance on various OOD benchmarks. The code for our methods is available.
