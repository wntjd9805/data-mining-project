Infrared small target detection in single-frame images involves separating small targets from background clutter. Deep learning methods have shown promising results in this area, but they require a large amount of training data with pixel-level annotations, which can be expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that achieves small target detection with single-point supervision. Our method aims to recover the per-pixel mask of each target from a single point label by using clustering techniques. This task is challenging due to the saliency of targets and the presence of background clutter. To overcome this challenge, we introduce randomness to the clustering process by adding noise to the input images. This allows us to obtain more reliable pseudo masks by averaging the results of the clustering. By applying this "Monte Carlo" clustering approach, our method can accurately recover pseudo masks and convert fully supervised small target detection networks into weakly supervised ones with only single point annotations. We conducted experiments on four datasets, which demonstrated that our method can achieve comparable performance to fully supervised networks. This suggests that single-point supervision is sufficient for small target detection.
