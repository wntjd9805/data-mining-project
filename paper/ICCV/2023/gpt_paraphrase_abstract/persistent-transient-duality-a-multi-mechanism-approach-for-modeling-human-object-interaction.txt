Humans are highly adaptable and can quickly switch between different modes to handle various tasks, situations, and contexts. In Human-object interaction (HOI) activities, these modes can be attributed to two mechanisms: a large-scale consistent plan for the entire activity and small-scale interactive actions that occur along the timeline. While neuroscience and cognitive science have confirmed this multi-mechanism nature of human behavior, machine modeling approaches for human motion are lagging behind. Current approaches, such as graph attention networks, attempt to model dynamic HOI patterns but fail to capture the fast and discrete mode-switching nature of human motion. To address this gap, this study proposes a model that incorporates two concurrent mechanisms for controlling human motion: a Persistent process that runs continuously on a global scale and Transient sub-processes that operate intermittently on the local context of the human interacting with objects. These two mechanisms form an interactive Persistent-Transient Duality that governs activity sequences. The model is represented by a parent-child neural network consisting of Persistent and Transient channels, with a dedicated neural module for dynamic mechanism switching. The proposed framework is evaluated on HOI motion forecasting using two diverse datasets and various settings. The results consistently demonstrate superior performance, indicating the suitability of the model for the challenge.
