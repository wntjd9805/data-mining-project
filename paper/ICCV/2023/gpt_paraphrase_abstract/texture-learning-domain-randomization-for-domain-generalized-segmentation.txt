Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) used for semantic segmentation often struggle to generalize to unseen domains due to a domain gap problem. This is mainly caused by the influence of texture, making the models biased towards texture features. Existing methods have addressed this issue by prioritizing shape over texture in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS). However, shape and texture are both important cues in semantic segmentation. Therefore, this paper argues for the importance of leveraging texture in DGSS and proposes a novel framework called Texture Learning DomainRandomization (TLDR). TLDR incorporates two new losses to enhance texture learning in DGSS. Firstly, a texture regularization loss is introduced to prevent overfitting to source domain textures by utilizing texture features from a pre-trained model. Secondly, a texture generalization loss is introduced, which uses random style images to learn diverse texture representations in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TLDR, with a mIoU improvement of 1.9 over the prior state-of-the-art method on the GTAâ†’Cityscapes dataset using ResNet-50.
