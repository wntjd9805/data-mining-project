Ordinal regression involves classifying object instances into ordinal categories, and it has been extensively researched in various fields like medical disease grading and movie rating. Previous methods have focused on learning the relationships between different categories, but they have struggled to effectively distinguish adjacent categories.   To address this limitation, we introduce a novel approach called Ord2Seq. Our method transforms each ordinal category label into a unique label sequence, allowing us to view the ordinal regression task as a sequence prediction problem. By doing this, we break down the ordinal regression task into a series of recursive binary classification steps, enabling us to better differentiate adjacent categories.   We conducted comprehensive experiments to evaluate our approach, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of distinguishing adjacent categories for improving performance. In fact, our new approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in four different scenarios. We have made the codes for our approach available at https://github.com/wjh892521292/Ord2Seq.
