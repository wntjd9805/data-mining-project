Video Question-Answering (VideoQA) has become a popular topic of interest in both industry and research. However, current methods in VideoQA are often misled by dataset bias, which focuses on spurious correlations in the training data. In order to understand the impact of dataset bias, we analyze the VideoQA pipeline using a causal graph, which demonstrates the cause-and-effect relationships among the video, question, aligned features, answer, and underlying confounder. Our analysis reveals that the confounder and the backdoor path contribute to spurious causality. To address the challenge of dealing with unobserved and non-enumerable confounders in VideoQA, we propose a model-agnostic framework called Knowledge Proxy Intervention (KPI). KPI introduces an additional knowledge proxy variable in the causal graph to eliminate the effect of the confounder by cutting off the backdoor path. Importantly, our KPI framework does not require prior knowledge about the confounder. We validate the effectiveness of our KPI framework using three baseline methods on five benchmark datasets, including MSVD-QA, MSRVTT-QA, TGIF-QA, NExT-QA, and Causal-VidQA. The answer format provided by our framework focuses solely on the abstraction of the answer.
