This paper presents StreamPETR, a framework for multi-view 3D object detection. The framework is based on the sparse query design of the PETR series and incorporates an object-centric temporal mechanism. The model operates online and propagates long-term historical information through object queries frame by frame. Additionally, a motion-aware layer normalization is introduced to capture object movement. StreamPETR achieves significant performance improvements with minimal computational cost compared to the single-frame baseline. On the nuScenes benchmark, it is the first online multi-view method to achieve comparable performance with lidar-based methods. The lightweight version of StreamPETR outperforms the state-of-the-art method (SOLOFusion) in terms of mean average precision (mAP) and frames per second (FPS).
