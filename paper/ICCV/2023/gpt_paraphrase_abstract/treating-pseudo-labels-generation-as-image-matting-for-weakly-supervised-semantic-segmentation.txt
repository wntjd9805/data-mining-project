We propose a new approach called Mat-Label for generating accurate pseudo-labels in Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS). We treat the task as an image matting problem, using a trimap to specify foreground, background, and unknown regions. Our intuition is that generating a trimap is easier than directly generating pseudo-labels. Current CAM-based methods for generating trimaps suffer from confusion between cross-category and foreground-background pixel predictions. To address this, we introduce Double Decoupled Class Activation Map (D2CAM) in Mat-Label, which explicitly models class activation maps with category decoupling and foreground-background decoupling. We also incorporate two refinement constraints in D2CAM to stabilize optimization and eliminate non-exclusive activation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Mat-Label approach outperforms current state-of-the-art WSSS methods consistently.
