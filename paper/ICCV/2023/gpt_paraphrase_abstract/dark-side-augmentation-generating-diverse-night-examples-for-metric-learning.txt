We propose a method to improve image retrieval performance for domains with limited training data, such as night-time images. Our approach involves training a synthetic-image generator using a GAN, which translates day-time images into night images. This generator is used as a form of data augmentation for metric learning. We introduce a lightweight GAN architecture that enforces consistency between the original and translated images through edge consistency. We also train an edge detector that operates on both night and day images. To increase variability in the training examples and improve model generalization, we propose a method of diverse anchor mining. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art results on a day-night retrieval benchmark without requiring training image pairs of matching day and night images.
