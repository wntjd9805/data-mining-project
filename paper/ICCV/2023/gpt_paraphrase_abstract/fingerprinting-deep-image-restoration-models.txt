Fingerprinting is a non-invasive method used to protect the intellectual property rights of deep neural network (DNN) models. Currently, existing fingerprinting methods are only applicable to classification-related models that map images to labels, but not to models for image restoration that map images to images. This paper proposes a fingerprinting framework specifically for DNN models of image restoration. The framework defines a fingerprint using a critical image which has distinct patterns and is resistant to minor modifications to the model. Model ownership is then verified by comparing the color histograms and local gradient pattern histograms of critical images between the suspect and source models. The proposed framework is applied to denoising and super-resolution tasks and outperforms existing fingerprinting methods as well as invasive model watermarking methods. The motivation for protecting the intellectual property rights of DNN models stems from the risk of adversaries plagiarizing or stealing the models, which can be done through malware infection or internal leaks. Model watermarking is a popular invasive approach to protect DNN models, but it can potentially impact the model's performance. Non-invasive fingerprinting has gained attention as an alternative to model watermarking, as it keeps the model intact and creates a unique fingerprint for ownership verification. While fingerprinting is still in its early stages with limited existing works, it is becoming more popular as a non-invasive method for protecting DNN model ownership.
