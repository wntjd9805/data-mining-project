We propose a new approach called Dual Diffusion Architecture (DDA) for rectifying fisheye images, as existing synthetic models produce subpar results for real-world correction. The DDA utilizes Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to gradually introduce bidirectional noise, allowing the synthesized and real images to align in terms of noise distribution. This enables our network to understand the distribution of unlabeled real fisheye images without relying on a transfer network, leading to improved performance in fisheye correction. Additionally, we develop an unsupervised one-pass network that generates a plausible new condition to enhance guidance and address the significant uncertainty between the prior condition and the target. This is particularly crucial in rectification tasks where radial distortion causes notable artifacts. Our network serves as an alternative method for producing reliable results quickly, without iterative inference. Compared to state-of-the-art techniques, our approach achieves superior performance in correcting both synthetic and real fisheye images.
