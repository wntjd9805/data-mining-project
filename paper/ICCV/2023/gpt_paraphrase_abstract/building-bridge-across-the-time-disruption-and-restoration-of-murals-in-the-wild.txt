This paper focuses on the task of mural restoration, which involves automatically detecting damaged regions in a mural and repainting them. Unlike traditional image restoration tasks, mural restoration deals with more complex degradation. However, current methods and datasets for mural restoration mainly focus on simple degradation like masking, which limits their real-world applicability. To address this gap, the paper presents a systematic framework for simulating the physical process of damaged murals and introduces a new benchmark dataset for mural restoration. The previous methods suffer from poor performance on this dataset due to the simplification of the data synthesis process. To overcome this issue, the paper proposes the Attention Diffusion Framework (ADF) for the challenging task of mural restoration. The framework includes a damage attention map module to estimate the extent of damage and a series of loss functions to adaptively choose repair strategies for diverse defects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in both mural synthesis and restoration.
