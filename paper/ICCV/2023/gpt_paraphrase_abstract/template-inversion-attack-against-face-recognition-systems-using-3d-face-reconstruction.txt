This paper introduces a new method called GaFaR for reconstructing 3D faces from facial templates, with a focus on template inversion attacks against face recognition systems. The method utilizes a geometry-aware generator network based on generative neural radiance fields (GNeRF) to reconstruct the 3D face from the templates. The network is trained using a semi-supervised learning approach, incorporating both real and synthetic images. For real training data, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework is used to learn the distribution of the latent space, while for synthetic training data, the true latent code is directly used in training. Additionally, the paper proposes optimizing the camera parameters during the inference stage to generate face images and improve the success attack rate. Experimental results show a success attack rate of up to 17.14%. The performance of the method is evaluated in whitebox and blackbox attacks against state-of-the-art face recognition models on the LFW and MOBIO datasets. This paper is the first to explore 3D face reconstruction from facial templates. More information can be found on the project page: https://www.idiap.ch/paper/gafar.
