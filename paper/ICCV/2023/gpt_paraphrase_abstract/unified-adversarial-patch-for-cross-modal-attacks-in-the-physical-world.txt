Physical adversarial attacks have emerged as a means to circumvent DNN-based object detectors. However, the deployment of both visible and infrared sensors in many scenarios has made single-modal physical attacks ineffective. To demonstrate the potential risks in such settings, we propose a unified adversarial patch that can deceive both visible and infrared object detectors simultaneously. Our focus is on modeling the shapes of adversarial patches, taking into account the distinct imaging mechanisms of visible and infrared sensors. To achieve compact and smooth shapes that can be easily implemented in the physical world, we introduce a novel boundary-limited shape optimization technique. Additionally, we propose a score-aware iterative evaluation method to balance the fooling degree between visible and infrared detectors during the optimization process. We evaluate our approach against two popular detectors, YOLOv3 and Faster RCNN, and achieve an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 73.33% and 69.17%, respectively. Importantly, we validate the effectiveness of our attacks in real-world scenarios involving various angles, distances, postures, and scenes captured by visible and infrared sensors.
