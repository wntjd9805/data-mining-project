Harmonizing cut-and-paste images to make them look realistic is a difficult task because it requires understanding the differences between the background of the target image and the inserted object. Current methods mainly adjust the appearance of the inserted object at the pixel level, but they are not effective in correcting color discrepancies caused by variations in scene illumination and image formation processes. We propose a new neural approach to address this issue by harmonizing image colors in a camera-independent color space, where colors are proportional to the scene radiance. Our approach includes an image unprocessing module to estimate a high dynamic range version of the object to be inserted, and a color harmonization module that uses the estimated scene radiance to harmonize the colors of the inserted object in the output color space. Extensive experiments show that our method performs better than existing approaches.
