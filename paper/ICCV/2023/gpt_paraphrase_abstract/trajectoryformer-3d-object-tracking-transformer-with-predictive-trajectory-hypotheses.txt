3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is crucial in various applications such as autonomous driving and service robots. Recent advancements in 3D MOT using the tracking-by-detection approach have shown significant progress. However, these methods solely rely on the detection boxes in the current frame, making it impossible to recover objects missed by the detector. In this study, we propose TrajectoryFormer, a new point-cloud-based framework for 3D MOT. To address the issue of missed objects, we generate multiple trajectory hypotheses using a combination of predicted boxes and current frame detection boxes. By incorporating predicted boxes, the network can compensate for short-term miss detections. We utilize a hybrid feature embedding that combines long-term object motion and short-term appearance features, reducing the computational burden for spatial-temporal encoding. Moreover, we introduce a Global-Local Interaction Module that facilitates information exchange among all hypotheses and models their spatial relations, resulting in accurate estimation of hypotheses. Our TrajectoryFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo 3D MOT benchmarks. The code for our framework is available at https://github.com/poodarchu/EFG.
