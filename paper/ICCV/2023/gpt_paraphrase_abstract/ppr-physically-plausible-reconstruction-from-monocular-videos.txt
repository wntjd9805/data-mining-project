We propose a method for building 3D models of articulated objects and environments using monocular videos. Our approach incorporates differentiable physics simulation and differentiable rendering to optimize both the 3D reconstructions and physical system parameters. By leveraging these techniques, we are able to mitigate common reconstruction artifacts and improve foot contact estimation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on monocular videos of quadruped animals and humans.
