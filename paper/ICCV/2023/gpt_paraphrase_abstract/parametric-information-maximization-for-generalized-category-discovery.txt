We present a Parametric Information Maximization (PIM) model to solve the Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) problem. Our approach involves a two-level optimization framework that utilizes a parameterized set of objective functions. These functions measure the information between features and weighted mutual latent labels, while considering supervision constraints from labeled samples. By doing so, our model addresses the class-balance bias inherent in standard information maximization approaches, allowing it to effectively handle both short-tailed and long-tailed datasets. Through extensive experiments and comparisons, we demonstrate that our PIM model consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in GCD across six different datasets. This is particularly evident in challenging fine-grained problems. To access our code, please visit: https://github.com/ThalesGroup/pim-generalized-category-discovery.
