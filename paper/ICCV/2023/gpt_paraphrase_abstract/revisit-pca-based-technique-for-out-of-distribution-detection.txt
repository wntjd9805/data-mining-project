Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring the reliability and safety of intelligent systems. Traditionally, scoring functions have been used to measure the likelihood of new data being an OOD sample, typically relying on a single source of information such as classifier output or feature vectors. However, recent studies have shown that combining multiple sources of information can lead to improved OOD detection.  In this study, we thoroughly analyze the issue of OOD detection using conventional principal component analysis (PCA). Building upon this analysis, we propose a novel approach that fuses a regularized PCA-based reconstruction error with other scoring functions to enhance OOD detection performance. Specifically, when combined with a robust energy score-based OOD method, the regularized reconstruction error achieves state-of-the-art results on various standard benchmarks.  To facilitate further research and applications, we have made the code available at https://github.com/SYSU-MIA-GROUP/pca-based-out-of-distribution-detection.
