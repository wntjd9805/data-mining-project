Curriculum design is a crucial aspect of education, whether it is for humans or machines. Just like in mathematics education, where we learn addition before moving on to multiplication and algebra, a well-designed curriculum aims to maximize knowledge transfer while minimizing forgetting. Previous research on curriculum design for image classification has focused on the order of training examples within a single offline task. However, in this study, we investigate the impact of the order in which multiple distinct tasks are learned in a sequence, specifically in the online class-incremental continual learning setting.Our findings show that curriculum consistently affects learning outcomes for both humans and machine learning algorithms across various benchmark datasets. To further explore automated curriculum design for online class-incremental learning, we propose a novel algorithm called Curriculum Designer (CD). CD designs and ranks curricula based on the similarities between features of different classes. We observe a significant overlap between curricula that are empirically effective and those highly ranked by CD.To facilitate future research on continuous learning using optimized curricula, we introduce a new object recognition dataset for human curriculum learning experiments. We establish a framework for teaching humans and machines to learn continuously and provide our code and data for further exploration.In human education, a knowledgeable math teacher would naturally design a curriculum that introduces addition, followed by multiplication, and then algebra. Students would learn these concepts in a continuous manner. Similarly, in an image classification task, we aim to determine the optimal curriculum for an AI teacher to continuously teach AI students to recognize images.In summary, our study highlights the importance of curriculum design for both humans and machines in achieving effective learning outcomes. We propose a novel algorithm, CD, for automated curriculum design and show its correlation with empirically effective curricula. This research provides a foundation for future investigations in the field of continuous learning using optimized curricula.
