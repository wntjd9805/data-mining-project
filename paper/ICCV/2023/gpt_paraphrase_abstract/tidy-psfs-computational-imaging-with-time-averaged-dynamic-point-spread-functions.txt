Point-spread-function (PSF) engineering is a computational imaging technique that involves integrating a customized phase mask into an optical system to encode additional information into captured images. By combining this technique with deep learning, these systems have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various tasks such as monocular depth estimation, extended depth-of-field imaging, and lensless imaging. This paper explores the possibility of further enhancing performance by dynamically changing the phase mask over time, inspired by recent advancements in spatial light modulator (SLM) technology. The authors start by proving that the set of PSFs described by static phase masks is non-convex, implying that time-averaged PSFs generated by dynamic phase masks are inherently more expressive. Through simulations, they demonstrate that time-averaged dynamic (TiDy) phase masks can leverage this increased expressiveness to significantly improve monocular depth estimation and extended depth-of-field imaging performance.
