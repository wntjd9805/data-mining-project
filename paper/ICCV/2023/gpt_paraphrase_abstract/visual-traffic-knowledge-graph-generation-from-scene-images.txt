Previous studies on understanding traffic scenes have mostly focused on low-level perception tasks like road segmentation and lane detection, neglecting high-level understanding. This paper introduces a novel task called Visual Traffic Knowledge Graph Generation (VTKGG) that aims to extract multiple types of information and integrate them into a knowledge graph. To support this task, a comprehensive dataset called CASIA-Tencent Road Scene dataset (RS10K) with extensive annotations is presented. Additionally, a new traffic scene parsing architecture, incorporating a Hierarchical Graph Attention network (HGAT), is proposed to analyze the complex relationships between heterogeneous elements in traffic scene images. By organizing the heterogeneous graph hierarchically and incorporating cross-level links, our approach effectively captures correlations among various elements and obtains accurate relations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method successfully generates visual traffic knowledge graphs and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
