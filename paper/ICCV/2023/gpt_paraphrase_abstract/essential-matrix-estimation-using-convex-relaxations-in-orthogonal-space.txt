We propose a new method for estimating the essential matrix in two-view Structure from Motion (SfM). Our approach involves embedding the 3 × 3 essential matrix into a 4 × 4 rotation matrix, with the bottom right entry fixed to zero, which we refer to as the quintessential matrix. This embedding allows for connections to be made between the essential matrix and 4-D rotations, quaternions, and the classical twisted-pair ambiguity in two-view SfM.Using this structure, we develop a series of semidefinite relaxations that require fewer parameters compared to existing non-minimal solvers. These relaxations also exhibit faster convergence with certifiable optimality. We leverage the low-rank geometry of these relaxations to transform them into an equivalent optimization problem on a Riemannian manifold. We solve this problem using the Riemannian Staircase method.Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our algorithm consistently finds the globally optimal solution and outperforms existing non-minimal methods. We have made our implementations open source for others to use.
