Privacy-preserving image-based localization techniques often employ a random line parameterization to safeguard the privacy of query images and database maps. However, this approach results in a significant decrease in accuracy compared to traditional methods that rely on geometric constraints. In this study, we address this issue by introducing a coordinate permutation scheme that allows for the recovery of original point positions during pose estimation. By doing so, we restore the full 2D geometric constraints and bridge the accuracy gap between privacy-preserving and traditional approaches. Moreover, random line methods are susceptible to density-based 3D line cloud inversion attacks. Our proposed method not only surpasses the accuracy of the original random line approach but also offers enhanced privacy protection against these attacks. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets consistently validate the improvements achieved in both scenarios: protecting the privacy of query images and preserving the privacy of the database map.
