Video deblurring is a process that aims to restore clear video frames from their blurred versions. While there has been significant progress in this field, most existing methods only consider temporal factors in the spatial domain and fail to explore the potential of the frequency domain. In this paper, we revisit the blurred video sequence in the Fourier space and identify inherent frequency-temporal characteristics that suggest the possibility of separating temporal blur degradation in the frequency domain. Based on these characteristics, we propose a novel Fourier-based frequency-temporal video deblurring solution. Our approach incorporates the temporal spectrum into a standard video deblurring pipeline, which includes feature extraction, alignment, aggregation, and optimization. We introduce a Spectrum Prior-guided Alignment module that utilizes enlarged blur information in the potential spectrum to mitigate the effects of blur on alignment. Additionally, we implement Temporal Energy prior-driven Aggregation to restore original local features by estimating the temporal spectrum energy as a guide for global sharpness. We also devise a customized frequency loss to optimize our method for better spectral distribution. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, confirming the effectiveness of frequency-temporal prior modeling.
