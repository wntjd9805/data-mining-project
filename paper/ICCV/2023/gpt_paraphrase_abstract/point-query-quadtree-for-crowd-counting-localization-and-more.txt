In this study, we propose a new approach to crowd counting by treating it as a decomposable point querying process. This allows us to consider any points as input and determine both whether they belong to a crowd and their specific location. However, this approach presents a challenge in determining the optimal number of querying points. Too few points result in underestimation, while too many points increase computational burden. To address this issue, we introduce a decomposable structure called the point-query quadtree and develop a counting model named Point quEry Transformer (PET). PET implements decomposable point querying through data-dependent quadtree splitting, allowing querying points to dynamically split into four new points when necessary. This enables efficient processing of both sparse and dense regions. The proposed querying process provides an intuitive and universal representation of crowds, as both the input and output are interpretable and adjustable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PET in various crowd-related tasks, including fully-supervised crowd counting and localization, partial annotation learning, and point annotation refinement, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Importantly, our study reveals that a single counting model can effectively address multiple crowd-related tasks using different learning paradigms.
