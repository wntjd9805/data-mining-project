Test-time task adaptation in few-shot learning aims to adapt a pre-trained, task-agnostic model to capture task-specific knowledge of a test task using only a few labeled support samples. However, previous approaches have mainly focused on developing advanced algorithms to achieve this goal, while neglecting the inherent problems of the support samples themselves. With only a small number of samples available, the adverse effects of image noise (X-noise) or label noise (Y-noise) from the support samples can be significantly amplified. To tackle this challenge, we propose DEnoised Task Adaptation (DETA), a novel framework that addresses both image and label noise in a unified manner, which is orthogonal to existing task adaptation approaches. DETA filters out task-irrelevant and noisy representations by leveraging both global visual information and local region details of the support samples, without requiring additional supervision. We evaluate DETA on the Meta-Dataset and consistently observe performance improvements across a wide range of baseline methods and pre-trained models. Notably, by addressing the overlooked issue of image noise in the Meta-Dataset, DETA achieves state-of-the-art results. The code for DETA is publicly available at https://github.com/JimZAI/DETA.
