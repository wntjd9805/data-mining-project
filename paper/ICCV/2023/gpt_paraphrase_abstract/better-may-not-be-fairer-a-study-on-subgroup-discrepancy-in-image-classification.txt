This paper presents a study on the impact of natural semantic spurious features on image classification. The authors provide 20,000 non-trivial human annotations on popular datasets to address the limitations in accessing realistic datasets. They focus on investigating the role of natural background colors as spurious features by annotating the test sets of CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 into subgroups based on background color. The resulting datasets are named CIFAR10-B and CIFAR100-B1, which are integrated with CIFAR-Cs.   The study reveals that overall human-level accuracy does not ensure consistent subgroup performances, even with models pre-trained on ImageNet or after data augmentation. To mitigate this issue, the authors propose a semantic data augmentation method called FlowAug, which utilizes decoupled semantic representations obtained from a pre-trained generative flow. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowAug achieves more consistent subgroup results compared to other data augmentation methods on CIFAR10/100 and CIFAR10/100-C, and it exhibits better generalization performance. Furthermore, the authors introduce a generic metric called MacroStd to evaluate model robustness to spurious correlations, which takes a macro average of weighted standard deviations across different classes. They show that FlowAug improves subgroup discrepancy according to this metric. This metric is applicable to datasets with subgroups or subclasses beyond the curated datasets used in this study.   Finally, the authors also demonstrate superior out-of-distribution results on CIFAR10.1.
