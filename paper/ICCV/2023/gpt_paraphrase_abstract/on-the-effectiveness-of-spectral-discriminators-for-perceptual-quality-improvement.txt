Recent studies have suggested using spectral discriminators to evaluate the Fourier spectra of images for generative modeling. However, the effectiveness of these discriminators is not well understood. In this study, we examine the use of spectral discriminators in the context of perceptual image super-resolution, where spectral changes can affect image quality. Our analysis shows that spectral discriminators outperform spatial discriminators in identifying differences in high-frequency range, while spatial discriminators are better in the low-frequency range. Therefore, we propose using both spectral and spatial discriminators simultaneously. Additionally, we enhance the spectral discriminators by calculating patch-wise Fourier spectra and aggregating them using a Transformer. Our proposed method is validated in two ways. Firstly, the additional spectral discriminator improves the alignment of SR image spectra with real images, resulting in a better trade-off between perceptual and visual quality. Secondly, our ensembled discriminator accurately predicts perceptual quality, as demonstrated in a no-reference image quality assessment task.
