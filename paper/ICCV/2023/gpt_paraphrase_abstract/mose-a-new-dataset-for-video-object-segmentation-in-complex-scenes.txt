Video object segmentation (VOS) is the process of accurately segmenting a specific object throughout an entire video clip sequence. While current VOS methods have shown impressive performance on existing datasets, these datasets typically contain salient and isolated target objects. As a result, VOS in complex scenes has received limited attention. To address this limitation and enhance the applicability of VOS in real-world scenarios, we introduce a new dataset called the coMplex video ObjectSEgmentation (MOSE) dataset. MOSE consists of 2,149 video clips and 5,200 objects from 36 categories, providing 431,725 high-quality object segmentation masks. The key feature of MOSE is its complex scenes, which include crowded and occluded objects. Objects in the videos are commonly occluded by others and may disappear in certain frames. To evaluate the MOSE dataset, we assess 18 existing VOS methods under four different settings and conduct comprehensive comparisons. The experiments reveal that current VOS algorithms struggle to accurately perceive objects in complex scenes. For instance, even the best-performing state-of-the-art VOS methods achieve only 59.4% accuracy on MOSE under the semi-supervised VOS setting, significantly lower than their âˆ¼90% performance on the DAVIS dataset. These results highlight the existence of unresolved challenges in VOS under complex scenes, emphasizing the need for further research and exploration in this area.
