Recent research in remote sensing object detection has primarily focused on improving the representation of oriented bounding boxes but has neglected the valuable prior knowledge specific to remote sensing scenarios. This prior knowledge is crucial because small objects in remote sensing can be mistakenly detected without considering a sufficiently long-range context, which can vary for different objects. To address this issue, this paper introduces the lightweight Large Selective Kernel Network (LSKNet), which can dynamically adjust its large spatial receptive field to effectively model the ranging context of diverse objects in remote sensing scenarios. Notably, the use of large and selective kernel mechanisms in remote sensing object detection has not been explored previously. Without any unnecessary complexity, our lightweight LSKNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, including HRSC2016 (98.46% mean average precision), DOTA-v1.0 (81.85% mean average precision), and FAIR1M-v1.0 (47.87% mean average precision).
