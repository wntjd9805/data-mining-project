This paper addresses the limitations of anchor-based lane detection methods that primarily rely on fixed anchors originating from the edges of the image, disregarding their versatility and quality. To overcome this inflexibility, the authors propose decomposing the anchors into learning the heat map of starting points and their associated directions. This decomposition allows for more adaptable algorithms that can handle different lane types in various datasets. Additionally, the authors introduce the Large Kernel Attention (LKA) for Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to enhance the quality of anchors. This approach significantly increases the receptive field, crucial for capturing the context as lane lines typically span the entire image. The proposed system, named Anchor Decomposition Network (ADNet), achieves improved performance in complex scenarios through the use of the General Lane IoU (GLIoU) loss. Experimental results on three widely used lane detection benchmarks (VIL-100, CU-Lane, and TuSimple) demonstrate that ADNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on VIL-100 and achieves competitive accuracy on CULane and TuSimple datasets. The code and models for ADNet will be made available on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/Sephirex-X/ADNet.
