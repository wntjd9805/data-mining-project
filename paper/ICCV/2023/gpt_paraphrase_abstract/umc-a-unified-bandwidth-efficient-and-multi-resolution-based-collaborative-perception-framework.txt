Multi-agent collaborative perception (MCP) has recently gained significant attention due to its three key processes: communication for sharing, collaboration for integration, and reconstruction for downstream tasks. However, existing methods focus solely on designing the collaboration process, neglecting the intrinsic interactions and resulting in suboptimal performance. In contrast, our proposed framework, Unified Collaborative perception (UMC), optimizes the communication, collaboration, and reconstruction processes using the Multi-resolution technique.UMC introduces a trainable multi-resolution and selective-region (MRSR) mechanism for communication, which achieves higher quality and lower bandwidth. Additionally, we propose a graph-based collaboration conducted on each resolution to adapt the MRSR. Finally, the reconstruction process integrates the collaborative features across multiple resolutions for downstream tasks.To accurately evaluate the performance enhancement brought by MCP, we introduce a new evaluation metric that assesses MCP from various perspectives. To validate our algorithm, we conducted experiments on the V2X-Sim and OPV2V datasets. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that UMC outperforms state-of-the-art collaborative perception approaches.Overall, our UMC framework enhances the MCP process by optimizing communication, collaboration, and reconstruction using the Multi-resolution technique. The proposed evaluation metric and experimental results confirm the superiority of UMC over existing approaches in collaborative perception.
