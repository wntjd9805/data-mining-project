This paper presents a new method called FreeCOS for curvilinear object segmentation. Manual annotation of curvilinear objects is time-consuming and prone to errors, resulting in a lack of annotated datasets for existing supervised and domain adaptation methods. FreeCOS addresses this issue by learning robust and distinctive features from fractals and unlabeled images in a self-supervised manner. The method introduces a novel Fractal-FDA synthesis module that generates curvilinear structures based on the Fractal L-system and integrates them into unlabeled images using Fourier Domain Adaptation. To align the intensity differences between synthetic and unlabeled images, a geometric information alignment approach is proposed. This approach compares the intensity order of a given pixel with its neighboring pixels to enhance the inherent geometric characteristics shared by both synthetic and real images. Additionally, the method aligns the features of synthetic and real images using prediction space adaptation loss and curvilinear mask contrastive loss. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that FreeCOS outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised, self-supervised, and traditional methods by a significant margin.
