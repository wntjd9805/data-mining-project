This paper addresses the challenge of continually discovering novel classes while maintaining performance in known classes in a real-world scenario. The authors propose a method called MetaGCD that uses a meta-learning framework and leverages offline labeled data to simulate the testing incremental learning process. The method lifts unrealistic assumptions made by existing methods and aims to achieve novel class discovery without forgetting. Additionally, a soft neighborhood-based contrastive network is introduced to discriminate uncorrelated images while attracting correlated images. The authors conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach.
