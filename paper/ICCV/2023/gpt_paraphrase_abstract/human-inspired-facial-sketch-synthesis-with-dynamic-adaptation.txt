The objective of facial sketch synthesis (FSS) is to produce a realistic sketch portrait from a facial photograph. Current FSS techniques primarily rely on 2D representations of facial features, disregarding the importance of conveying the three-dimensional (3D) geometry used by professional artists. This paper proposes a new approach called Human-Inspired Dynamic Adaptation (HIDA) that takes into account both the facial 3D geometry and 2D appearance, as well as maintaining a globally consistent style control. To achieve this, the method dynamically adjusts neuron activations and employs deformable convolutions to align deep features for generating distinct outlines. Experimental results demonstrate that HIDA can generate high-quality sketches in various styles and outperforms previous methods on challenging faces. Additionally, HIDA enables precise style control and generalizes well to natural scenes and other artistic styles. The code and results of HIDA can be accessed at https://github.com/AiArt-HDU/HIDA.
