This paper focuses on the problem of multi-person pose estimation using an end-to-end approach. Previous state-of-the-art solutions have used the DETR-like framework, with a focus on developing complex decoders. Our proposed approach, called Group Pose, is a simple yet effective transformer-based method. We consider pose estimation as predicting a set of keypoint positions for each person, along with an instance query for scoring pose predictions. We make a modification to the decoder self-attention by replacing single self-attention with two subsequent group self-attentions. This modification removes the interaction among different types of queries, leading to improved performance and easier optimization. Our experimental results on MS COCO and Crowd-Pose datasets show that our approach outperforms previous methods without using human box supervision, and even performs slightly better than ED-Pose, which does use human box supervision. We provide the Paddle and PyTorch code implementations for our approach.
