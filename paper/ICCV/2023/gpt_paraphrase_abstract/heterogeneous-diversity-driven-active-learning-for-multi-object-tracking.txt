We propose a method called HD-AMOT that reduces the need for labeled data in one-stage multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms. HD-AMOT uses heterogeneous cues to identify the most informative frames for any MOT tracker. It encodes geometric and semantic information to create a diverse and informative representation of the frames. The frame inference strategy is formulated as a Markov decision process to learn an optimal sampling policy based on this representation. HD-AMOT consists of two components: a diverse informative representation module and an informative frame selection network. The former characterizes the diversity and distribution of frames, while the latter conducts multi-frame cooperation to enable batch frame sampling. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HD-AMOT, achieving similar or even higher performance than fully-supervised learning under a reduced budget.
