We investigate the problem of generating articulated meshes with limited examples. Our goal is to develop a model that can produce diverse and visually accurate meshes while adhering to physical constraints. Existing mesh generation models struggle to capture diversity from a small dataset and often overlook physical validity. To address these challenges, we propose two innovations: 1) a hierarchical mesh deformation-based generative model that leverages transferable deformation patterns from larger rigid meshes to overcome the few-shot problem, and 2) a physics-aware deformation correction scheme that promotes physically plausible generations. We conduct extensive experiments on six articulated categories, demonstrating that our method outperforms previous approaches in terms of diversity, visual fidelity, and physical validity in the few-shot scenario. Additionally, we validate the significant contributions of our innovations through an ablation study. More information and code can be found on our project page at meowuu7.github.io/few-arti-obj-gen.
