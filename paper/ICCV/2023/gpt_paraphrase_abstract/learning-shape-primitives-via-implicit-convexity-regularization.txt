This paper presents a novel approach for learning shape primitives from multi-view images using implicit surface rendering. Previous methods rely on 3D point clouds or voxel data, which are less practical in real-world scenarios. The proposed method introduces a regularization term called Implicit Convexity Regularization (ICR) to address the challenge of implicit shapes having a high degree of freedom. The ICR is imposed on implicit primitive learning by constraining second order directional derivatives on line segments inside the shapes, which provides a tighter condition for 3D convexity. The implicit primitives, constrained by the ICR, are combined into a whole object through a softmax-weighted-sum operation. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method can decompose objects into simple and reasonable shape primitives without the need for segmentation labels or 3D data.
