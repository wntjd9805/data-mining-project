This paper presents a novel approach for learning hyperbolic representations of visual data directly from the pixel-level using a residual network called Poincaré ResNet. While hyperbolic learning has shown promise for visual understanding, it has only been applied in the penultimate layer(s) of deep networks, with visual representations still being learned through standard Euclidean networks.   To address this limitation, the authors propose Poincaré ResNet, which operates entirely on the Poincaré ball model of hyperbolic space. The network includes Poincaré 2D convolutions and Poincaré residual connections. However, training convolutional networks entirely in hyperbolic space faces three challenges that the authors address.   First, current hyperbolic network initializations collapse to the origin, limiting their applicability in deeper networks. The authors introduce an identity-based initialization that preserves norms over many layers.   Second, residual networks heavily rely on batch normalization, which is computationally expensive in hyperbolic space due to the need for Fréchet mean calculations. The authors propose Poincaré midpoint batch normalization as a faster and equally effective alternative.   Third, the computation graphs of deep learning libraries become unmanageable due to the many intermediate operations in Poincaré layers, limiting the ability to train deep hyperbolic networks. To overcome this, the authors manually derive backward operations for core hyperbolic operations to maintain manageable computation graphs.  Overall, the proposed Poincaré ResNet enables the learning of hyperbolic representations directly from pixel-level data, addressing the limitations of current approaches that only use hyperbolic learning in the penultimate layer(s) of deep networks.
