The primary challenge in monocular 3D object detection is accurately determining the location of the 3D center. To address this challenge, we propose a stage-wise approach that combines the flow of information from 2D-to-3D and 3D-to-2D in a top-down manner. This approach involves generating initial proposals using existing monocular 3D detectors, creating a 3D anchor space through local-grid sampling, and performing 3D bounding box denoising for proposal verification. To effectively learn discriminative features for denoising overlapped proposals, we utilize the Perceiver I/O model to fuse geometric and appearance information. The verification process employs a self-attention module. Our method, called MonoXiver, is adaptable to any backbone monocular 3D detectors and consistently improves performance without significant computation overhead. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo datasets support the efficacy of MonoXiver.
