This paper presents a novel architecture for teaching embodied agents how to navigate in indoor environments with limited space and obstructed views. The proposed architecture utilizes Proximity-Aware Tasks, specifically the Risk and Proximity Compass, to enhance a reinforcement learning navigation policy by incorporating the ability to understand social behaviors based on common sense. The tasks focus on identifying immediate and future collision risks. Additionally, the paper introduces an evaluation protocol specifically designed for the Social Navigation Task in simulated environments. This protocol aims to capture detailed features and characteristics of the policy by analyzing individual human-robot spatial interactions known as Encounters. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments conducted on Gibson4+ and Habitat-Matterport3D datasets.
