Cracks are common features in various computer vision applications, such as road safety inspection and surface inspection of industrial facilities. Current crack segmentation methods either rely on time-consuming pixel-level annotations or use object-based detection that does not consider crack orientation, leading to limitations in scale and intra-class variation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach for crack detection that models cracks as a series of sub-cracks with corresponding orientations. However, adapting existing object detection methods to this task has limited performance due to boundary discontinuity and ambiguities in sub-crack orientation. In this paper, we introduce CrackDet, a unique oriented sub-crack detector derived from a new piecewise angle definition to address the boundary discontinuity issue. We also propose a multi-branch angle regression loss to learn sub-crack orientation and variance simultaneously. To evaluate our approach, we construct three fully annotated datasets (ORC, ONPP, and OCCSD) containing various cracks in road pavement and industrial facilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art crack detectors. We provide visual comparisons to highlight the advantages of our orientation-based perspective and the challenges of boundary discontinuity and orientation ambiguities in crack detection.
