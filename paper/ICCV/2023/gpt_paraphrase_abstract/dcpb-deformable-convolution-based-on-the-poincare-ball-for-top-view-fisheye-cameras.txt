This paper presents a method to improve the accuracy of visual tasks for top-view fisheye cameras. The authors demonstrate the similarity between the fisheye model and the Poincaré ball and propose a new approach called Deformable Convolution based on the Poincaré Ball (DCPB). DCPB utilizes the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) in the Poincaré ball and calculates geodesic distances to Poincaré hyperplanes as offsets and modulation scalars for modulated deformable convolution. The authors also explore an appropriate network structure in the baseline with DCPB. Experimental results on the public dataset THEODORE show that DCPB significantly improves the neural network's performance, achieving higher accuracy and demonstrating potential for utilizing temporal information in fisheye videos.
