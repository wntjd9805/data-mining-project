Priors are crucial when it comes to reconstructing images from noisy or incomplete data. The choice of prior affects both the quality and uncertainty of the recovered images. Our proposal is to transform score-based diffusion models into well-founded image priors, which we refer to as "score-based priors." This allows us to analyze the posterior distribution of images given measurements. Previously, the use of probabilistic priors was limited to manually designed regularization techniques and simple distributions. However, in this study, we provide empirical evidence to validate the theoretically-proven probability function of a score-based diffusion model. We also demonstrate how this probability function can be used for variational inference to sample from resulting posteriors. Our experimental results, which involve tasks such as denoising, deblurring, and interferometric imaging, indicate that score-based priors facilitate principled inference using a sophisticated, data-driven image prior.
