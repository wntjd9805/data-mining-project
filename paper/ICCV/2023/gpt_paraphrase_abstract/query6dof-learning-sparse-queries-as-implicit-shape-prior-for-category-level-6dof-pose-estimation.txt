This study focuses on the estimation of the pose (rotation, translation, and size) of objects in 3D space. Previous methods have used pre-learned shape information from point clouds to handle variations within object categories. These methods deform the shape information to reconstruct point clouds and establish correspondences between observed and reconstructed point clouds. However, the pre-learned shape information is not optimized together with the estimation networks and is trained with a surrogate objective.   To address this limitation, the authors propose a new 6D pose estimation network called Query6DoF. It utilizes a series of category-specific sparse queries that represent the shape prior. Each query represents a component of the shape, and these queries can be optimized alongside the estimation network based on various loss functions. The network employs a deformation-and-matching approach with attention, where the queries dynamically extract features from regions of interest and directly regress results. Additionally, Query6DoF reduces computation overhead through the sparseness of the queries and the inclusion of a lightweight global information injection block.  The proposed Query6DoF achieves state-of-the-art pose estimation performance on the NOCS datasets. The source code and models are publicly available.

Figure 1 illustrates a comparison between conventional methods and the proposed approach, highlighting the use of sparse learnable queries and the query/feature-based deformation and matching in Query6DoF.
