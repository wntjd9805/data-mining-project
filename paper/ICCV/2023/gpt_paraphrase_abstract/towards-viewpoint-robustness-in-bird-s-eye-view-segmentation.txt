This paper investigates the impact of camera viewpoint changes on the performance of autonomous vehicle (AV) perception models. Currently, AV companies focus on collecting diverse data from various scenarios and locations, but not different camera rig configurations due to cost constraints. However, this lack of variation in camera rigs can lead to significant drops in performance when deploying AV perception models across different vehicles. To address this issue, the authors propose a method for scaling AV perception models across vehicle types without the need for additional data collection and labeling. They specifically focus on the task of bird's eye view (BEV) segmentation. Through extensive experiments, they discover that existing perception models are unexpectedly sensitive to changes in camera viewpoint. Even small alterations in camera pitch, yaw, depth, or height during inference can result in significant decreases in performance.To overcome this challenge, the authors introduce a technique for novel view synthesis. This technique allows them to transform the collected data to match the viewpoint of target camera rigs. By training BEV segmentation models on this transformed data, they can effectively adapt the models to diverse target rigs without incurring additional data collection or labeling costs. To evaluate the impact of viewpoint changes, the authors utilize synthetic data to mitigate other potential gaps, such as differences in content or image signal processing. Their approach is trained on real data and evaluated on synthetic data, enabling assessment on diverse target rigs. The authors also make all the data used in their study available for future research.Overall, the proposed method is able to recover an average of 14.7% of the Intersection over Union (IoU) that would otherwise be lost when deploying AV perception models to new camera rigs. This research contributes to the advancement of AV technology by addressing the challenge of viewpoint robustness in perception models, facilitating their deployment across different types of vehicles.
