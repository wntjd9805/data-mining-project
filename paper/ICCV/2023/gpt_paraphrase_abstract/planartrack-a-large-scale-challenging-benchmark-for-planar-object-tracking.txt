Planar object tracking is an important problem in computer vision, with applications in robotics and augmented reality. However, the lack of large-scale challenging benchmarks has hindered its development, particularly in the era of deep learning. To address this issue, we present PlanarTrack, a large-scale benchmark for planar tracking. PlanarTrack consists of 1,000 videos with over 490K images, collected from complex unconstrained scenarios in the real world. Each frame in PlanarTrack is manually labeled with four corners, ensuring high-quality annotations. This makes PlanarTrack the largest and most challenging dataset for planar object tracking to date. We evaluate 10 planar trackers on PlanarTrack and find that current top-performing trackers struggle with the challenging scenarios, highlighting the need for further improvement in planar tracking. Additionally, we introduce a variant called PlanarTrackBB for generic object tracking, which proves to be even more challenging than popular generic tracking benchmarks. Our benchmarks and evaluations are publicly available for further research and development.
