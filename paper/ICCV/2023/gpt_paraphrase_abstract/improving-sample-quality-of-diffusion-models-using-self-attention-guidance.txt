Denoising diffusion models (DDMs) have gained attention for their exceptional generation quality and diversity. This success is largely attributed to the use of class or text conditional diffusion guidance methods. This paper presents a broader perspective that goes beyond traditional guidance methods and introduces new strategies to enhance the quality of generated images. One such strategy is blur guidance, which improves the suitability of intermediate samples by enhancing their fine-scale information and structures. This allows diffusion models to generate higher quality samples with moderate guidance. Another strategy, called Self-Attention Guidance (SAG), uses the intermediate self-attention maps of diffusion models to enhance their stability and efficacy. SAG selectively blurs only the regions that diffusion models attend to at each iteration, guiding them accordingly. Experimental results demonstrate that SAG improves the performance of various diffusion models. Additionally, combining SAG with conventional guidance methods further enhances the results.
