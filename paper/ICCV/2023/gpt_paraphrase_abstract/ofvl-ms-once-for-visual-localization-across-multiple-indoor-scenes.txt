This study proposes a multi-task learning approach to predict camera poses in different scenes. The proposed framework, called OFVL-MS, eliminates the need to train separate models for each scene and addresses the issue of gradient conflict when optimizing multiple scenes collectively. OFVL-MS incorporates a layer-adaptive sharing policy that automatically determines whether to share or not share each layer, allowing for efficient storage and accurate localization. Additionally, a gradient normalization algorithm is introduced to ensure that all tasks converge at the same pace. A sparse penalty loss is applied to facilitate parameter sharing without performance degradation. The performance of OFVL-MS is evaluated on various benchmarks and a newly released indoor dataset, demonstrating superior results with fewer parameters compared to existing methods. The generalizability of OFVL-MS to new scenes with fewer parameters is also confirmed. The dataset and evaluation code can be accessed at https://github.com/mooncake199809/UFVL-Net.
