This study addresses the limitations of existing open vocabulary object detection (OVD) methods, which struggle to accurately detect objects in novel categories. These methods typically replace the classifier with category text embeddings and optimize region-text alignment using data from known categories. However, this approach leads to biases towards known categories, resulting in gaps in objectness and accuracy assessment for novel classes.  To overcome these limitations, the authors propose the use of an open corpus consisting of external object concepts clustered into multiple centroids. This open corpus aims to improve the generalization ability of the object detector. The authors introduce the Generalized Objectness Assessment (GOAT) in the proposal generator, which assesses objectness based on the visual-text alignment. This assessment is performed by measuring the similarity of visual features to the cluster centroids, allowing for the evaluation of objectness with concepts in the open corpus and thus enabling generalization to open categories.  Additionally, the authors propose Category Expanding (CE) with the open corpus in two training tasks. This approach helps the detector perceive more categories in the feature space and obtain more reasonable optimization directions. For the classification task, an open corpus classifier is introduced by reconstructing the original classifier using similar words in the text space. In the image-caption alignment task, the open corpus centroids are incorporated to increase the number of negative samples in the contrastive loss.  Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GOAT and CE methods, as they significantly improve the performance on novel classes and achieve new state-of-the-art results on OVD benchmarks.
