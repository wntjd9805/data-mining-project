This paper examines the generalization of deep-fake detectors by considering the multi-order interactions among visual concepts. The authors propose three hypotheses: 1. Deepfake detectors capture multi-order interactions, where low-order interactions typically hinder deepfake detection. 2. Deepfake detectors with better generalization abilities tend to have fewer negative contributions from low-order interactions. 3. Generalized deepfake detectors often weaken the negative impact of low-order interactions by suppressing their strength. To assess the effect of low-order interactions, the authors introduce several mathematical metrics. Through extensive comparative experiments, they validate their hypotheses. Additionally, the authors propose a generic approach to mitigate the negative effects of low-order interactions and enhance the generalization of deepfake detectors.
