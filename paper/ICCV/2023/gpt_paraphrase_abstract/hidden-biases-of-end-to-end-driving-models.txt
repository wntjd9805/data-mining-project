Recent advancements in end-to-end driving systems, specifically on the CARLA platform, have shown significant progress. However, it remains unclear what exactly contributes to these improvements as minor components of the system are often modified. In this study, we have identified two recurring biases in state-of-the-art methods that play a crucial role in the observed progress on CARLA. Firstly, there is a strong inclination towards target point following for lateral recovery, resulting in a particular inductive bias. Secondly, there is a tendency to average multimodal waypoint predictions for slowing down, which affects longitudinal control. We thoroughly examine the limitations of these biases and propose alternative approaches based on sound principles. Utilizing our insights, we have developed TF++, a straightforward end-to-end method that outperforms all previous works on the Longest6 and LAV benchmarks. TF++ achieves an impressive 11-point increase in driving score compared to the best prior work on the Longest6 benchmark.
