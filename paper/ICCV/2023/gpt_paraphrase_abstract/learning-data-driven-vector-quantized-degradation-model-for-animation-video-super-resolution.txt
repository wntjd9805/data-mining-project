Current video super-resolution methods aim to improve the quality of videos by designing a degradation pipeline that can be applied to various types of videos. However, these methods often overlook the unique characteristics of specific domains, such as animation videos, which limits their performance. In this study, we thoroughly analyze the features of animation videos and utilize the inherent knowledge present in real-world animation data to develop a more practical animation video super-resolution model. We introduce a multi-scale Vector-Quantized Degradation model, called VQD-SR, which separates local details from global structures and incorporates degradation priors from real-world animation videos into a learned vector-quantized codebook. To extract these priors, we create a comprehensive dataset of low-quality real animation videos. Additionally, we propose a data enhancement strategy for high-resolution training videos, as we observe that existing high-resolution videos collected from the web often contain noticeable compression artifacts. This strategy helps improve the performance of animation video super-resolution models, regardless of the specific method used. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on a benchmark dataset for animation video super-resolution, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed VQD-SR model over state-of-the-art methods.
