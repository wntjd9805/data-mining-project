This study introduces an active content tracing method that combines image watermarking and Latent Diffusion Models to address ethical concerns surrounding generative image modeling. The proposed method aims to conceal an invisible watermark in all generated images, enabling future detection and identification. The technique involves fine-tuning the latent decoder of the image generator based on a binary signature. A pre-trained watermark extractor is utilized to retrieve the hidden signature from any generated image, and a statistical test is performed to determine if it originated from the generative model. The research evaluates the effectiveness and resilience of the watermarks across various generation tasks, demonstrating that the StableSignature remains robust even when images are modified. For instance, it successfully identifies the source of an image generated from a text prompt, even when cropped to retain only 10% of the content, achieving over 90% accuracy with a false positive rate below 10^(-6).
