The domain gap between training and test data remains a significant challenge in 3D human mesh reconstruction, despite recent advancements. Previous approaches have used test-time adaptation to address this issue by fine-tuning a network using 2D evidence from test images. However, relying heavily on 2D evidence during adaptation leads to two main problems. Firstly, 2D evidence introduces depth ambiguity, making it difficult to learn accurate 3D human geometry. Secondly, 2D evidence is often noisy or incomplete during test time, resulting in erroneous adaptation. To overcome these problems, we propose a method called CycleAdapt, which cyclically adapts two networks - a human mesh reconstruction network (HMRNet) and a human motion denoising network (MDNet) - using a test video. In our framework, we mitigate the reliance on 2D evidence by supervising HMRNet with 3D supervision targets generated by MDNet. Our cyclic adaptation scheme progressively refines the 3D supervision targets, compensating for imperfect 2D evidence. As a result, CycleAdapt achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous test-time adaptation methods. The source code is available [insert link].
