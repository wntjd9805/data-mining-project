Existing traditional and deep Structure-from-Motion (SfM) methods assume a rigid scene, either static or with a single moving object. However, there is a lack of approaches that can accurately reconstruct multiple rigid bodies in a scene, due to the scale ambiguity inherent in SfM. To address this issue, we propose a framework for estimating depth and camera pose in multi-body scenes, aiming to resolve the scale ambiguity. Our approach starts with disorganized images and includes a novel multi-view scale estimator to resolve camera pose ambiguity, as well as a multi-body plane sweep network that extends depth estimation to dynamic scenes. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art SfM frameworks in multi-body scenes and achieves comparable results in static scenes. The code and dataset for our approach are available at the following link: https://github.com/andreadalcin/MultiBodySfM.
