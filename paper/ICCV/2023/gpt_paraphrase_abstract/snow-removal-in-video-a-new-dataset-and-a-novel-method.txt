Snowfall can have a negative impact on computer vision tasks by obstructing objects and scenes. Current deep learning-based methods for removing snow are designed for single images only. In this study, we focus on the more challenging task of removing snow from videos to restore clear footage. To aid in this task, we introduce a high-quality video dataset that accurately represents the physical characteristics of snow and haze through rendering and augmentation techniques. Additionally, we develop a deep learning framework for video snow removal. Our framework includes a module that aggregates features between video frames to effectively remove snow and a loss function that helps identify and eliminate snow features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our dataset is more realistic than previous datasets, and models trained on it achieve superior performance on both synthetic and real snowy videos. Our proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art video and image-based methods in removing snow.
