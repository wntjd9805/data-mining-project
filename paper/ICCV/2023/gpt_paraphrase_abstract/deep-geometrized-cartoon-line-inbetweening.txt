The anime industry faces a neglected issue regarding the inbetweening of cartoon line drawings. Inbetweening involves creating intermediate frames between two black-and-white line drawings, which is a time-consuming and costly process. Existing methods that use whole raster images for frame interpolation are not suitable for line inbetweening and often result in blurring artifacts that damage the intricate line structures. To address this problem, we propose a new approach called AnimeInbet. This approach converts raster line drawings into graphs of endpoints and reframes the inbetweening task as a graph fusion problem with vertex repositioning. Our method effectively captures the sparse and unique structure of line drawings while preserving the details during inbetweening. We introduce a new dataset called Mixamo-Line240 to train our method, which includes line drawings with ground truth vectorization and matching labels. Our experiments demonstrate that AnimeInbet produces high-quality and complete intermediate line drawings, surpassing existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, particularly in cases with large motions. The data and code for AnimeInbet are available at https://github.com/lisiyao21/AnimeInbet.
