Recent advancements in unsupervised multi-object segmentation have yielded impressive outcomes by predicting motion based on a single image, despite the inherent uncertainty in predicting motion without access to the next image. However, the range of potential motions for an image can be limited to a lower-dimensional space by taking into account the scene structure and the objects within it. In this study, we propose a methodology that combines pixel-wise geometry and object motion to alleviate ambiguity in reconstructing flow from a single image. Specifically, we partition the image into coherent moving regions and utilize depth information to construct flow bases that provide the best explanation for the observed flow in each region. Through this approach, we achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised multi-object segmentation across both synthetic and real-world datasets, as we effectively model the scene structure and object motion. Furthermore, our evaluation of the predicted depth maps demonstrates reliable performance in monocular depth estimation.
