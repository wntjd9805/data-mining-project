Instance segmentation on point clouds is essential for understanding 3D scenes. Most state-of-the-art methods use distance clustering, which is effective but struggles to segment adjacent objects with the same semantic label. This is especially true when these objects share neighboring points. Existing methods also struggle to cluster all instance points due to the uneven distribution of offset points. To address these challenges, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer strategy called PBNet. PBNet binarizes each point and clusters them separately to segment instances. Our binary clustering categorizes offset instance points into high and low density points (HPs vs. LPs). By removing LPs, adjacent objects can be clearly separated and then completed and refined by assigning LPs using a neighbor voting method. To avoid over-segmentation, we propose constructing local scenes with weight masks for each instance. The proposed binary clustering can replace traditional distance clustering and consistently improve performance on mainstream baselines. Experimental results on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model. PBNet achieved the highest mAP on the ScanNetV2 official benchmark challenge. Code for PBNet will be publicly available at https://github.com/weiguangzhao/PBNet.
