The emergence of quantum machine learning and vision has been facilitated by advancements in hardware, allowing for significant progress in the capabilities of quantum machines. In particular, quantum image generation has gained attention due to its potential advantages over non-quantum methods. However, previous techniques in this area have been plagued by issues such as low quality and lack of robustness. To tackle these challenges, we propose MosaiQ, a state-of-the-art framework for quantum image generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This framework is designed specifically for execution on Near-term Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers available today. By leveraging the power of quantum computing, MosaiQ aims to overcome the limitations of previous approaches and deliver high-quality results.
