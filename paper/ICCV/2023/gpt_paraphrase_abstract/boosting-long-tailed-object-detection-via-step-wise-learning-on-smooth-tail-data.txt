This paper introduces a step-wise learning framework to address the issue of class imbalance in long-tailed datasets. The proposed framework gradually enhances the model's capability to detect all categories of long-tailed datasets. The approach involves creating smooth-tail data to correct the bias towards head classes, pre-training a model on the entire long-tailed data to preserve discriminability between categories, fine-tuning the class-agnostic modules on head class dominant replay data to improve decision boundaries, and training a unified model on tail class dominant replay data while transferring knowledge from the head class expert model. Experimental results on LVIS v0.5 and LVIS v1.0 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method, with significant improvements in average precision (AP) for both overall and rare categories. The code for the method is available on GitHub.
