Pose-based gait recognition methods have shown promise in achieving results similar to silhouette-based methods using simple information. However, these pose-based methods have limited ability to generalize across different datasets, which hinders their practical application. In order to address this limitation, we propose a framework called Generalized Pose-based Gait recognition (GPGait). This framework utilizes a Human-Oriented Transformation (HOT) and a series of Human-Oriented Descriptors (HOD) to obtain a unified pose representation with multiple discriminative features. Additionally, we introduce a Part-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (PAGCN) to extract local-global relationships between keypoints, which is crucial for handling slight variations in the unified representation. Our experiments on four public gait recognition datasets demonstrate that our model exhibits better and more stable cross-domain capabilities compared to existing skeleton-based methods, achieving recognition results comparable to silhouette-based methods. The code for our model is available at https://github.com/BNU-IVC/FastPoseGait.
