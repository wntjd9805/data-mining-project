This study addresses the challenge of instance segmentation, which requires manual labeling of complex object contours in images for training. The authors propose a novel method for weakly-supervised instance segmentation that utilizes semantic knowledge from weakly-supervised semantic segmentation. Unlike traditional methods that rely on object proposals, their approach generates instance cues from the transferred semantic knowledge. To overcome the background shift problem in continual learning, the authors incorporate old class segmentation results from previous models to enhance the reliability of semantic and peak hypotheses. This is the first study to explore weakly-supervised continual learning for instance segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of their method on Pascal VOC and COCO datasets, achieving superior performance under various incremental settings.
