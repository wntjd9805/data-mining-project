This paper addresses the issue of ranking pre-trained models for object detection and image classification. The traditional method of selecting the best pre-trained model by fine-tuning is time-consuming and costly. Previous studies have suggested estimating transferability based on features extracted by pre-trained models. However, we argue that it is crucial to quantify whether the target dataset is in-distribution (IND) or out-of-distribution (OOD) for the pre-trained model in order to accurately assess transferability. To tackle this, we propose ETran, an energy-based transferability assessment metric, which comprises three scores: energy score, classification score, and regression score. By utilizing energy-based models, we can determine whether the target dataset is OOD or IND for the pre-trained model. Unlike previous approaches, ETran can be applied to various tasks, including classification, regression, and object detection (classification+regression). Notably, our work is the first to propose transferability estimation specifically for object detection. Through extensive experiments on four benchmarks and two tasks, we demonstrate that ETran surpasses previous methods in terms of object detection and classification benchmarks, achieving an average improvement of 21% and 12% respectively. Additionally, ETran achieves state-of-the-art performance in transferability assessment. The code for ETran is available at [link].
