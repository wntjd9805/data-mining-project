Efficient compression technology is necessary for transmitting underwater images (UWIs) in limited underwater bandwidth. However, existing image compression methods perform poorly on UWIs due to their failure to consider the unique characteristics of UWIs. These characteristics include the various underwater styles of color shift and distance-dependent clarity, as well as the redundancy between different UWIs caused by common ocean objects with similar structures and semantics. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach called RFD-ECNet. This approach involves constructing an underwater multi-scale feature dictionary to serve as a reference for UWI compression. We also introduce an underwater style normalized block (USNB) to align different underwater styles and improve feature matching accuracy using underwater physical priors. Additionally, a reference feature variant module (RFVM) is designed to adaptively adjust the reference features, enhancing the similarity between the reference and input features. Experimental results on four UWI datasets demonstrate that our RFD-ECNet achieves a significant BD-rate saving of 31% compared to the most advanced VVC.
