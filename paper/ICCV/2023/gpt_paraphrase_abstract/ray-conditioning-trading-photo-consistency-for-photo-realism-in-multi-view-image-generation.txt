Multi-view image generation is currently a popular research area with significant potential for 3D-related applications such as image viewpoint editing. Existing methods typically involve synthesizing a 3D representation, followed by rendering it into 2D images to ensure photo-consistency across different viewpoints. However, this emphasis on photo-consistency often leads to a sacrifice in photo-realism, resulting in geometric artifacts and a loss of fine-scale details when applied to real image editing. To overcome this limitation, we propose a geometry-free alternative called ray conditioning, which relaxes the photo-consistency constraint. Our approach involves conditioning a 2DGAN on a light field prior to generate multi-view images. By incorporating explicit viewpoint control, our method achieves state-of-the-art photo-realism and maintains identity consistency, making it particularly suitable for the task of viewpoint editing.
