The use of 3D reconstruction techniques has become common in digitally documenting archaeological fragments. However, efficiently capturing these fragments digitally remains a challenge. This study aims to develop a portable, accurate, and high-throughput reconstruction system for digitizing fragments found in archaeological sites. To achieve efficient digitization of a large number of objects, a strategy of scanning and reconstructing in batches is proposed. However, two main challenges arise: 1) correlating partial scans of the same object from multiple batch scans, and 2) registering and reconstructing complete models from partial scans with limited overlaps. To address these challenges, a new batch-based matching algorithm is developed to pair the front and back sides of the fragments, and a Bilateral BoundaryICP algorithm is introduced to register partial scans with narrow overlapping regions. Extensive validation in laboratories and testing in excavation sites demonstrate that these designs enable efficient batch-based scanning for fragments. The proposed batch-based scanning and reconstruction pipeline has immediate applications in digitizing sherds during archaeological excavations.
