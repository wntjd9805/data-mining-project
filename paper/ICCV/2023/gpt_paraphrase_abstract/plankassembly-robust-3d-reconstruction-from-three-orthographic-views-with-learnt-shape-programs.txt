In this study, a novel approach is presented for automatically converting 2D line drawings from three orthographic views into 3D CAD models. Existing methods for this task rely on back-projecting 2D observations into 3D space while maintaining a direct correspondence between the input and output. However, these methods are prone to errors and noise in the input, often leading to failure when dealing with imperfect drawings created by human designers. To address this challenge, the attention mechanism in a Transformer-based sequence generation model is employed to learn flexible mappings between the input and output. Additionally, shape programs are designed to enhance reconstruction accuracy and facilitate CAD modeling applications. Experimental results on a new benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches, particularly in scenarios involving noisy or incomplete inputs.
