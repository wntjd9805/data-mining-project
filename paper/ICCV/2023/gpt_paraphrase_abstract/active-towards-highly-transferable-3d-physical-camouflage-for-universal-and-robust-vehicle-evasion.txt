Adversarial camouflage has gained attention for its ability to conceal objects from detectors, but existing methods often lack universality and robustness, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we introduce ACTIVE, a cutting-edge camouflage framework that generates universal and robust adversarial camouflage for concealing 3D vehicles. Our framework incorporates innovative techniques such as refined texture rendering, a stealth loss for undetectability, and a camouflage loss for naturalness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACTIVE outperforms existing works on various detectors, including YOLOv7. Importantly, our evaluations show promising transferability to other vehicle classes, segmentation models, and real-world scenarios.
