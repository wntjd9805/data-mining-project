The abstract discusses the importance of 3D single object tracking (SOT) in automated driving and the challenges of annotating point clouds. The authors propose a semi-supervised approach to 3D SOT, inspired by the success of unsupervised 2D SOT. They introduce two cycle-consistency strategies for supervision, including self tracking cycles and forward-backward cycles, to improve the model's convergence and robustness. Additionally, they propose a data augmentation strategy called SOT-Mixup to enhance the tracker's robustness to point cloud diversity. The resulting MixCycle approach performs better than existing trackers, even with a lower percentage of labeled data. The authors provide their code at a specified GitHub repository.
