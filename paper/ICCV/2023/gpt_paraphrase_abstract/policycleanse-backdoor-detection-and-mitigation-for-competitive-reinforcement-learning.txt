The importance of the security and robustness of reinforcement learning (RL) systems is growing as their real-world applications become more popular. Recent studies have shown that in a multi-agent RL environment, malicious backdoor trigger actions can be injected into a victim agent, leading to catastrophic failures. To address this issue, we propose a solution called PolicyCleanse, which aims to detect Trojan agents and their trigger actions, as well as mitigate their malicious behavior. Our approach is based on the observation that the rewards of activated Trojan agents degrade significantly over time. Additionally, we introduce a machine unlearning-based approach to effectively mitigate the detected backdoors. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our methods can accurately detect Trojan agents and achieve a higher winning rate compared to existing backdoor mitigation approaches across different types of agents and environments.
