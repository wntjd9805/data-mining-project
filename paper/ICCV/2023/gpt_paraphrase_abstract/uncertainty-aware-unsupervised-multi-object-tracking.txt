Unsupervised multi-object trackers without manually annotated identities are not as effective as those that utilize reliable feature embeddings. This leads to errors in the similarity-based inter-frame association stage, resulting in uncertainty. The accumulation of uncertainty from frame to frame hinders the trackers' ability to learn consistent feature embeddings over time. Recent self-supervised techniques attempt to address this issue but fail to capture temporal relations, thus the inter-frame uncertainty persists. However, this paper argues that it is possible to leverage the uncertainty itself to improve the learned consistency. To achieve this, an uncertainty-based metric is developed to verify and rectify risky associations, enhancing the accuracy of pseudo-tracklets and improving feature consistency. Accurate tracklets can then incorporate temporal information into spatial transformation. The paper proposes a tracklet-guided augmentation strategy that simulates the motion of tracklets using a hierarchical uncertainty-based sampling mechanism for hard sample mining. This strategy is implemented in the U2MOT framework, an ultimate unsupervised MOT system. U2MOT is proven effective in MOT-Challenges and VisDrone-MOT benchmark, outperforming both supervised and unsupervised trackers currently published.
