Learning robust local image feature matching is a crucial task in computer vision and has been extensively studied in recent years. Transformer-based local feature matchers have emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based methods. However, these transformer-based approaches suffer from limited spatial correlations due to the expensive attention learning process, which only focuses on the center of coarse patches in the source views. This limitation negatively impacts pose estimation, particularly for low-resolution images. To address this issue, we propose a novel transformer-based cascade matching model called Cascade feature Matching TRansformer (CasMTR). CasMTR efficiently learns dense feature correlations, enabling the selection of more reliable matching pairs for accurate relative pose estimation. Instead of training a new detector, we employ a simple yet effective Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) post-processing technique to filter keypoints using the confidence map. This approach significantly improves matching precision. In our experiments, CasMTR achieves state-of-the-art performance in indoor and outdoor pose estimation, as well as visual localization. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed components and techniques.
