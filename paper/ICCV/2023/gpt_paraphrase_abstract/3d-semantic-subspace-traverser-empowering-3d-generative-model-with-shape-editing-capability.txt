This study introduces a new approach to 3D shape generation and editing that incorporates semantic information. Previous research in this area has focused mainly on shape quality and structure, neglecting the importance of preserving semantic consistency and enabling manipulation of semantic attributes. To address this, the authors propose a semantic generative model called 3D Semantic Subspace Traverser. The model uses implicit functions as the representation for 3D shapes and combines a latent-space GAN with a linear subspace model to identify semantic dimensions within the local latent space. Each dimension corresponds to a specific semantic attribute, allowing for the editing of generated shapes by adjusting the coefficients of these dimensions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate realistic shapes with intricate structures and facilitate the manipulation of semantic attributes. The code and trained models for this approach are available on the project's GitHub repository.
