Fair face recognition focuses on developing a feature learning system that can accurately recognize faces from different demographic groups. However, existing face datasets often have imbalanced representation of demographic attributes, leading to biased feature learning that performs poorly for minority groups. This bias is caused by confounding demographic attributes, which mislead the model into capturing irrelevant features specific to certain demographics. To address this issue, we propose a method called Invariant Feature Regularization (INV-REG) that can remove the confounding effect through unsupervised generation of diverse data partitions. Each partition acts as a self-annotated confounder, allowing INV-REG to effectively deconfound the learned features. We demonstrate that combining INV-REG with two strong baselines (Arcface and CIFP) results in state-of-the-art performance improvements in face recognition across various demographic groups. The code for INV-REG is available at https://github.com/milliema/InvReg.
