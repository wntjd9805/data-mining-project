We propose ∇-RANSAC, a generalized differentiable RANSAC that allows the entire randomized robust estimation pipeline to be learned. Our approach incorporates relaxation techniques to estimate gradients in the sampling distribution, which are then used in a differentiable solver. The trainable quality function considers scores from all models estimated within ∇-RANSAC to guide the network in learning accurate and useful inlier probabilities or training feature detection and matching networks. By directly maximizing the probability of drawing a good hypothesis, our method enables the learning of better sampling distributions. We evaluate ∇-RANSAC on real-world scenarios involving fundamental and essential matrix estimation, as well as 3D point cloud registration, both outdoors and indoors, using handcrafted and learning-based features. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy, while maintaining a similar speed to less accurate alternatives.
