Unsupervised image denoising methods have been developed to address the issue of noise in images without requiring clean images for comparison. Most existing methods follow a self-supervised approach, where the goal is to reconstruct each pixel of the noisy image without knowing the true pixel values. Recently, some researchers have recognized the importance of considering the value of each pixel when denoising, but this approach is highly sensitive to the standard deviation of the noise present in the clean images. Since this standard deviation is typically unknown without access to clean images, it is impractical to assume that it is known in order to achieve high model performance.  To tackle this problem, we propose a method called Noise2Info that can extract the critical information, specifically the standard deviation of the injected noise, solely based on the noisy images. We first establish an upper bound on the standard deviation, which traditionally requires clean images. However, we introduce a novel approach to estimate this bound using only the noisy images. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the difference between our estimated standard deviation and the true value decreases as the model is trained. Empirical studies validate the effectiveness and robustness of Noise2Info on benchmark datasets, and show that it accurately estimates the standard deviation of noise during model training.
