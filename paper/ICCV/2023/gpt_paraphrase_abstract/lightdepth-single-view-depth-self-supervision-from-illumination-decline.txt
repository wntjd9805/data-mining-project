Single-view depth estimation is highly effective when there is sufficient ground-truth depth data for supervised training. However, in certain scenarios, such as in medical endoscopies, obtaining such data is not possible. In such cases, alternative approaches like multi-view self-supervision and synthetic-to-real transfer are used but result in a significant decrease in performance compared to supervised training. Instead, we propose a single-view self-supervised method that achieves similar performance to supervised training. In medical devices like endoscopes, where the camera and light sources are located close to the target surfaces, we can exploit the fact that pixel brightness is inversely proportional to the square of the distance to the surface for a given albedo and surface orientation. This provides a strong self-supervisory signal for single-view depth estimation. Our experimental results demonstrate that our self-supervised models achieve accuracies comparable to fully supervised ones, while being applicable without the need for ground-truth depth data.
