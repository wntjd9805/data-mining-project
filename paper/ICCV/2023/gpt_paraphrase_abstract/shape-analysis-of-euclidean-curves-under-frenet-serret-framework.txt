Geometric methods are commonly used in curve analysis to identify invariant features and offer visually appealing solutions for various problems like calculating invariant distances, averaging curves, and aligning curves. In this study, we demonstrate that the generalized curvatures associated with the Frenet-Serret equation can establish a Riemannian geometry that encompasses all the geometric characteristics of a smooth curve in Rd (d > 1). This geometry builds upon the Square Root Curvature Transform, an extension of the square root-velocity transform for Euclidean curves in any dimension. By incorporating higher-order geometric information, our approach produces more reliable geodesics, eliminating artifacts that arise from using only first-order geometric data. To validate our findings, we conduct experiments with simulated data, with a particular focus on analyzing human motions. Specifically, we examine trajectories obtained from sign language and highlight the significance of considering both curvature and torsion in their analysis, as these measures hold physical meaning.
