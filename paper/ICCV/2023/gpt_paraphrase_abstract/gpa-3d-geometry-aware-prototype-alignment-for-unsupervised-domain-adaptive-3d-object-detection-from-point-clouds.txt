LiDAR-based 3D detection has made significant advancements, but its performance is limited in unseen environments due to the domain gap issue. Existing adaptive methods for 3D detection fail to address the distributional discrepancy problem in feature space, which hinders generalization across domains. To overcome this, we propose a new framework called Geometry-aware Prototype Alignment (GPA-3D) that uses the intrinsic geometric relationship of point cloud objects to reduce feature discrepancies and enable cross-domain transfer. GPA-3D assigns tailored and learnable prototypes to point cloud objects with different geometric structures. These prototypes align features derived from corresponding objects, reducing distributional discrepancies and improving adaptation. Evaluation results on various benchmarks show that GPA-3D outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in different adaptation scenarios. The MindSpore version code for GPA-3D will be publicly available at https://github.com/Liz66666/GPA3D.
