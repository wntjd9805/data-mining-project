This study aims to develop an efficient and effective framework for image restoration, which is crucial in various fields. While Transformer models have shown promising results in image restoration, their quadratic complexity poses practical challenges. To address this issue, we propose a dual-domain selection mechanism that focuses on important areas for reconstruction, such as edge signals and hard regions. Additionally, we enhance the network's efficiency and performance by incorporating multi-scale receptive fields into high-resolution features. The resulting network, named FocalNet, is constructed by integrating these designs into a U-shaped backbone. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FocalNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten datasets across three tasks: single-image defocus deblurring, image dehazing, and image desnowing. The code for FocalNet is publicly available at https://github.com/c-yn/FocalNet.
