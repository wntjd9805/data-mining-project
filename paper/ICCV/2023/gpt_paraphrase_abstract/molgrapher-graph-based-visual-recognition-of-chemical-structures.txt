The potential for accelerating the discovery of new materials and drugs through the automatic analysis of chemical literature is considerable. However, accurately parsing chemical structures from figures is a difficult task due to the complexity of the information, the variety of drawing styles, and the need for training data. To address this challenge, we present MolGrapher, a system that visually recognizes chemical structures. It utilizes a deep keypoint detector to identify atoms and constructs a graph representation of the molecule using candidate atoms and bonds as nodes. A Graph Neural Network then classifies the atom and bond nodes in the graph. To overcome the lack of real training data, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline that produces diverse and realistic results. We also introduce a benchmark dataset, USPTO-30K, which contains annotated real molecule images to facilitate research in this area. Our approach outperforms classical and learning-based methods in most scenarios, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on five datasets. The code, models, and datasets are publicly available.
