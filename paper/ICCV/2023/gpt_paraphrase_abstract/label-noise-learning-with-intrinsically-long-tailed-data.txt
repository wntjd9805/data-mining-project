The poor generalization of deep learning models is often caused by label noise, which is a major factor. Current label-noise learning methods assume balanced ground-truth classes in training data. However, real-world data is usually imbalanced, resulting in inconsistency between observed and intrinsic class distribution due to label noise. Identifying clean samples from noisy samples in the unknown intrinsic tail classes is challenging. To address this issue, we propose a learning framework called TABASCO for label-noise learning with intrinsically long-tailed data. TABASCO utilizes a two-stage bi-dimensional sample selection approach to separate clean samples from noisy samples, particularly in the tail classes. We introduce two novel separation metrics in TABASCO to overcome the limitations of using a single metric for sample separation. Extensive experiments on benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method. The code for our approach is publicly available at https://github.com/Wakings/TABASCO.
