This paper introduces a learning-based approach for estimating transparent surface shapes using single-view polarization images. Existing methods for shape estimation from polarization images face challenges in estimating transparent shapes due to interference from transmission, which reduces the reliability of physics-based priors. To overcome this challenge, we propose the concept of physics-based prior confidence, which exploits the fact that the transmission component in polarization images has more noise compared to reflection. This confidence measure is used to determine the contribution of the interfered physics-based prior. Additionally, we introduce a network called TransSfP with a multi-branch architecture to preserve relationships between different hierarchical inputs. To evaluate our method, we create a dataset consisting of paired polarization images and ground-truth normal maps for transparent shape estimation. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the superior accuracy of our approach. The dataset and code for our method are publicly available at https://github.com/shaomq2187/TransSfP.
