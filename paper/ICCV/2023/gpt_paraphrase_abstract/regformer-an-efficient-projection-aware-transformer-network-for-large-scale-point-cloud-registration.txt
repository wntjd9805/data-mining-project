Large-scale point cloud registration methods for outdoor LiDAR scans are underexplored due to challenges with the large number of points, complex distribution, and outliers. Existing methods typically use a two-stage approach, finding correspondences using local features and then filtering outliers with estimators. This approach relies heavily on well-designed descriptors and post-processing choices. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end transformer network called RegFormer. It uses a projection-aware hierarchical transformer to capture long-range dependencies and extract global point features to filter outliers. The transformer has linear complexity, ensuring efficiency even for large-scale scenes. Additionally, we introduce a bijective association transformer to regress the initial transformation and reduce mismatches. Extensive experiments on KITTI and NuScenes datasets validate the competitive performance of RegFormer in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The code for RegFormer is available at https://github.com/IRMVLab/RegFormer.
