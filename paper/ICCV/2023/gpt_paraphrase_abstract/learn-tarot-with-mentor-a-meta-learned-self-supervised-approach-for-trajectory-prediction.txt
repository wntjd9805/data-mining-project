Predicting feasible trajectories that adhere to map constraints is a difficult task. While graph-based scene encoders have been effective in preserving local structures of maps by defining lane-level connections, they fail to capture complex patterns arising from long-range connections between nonadjacent lanes. In this study, we introduce TAROT, which formulates combinations of various relations between lanes on the road topology to learn common driving patterns. TAROT can be seen as finding feasible routes. Additionally, we propose MENTOR, a meta-road network that aids trajectory prediction by providing navigation tips from TAROT. We define TAROT prediction as a self-supervised proxy task to identify the heterogeneous structure of the map. We establish multiple Heterogeneous Structure Learning (HSL) tasks for typical driving actions using TAROTs. MENTOR simultaneously predicts trajectories and performs meta-learning by finding an optimal combination of proxy tasks and balancing them to improve the primary task. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse dataset, particularly in terms of diversity and admissibility metrics, with improvements of up to 20% in challenging scenarios. Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules.
