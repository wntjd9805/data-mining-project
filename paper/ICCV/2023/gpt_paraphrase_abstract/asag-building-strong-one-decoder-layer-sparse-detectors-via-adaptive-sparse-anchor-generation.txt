Sparse detectors with multiple decoder layers have shown promising performance, but they suffer from long inference times due to their complex heads. Previous studies have used dense priors as initialization to build detectors with only one decoder layer, resulting in faster inference times. However, these detectors still significantly lag behind their counterparts with six decoder layers in terms of performance. To address this performance gap while maintaining fast speed, we identify that the architectural difference between dense and sparse detectors leads to feature conflict, which hinders the performance of one-decoder-layer detectors. Therefore, we propose the Adaptive Sparse Anchor Generator (ASAG) which predicts dynamic anchors on patches instead of grids in a sparse manner, mitigating the feature conflict issue. ASAG dynamically selects which feature maps and locations to predict for each image, enabling a fully adaptive approach to generate image-specific anchors. Additionally, we introduce a simple and effective Query Weighting method to alleviate training instability caused by adaptiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses dense-initialized detectors and achieves a better balance between speed and accuracy.
