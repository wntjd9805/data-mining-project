We propose a Template-guided Hierarchical Feature Restoration method for detecting anomalies in complex normal patterns. Our method utilizes two key techniques, bottleneck compression and template-guided compensation, to restore features without anomalies. The hierarchical features of an image are compressed using a bottleneck structure to preserve crucial features shared among normal samples. Template-guided compensation is designed to restore distorted features towards anomaly-free features by using hierarchical features from the most similar normal sample as a template. The bottleneck filters out some anomaly features, while compensation converts the remaining anomaly features towards normal with template guidance. Anomalies are detected by measuring the cosine distance between pre-trained features of an inference image and the corresponding restored anomaly-free features. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MVTecLOCO AD dataset, as demonstrated by experimental results.
