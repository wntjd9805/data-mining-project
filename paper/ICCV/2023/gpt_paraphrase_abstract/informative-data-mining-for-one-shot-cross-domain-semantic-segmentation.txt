Contemporary domain adaptation has become popular for transferring semantic segmentation between labeled source data and unlabeled target data. However, existing methods require retraining the model when the test environment changes, which can be costly and raise privacy concerns. One-shot domain adaptation methods aim to overcome these challenges by transferring a pre-trained source model to the target domain using only one target data. Nevertheless, these methods still face issues with computation cost and overfitting. To address this, we propose a novel framework called Informative Data Mining (IDM) that enables efficient one-shot domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. IDM incorporates an uncertainty-based selection criterion to identify the most informative samples, allowing for quick adaptation and reducing redundant training. We then apply a model adaptation method using these selected samples, including patch-wise mixing and prototype-based information maximization to update the model. This approach effectively improves adaptation and mitigates overfitting. Empirical evidence demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of IDM, which outperforms existing methods and achieves a new state-of-the-art one-shot performance on the GTA5/SYNTHIA to Cityscapes adaptation tasks. The code for IDM will be made available at https://github.com/yxiwang/IDM.
