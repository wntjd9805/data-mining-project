This paper presents MatrixVT, an efficient method for transforming multi-camera views to Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) in 3D perception. Existing methods for view transformation are either inefficient or rely on device-specific operators, limiting their applicability. In contrast, MatrixVT generates BEV features using convolutions and matrix multiplications (MatMul) only. The method utilizes a sparse Feature Transporting Matrix (FTM) in combination with image features to describe the BEV feature as a MatMul operation. To enhance efficiency, a Prime Extraction module is introduced to compress the dimension of image features and reduce FTM sparsity. Additionally, the Ring & Ray Decomposition technique is proposed to replace the FTM with two matrices, further reducing computation. MatrixVT outperforms existing methods in terms of speed, memory usage, and deployability. Experimental results on nuScenes and Waymo benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency of MatrixVT in object detection and map segmentation tasks, achieving comparable results to the state-of-the-art method.
