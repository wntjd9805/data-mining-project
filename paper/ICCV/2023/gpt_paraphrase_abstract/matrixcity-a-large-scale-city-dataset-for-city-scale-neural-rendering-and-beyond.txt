Neural rendering methods have made significant progress in rendering objects and small-scale scenes. However, there is a lack of comprehensive and high-quality datasets for neural rendering of city-scale scenes due to cost and technical limitations. To address this, we have created a synthetic dataset called MatrixCity using the Unreal Engine 5 City Sample project. This dataset includes aerial and street city views, accurate camera poses, and various additional data modalities. Our pipeline also allows for flexible control over environmental factors such as lighting, weather, and crowds. MatrixCity contains 67k aerial images and 452k street images from two city maps spanning 28km2. We have also conducted a benchmark on the dataset, which highlights the challenges and potential improvements for city-scale neural rendering. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at the project page: https://city-super.github.io/matrixcity/.
