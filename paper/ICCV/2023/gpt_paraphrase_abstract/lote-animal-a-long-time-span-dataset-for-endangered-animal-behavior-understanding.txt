The lack of large and diverse datasets for training deep learning models has hindered the application of advanced computer vision techniques in understanding and analyzing animal behavior, which is crucial for the conservation of endangered species. To address this issue, we introduce LoTE-Animal, a comprehensive dataset collected over 12 years, aimed at promoting the use of deep learning in rare species conservation. The dataset includes a wide range of variations such as ecological seasons, weather conditions, periods, viewpoints, and habitat scenes. It comprises over 500,000 videos and 1.2 million images. Specifically, we have selected and annotated 11 endangered animals for behavior understanding, providing 10,000 video sequences for action recognition and 28,000 images for object detection, instance segmentation, and pose estimation tasks. Additionally, we have gathered 7,000 web images of the same species for domain adaptation. We present evaluation results of various vision understanding approaches and cross-domain experiments. The release of the LoTE-Animal dataset will enable the research community to develop more advanced machine learning models and explore novel tasks to aid in endangered animal conservation.
