The abstract discusses the challenges faced by standard volume rendering approaches in dealing with degenerate geometries when there is limited viewpoint diversity. To address this issue, the authors propose the use of the multi-view photometric objective as a geometric regularizer for volumetric rendering. They suggest modeling scene geometry using a generalist Transformer, which learns a radiance field, depth field, and light fields with shared latent codes. By sharing geometric information across tasks, the authors show that their DeLiRa architecture achieves state-of-the-art results on the ScanNet benchmark, allowing for high-quality volumetric rendering and real-time novel view and depth synthesis in scenarios with limited viewpoint diversity.
