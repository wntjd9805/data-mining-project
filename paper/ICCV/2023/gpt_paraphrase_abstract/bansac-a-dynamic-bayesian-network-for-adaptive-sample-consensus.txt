This paper introduces a new adaptive sampling process for RANSAC, a commonly used algorithm for robust estimation in computer vision. The algorithm iteratively samples data, computes hypotheses, and counts inliers. Previous methods have attempted to improve efficiency through guided sampling, but they either assume no prior information about data point classifications or use precomputed scores. In this paper, we present a dynamic Bayesian network that updates individual data points' inlier scores during RANSAC iterations. We then apply weighted sampling based on these updated scores. Our method can be used with or without prior data point scores. Additionally, we use the updated inlier/outlier scores to derive a new stopping criterion for the RANSAC loop. We evaluate our method on multiple real-world datasets for various applications and achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy while requiring less computational time. The code for our method is publicly available. We illustrate the effectiveness of our method in a homography estimation problem, showing the updated inlier probabilities of data points over iterations.
