We introduce Skill Transformer, a method for addressing long-horizon robotic tasks through the combination of conditional sequence modeling and skill modularity. By utilizing the observations of a robot's surroundings and body movements, Skill Transformer is trained to predict both high-level skills (e.g., navigation, picking, placing) and low-level actions (e.g., base and arm motion) using a transformer architecture and demonstration trajectories that solve the entire task. It maintains the modularity and composability of the overall task by incorporating a skill predictor module, which enables reasoning about low-level actions and prevents common errors that occur during hand-offs in modular approaches. In experiments conducted on a benchmark for rearrangement tasks, Skill Transformer demonstrates effective task planning and precise control in new scenarios, achieving a success rate 2.5 times higher than the baseline methods in challenging rearrangement problems.
