Recent advancements in image sensor technology have greatly improved the spatial resolution of quad-Bayer patterned image sensors. This has paved the way for single-shot high-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging using spatially varying multiple exposures. However, existing methods that vary the gain of each exposure do not effectively change the photoelectronic energy, leading to issues such as noise and saturated details in HDR images. To overcome this, we propose using time-varying exposures in quad-Bayer patterned sensors. By allowing long-exposure pixels to receive more photon energy than short- or middle-exposure pixels, we can produce higher-quality HDR images. However, this approach is not ideal for dynamic scenes and requires a deghosting method. To address this, we introduce a single-shot HDR demosaicing method that simultaneously solves the demosaicing and deghosting problems using time-varying multiple exposures as input. Our method incorporates a feature-extraction module to handle mosaiced multiple exposures and a multiscale transformer module to register spatial displacements of multiple exposures and colors. Additionally, we have created a dataset of quad-Bayer sensor input with time-varying exposures and trained our network using this dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline HDR reconstruction methods using both synthetic and real datasets, allowing for high-quality HDR images even in challenging lighting conditions.
