Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are effective in learning patterns for vision tasks, but they are susceptible to label noise and can overfit to noisy labels during training. To address this issue, the early stopping strategy is commonly used to prevent further updates to CNNs in the early stages of training. However, inspired by biological observations that the amplitude spectrum (AS) and phase spectrum (PS) in the frequency domain have distinct roles in animal vision, we have discovered that the PS, which contains more semantic information, can enhance the robustness of CNNs against label noise more effectively than the AS. Consequently, we propose a novel approach called Phase-AmplituDe DisentangLed Early Stopping (PADDLES) that incorporates early stops at different training stages for AS and PS. This is achieved by separating the features of certain layers into AS and PS using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). Our experimental results on both synthetic and real-world label-noise datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the PADDLES method. It outperforms other early stopping techniques and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
