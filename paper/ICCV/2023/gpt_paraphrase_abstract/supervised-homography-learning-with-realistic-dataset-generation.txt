This paper presents an iterative framework for generating realistic training data and training a supervised homography network. The framework consists of two phases: a generation phase and a training phase. In the generation phase, unlabeled image pairs are used along with pre-estimated dominant plane masks and homography to generate labeled training pairs with realistic motion. The training phase utilizes the generated data to train the supervised homography network, refining the training data through a content consistency module and a quality assessment module. The trained network is then used in the next data generation phase to update the pre-estimated homography. This iterative strategy allows for gradual improvement of both the dataset quality and network performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance and can also improve existing supervised methods.
