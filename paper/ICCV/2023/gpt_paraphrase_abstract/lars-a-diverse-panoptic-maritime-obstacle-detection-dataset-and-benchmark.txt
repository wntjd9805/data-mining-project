The lack of a diverse dataset that accurately represents the complexity of maritime environments has hindered progress in detecting obstacles at sea. In response, we introduce the LaRS benchmark, the first comprehensive dataset for maritime panoptic obstacle detection. This dataset includes scenes from Lakes, Rivers, and Seas, and is distinguished by its wide range of recording locations, scene types, obstacle classes, and acquisition conditions. LaRS consists of over 4000 key frames, each with nine preceding frames to leverage temporal texture, resulting in a total of over 40k frames. Each key frame is meticulously labeled with 8 thing classes, 3 stuff classes, and 19 global scene attributes. We present the findings of evaluating 27 semantic and panoptic segmentation methods on the LaRS dataset, along with valuable performance insights and suggestions for future research directions. To facilitate fair evaluation, we have developed an online evaluation server. The LaRS dataset, evaluation toolkit, and benchmark are publicly accessible at: https://lojzezust.github.io/lars-dataset.
