The aim of this study was to develop a new approach for autonomous driving that improves trajectory planning by utilizing a vectorized representation of the driving scene. Previous methods relied on computationally intensive rasterized scene representations, which lacked instance-level structure information. The proposed vectorized paradigm, called VAD, offers two main advantages. Firstly, it incorporates explicit instance-level planning constraints based on vectorized agent motion and map elements, leading to enhanced planning safety. Secondly, VAD achieves faster processing times compared to previous methods by eliminating the need for computation-intensive rasterized representations and hand-designed post-processing steps. The effectiveness of VAD was demonstrated through its superior end-to-end planning performance on the nuScenes dataset, surpassing the previous best method by a significant margin. The base model, VAD-Base, reduced the average collision rate by 29.0% and was 2.5 times faster. Additionally, a lightweight variant, VAD-Tiny, achieved comparable planning performance while significantly improving inference speed (up to 9.3 times faster). The authors believe that the impressive performance and efficiency of VAD are crucial for the practical implementation of autonomous driving systems. The code and models for VAD are available at https://github.com/hustvl/VAD to facilitate further research in this area.
