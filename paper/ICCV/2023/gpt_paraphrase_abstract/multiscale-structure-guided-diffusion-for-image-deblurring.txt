Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have been used recently for image deblurring, where they generate high-quality images from Gaussian noise, conditioned on blurry images. These image-conditioned DPMs (icDPMs) have shown better results compared to regression-based methods when trained on similar data. However, their effectiveness in restoring images is uncertain when presented with images that are not from the same domain, as they do not impose specific degradation models or constraints. To address this, we propose a simple but effective approach that provides multiscale structure guidance to the icDPM. This guidance serves as an implicit bias, informing the icDPM about the coarse structure of the sharp image at intermediate layers. By incorporating this guidance, we observe a significant improvement in deblurring results, especially on unseen domains. The guidance is derived from the latent space of a regression network trained to predict the clean-sharp target at multiple lower resolutions, thus preserving the most important sharp structures. By utilizing both the blurry input and multiscale guidance, the icDPM model gains a better understanding of the blur and produces a cleaner image. We evaluate our model on various datasets and demonstrate more robust deblurring results with fewer artifacts on unseen data. Our method surpasses existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art perceptual quality while maintaining competitive distortion metrics.
