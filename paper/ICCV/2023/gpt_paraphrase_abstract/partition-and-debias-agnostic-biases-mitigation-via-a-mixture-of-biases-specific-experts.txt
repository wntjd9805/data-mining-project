Many existing methods for bias mitigation in image classification assume that an image contains only one type of known or unknown bias. However, this fails to consider the complexities of real-world biases. We propose a more challenging scenario called agnostic biases mitigation, which aims to remove bias regardless of the type or number of biases in the datasets. To tackle this task, we introduce the Partition-and-Debias (PnD) method. PnD utilizes a combination of biases-specific experts to divide the bias space into multiple subspaces and a gating module to achieve a consensus among the experts for debiased classification. Our experiments on various benchmarks, both public and constructed, demonstrate the effectiveness of PnD. The code for PnD is available at: https://github.com/Jiaxuan-Li/PnD.
