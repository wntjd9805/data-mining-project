Neural implicit surface reconstruction has become popular for 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods neglect the reconstruction of individual objects within the scene, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, previous work introduced ObjectSDF, which uses 2D instance masks to supervise object reconstruction. In this paper, we propose ObjectSDF++, a new framework that overcomes the limitations of ObjectSDF. Our model focuses on occlusion-aware object opacity rendering and introduces a regularization term for object distinction. Our experiments demonstrate that ObjectSDF++ produces superior object reconstruction and improves the quality of scene reconstruction.
