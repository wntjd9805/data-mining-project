Learning from label proportions (LLP) is a promising approach to weakly supervised learning. Instead of having instance-level labels, LLP uses label proportions associated with a set of instances (bag) to train an instance-level classifier. This paper introduces a bag-level data augmentation method called MixBag for LLP. The method is based on the observation that increasing the number of labeled bags improves instance-level classification accuracy, even with a fixed number of instances. The proposed approach also includes a confidence interval loss, which is designed using statistical theory to effectively utilize the augmented bags. This is the first attempt to propose bag-level data augmentation for LLP. MixBag can be applied to instance-level data augmentation techniques and any LLP method that employs the proportion loss. Experimental results demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of MixBag.
