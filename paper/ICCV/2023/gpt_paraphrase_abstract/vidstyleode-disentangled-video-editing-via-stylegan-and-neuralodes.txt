We introduce VidStyleODE, a novel video representation that combines the strengths of StyleGAN and Neural-ODEs. While Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have revolutionized image editing through effective traversal of latent spaces, applying these advancements to videos has proven challenging. Videos consist of both content and complex motion, requiring a specialized mechanism for disentanglement and control. VidStyleODE addresses this by encoding video content in a pre-trained StyleGANW+ space and utilizing a latent ODE component to summarize the spatiotemporal dynamics. Our continuous video generation process merges these components to produce high-quality videos with consistent temporal flow and adjustable frame rates. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method through various applications on real videos, including text-guided appearance manipulation, motion manipulation, image animation, and video interpolation and extrapolation.
