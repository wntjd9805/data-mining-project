Few-shot segmentation (FSS) success relies on effectively utilizing support samples. Many approaches compress support foreground (FG) features into prototypes, sacrificing spatial details. Others use cross attention to fuse query features with uncompressed support FG. Although query FG can be fused with support FG, query background (BG) cannot find matched BG features in support FG, resulting in the integration of dissimilar features. Additionally, combining both query FG and BG with support FG leads to ineffective segmentation. To address these issues, we propose a self-calibrated cross attention (SCCA) block. We begin by splitting query and support features into patches for efficient patch-based attention. Next, we introduce a patch alignment module to align each query patch with its most similar support patch to improve cross attention. Specifically, SCCA takes a query patch (Q) and groups patches from the same query image and aligned patches from the support image as K&V. This approach allows the fusion of query BG features with matched BG features, mitigating the aforementioned issues. Furthermore, we incorporate a scaled-cosine mechanism into SCCA to better leverage support features for similarity calculation. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i demonstrate the superiority of our model, with the mIoU score under a 5-shot setting on COCO-20i being 5.6%+ better than previous state-of-the-art methods.
