We demonstrate that using random region proposals for training classifiers can achieve state-of-the-art results in Open-world Object Detection (OWOD). These classifiers not only maintain accuracy for known objects with training labels but also significantly improve recall for unknown objects without training labels. Our proposed architecture, called RandBox, is based on Fast R-CNN and is trained on random proposals at each iteration, outperforming existing OWOD models such as Faster R-CNN and Transformer. The effectiveness of RandBox stems from two key benefits introduced by randomness. Firstly, the randomization is independent of the distribution of known objects, making the random proposals an instrumental variable that prevents the training from being influenced by the known objects. Secondly, unbiased training encourages more proposal explorations by using a matching score that does not penalize random proposals that do not match the known objects' prediction scores. We evaluate RandBox on the Pascal-VOC/MS-COCO and LVIS benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models in all metrics. We provide detailed information on the randomization and loss designs used in RandBox. The source code for RandBox is available at https://github.com/scuwyh2000/RandBox.
