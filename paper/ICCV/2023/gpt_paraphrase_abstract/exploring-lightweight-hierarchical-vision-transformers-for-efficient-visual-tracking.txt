We introduce HiT, a new family of efficient tracking models designed to address the speed limitations of existing transformer-based visual trackers. By incorporating a Bridge Module, HiT is able to bridge the gap between lightweight transformers and the tracking framework, resulting in better features for the tracking head. Additionally, we propose a dual-image position encoding technique that encodes position information for both the search region and template images. The HiT model achieves high speed, running at 61 fps on the Nvidia Jetson AGX edge device, while also delivering competitive performance. In fact, it achieves a 64.6% AUC on the LaSOT benchmark, outperforming previous efficient trackers. Code and models for HiT are available at https://github.com/kangben258/HiT.
