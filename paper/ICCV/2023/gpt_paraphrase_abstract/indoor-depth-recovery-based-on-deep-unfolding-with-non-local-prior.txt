In recent years, deep neural networks have been successful in depth recovery tasks. However, these networks lack a clear mechanism and function like black boxes. To address this, we propose the DC-NLAR model, which utilizes the common characteristics found in depth images. Our model includes a non-local auto-regressive regular term to capture more non-local depth information. Additionally, we introduce a deep image prior to better describe the characteristics of depth images. To handle the degenerate operator with high heterogeneity, we incorporate an implicit data consistency term. We transform our proposed model into networks using the half-quadratic splitting algorithm. Experimental results on the NYU-Depth V2 and SUN RGB-D datasets demonstrate comparable performance to deep learning methods.
