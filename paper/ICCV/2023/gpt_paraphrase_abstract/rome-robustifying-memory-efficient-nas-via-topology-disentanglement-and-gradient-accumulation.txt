DARTS, a popular architecture searching approach, faces challenges due to its high memory cost. To address this issue, single-path DARTS selects a memory-friendly submodel with low computational costs. However, we have identified a significant problem with single-path DARTS, which leads to a performance collapse due to an excessive number of parameter-free operations. In this paper, we propose a solution called ROME (Robustifying Memory-Efficient NAS) to overcome this problem. ROME separates the topology search from the operation search to ensure consistent searching and evaluation. We also employ Gumbel-Top2 reparameterization and gradient accumulation to enhance the optimization process. Our extensive experiments on 15 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of ROME.
