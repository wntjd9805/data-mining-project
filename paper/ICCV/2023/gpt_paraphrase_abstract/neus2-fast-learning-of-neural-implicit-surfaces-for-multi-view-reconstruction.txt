A new approach called NeuS2 has been developed to improve the training speed of neural surface reconstruction for both static and dynamic scenes. Previous methods, such as NeuS, achieved high-quality reconstruction but required an impractically long training time of 8 hours. NeuS2 addresses this issue by utilizing multi-resolution hash encodings and a lightweight calculation of second-order derivatives to accelerate the training process. A progressive learning strategy is also employed to optimize the encodings from coarse to fine, further stabilizing and expediting training. Additionally, NeuS2 introduces an incremental training strategy and a global transformation prediction component to handle challenging long sequences with large movements and deformations in dynamic scene reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that NeuS2 outperforms existing methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and training speed for both static and dynamic scenes. The code for NeuS2 is available on the authors' website.
