This paper proposes the use of implicit surface representation in self-supervised 3D representation learning with autoencoders. Point clouds, the most popular 3D representation, involve discrete samples of the continuous 3D surface, which introduces variations in sampling. This makes it difficult to develop transferable knowledge in the standard autoencoding of the true 3D geometry, as the encoder must encode information on the specific discrete sampling into the latent code. To address this issue, the paper introduces the Implicit AutoEncoder (IAE), which replaces the point-cloud decoder with an implicit decoder. The implicit decoder reconstructs a continuous representation of the 3D shape, independent of sampling imperfections. Extensive experiments show that the proposed IAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised learning benchmarks. The code for the IAE is available at https://github.com/SimingYan/IAE.
