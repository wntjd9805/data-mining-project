This paper presents a weakly supervised learning algorithm for acquiring robust semantic correspondences from large-scale datasets that only have image-level labels. The algorithm decomposes the correspondence learning problem into three stages: image-level matching, region-level matching, and pixel-level matching. A novel cascaded online correspondence refinement algorithm is proposed to integrate multiple instance learning (MIL) and correspondence filtering and refinement into a single deep network. This network is trained end-to-end using only image-level supervision, without point-to-point matching information. During the correspondence learning process, weak supervision is used to infer, filter, and enhance pixel-to-pixel matching pairs through masked correspondence voting and calibration. Additionally, a correspondence consistency check algorithm is designed to select images with discriminative keypoints and generate pseudo-labels for classical matching algorithms. The authors create a new dataset called SC-ImageNet by filtering out approximately 110,000 images from the ImageNet ILSVRC training set. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that pre-training on SC-ImageNet significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art algorithms.
