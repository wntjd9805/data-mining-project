Generating human motion sequences based on text descriptions is a significant but challenging task in computer vision. Existing methods have limitations in producing either deterministic or imprecise motion sequences, as they struggle to effectively control the temporal and spatial relationships required to match a given text description. In this study, we propose a detailed approach to generate high-quality human motion sequences that accurately align with specific text descriptions. Our approach comprises two main components: 1) A linguistics-structure assisted module that constructs precise and comprehensive language features to fully leverage the information from the text description. 2) A context-aware progressive reasoning module that learns both local and global semantic linguistic features using shallow and deep graph neural networks, enabling multi-step inference.Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing text-driven motion generation methods on HumanML3D and KIT test sets. It successfully generates visually confirmed motions that closely adhere to the given text conditions.
