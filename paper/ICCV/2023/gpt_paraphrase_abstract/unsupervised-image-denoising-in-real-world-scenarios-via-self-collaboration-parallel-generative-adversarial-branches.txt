Deep learning has achieved impressive results in image denoising, particularly when trained on large-scale paired datasets. However, obtaining such datasets for real-world scenarios is challenging. Unsupervised approaches based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) offer a potential solution for denoising without paired datasets, but they struggle to surpass the limitations of conventional GAN-based unsupervised frameworks without significant modifications or increased computational complexity. To address this issue, we propose a self-collaboration (SC) strategy for multiple denoisers. This strategy significantly improves performance without increasing the inference complexity of the GAN-based denoising framework. The idea is to iteratively replace the less powerful denoiser in the filter-guided noise extraction module with the current powerful denoiser, generating better synthetic clean-noisy image pairs and leading to a more powerful denoiser in the next iteration. Additionally, we introduce a baseline method that incorporates parallel generative adversarial branches with complementary "self-synthesis" and "unpaired-synthesis" constraints to ensure stability and effectiveness during training. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art unsupervised methods. More information about our method can be found at https://github.com/linxin0/SCPGabNet.
