Dataset summarization is a valuable method for examining datasets. However, it is limited to identifying only the most prominent visual concepts when applied to a single dataset. We propose that a comparative approach can enhance this paradigm and allow for more comprehensive dataset inspection beyond these prominent concepts. To facilitate dataset comparison, we introduce a module that learns concept-level prototypes across multiple datasets. Utilizing self-supervised learning, we identify these prototypes without the need for supervision. Through two case studies, we demonstrate the advantages of our approach. Our results indicate that dataset comparison expands the possibilities for dataset inspection, and we hope to inspire further research in this direction.
