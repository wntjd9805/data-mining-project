This study addresses the challenge of underwater image instance segmentation, which is a crucial step in analyzing and understanding underwater images. The lack of comprehensive multiclass instance segmentation datasets has hindered the progress in this field. To overcome this limitation, the researchers introduce the first underwater image instance segmentation dataset called UIIS. This dataset consists of 4628 images across 7 categories, each with pixel-level annotations. Additionally, the researchers propose a novel method called WaterMask for underwater image instance segmentation. WaterMask employs the Difference Similarity Graph Attention Module (DSGAT) to recover lost details caused by image quality degradation and downsampling. It also utilizes the Multi-level Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) to predict foreground masks and boundary masks separately at different scales. The network is guided by the Boundary Mask Strategy (BMS) with a boundary learning loss to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that WaterMask outperforms the Mask R-CNN model by achieving a significant increase in mean average precision (2.9 mAP with ResNet-50 and 3.8 mAP with ResNet-101).
