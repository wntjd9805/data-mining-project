TF-ICON is a new framework called Training-Free Image COmpositioN that utilizes text-driven diffusion models for cross-domain image-guided composition. Unlike current methods, which require expensive optimization or fine-tuning on customized datasets, TF-ICON can perform composition without additional training or optimization. The framework introduces the concept of an exceptional prompt, which contains no information but helps accurately invert real images into latent representations for compositing. Experimental results demonstrate that TF-ICON, equipped with the exceptional prompt, outperforms state-of-the-art inversion methods on various datasets (CelebA-HQ, COCO, and ImageNet), surpassing previous baselines in versatile visual domains.
