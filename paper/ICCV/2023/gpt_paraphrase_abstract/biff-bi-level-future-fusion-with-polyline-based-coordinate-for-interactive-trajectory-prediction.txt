The prediction of future paths for surrounding agents is crucial for ensuring safe autonomous driving. Previous research has primarily focused on predicting individual trajectories for each agent separately. However, there has been limited exploration into predicting joint trajectories for interactive agents. In this study, we introduce a new approach called Bi-level Future Fusion (BiFF) that specifically aims to capture future interactions between interactive agents. BiFF combines the high-level future intentions with the low-level future behaviors of agents. Additionally, we propose the use of polyline-based coordinates for multi-agent prediction, which ensures efficient data utilization, robustness across frames, and accurate predictions. Our experiments demonstrate that BiFF outperforms other methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the interactive prediction benchmark of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.
