We address the problem of clustering and learning a linear representation for data that is close to a combination of low-dimensional manifolds. This is a significant task in machine learning and computer vision. Existing methods for subspace clustering, which assumes linear subspaces, are inadequate for real-world datasets like natural images. To overcome this limitation, previous works have tried to learn a transformation that maps data from non-linear manifolds to linear subspaces, ensuring that points from the same manifold are mapped to the same subspace. However, these approaches have limitations such as requiring knowledge of cluster membership, high sampling density, or learning trivial representations. In this study, we propose a novel approach that optimizes the Maximal Coding Rate Reduction metric for both data representation and a new doubly stochastic cluster membership. We provide a parameterization for this representation and membership, enabling efficient mini-batching and one-shot initialization. Our experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-20, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet-200 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art deep clustering methods in terms of accuracy and scalability. Additionally, our approach learns a latent linear representation of the data.
