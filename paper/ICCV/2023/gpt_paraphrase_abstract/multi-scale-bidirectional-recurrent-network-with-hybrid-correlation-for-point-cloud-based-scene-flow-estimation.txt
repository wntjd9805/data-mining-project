We introduce a new approach for estimating scene flow in dynamic scenes, which is crucial for various computer vision applications. Our method employs a novel multi-scale bidirectional recurrent architecture that optimizes the estimation from coarse to fine levels. At each resolution scale, we propose a bidirectional gated recurrent unit that iteratively enhances point features and generates progressively refined scene flow. The optimization process incorporates hybrid correlation, capturing both local and semantic correlations to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the FlyingThings3D and KITTI benchmarks, while maintaining efficient computation time.
