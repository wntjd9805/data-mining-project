Recovering information from non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging is a complex problem that requires significant computational resources. Existing physics-based methods for NLOS imaging assume certain conditions, such as three-bounce reflections and no self-occlusion, which may limit their accuracy for objects with substantial depth variations. On the other hand, learning-based methods can overcome these limitations but struggle to capture fine details without specific designs due to the bias of neural networks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that combines physics-based and learning-based methods. We introduce a learnable inverse kernel in the Fourier domain and utilize an attention mechanism to improve the neural network's ability to learn high-frequency information. We evaluate our method on both publicly available and new synthetic datasets, and it outperforms existing physics-based and learning-based methods, particularly for objects with large depth variations. Our approach also generalizes well to real data and can be applied to tasks like classification and depth reconstruction. We will release our code and dataset to the public for further research and development.
