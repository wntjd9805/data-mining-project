Humans have a unique ability to identify similarities between unfamiliar objects and recreate them in a novel way. This skill is challenging for machines to replicate. In this study, we introduce a framework called ISCO, which allows for the recomposition of objects using 3D superquadrics as semantic parts. Unlike other methods that require training a model with 3D supervision, ISCO directly utilizes 2D views to optimize the parameters of the superquadrics that make up the object. By comparing the rendered 3D view and the 2D image silhouette, ISCO iteratively adds new superquadrics to regions where the reconstruction error is high. This process abstracts both coarse and fine details of the target object. Despite not having any semantic supervision, ISCO consistently provides accurate superquadrics for related object parts. Additionally, ISCO does not rely on training a neural network, making it robust to out-of-distribution objects. Experimental results demonstrate that ISCO outperforms recent single instance superquadrics reconstruction approaches, even when working with images in real-world environments.
