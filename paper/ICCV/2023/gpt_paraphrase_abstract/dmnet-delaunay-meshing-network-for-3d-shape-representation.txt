There has been a growing interest in learning-based explicit methods that can preserve details and respect the original input. However, these methods struggle to infer connectivity on complex structures, resulting in artifacts and non-watertight triangles. In this paper, we propose a new learning-based approach that combines Delaunay triangulation to achieve high-precision reconstruction. We view Delaunay triangulation as a dual graph and extract local geometric information from the points, incorporating it into the structural representation. To enhance interaction between edges and nodes in the graph, we introduce a local graph iteration algorithm inspired by graph neural networks. Additionally, we utilize a geometric constraint loss to improve the classification of tetrahedrons. Our method is scalable and can handle large-scale reconstruction by employing a scaling strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach produces watertight and high-quality meshes, outperforming state-of-the-art methods, particularly in thin structures and sharp edges. Furthermore, our method is adaptable to point clouds with varying densities.
