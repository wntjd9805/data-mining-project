Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved excellent results in various applications that utilize graph data, such as social analysis and fraud detection. However, the sensitive nature of graph links, such as social relationships and transaction history, raises privacy concerns when GNNs are used. To exploit these vulnerabilities, we propose VertexSerum, a new graph poisoning attack that enhances the effectiveness of stealing graph links by amplifying the leakage of link connectivity. To accurately infer node adjacency, we introduce an attention mechanism that can be integrated into the link detection network. Our experiments demonstrate that VertexSerum significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art link inference attack, improving the AUC scores by an average of 9.8% across four real-world datasets and three different GNN structures. Moreover, our experiments prove the effectiveness of VertexSerum in both black-box and online learning scenarios, further validating its applicability in real-world situations.
