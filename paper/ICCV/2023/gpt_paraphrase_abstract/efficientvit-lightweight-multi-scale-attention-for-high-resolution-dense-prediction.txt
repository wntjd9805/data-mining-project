EfficientViT is a new family of high-resolution vision models that aims to overcome the computational cost challenges associated with deploying state-of-the-art high-resolution dense prediction models on hardware devices. Unlike previous models that rely on heavy self-attention, hardware-inefficient large-kernel convolution, or complicated topological structures, EfficientViT introduces a lightweight multi-scale attention mechanism. This attention mechanism achieves a global receptive field and multi-scale learning, which are crucial for high-resolution dense prediction, using lightweight and hardware-efficient operations.EfficientViT outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in terms of performance and speed on various hardware platforms, including mobile CPUs, edge GPUs, and cloud GPUs. In the case of Cityscapes, EfficientViT achieves up to 8.8× and 3.8× GPU latency reduction compared to SegFormer and SegNeXt, respectively, without sacrificing performance. In super-resolution tasks, EfficientViT achieves up to 6.4× speedup compared to Restormer while also providing a 0.11dB gain in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).In summary, EfficientViT presents a solution to the challenge of deploying high-resolution dense prediction models on hardware devices by introducing a lightweight multi-scale attention mechanism. It demonstrates superior performance and significant speed improvements compared to previous models on various hardware platforms.
