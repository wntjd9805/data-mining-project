This paper proposes a novel approach called Wavelet-aware Image-based Pose Transfer (WaveIPT) that combines attention and flow methods in the wavelet domain. WaveIPT utilizes Intra-scale Local Correlation (ILC) to adaptively fuse attention and flow in the same scale, taking into account their strengths in the low and high-frequency domains. It also employs Inter-scale Feature Interaction (IFI) to explore inter-scale frequency features, facilitating effective information transfer across different scales. Additionally, the paper introduces Progressive Flow Regularization (PFR) to overcome the challenges of flow estimation under large pose differences. Experimental results on the DeepFashion dataset demonstrate that WaveIPT achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both FID and LPIPS, with improvements of 4.97% and 3.89%, respectively.
