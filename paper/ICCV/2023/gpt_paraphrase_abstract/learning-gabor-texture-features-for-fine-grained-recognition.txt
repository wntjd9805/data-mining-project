To improve the recognition of fine-grained categories, it is important to extract and utilize features that differentiate between similar classes. While deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promise in exploiting class-discriminative features, they suffer from issues such as frequency bias and loss of local information, which limit their performance. To address this challenge, we propose a new approach that incorporates a texture branch alongside the CNN branch for feature extraction. We leverage the power of Gabor filters, known for their ability to effectively capture multi-frequency features and detailed local information, as the texture feature extractor. We introduce various designs to enhance the effectiveness of Gabor filters, including imposing constraints on parameter values and developing a learning method to determine optimal parameters. Additionally, we utilize a statistical feature extractor to extract informative statistical information from the signals captured by Gabor filters. To enable efficient computation, we employ a gate selection mechanism that considers only qualified regions as input for texture extraction. By integrating the features extracted from the Gabor-filter-based texture branch and the CNN-based semantic branch, we achieve comprehensive information extraction. We validate the effectiveness of our method on multiple datasets, including CUB-200-2011, NA-bird, Stanford Dogs, and GTOS-mobile, and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance using our approach.
