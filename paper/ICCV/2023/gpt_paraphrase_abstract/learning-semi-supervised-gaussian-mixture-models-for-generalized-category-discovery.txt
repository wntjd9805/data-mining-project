This paper addresses the problem of discovering categories in a generalized manner, specifically in the context of image clustering. The task involves automatically grouping unlabeled images using information from labeled data, where the unlabeled data includes images from both labeled classes and new categories. This problem, known as generalized category discovery (GCD), is more realistic and challenging than traditional semi-supervised learning (SSL) because SSL assumes that all unlabeled images belong to the same classes as the labeled ones. Additionally, the number of classes in the unlabeled data is not known in advance, further increasing the difficulty of the GCD problem.To address the GCD problem without prior knowledge of the class number, the paper proposes an iterative framework inspired by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. This framework alternates between two main steps: representation learning and class number estimation. The authors introduce a semi-supervised variant of the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with a stochastic splitting and merging mechanism to dynamically determine prototypes for the clustering process. The prototypes are selected based on cluster compactness and separability. The authors then employ prototypical contrastive learning to learn representations from the partially labeled data, while adhering to the constraints provided by the labeled data. This alternating process continues until convergence is achieved.To assign an unlabeled instance to a cluster, the framework identifies its nearest prototype. The proposed framework is extensively evaluated on both generic image classification datasets and challenging fine-grained object recognition datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance. The code for this framework is publicly available at the provided GitHub repository (https://github.com/DTennant/GPC).
