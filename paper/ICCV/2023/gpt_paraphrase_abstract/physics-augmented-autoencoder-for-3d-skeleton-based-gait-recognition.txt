This paper presents a new framework called physics-augmented autoencoder (PAA) for 3D skeleton-based human gait recognition. The framework consists of a graph-convolution-based encoder and a physics-based decoder. The encoder takes the skeleton sequence as input and generates generalized positions and forces for each joint. The decoder then reconstructs the input skeleton using Lagrangian dynamics. This ensures that the intermediate representations are both physically plausible and discriminative. During inference, a RNN-based classifier is used for gait recognition, while the decoder is discarded. The proposed method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies demonstrate that the method generalizes well and is robust with small-scale training data due to the incorporation of physics knowledge. The physical plausibility of the intermediate representations is validated by making force predictions on real data with physical annotations.
