We present a new technique for automatically creating artistic typography that visually represents the meaning of a word while maintaining readability. Our approach overcomes challenges such as conflicting goals, lack of ground truth data, and a large search space by utilizing large language models. We use a denoising generator in a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), augmented with a CNN-based discriminator to adapt the input style to the input text. This discriminator compares rasterized images of real letter/word fonts with the output of the generator. Our model, DS-Fusion, combines discrimination and stylization using diffusion. We demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our method through various examples, qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and ablation studies. User studies comparing our approach to strong baselines and artist-created typographies show that DS-Fusion performs exceptionally well. The code for our method is available at https://ds-fusion.github.io/.
