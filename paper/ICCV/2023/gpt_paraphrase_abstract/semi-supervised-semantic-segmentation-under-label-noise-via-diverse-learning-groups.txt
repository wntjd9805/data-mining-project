Semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods aim to interpret a large amount of unlabelled image data using a small number of clean pixel-level annotations as guidance. However, the difficulty of providing accurate annotations at scale often leads to noisy labels, which negatively impact the final results. To address this challenge, we propose a robust approach that can handle label noise in the annotated data. Our method involves two learning groups, each equipped with different network architectures, to effectively handle both label noise and unlabelled images. Each learning group consists of a teacher network, a student network, and a unique filter module. The filter module in each learning group utilizes pixel-level features from the teacher network to identify incorrectly labelled pixels. To mitigate confirmation bias, we utilize the labels cleaned by the filter module from one learning group to train the other learning group. Experimental results on two different benchmarks and settings demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.
