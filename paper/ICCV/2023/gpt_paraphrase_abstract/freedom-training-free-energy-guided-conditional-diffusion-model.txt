Recently, conditional diffusion models have become popular in various applications due to their exceptional generation ability. However, many existing methods require training, either through a time-dependent classifier or a condition-dependent score estimator. This increases the cost of constructing conditional diffusion models and makes it inconvenient to transfer them across different conditions. Some current approaches attempt to overcome this limitation by proposing training-free solutions, but most are only applicable to specific tasks and not to more general conditions.In this study, we introduce a training-free conditional diffusion model called FreeDoM, which can be used for various conditions. We achieve this by utilizing pre-trained networks, such as a face detection model, to create time-independent energy functions that guide the generation process without the need for training. Moreover, the construction of the energy function is highly flexible and adaptable to different conditions, enabling FreeDoM to have a broader range of applications compared to existing training-free methods. FreeDoM offers advantages in terms of simplicity, effectiveness, and low cost.Experimental results demonstrate that FreeDoM is effective for diverse conditions and suitable for diffusion models in different data domains, including images and latent codes.
