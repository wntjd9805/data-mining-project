In the era of deep learning, significant progress has been made in natural image compression. However, when applying pretrained encoders directly to compress screen content images, the compression performance suffers greatly. On the other hand, parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) methods have displayed impressive adaptation abilities in high-level vision tasks. To address this issue, we introduce a novel module called Dec-Adapter, which is an entropy-efficient transfer learning module for the decoder. This module serves as a bridge between natural image and screen content compression. The adapter's parameters are learned during encoding and then transmitted to the decoder for image-adaptive decoding. Our Dec-Adapter is lightweight, can be transferred across domains, and is compatible with various architectures, offering versatile performance in connecting the two domains. Experimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of BD-rate performance for screen content image compression. Specifically, when applied to screen content image compression, our method achieves a gain of over 2 dB compared to the baseline method.
