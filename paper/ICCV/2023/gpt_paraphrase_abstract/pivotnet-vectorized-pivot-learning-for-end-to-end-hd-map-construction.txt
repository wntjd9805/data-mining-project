Vectorized high-definition map construction for autonomous driving research has become an area of focus. Current approaches often use a fixed number of points or predict local maps in a two-stage autoregressive manner, which can result in missing important details and accumulating errors. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective architecture called PivotNet. PivotNet utilizes unified pivot-based map representations and is formulated as a direct set prediction paradigm. We introduce a Point-to-Line Mask module to encode point-line priors and a Pivot Dynamic Matching module to model topology in dynamic point sequences. Additionally, we propose a Dynamic Vectorized Sequence loss to supervise the position and topology of vectorized point predictions. Our extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that PivotNet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by at least 5.9 mAP. The code for PivotNet will be made available soon.
