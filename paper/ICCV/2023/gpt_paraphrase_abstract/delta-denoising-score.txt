This paper introduces a new scoring technique called Delta Denoising Score (DDS) for image editing. Unlike the existing technique called Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which uses a single image-text pair to query the generative model, DDS utilizes an additional fixed query with a reference image-text pair. DDS generates delta scores that represent the difference between the outputs of the two queries. By estimating noisy gradient directions introduced by SDS using the source image and its text description, DDS provides cleaner gradient directions that modify the edited parts of the image while keeping the rest unchanged. This results in a refined edited version of the source image. The analysis presented in this paper demonstrates the effectiveness of DDS for image-to-image translation. Additionally, we show that DDS can be used to train a zero-shot image translation model with good results. Experimental results indicate that the proposed loss term performs better than existing methods in terms of stability and quality, showcasing its potential for real-world applications.
