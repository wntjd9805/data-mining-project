Semi-supervised Learning (SSL) is gaining attention in autonomous driving as a way to reduce the burden of annotating 3D data. This paper introduces a novel SSL framework called UpCycling, which uses unlabeled intermediate features to train a 3D object detection model without the need for raw-level point cloud data. These intermediate features are already produced during the inference process, eliminating the need for additional computations on autonomous vehicles. However, creating an effective consistency loss for the unlabeled feature-level scenes presents a challenge. Existing SSL frameworks that enforce consistency regularization between different augmentations of unlabeled raw-point scenes do not work well with intermediate features. To address this issue, the authors propose a combination of hybrid pseudo labels and feature-level Ground Truth sampling (F-GT) to augment the unlabeled multi-type 3D scene features and provide high-quality supervision. The UpCycling framework is implemented on two popular 3D object detection models and experiments on widely-used datasets show that UpCycling performs better than other feature-level augmentation methods. Furthermore, while preserving privacy, UpCycling achieves comparable or better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods that use raw-level unlabeled data in both domain adaptation and partial-label scenarios.
