This study focuses on the use of text as a guide for creating graphic layouts, known as Text-to-Layout, with the goal of making design more accessible. Text-to-Layout is a challenging task as it requires considering implicit, combined, and incomplete layout constraints from the text, which has not been thoroughly explored in previous research. To address this, a two-stage approach called parse-then-place is proposed. This approach introduces an intermediate representation (IR) between text and layout to capture diverse layout constraints. The parse stage takes a textual description and generates an IR, transforming implicit constraints into explicit ones. The place stage then generates layouts based on the IR. To model combined and incomplete constraints, a Transformer-based layout generation model is used, and a method to represent constraints and layouts as sequences is carefully designed. Additionally, the pretrain-then-finetune strategy is employed to enhance the performance of the layout generation model using large-scale unlabeled layouts. Two Text-to-Layout datasets are constructed to evaluate the proposed approach. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through quantitative results, qualitative analysis, and user studies.
