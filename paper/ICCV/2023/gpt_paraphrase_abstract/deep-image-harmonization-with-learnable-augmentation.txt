The objective of image harmonization is to adjust the appearance of the foreground in a composite image in order to achieve overall visual harmony. Existing datasets use various methods to modify the illumination characteristics of the foreground in real images to create synthetic composite images for paired training. However, these datasets have significant differences in their domains, and the performance on small-scale datasets is limited due to insufficient training data. In this study, we propose using learnable augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity of illumination in small-scale datasets, thus improving the harmonization performance. Our approach, called SycoNet (SYnthetic COmposite Network), takes a real image with a foreground mask and a random vector as input to learn an appropriate color transformation. This transformation is then applied to the foreground of the real image to generate a synthetic composite image. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed learnable augmentation for image harmonization. The code for SycoNet is publicly available at https://github.com/bcmi/SycoNet-Adaptive-Image-Harmonization.
