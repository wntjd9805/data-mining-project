This study focuses on weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods that use class activation maps (CAM) to generate initial segmentation results. However, CAM often fails to accurately distinguish the foreground from the co-occurred background, leading to inaccurate activation from the background. Previous attempts to address this issue have involved external supervision and human priors. In this paper, the authors propose a method called False Positive Rectification (FPR) to tackle the co-occurrence problem by utilizing the false positives of CAM. They observe that the CAM-activated regions of absent classes contain class-specific co-occurred background cues. By collecting these false positives, they guide the training of the CAM network using a region-level contrast loss and a pixel-level rectification loss. Importantly, this approach does not rely on any external supervision or human priors.The proposed FPR method effectively suppresses incorrect activations from background objects. The authors conduct extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets, demonstrating that FPR significantly improves the performance of off-the-shelf methods and achieves state-of-the-art results.
