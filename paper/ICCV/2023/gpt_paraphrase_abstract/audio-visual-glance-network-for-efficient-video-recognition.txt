Deep learning has made significant progress in understanding videos, but the computational requirements for classifying lengthy and massive videos using clip-level video classifiers are currently impractical and expensive. To address this issue, we propose a solution called Audio-Visual Glance Network (AVGN). AVGN utilizes the audio and visual modalities that are commonly available to efficiently process the important parts of a video in terms of space and time.  To begin with, AVGN divides the video into smaller snippets consisting of image-audio clip pairs. It then employs lightweight encoders to extract global visual and audio features from these snippets. In order to identify the crucial temporal segments, we introduce an Audio-Visual Temporal Saliency Transformer (AV-TeST) that estimates the saliency scores of each frame.  To improve efficiency in the spatial dimension, AVGN focuses only on important patches instead of processing the entire images. This is achieved using an Audio-Enhanced Spatial Patch Attention (AESPA) module, which generates a set of enhanced coarse visual features. These features are then utilized by a policy network to determine the coordinates of the important patches.  By adopting this approach, AVGN is able to concentrate solely on the most significant spatio-temporal parts of the video, resulting in more efficient video recognition. Additionally, we incorporate various training techniques and multi-modal feature fusion to enhance the robustness and effectiveness of AVGN. Through the combination of these strategies, our AVGN achieves state-of-the-art performance in multiple video recognition benchmarks while also achieving faster processing speed.  In conclusion, our proposed AVGN approach addresses the computational challenges associated with classifying lengthy and massive videos. By leveraging audio and visual modalities, as well as employing techniques such as temporal saliency estimation and spatial patch attention, AVGN achieves superior video recognition performance while being more computationally efficient.
