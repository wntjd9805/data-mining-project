This study explores data-free class-incremental learning (DFCIL) for recognizing hand gestures from 3D skeleton sequences. In DFCIL, new classes are incrementally added, but training samples of known classes are not accessible due to privacy concerns. Existing DFCIL methods mainly focus on knowledge distillation techniques to address catastrophic forgetting. However, this paper goes further by investigating the selection of optimal samples for model inversion. Drawing inspiration from max-margin classification theory, the study finds that the best samples are typically located near the decision boundary within a reasonable margin. To address this, the authors propose BOAT-MI, a boundary-aware prototypical sampling mechanism for model inversion in DFCIL. The effectiveness of their sampling scheme is demonstrated through experiments on two 3D skeleton gesture datasets: SHREC 2017 and EgoGesture3D. The codebase and EgoGesture3D skeleton dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/humansensinglab/dfcil-hgr.
