This paper introduces a new network called SVDFormer, which addresses two challenges in point cloud completion: understanding global shapes from incomplete point clouds and generating accurate local structures. Existing methods either rely solely on 3D coordinates or incorporate additional images to guide the estimation of missing parts. However, these approaches do not fully utilize the available cross-modal self-structures for achieving accurate and high-quality point cloud completion. To overcome this limitation, the authors propose a Self-view Fusion Network that utilizes multiple-view depth image information to observe incomplete self-shape and generate a compact global shape. Additionally, a refinement module called Self-structure Dual-generator is introduced to capture highly detailed structures. This module incorporates learned shape priors and geometric self-similarities to generate new points. By considering the incompleteness of each point, the dual-path design of the module allows for refinement strategies based on the structural type of each point. SVDFormer leverages self-structures and does not require additional paired information such as color images with precisely calibrated camera parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used benchmarks. The code for SVDFormer is available at https://github.com/czvvd/SVDFormer.
