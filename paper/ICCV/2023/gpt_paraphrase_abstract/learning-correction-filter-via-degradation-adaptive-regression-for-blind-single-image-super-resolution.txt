We introduce an unsupervised method for Blind Single Image Super-Resolution (SR) that addresses the issue of performance drops in existing deep learning SR methods when the degradation of the low-resolution input is not covered in training. Our method, called Learn-ing Correction Filter via Degradation-Adaptive Regression (DAR), enhances the performance of off-the-shelf SR methods by adapting to unknown complex degradations. Inspired by the generalized sampling theory, we estimate the degradation for each local image region using unsupervised learning via a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). Instead of assuming spatially invariant degradations, we learn correction filters to adjust the degradations in a spatially variant way using a novel linearly-assembled pixel degradation-adaptive regression module (DARM). DARM is lightweight and optimized on a dictionary of pre-defined filter bases. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method both qualitatively and quantitatively. The code for our method is available at: https://github.com/edbca/DARSR.
