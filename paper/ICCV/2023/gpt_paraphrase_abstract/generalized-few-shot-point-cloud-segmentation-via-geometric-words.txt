Current fully-supervised algorithms for segmenting point clouds struggle in dynamic testing environments where new classes emerge. Few-shot point cloud segmentation methods attempt to adapt to new classes but compromise segmentation accuracy for existing classes, making them impractical. To address this, we propose a generalized few-shot point cloud segmentation paradigm that enables models to generalize to new categories with limited support point clouds while still accurately segmenting base classes. We introduce geometric words to represent shared geometric components between base and novel classes, integrating them into a novel geometric-aware semantic representation to enhance generalization without forgetting previous knowledge. Additionally, we incorporate geometric prototypes to guide segmentation using prior geometric information. Extensive experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet consistently demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to baseline approaches.
