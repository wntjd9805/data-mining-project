We propose a new method for automatically detecting large-size corruptions in images, enabling blind restoration without prior knowledge of corruption masks. Our approach utilizes a hierarchical contrastive learning framework to identify corrupted regions based on the intrinsic semantic differences between corrupted and uncorrupted areas. The model detects corruption masks in a coarse-to-fine manner, first predicting a coarse mask using contrastive learning in a low-resolution feature space, and then refining the uncertain areas using high-resolution contrastive learning. We employ a specialized hierarchical interaction mechanism to facilitate knowledge propagation and improve modeling performance. By learning contrastive distinctions instead of semantic patterns, our model demonstrates strong generalization across different corruption patterns. Extensive experiments show that our model outperforms other methods in corruption detection and various image restoration tasks such as blind inpainting and watermark removal. Furthermore, our model exhibits robust generalization capabilities across different types of corruptions, including graffiti, random noise, and other image content.
