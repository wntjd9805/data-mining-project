We introduce the first active learning tool for precise 3D part labeling, a challenging task for advanced deep learning methods due to the complex structural variations among the parts. Annotating the training data for this task requires significant effort, prompting the need for approaches that minimize human involvement. Our labeling tool improves the predictions of a deep neural network by iteratively verifying or modifying the part labels, with continuous human feedback enhancing the network's performance. To reduce human effort effectively, we incorporate two innovative features in our tool: hierarchical and symmetry-aware active labeling. Our approach, named HAL3D, achieves nearly error-free fine-grained annotations on any test set with pre-defined hierarchical part labels, while saving 80% of the time compared to manual annotation. We will make the annotated models available to the research community.
