Commonly used 3D object detectors that rely on LiDAR often overlook important geometric information available from object proposals, leading to inaccurate confidence estimation. This is mainly due to design choices borrowed from the 2D image domain, where geometric context is usually absent. However, in the 3D domain, considering both object properties and surroundings holistically is crucial for accurately distinguishing between true and false positive detections, such as occluded pedestrians in a group. To address this issue, we introduce GACE, a straightforward and highly efficient approach to enhance confidence estimation in any given black-box 3D object detector. By aggregating geometric cues of detections and their spatial relationships, we can effectively assess their plausibility and consequently improve confidence estimation. This results in consistent performance improvements across various state-of-the-art detectors. Notably, GACE proves to be particularly advantageous for vulnerable road user classes like pedestrians and cyclists.
