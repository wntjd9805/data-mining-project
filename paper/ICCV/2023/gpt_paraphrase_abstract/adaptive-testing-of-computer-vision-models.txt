AdaVision is a novel approach to testing vision models that helps users identify and address systematic failures on specific types of data. By leveraging natural language descriptions and image retrieval techniques from LAION-5B with CLIP, AdaVision retrieves relevant images for a given coherent group. The user then labels a small set of data to assess model correctness, which is used iteratively to refine the group definition and identify high-error regions. Additionally, AdaVision utilizes GPT-3 to suggest new group descriptions for further exploration. User studies demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of AdaVision, as it successfully uncovers significant bugs in state-of-the-art classification, object detection, and image captioning models. The failure rates of user-discovered groups surpass those identified by automatic error clustering methods by 2-3 times. Furthermore, fine-tuning on examples discovered through AdaVision resolves the identified bugs without compromising in-distribution accuracy and even enhances performance on out-of-distribution datasets.
