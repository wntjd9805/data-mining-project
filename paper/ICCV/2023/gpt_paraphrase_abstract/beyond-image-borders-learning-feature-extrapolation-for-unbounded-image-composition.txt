Existing methods for improving image composition and aesthetic quality typically involve cropping out redundant content near the image borders. However, these cropping methods have limitations in terms of the range of image views. Some methods attempt to extrapolate the images and predict cropping boxes based on the extrapolated image. However, this approach can result in including synthesized extrapolated regions in the cropped image, leading to unrealistic composition and potentially degraded image quality. In this paper, we propose a joint framework called UNIC, which addresses this issue by providing both unbounded recommendation of camera view and image composition. Our framework takes the current camera preview frame as input and offers recommendations for view adjustment, including zooming in or out and camera movement, without being restricted by image borders. To improve the accuracy of view adjustment prediction, we extend the field of view through feature extrapolation. After one or multiple view adjustments, our method converges and provides both a camera view and a bounding box indicating the recommended image composition. We conduct extensive experiments on datasets constructed from existing image cropping datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our UNIC framework in unbounded recommendation of camera view and image composition.
