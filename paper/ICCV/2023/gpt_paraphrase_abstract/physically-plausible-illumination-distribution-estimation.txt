The auto-white-balance (AWB) module in cameras assumes that there is a dominant illumination in a scene and corrects the white balance based on this assumption. However, our user study revealed that non-dominant illuminations can also produce visually pleasing images and are sometimes preferred over the dominant illumination. Based on this finding, we propose a new approach to AWB that predicts a distribution of plausible illuminations for white balance correction. To support this approach, we expand the Cube++ illumination estimation dataset to include ground truth illumination distributions per image. With this new data, we train a lightweight neural network to predict the scene's illumination distribution. Our method can be applied to existing image formats by embedding the estimated distribution in the RAW image, allowing users to generate visually plausible white-balanced images.
