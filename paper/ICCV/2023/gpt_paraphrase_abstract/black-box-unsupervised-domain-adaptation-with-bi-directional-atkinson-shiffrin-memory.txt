Black-box unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is a method that learns from source predictions of target data without accessing the source data or models during training. This approach offers advantages in terms of data privacy and flexibility in selecting the target network. However, using the source predictions of target data can result in noisy labels and may lead to learning collapses. To address this issue, we propose a new mechanism called BiMem, which is a bi-directional memorization system that learns to remember useful and representative information to correct noisy labels in real-time. This leads to a more robust black-box UDA approach that can generalize across different visual recognition tasks.  BiMem consists of three types of memory: sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. These memories interact in a bi-directional manner to comprehensively and robustly memorize the learned features. The system includes a forward memorization flow that identifies and stores useful features, as well as a backward calibration flow that progressively rectifies the pseudo labels assigned to these features.  We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of BiMem in domain adaptation across various visual recognition tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. The results consistently demonstrate that BiMem achieves superior performance compared to other methods. The proposed approach effectively addresses the limitations of training with noisy pseudo labels, improving the overall performance and generalization capabilities of black-box UDA.
