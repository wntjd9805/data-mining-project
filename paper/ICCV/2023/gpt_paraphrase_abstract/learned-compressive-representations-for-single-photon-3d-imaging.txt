Single-photon 3D cameras capture the time-of-arrival of billions of photons per second with high accuracy. To summarize the photon data, a common approach is to create a per-pixel timestamp histogram, which represents distances along the time axis in a 3D histogram tensor. However, as the resolution of the histogram tensor increases, the memory requirements and output data rates can become impractical. To address this issue, we propose a linear compressive representation of histogram tensors that can be efficiently computed as a matrix operation in real-time. We develop lightweight compressive representations that can be implemented within individual pixels and capture the spatio-temporal information of each timestamp. Additionally, we integrate our proposed framework as the first layer of a neural network, allowing for the joint optimization of compressive representations and downstream data processing. Our findings show that a well-designed compressive representation can significantly reduce in-sensor memory and data rates by up to two orders of magnitude without compromising the quality of 3D imaging. Furthermore, we analyze the power consumption implications of implementing our approach on a chip.
