The prediction of driver attention is a crucial aspect of autonomous driving and assisted driving systems. Skilled drivers can anticipate potential dangers based on their driving experience and quickly focus their attention on the relevant areas. However, modeling the subjective driving experience is challenging, leading to a lack of methods that simulate the driver experience accumulation process. Existing approaches rely on saliency prediction techniques to predict driver attention. In this study, we propose a Feed-Back Loop Network (FBLNet) that aims to model the accumulation of driving experience. Through iterative processes, FBLNet generates incremental knowledge that captures historically-accumulative and long-term temporal information, resembling human driving experience. Guided by this incremental knowledge, our model combines CNN and Transformer features extracted from input images to predict driver attention. Our model outperforms existing methods, demonstrating significant improvements on two driver attention benchmark datasets.
