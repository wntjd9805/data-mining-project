Manipulating deformable objects like ropes and fabrics is a challenging task with various applications. The complexity arises from the objects' diverse configurations, dynamic states, and high-dimensional action space. Additionally, these manipulation tasks often require multiple steps, and relying on greedy policies can result in suboptimal outcomes. Previous research has used reinforcement learning or expert demonstrations to address this problem, but they have limitations in modeling complex states or requiring hand-crafted policies. In this study, we focus on deformable object manipulation using dense visual affordance, which allows for generalization across different states. We propose a novel approach called foresightful dense affordance, which estimates the long-term manipulation value of states to avoid local optima. To learn this representation, we introduce a framework that incorporates multi-stage stable learning and efficient self-supervised data collection without expert assistance. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed foresightful dense affordance.
