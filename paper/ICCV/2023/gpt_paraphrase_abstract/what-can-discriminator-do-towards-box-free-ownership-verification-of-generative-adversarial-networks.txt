In recent years, there has been significant progress in image synthesis using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and its variants. However, the success of well-trained GANs is threatened by the possibility of illegal theft or leakage. Previous studies on remote ownership verification have focused on a black-box approach, where the defender can query the suspicious model using specific inputs. However, we argue that this approach is insufficient for generation tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new IP protection scheme for GANs that allows ownership verification based solely on the examination of outputs, without the need to select specific inputs (referred to as the box-free setting). Our approach leverages the untapped potential of the discriminator in learning a hypersphere that captures the distinct distribution learned by the paired generator. Through extensive evaluations on popular GAN tasks and various GAN architectures, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme effectively verifies ownership. Furthermore, our scheme proves to be resilient against common input-based removal attacks and other existing attacks.
