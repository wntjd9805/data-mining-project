We propose PHRIT, a new method for creating parametric hand meshes using an implicit template. This approach combines the benefits of both parametric meshes and implicit representations. Our technique represents deformable hand shapes using signed distance fields (SDFs) with part-based shape priors. We use a deformation field to manipulate the shape. By deforming the canonical template at infinite resolution, our model enables efficient and high-quality hand reconstruction. Furthermore, it is fully differentiable and can be easily utilized in hand modeling through skeleton and shape latent codes. We assess the effectiveness of PHRIT in various tasks, such as skeleton-driven hand reconstruction, generating shapes from point clouds, and single-view 3D reconstruction. Our results demonstrate that our approach achieves realistic and immersive hand modeling with outstanding performance.
