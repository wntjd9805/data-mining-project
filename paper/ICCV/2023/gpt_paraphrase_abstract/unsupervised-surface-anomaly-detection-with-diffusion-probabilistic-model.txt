Unsupervised surface anomaly detection aims to identify and locate abnormal patterns using training samples that are free of anomalies. Reconstruction-based models have been widely used for this purpose, as they assume that anomaly regions are harder to reconstruct. However, there are three main challenges in applying this approach: 1) the need to improve the quality of reconstruction, particularly for images with structural changes; 2) the observation that anomalies can also be well reconstructed by many neural networks, which contradicts the underlying assumption; and 3) the fact that a test instance may correspond to multiple normal patterns, but most current reconstruction-based methods overlook this crucial aspect. In this study, we introduce DiffAD, a novel method for unsupervised anomaly detection based on the latent diffusion model. We draw inspiration from the model's ability to generate diverse and high-quality images. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose the use of noisy condition embedding and interpolated channels within the general reconstruction-based pipeline. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging MVTec dataset, especially in terms of localization accuracy.
