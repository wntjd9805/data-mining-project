Current forecasting systems rely on memory-based methods to mimic human forecasting ability. However, these methods have limitations in modeling historical dependence and cannot predict future events. This paper introduces a new paradigm called memory-anticipation-based approach, which aims to model the entire temporal structure including the past, present, and future. The proposed approach, called Memory-and-Anticipation Transformer (MAT), addresses online action detection and anticipation tasks in a unified manner. The MAT model is evaluated on four benchmarks and outperforms existing methods. The code for MAT is available at https://github.com/Echo0125/Memory-and-Anticipation-Transformer.
