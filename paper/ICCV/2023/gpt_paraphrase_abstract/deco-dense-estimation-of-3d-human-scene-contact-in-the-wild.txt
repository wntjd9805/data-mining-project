Understanding how humans interact with the world through physical contact is crucial for developing human-centric artificial intelligence. Existing methods for inferring 3D contact focus on limited aspects, such as 2D contact, body joints instead of the surface, coarse body regions, or lack generalization to real-world images. In contrast, our approach aims to infer dense, 3D contact between the full body surface and objects in any image. To achieve this, we introduce the DAMON dataset, which contains detailed vertex-level contact annotations paired with RGB images depicting complex human-object and human-scene interactions. We then train DECO, a novel 3D contact detector that utilizes both body-part-driven and scene-context-driven attention to estimate vertex-level contact on the SMPL body model. DECO incorporates the understanding that human observers identify contact by considering the contacting body parts, their proximity to scene objects, and the surrounding scene context. We extensively evaluate our detector on the DAMON, RICH, and BEHAVE datasets, and our results surpass those of existing state-of-the-art methods on all benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate the generalization capability of DECO to diverse and challenging real-world human interactions in natural images. The code, data, and models for DECO are publicly available at https://deco.is.tue.mpg.de.
