We introduce GeoUDF, a novel learning-based approach for reconstructing discrete surfaces from sparse point clouds. Our method utilizes geometry-guided learning to estimate the unsigned distance function (UDF) and its gradient. By formulating the UDF as an affine averaging of distances to tangent planes of neighboring points, we accurately reconstruct the surface. Additionally, we model the local geometric structure of the input point clouds by learning a quadratic polynomial for each point. This aids in upsampling the sparse point cloud and generates unoriented normals, enhancing UDF estimation. To extract triangle meshes from the predicted UDF, we propose a customized edge-based marching cube module. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of reconstruction accuracy, efficiency, and generality.
