The abstract discusses the limitations of previous studies on underexposure correction in images captured with irregular exposures. It introduces a novel correction algorithm called Luminance-Aware Color Transform (LACT) that addresses these limitations. The algorithm uses a luminance comparison module to determine the relative exposure condition between images and then encodes a set of transformation functions based on the luminance features. These functions enable complex color transformations for both overexposure and underexposure images. The transformed representation is projected onto the RGB color space to produce exposure correction results. Extensive experiments show that LACT outperforms existing methods on multiple exposure datasets. The code for LACT is available on GitHub.
