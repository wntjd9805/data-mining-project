We introduce ExBluRF, a new technique for synthesizing clear images from extremely motion blurred images using efficient radiance fields optimization. Our method includes two main components: a motion blur formulation based on a 6-DOF camera trajectory and voxel-based radiance fields. To enhance the sharpness of the radiance fields, we optimize them by simultaneously estimating the camera trajectories that produce the blurry images. During training, we accumulate multiple rays along the camera trajectory to reconstruct a single blurry color, simulating the physical motion blur operation. By minimizing the photo-consistency loss in the blurred image space, we obtain sharp radiance fields along with camera trajectories that explain the blur in all images. Previous approaches required significant computation and resources proportional to the blur size for joint optimization in the blurred image space. However, our method addresses this issue by replacing the MLP-based framework with low-dimensional 6-DOF camera poses and voxel-based radiance fields. Compared to existing methods, our approach achieves much sharper 3D scenes from challenging motion blurred views, while reducing training time and GPU memory consumption by approximately 10 times.
