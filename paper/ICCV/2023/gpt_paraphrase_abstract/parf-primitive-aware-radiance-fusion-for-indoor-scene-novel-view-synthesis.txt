This paper presents a method for rapidly reconstructing the radiance field of a scene, while also achieving excellent performance in novel view synthesis and offering convenient scene editing capabilities. The proposed approach utilizes semantic parsing and primitive extraction to effectively constrain and accelerate the process of reconstructing the radiance field. To achieve this objective, a hybrid rendering strategy that combines the advantages of both volumetric and primitive rendering is proposed. Additionally, a reconstruction pipeline is introduced, which iteratively conducts primitive parsing and radiance field learning for each input frame, effectively integrating semantic, primitive, and radiance information into a unified framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the fast reconstruction capability, high rendering quality, and user-friendly editing functionality of the proposed method.
