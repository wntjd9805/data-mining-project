To effectively predict the future trajectories of agents in complex traffic scenes, it is crucial to have reliable and efficient prediction methods that encompass all agents in the scene. However, existing approaches either suffer from inefficiency or compromise accuracy. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new method called ADAPT, which utilizes dynamic weight learning to jointly predict the trajectories of all agents in the scene. Our approach surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods in both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios, as demonstrated on the Argoverse and Interaction datasets, while requiring significantly less computational resources. We attribute our improved performance to two key factors: firstly, the adaptive head that enhances the model's capacity without increasing its size; secondly, our carefully chosen design principles in endpoint-conditioned prediction, supported by gradient stopping. Our analyses reveal that ADAPT effectively focuses on each agent through adaptive prediction, resulting in accurate and efficient trajectory predictions.
