The role of temporal modeling in understanding video content is crucial. Previous studies have addressed this issue by constructing complex temporal relations using powerful computational devices. However, in this research, we investigate the potential of utilizing simple arithmetic operations for temporal modeling. We begin by computing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between pairs of extracted frame features to capture auxiliary temporal cues. Subsequently, we extract relevant features from these cues to enhance the original temporal-irrespective domain. We refer to this straightforward approach as an Arithmetic Temporal Module (ATM), which can be seamlessly integrated into a visual backbone using a plug-and-play style. Through comprehensive experimentation, we analyze the various implementations of ATMs and demonstrate that this module offers effective temporal modeling capabilities at a low computational cost. Furthermore, the ATM is compatible with both CNNs- and ViTs-based architectures. Our results indicate that the ATM outperforms several popular video benchmarks. For instance, on Something-Something V1, V2, and Kinetics-400 datasets, we achieve top-1 accuracies of 65.6%, 74.6%, and 89.4%, respectively.
