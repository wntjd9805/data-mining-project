Recent advancements in neural reconstruction using posed image sequences have made remarkable strides. However, existing volumetric-based techniques face challenges in producing high-quality 3D geometry due to the lack of depth information. These techniques simply duplicate 2D image features along the camera ray, introducing noise in empty and occluded spaces. To address this issue, we propose CVRecon, an end-to-end 3D neural reconstruction framework inspired by traditional multi-view stereo methods. Our framework leverages the rich geometric embedding in the cost volumes to facilitate 3D geometric feature learning. Additionally, we introduce RCCV, a novel 3D geometric feature representation that encodes view-dependent information with improved integrity and robustness. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances the reconstruction quality in various metrics and accurately captures fine details of the 3D geometries. Furthermore, our extensive ablation studies provide valuable insights into the development of effective 3D geometric feature learning schemes.
