The deep learning paradigm has become a popular tool for image denoising due to its significant performance improvements. However, existing approaches often struggle to generalize to unseen types of noise or general and real noise. This is because these models are designed to learn paired mapping from a noisy image to its clean version. In this study, we propose a different approach where we aim to disentangle the noisy image by assuming that different corrupted versions of the same clean image have a common latent space. We introduce a self-supervised learning framework called Multi-view Self-supervised Disentanglement (MeD) that achieves this goal without relying on the latent clean image. By using two different corrupted versions of the same image as input, MeD learns to separate the latent clean features from the corruptions and thereby recovers the clean image. Extensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real noise demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method over previous self-supervised approaches, particularly on unseen novel noise types. In fact, on real noise, our method even outperforms supervised counterparts by more than 3 dB.
