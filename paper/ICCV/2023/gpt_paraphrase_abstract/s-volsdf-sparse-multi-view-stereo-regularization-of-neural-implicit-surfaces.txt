Neural rendering of implicit surfaces is effective in 3D vision applications but requires dense input views for supervision. When only sparse input images are available, the quality of the output decreases due to the shape-radiance ambiguity problem. However, this ambiguity can be constrained by utilizing multiple views of a 3D point, as seen in multi-view stereo (MVS). To address this, we propose regularizing the neural rendering optimization using an MVS solution. By incorporating an MVS probability volume and a generalized cross entropy loss, our approach enables a noise-tolerant optimization process. Moreover, the neural rendering provides global consistency constraints that enhance the MVS depth hypothesis sampling and consequently improve MVS performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses generic neural rendering models and significantly enhances the reconstruction quality of MVS models, even with just three sparse input views.
