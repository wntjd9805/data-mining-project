Deep learning has greatly improved medical image segmentation methods. However, current approaches are not effective at adapting and updating trained models when new segmentation classes need to be added. In clinical settings, it is often preferred to extend segmentation models to include new organs or tumors without accessing previous training data due to privacy concerns. This is known as a continual semantic segmentation (CSS) problem, which has not been well-studied for multi-organ segmentation. In this study, we propose a new CSS learning framework that uses a single deep segmentation model to segment a total of 143 whole-body organs. We demonstrate that by using an encoder/decoder network structure, a continually trained encoder combined with incrementally-added decoders can effectively segment new classes without forgetting previously learned information. To maintain model complexity, we prune each decoder using neural architecture search and knowledge distillation. Additionally, we propose an output merging module that takes into account the presence of healthy and pathological organs in different datasets. Our single network model achieves high accuracy in segmenting all 143 organs, approaching the performance of training separate models for each dataset. This research was conducted on 3D CT scans of over 2500 patients from four datasets.
