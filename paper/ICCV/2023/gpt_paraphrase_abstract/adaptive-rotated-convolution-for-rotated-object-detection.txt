The aim of rotated object detection is to identify and locate objects in images regardless of their orientation. However, the varying orientations of objects across different images and within a single image pose a challenge for standard backbone networks to extract accurate features. To address this issue, we introduce the Adaptive Rotated Convolution (ARC) module. The ARC module utilizes adaptable convolution kernels that rotate to extract object features with different orientations in different images. Additionally, an efficient conditional computation mechanism is implemented to handle the large variations in object orientation within an image. These two designs work together seamlessly to improve rotated object detection. Furthermore, the ARC module can be easily incorporated into various vision backbones, enhancing their ability to accurately detect oriented objects. Experimental results on widely used benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ARC module, achieving significant performance improvements for popular oriented object detectors. When combined with the Oriented R-CNN method, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DOTA dataset with a mean average precision (mAP) of 81.77%.
