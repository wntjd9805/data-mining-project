The recent advancement in weakly supervised object detection involves combining multiple instance detection networks (MIDN) with ordinal online refinement. However, due to the use of only image-level annotation, MIDN tends to assign high scores to unexpected region proposals when generating pseudo labels. These inaccurate proposals adversely affect the training of subsequent refinement modules and hinder detection performance. This study aims to improve the quality of pseudo-labeling in MIDN. To achieve this, a novel weakly supervised object detection pipeline called Cyclic-Bootstrap Labeling (CBL) is proposed. CBL optimizes MIDN using rank information obtained from a reliable teacher network. The teacher network is created by employing a weighted exponential moving average strategy to leverage various refinement modules. A class-specific ranking distillation algorithm is introduced to use the output of the weighted ensembled teacher network for distilling MIDN with rank information. Consequently, MIDN is guided to assign higher scores to accurate proposals compared to their neighboring ones, thereby improving pseudo-labeling. Extensive experiments conducted on widely used datasets, namely PASCAL VOC 2007 & 2012 and COCO, demonstrate the superior performance of the CBL framework. The code for the framework will be made available at https://github.com/Yinyf0804/WSOD-CBL/.
