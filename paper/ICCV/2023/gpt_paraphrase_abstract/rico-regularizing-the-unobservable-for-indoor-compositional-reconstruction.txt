In recent years, neural implicit surfaces have gained popularity for multi-view reconstruction. However, when it comes to practical applications such as scene editing and manipulation, some researchers have expanded on this framework by incorporating semantic masks to enable object-compositional reconstruction instead of a holistic perspective. While this approach achieves plausible disentanglement, its performance suffers when applied to indoor scenes where objects are often only partially observed. To address this limitation, we propose a method called RICO that regularizes the unobservable regions for indoor compositional reconstruction. Our main concept involves first regularizing the smoothness of the occluded background, which then guides the reconstruction of foreground objects in these unobservable regions based on their relationship with the background. Specifically, we focus on regularizing the geometric smoothness of occluded background patches. By improving the background surface, we can optimize the signed distance function and the depth of objects rendered in reverse to ensure they remain within the range of the background. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other approaches on both synthetic and real-world indoor scenes, proving the effectiveness of our proposed regularizations.
