We have created a new dataset called the 4D temporal exposure dataset to address the limitations of current autoexposure (AE) algorithms in challenging lighting environments. These algorithms struggle in situations with bright light sources or sudden changes in lighting. The lack of suitable image datasets has hindered the development of new AE algorithms for such environments. Our dataset provides a wide range of exposure values (shutter speed range from 1,500 to 15 seconds) over a temporal sequence, including moving objects, bright lights, and varying lighting conditions. We have also developed a software platform that allows AE algorithms to be easily tested with the dataset. This dataset and platform enable the evaluation of different AE algorithms and serve as a starting point for the development of improved AE methods. We have evaluated several existing AE strategies using our dataset and found that most users prefer a simple saliency method for challenging lighting conditions.
