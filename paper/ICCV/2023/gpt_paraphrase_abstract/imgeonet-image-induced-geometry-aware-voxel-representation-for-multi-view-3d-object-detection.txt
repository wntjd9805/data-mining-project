We introduce ImGeoNet, a framework for 3D object detection using multi-view images. Unlike previous methods, ImGeoNet considers the geometry of the 3D space by using an image-induced voxel representation. By learning to induce geometry from multi-view images, ImGeoNet reduces confusion caused by voxels of free space. During inference, only images from multiple views are required. Additionally, ImGeoNet leverages a pre-trained 2D feature extractor, leading to improved performance. To evaluate ImGeoNet, we conduct experiments on three indoor datasets and demonstrate its superior detection accuracy compared to the current state-of-the-art method, ImVoxelNet. ImGeoNet also achieves comparable results to ImVoxelNet with fewer views, showcasing its data efficiency. Furthermore, our proposed representation allows image-based methods to outperform point cloud-based methods in scenarios with sparse and noisy point clouds, as well as scenarios involving diverse object classes, particularly small objects. The visualization of ImGeoNet shows its ability to preserve geometric structure while reducing the number of voxels in free space. The detection results are presented using color-coded bounding cubes based on predicted categories. The project page for ImGeoNet can be found at https://ttaoretw.github.io/imgeonet.
