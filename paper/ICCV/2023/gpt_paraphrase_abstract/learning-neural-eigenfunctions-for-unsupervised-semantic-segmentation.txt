Unsupervised semantic segmentation is a significant challenge in computer vision. Spectral clustering has been proposed as a solution, where spectral embeddings are computed to create distinct clusters. However, current approaches face issues with spectral decomposition efficiency and inflexibility in applying them to test data. This study addresses these problems by introducing a parametric approach that uses neural network-based eigenfunctions to generate spectral embeddings. The neural eigenfunctions produce discrete vectors that directly indicate clustering assignments, resulting in an end-to-end neural network-based paradigm for spectral clustering. The neural eigenfunctions are lightweight and use features from pre-trained models, making training more efficient and utilizing the potential of pre-trained models for dense prediction. Extensive empirical studies validate the effectiveness of this approach, showing significant performance improvements compared to competitive baselines on various benchmarks. The code for this approach is available at https://github.com/thudzj/NeuralEigenfunctionSegmentor.
