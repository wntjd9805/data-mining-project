We introduce a new method for optimizing camera paths in online video stabilization. While previous approaches have focused primarily on motion estimation, our framework emphasizes path optimization, particularly in the online setting where future frames are unknown. We utilize high-quality deep motion models for motion estimation and concentrate on the latter two steps of the stabilization pipeline: path smoothing and novel view rendering. Our network takes a 2D camera path as input and generates a stabilizing warp field for the last frame, aligning it with the desired stabilized position. We employ a hybrid loss function to ensure spatial and temporal consistency. Additionally, we create a motion dataset containing stable and unstable motion pairs for training purposes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art online methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, achieving results comparable to offline methods.
