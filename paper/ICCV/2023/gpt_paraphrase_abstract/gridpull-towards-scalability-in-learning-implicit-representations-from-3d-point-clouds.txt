We propose GridPull, a method to improve the efficiency of learning implicit representations from large-scale point clouds for surface reconstruction. Unlike previous methods that infer distance or occupancy fields using neural networks, our approach uses a discrete distance field defined on grids without any neural components. To ensure continuity in the field, we introduce a loss function that encourages continuous distances and consistent gradients during pulling queries onto the surface. We employ uniform grids for fast grid search and organize surface points in a tree structure to speed up distance calculations. Our method does not rely on learning priors or normal supervision during optimization. We outperform the latest methods in terms of complexity and accuracy, as demonstrated through evaluations on shape and scene benchmarks. The code for our method is publicly available at https://github.com/chenchao15/GridPull.
