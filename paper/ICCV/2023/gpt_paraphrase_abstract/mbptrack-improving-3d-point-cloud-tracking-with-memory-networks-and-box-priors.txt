MBPTrack is a novel approach to 3D single object tracking that addresses the challenges posed by occlusion and size differences among tracked targets. It utilizes a Memory mechanism and a coarse-to-fine localization scheme using Box Priors from the first frame. The past frames with targetness masks serve as an external memory, and a transformer-based module propagates tracked target cues to the current frame. The proposed method accurately localizes objects of all sizes by first predicting the target center using Hough voting. Reference points are then adaptively sampled around the target center based on box priors from the first frame, covering targets of different sizes. Dense feature maps are obtained by aggregating point features into the reference points, enabling more effective localization. Extensive experiments on KITTI, nuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that MBPTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, while running at a high frame rate of 50 FPS on a single RTX3090 GPU.
