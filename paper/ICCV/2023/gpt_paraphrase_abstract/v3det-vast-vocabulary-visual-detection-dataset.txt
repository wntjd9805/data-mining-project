Recent advancements in detecting objects in the real world have primarily relied on object detection datasets with limited vocabulary. In order to facilitate the development of more comprehensive visual object detection systems, we introduce V3Det, a visual detection dataset with a vast vocabulary and precisely annotated bounding boxes on a large scale. V3Det possesses several attractive features: 1) Vast Vocabulary: It encompasses bounding boxes of objects belonging to 13,204 categories in real-world images, which is ten times larger than existing datasets like LVIS that focus on large vocabulary object detection. 2) Hierarchical Category Organization: The extensive vocabulary in V3Det is organized using a hierarchical category tree that captures the inclusion relationships among categories. This encourages the exploration of category relationships in the context of vast and open vocabulary object detection. 3) Rich Annotations: V3Det consists of precisely annotated objects in 243k images, accompanied by professional descriptions of each category provided by human experts as well as a powerful chatbot. This combination of detailed annotations enables a wide exploration space for benchmarking vast and open vocabulary object detection, which in turn leads to new insights, practices, and observations for future research. V3Det has the potential to serve as a foundational dataset for the development of more inclusive visual perception systems. It can be accessed at https://v3det.openxlab.org.cn/.
