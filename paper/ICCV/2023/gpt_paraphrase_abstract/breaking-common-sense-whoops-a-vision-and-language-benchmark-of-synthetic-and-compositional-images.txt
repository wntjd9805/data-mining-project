Strange, uncommon, and eerie images capture the interest of observers because they defy common sense. For instance, a picture released during the 2022 world cup portrays the renowned soccer stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo playing chess, which playfully contradicts our expectation that their competition should take place on the football field. While humans can easily recognize and interpret these unconventional images, the capability of AI models to do the same is questioned. In this study, we present WHOOPS!, a novel dataset and benchmark for visual common sense. The dataset comprises intentionally nonsensical images created by designers using publicly available image generation tools like Midjourney. We explore various tasks using this dataset, including image captioning, cross-modal matching, visual question answering, and a challenging explanation generation task where models must identify and elucidate why a given image is unusual. Our findings reveal that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT3 and BLIP2 still fall behind human performance on WHOOPS!. We believe that our dataset will serve as inspiration for the advancement of AI models possessing enhanced visual common sense reasoning abilities.
