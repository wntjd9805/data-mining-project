This study explores a two-stage framework for generating high-resolution images using vector-quantized image modeling. The goal is to improve efficiency and reconstruction quality. Firstly, a local attention-based quantization model is employed instead of the global attention mechanism used in previous methods, leading to better efficiency and reconstruction quality. Secondly, an efficient attention mechanism is introduced that combines global attention and local attention, resulting in faster generation speed, higher generation fidelity, and improved resolution. Finally, a new generation pipeline incorporating autoencoding training and autoregressive generation strategy is proposed, demonstrating a better paradigm for image synthesis. Extensive experiments show the superiority of this approach in high-quality and high-resolution image reconstruction and generation.
