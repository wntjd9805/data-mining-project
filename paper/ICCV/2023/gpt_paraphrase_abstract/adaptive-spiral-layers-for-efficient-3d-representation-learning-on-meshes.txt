The success of deep learning models on structured data has sparked interest in applying them to non-Euclidean domains. In this study, we present a new intrinsic operator that is well-suited for learning representations on 3D meshes. Our operator is designed to adapt to the irregular structure of the underlying graph and effectively utilize long-range dependencies, while also being computationally efficient and easy to optimize. Inspired by Spiral Convolution, which orders and transforms vertices in a 3D mesh using a local spiral pattern, we propose a flexible operator that adjusts the length of the spiral trajectory and the transformation parameters for each vertex and mesh. We utilize polyadic decomposition to factorize the dense weight tensor into lighter linear layers that process features and vertex information separately, reducing computational complexity without introducing strong biases. We leverage dynamic gating to achieve spatial adaptivity and enable global reasoning with constant time complexity, benefiting from an efficient dynamic pooling mechanism based on Summed-Area-Tables. When used in existing architectures for shape correspondence, our operator significantly improves the trade-off between performance and efficiency. In 3D shape generation with morphable models, it achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring three times fewer parameters.
