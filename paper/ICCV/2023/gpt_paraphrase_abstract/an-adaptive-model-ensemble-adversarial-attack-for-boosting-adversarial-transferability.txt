While adversarial examples can be transferred across different models, existing methods for transfer-based adversarial attacks are limited in their ability to transfer across models with wide differences. Model ensemble attacks have been proposed as a solution, where outputs from surrogate models with diverse architectures are fused to create an ensemble loss. However, these attacks do not effectively capture and amplify the intrinsic transfer information of adversarial examples. In this paper, we introduce an adaptive ensemble attack called AdaEA, which dynamically controls the fusion of outputs from each model based on their contribution to the adversarial objective. We also introduce a disparity-reduced filter to synchronize the update direction. Experimental results show that AdaEA outperforms existing ensemble attacks on various datasets and can enhance existing transfer-based attacks, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.
