We introduce SegGPT, a versatile model designed to segment various objects within their respective contexts. By consolidating different segmentation tasks into a single in-context learning framework, we are able to handle diverse types of segmentation data by converting them into image format. The training of SegGPT involves treating it as a coloring problem, where each data sample is randomly assigned colors. The aim is to successfully accomplish different segmentation tasks based on context rather than relying on specific colors. Once trained, SegGPT can perform a wide range of segmentation tasks in both images and videos by utilizing in-context inference. These tasks include segmenting object instances, stuff, parts, contours, and text. We evaluate SegGPT on multiple tasks, including few-shot semantic segmentation, video object segmentation, semantic segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. Our results demonstrate that SegGPT possesses strong capabilities in segmenting targets within and outside of its training domain, as confirmed through qualitative and quantitative assessments.
