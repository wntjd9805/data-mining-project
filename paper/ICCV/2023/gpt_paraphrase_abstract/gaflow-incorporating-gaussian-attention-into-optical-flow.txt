This paper focuses on the problem of optical flow estimation, which involves determining motion fields from sequences of images. Existing approaches in computer vision have not fully explored the need for local discrimination and smoothness in optical flow. To address this, the authors introduce GaussianAttention (GA) into optical flow models. They propose a Gaussian-Constrained Layer (GCL) that highlights the local neighborhood containing fine-grained structural information, and a Gaussian-Guided Attention Module (GGAM) that emphasizes contextually related regions during matching. The resulting model, GAFlow, incorporates these novel Gaussian-based modules into the conventional optical flow framework. Experimental results on standard optical flow datasets demonstrate the exceptional performance of the proposed approach in terms of generalization ability and online benchmark testing. The code for GAFlow is available at https://github.com/LA30/GAFlow.
