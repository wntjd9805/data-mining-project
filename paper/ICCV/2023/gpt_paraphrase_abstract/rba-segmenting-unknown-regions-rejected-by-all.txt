Traditional semantic segmentation models have been successful in identifying objects from fixed categories, but they struggle to recognize unknown objects from novel categories. Existing outlier detection methods lack smoothness and objectness in their predictions, as they rely on per-pixel classification. Additionally, training these methods to detect outliers negatively impacts the performance of known classes. This paper introduces a new approach that utilizes region-level classification to better segment unknown objects. The authors observe that object queries in mask classification act like one vs. all classifiers. Based on this observation, they propose a novel outlier scoring function called RbA, which defines an outlier as an object rejected by all known classes. The authors conduct extensive experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of mask classification in improving outlier detection, with the best results achieved using the proposed RbA scoring function. They also propose an objective to optimize RbA with minimal outlier supervision. Fine-tuning with outliers further enhances the performance on unknown objects without degrading the performance on known objects.
