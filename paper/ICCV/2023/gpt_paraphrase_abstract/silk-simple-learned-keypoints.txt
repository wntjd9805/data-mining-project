Keypoint detection and descriptors are essential technologies in computer vision applications such as image matching, 3D reconstruction, and visual odometry. Traditional methods like Harris corners, SIFT, and HOG descriptors have been used for many years. However, recent approaches have incorporated machine learning to improve keypoint detectors. The problem is that the results of these learning-based methods are difficult to interpret due to the wide range of experimental setups and design choices used in different studies. This raises the question of what defines a good learned keypoint detector. In this study, we analyze existing keypoint detectors and break down their methodologies to identify the key components. We then redesign each component based on fundamental principles to propose Simple Learned Keypoints (SiLK), a fully-differentiable, lightweight, and flexible keypoint detector. Despite its simplicity, SiLK achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks such as Detection Repeatability, Homography Estimation, 3D Point-Cloud Registration, and camera pose estimation in the 2022 Image Matching Challenge and ScanNet.
