DREAMWALKER is a proposed AI agent designed for the VLN-CE task, which involves navigating a complex environment to reach a specific location based on language instructions. The agent aims to overcome the challenges posed by the vast number of possible strategies by utilizing a world model. This model summarizes the visual, topological, and dynamic properties of the environment into a structured representation. By simulating and evaluating potential plans within this internal abstract world, DREAMWALKER can make strategic decisions without the need for immediate actions in the real world. This approach differs from existing model-free agents that often make short-sighted decisions. Additionally, DREAMWALKER's imagined future scenarios reflect its intentions, leading to a more transparent decision-making process. Extensive experiments and studies on the VLN-CE dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach and provide valuable insights for future research.
