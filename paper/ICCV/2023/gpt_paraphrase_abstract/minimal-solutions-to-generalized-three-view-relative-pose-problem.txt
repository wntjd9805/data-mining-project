This study focuses on the minimal problems for three views with four points and three views of six lines in a generalized camera model. Despite previous efforts from the computer vision community, efficient solvers for these problems have not yet been explored and solved. The paper introduces the formulations for these minimal problems and demonstrates the effectiveness of using state-of-the-art GPU implementations of Homotopy Continuation solver. The proposed methods are evaluated using synthetic and real datasets, showing that they are both fast and accurate. Furthermore, when applied in a hypothesis and test setting, these methods improve the estimations of structure from motion.
