We introduce MeMOTR, a novel approach for Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) that effectively captures temporal information of targets. Unlike existing methods, which primarily focus on object features between adjacent frames, MeMOTR incorporates long-term memory injection using a customized memory-attention layer. This enhances the stability and distinguishability of object track embeddings, significantly improving target association ability. In experiments on DanceTrack, MeMOTR outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 7.9% and 13.0% on HOTA and AssA metrics, respectively. It also surpasses other Transformer-based methods on MOT17 and demonstrates strong generalization on BDD100K. The code is available at https://github.com/MCG-NJU/MeMOTR.
