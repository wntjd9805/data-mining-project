We introduce NEMTO, a novel neural rendering pipeline for accurately modeling 3D transparent objects with complex geometry and unknown indices of refraction. Existing appearance modeling techniques like the Disney BSDF model fall short in addressing this challenging problem due to the intricate light paths bending through refractions and the strong dependence of surface appearance on illumination. By using 2D images of the transparent object as input, our approach enables the synthesis of high-quality novel views and re-lighting. We employ implicit Signed Distance Functions (SDF) to represent the object's geometry and propose a ray bending network that is aware of refraction to capture the effects of light bending within the object. Our ray bending network is more tolerant to geometric inaccuracies compared to traditional physically-based rendering methods for transparent objects. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superior quality of our synthesis and the practicality of our approach.
