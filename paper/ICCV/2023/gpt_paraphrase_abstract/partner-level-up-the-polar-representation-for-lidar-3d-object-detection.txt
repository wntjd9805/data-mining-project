In recent years, there has been interest in using polar-based representation for perceptual tasks. Compared to Cartesian-based approaches, polar grids have been recognized as a viable alternative due to their robust performance across different resolutions and superiority in streaming-based approaches. However, current polar-based detection methods suffer from feature distortion issues caused by the uneven division of polar representation. This leads to a significant performance gap compared to Cartesian-based approaches. To address this problem, we propose PARTNER, a novel 3D object detector that operates in the polar coordinate system. PARTNER resolves the feature distortion dilemma by realigning global representations and improves regression by incorporating instance-level geometric information into the detection process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method offers significant advantages in streaming-based detection and performs well across different resolutions. Moreover, our approach outperforms previous polar-based methods by large margins (3.68% and 9.15% on the Waymo and ONCE validation sets, respectively), achieving competitive results compared to state-of-the-art techniques.
