Most existing semantic segmentation methods are designed for day-time scenes and struggle to perform well in night-time scenes due to challenging lighting conditions. This paper proposes a new approach called disentangle then parse (DTP) to address this challenge. DTP separates night-time images into two components: light-invariant reflectance and light-specific illumination. The reflectance component is extracted using a Semantic-Oriented Disentanglement (SOD) framework, allowing the network to consistently recognize semantics under varying and complicated lighting conditions. The illumination component is used as a cue for semantically confused regions and is aggregated using an Illumination-Aware Parser (IAParser) to improve prediction accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in night-time segmentation tasks. Additionally, DTP can be easily integrated into existing day-time methods with minimal additional parameters. The code and dataset for DTP are available at https://github.com/w1oves/DTP.git.
