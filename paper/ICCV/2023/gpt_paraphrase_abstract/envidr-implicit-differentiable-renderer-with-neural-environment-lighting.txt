Neural rendering has made significant progress in reconstructing scenes from multiple images. However, accurately representing objects with glossy surfaces remains difficult for current methods. This study introduces ENVIDR, a framework for high-quality rendering and reconstruction of surfaces with challenging specular reflections. The researchers propose a new neural renderer that learns the interaction between surface and environment lighting. This renderer is trained using existing physically based renderers and is separate from actual scene representations. They also propose a neural surface model based on signed distance fields (SDF) that utilizes the learned neural renderer to represent general scenes. The model can synthesize indirect illuminations caused by inter-reflections from shiny surfaces by tracing surface-reflected rays. The authors demonstrate that their method outperforms existing techniques in rendering challenging scenes with specular reflections. Additionally, their approach allows for material editing and scene relighting.
