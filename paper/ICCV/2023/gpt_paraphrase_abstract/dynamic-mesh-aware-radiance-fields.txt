This paper explores the integration of polygonal mesh assets with photorealistic Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) volumes in the traditional graphics pipeline. It proposes a two-way coupling between mesh and NeRF during rendering and simulation. The paper discusses the light transport equations for both mesh and NeRF and develops an efficient algorithm for updating radiance and throughput along a ray with multiple bounces. To address the discrepancy between the linear color space assumed by the path tracer and the sRGB color space used by standard NeRF, the paper trains NeRF with High Dynamic Range (HDR) images. It also presents a method for estimating light sources and casting shadows on the NeRF. Furthermore, the paper considers the integration of the hybrid surface-volumetric formulation with a high-performance physics simulator that supports cloth, rigid, and soft bodies. The proposed rendering and simulation system can be executed on a GPU in real-time. The paper demonstrates that the hybrid system approach outperforms alternatives in terms of visual realism for mesh insertion. This is achieved by enabling realistic light transport from volumetric NeRF media onto surfaces, thereby influencing the appearance of reflective/refractive surfaces and the illumination of diffuse surfaces based on the dynamic scene.
