Current offboard 3D detectors typically use a modular pipeline design to process sequential point clouds. However, the full potential of offboard 3D detectors is not fully realized due to two main reasons: (1) the onboard multi-object tracker fails to generate sufficient complete object trajectories, and (2) the motion state of objects presents a challenge for the object-centric refining stage in utilizing long-term temporal context representation. To address these issues, we propose a new approach called DetZero for offboard 3D object detection. DetZero utilizes an offline tracker and a multi-frame detector to focus on generating complete object tracks. Additionally, we introduce an attention-based refining module that enhances the interaction of contextual information across long-term sequential point clouds, enabling effective object refining using decomposed regression methods. Through extensive experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset, we demonstrate that DetZero outperforms all other state-of-the-art onboard and offboard 3D detection methods. Remarkably, DetZero achieves 1st place on the Waymo 3D object detection leaderboard with an 85.15 mAPH (L2) detection performance. Further experiments demonstrate the potential of using DetZero to replace human labels, yielding high-quality results. Our findings challenge conventional approaches and provide insights for future research in offboard 3D object detection.
