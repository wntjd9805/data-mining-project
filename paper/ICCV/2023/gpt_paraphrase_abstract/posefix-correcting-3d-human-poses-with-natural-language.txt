Automated generation of instructions for posture modification has numerous applications, such as personalized coaching and in-home physical therapy. Addressing the reverse problem of refining a 3D pose using natural language feedback can be beneficial for tasks like assisted 3D character animation or robot teaching. While some recent studies have explored the relationship between natural language and 3D human pose, none have specifically focused on describing differences in 3D body pose. In this paper, we tackle the issue of correcting 3D human poses using natural language. To accomplish this, we present the Pose-Fix dataset, which includes thousands of paired 3D poses and their corresponding textual feedback. This feedback describes how the initial pose should be modified to achieve the desired pose. We showcase the potential of this dataset through two tasks: (1) text-based pose editing, which involves generating corrected 3D body poses using a given query pose and a textual modifier; and (2) correctional text generation, where instructions are generated based on the differences between two body poses.
