We propose SeedAL, a method for efficiently annotating 3D point clouds for semantic segmentation using active learning (AL). AL selects relevant data fractions to annotate within a budget, but requires a pre-annotated 'seed' dataset to estimate the benefit of annotating other data fractions. We show that the choice of seed significantly affects AL performance. Our method automatically constructs a seed that guarantees good AL performance. If images of the point clouds are available, our method uses unsupervised image features to measure point cloud diversity. It selects point clouds for the seed by optimizing diversity under an annotation budget through linear optimization. Experiments on S3DIS and SemanticKitti datasets prove the effectiveness of our approach compared to random seeding and existing methods. Code is available at https://github.com/nerminsamet/seedal.
