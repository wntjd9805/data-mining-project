This paper presents ParCNetV2, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) that combines the design concepts of transformers to enhance computer vision tasks. Building upon the success of previous studies, ParCNetV2 extends the research of ParCNetV1 by bridging the gap between CNN and ViT. This is achieved through the introduction of two key designs: Oversized Convolution (OC) which processes input with twice the size, and Bifurcate Gate Unit (BGU) which ensures adaptability to different inputs. By integrating OC and BGU within a unified CNN, ParCNetV2 effectively extracts global features similar to ViT, while maintaining lower latency and improved accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ParCNetV2 over other CNNs and hybrid models that combine CNNs and transformers. The code for ParCNetV2 is publicly available at https://github.com/XuRuihan/ParCNetV2.
