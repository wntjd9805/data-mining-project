Panoptic segmentation methods traditionally assign a known class to each pixel in an image, but this approach often leads to incorrect predictions for objects outside the training categories. In safety-critical situations, it is important for models to be robust against out-of-distribution samples and corner cases to avoid dangerous consequences. Since real-world datasets cannot adequately represent the full range of possible scenarios, it is necessary for models to handle unseen and unknown scenarios as well. Previous methods have attempted to address this issue by re-identifying unlabeled objects that have been seen before.In this study, we propose a new approach called holistic segmentation, which extends the concept of segmentation to identify and separate objects of unseen and unknown categories without any prior knowledge about them. This is done while still performing panoptic segmentation for known classes. Our method, U3HS, identifies unknown objects as highly uncertain regions and clusters their corresponding instance-aware embeddings into individual objects. Unlike previous approaches, U3HS is trained without any knowledge of unknown categories, making it more adaptable to real-life scenarios.We conducted extensive experiments on publicly available datasets such as MS COCO, Cityscapes, and Lost&Found to evaluate the effectiveness of U3HS in this new and challenging setting of holistic segmentation, which is free from assumptions. The results demonstrate the efficacy of U3HS in handling unknown objects and highlight the importance of this novel approach.
