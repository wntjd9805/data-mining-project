This study examines the problem of recovering cameras from a set of fundamental matrices. Fundamental matrices are considered compatible if there exists a set of cameras for which they are the fundamental matrices. The focus is on the complete graph, where fundamental matrices are given for each pair of cameras. Previous research has established necessary and sufficient conditions for compatibility based on rank and eigenvalue conditions of the concatenated n-view fundamental matrix. However, this paper shows that the eigenvalue condition is redundant in cases where the cameras are generic or collinear. The paper presents explicit homogeneous polynomials that describe the necessary and sufficient conditions for compatibility using the fundamental matrices and their epipoles. It is found that quadruple-wise compatibility is sufficient to ensure global compatibility for any number of cameras. For four cameras, compatibility is generally determined by triple-wise conditions and one additional equation involving all fundamental matrices.
