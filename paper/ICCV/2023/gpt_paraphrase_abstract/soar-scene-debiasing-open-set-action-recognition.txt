We propose a novel method called Scene-debiasing Open-set Action Recognition (SOAR) to address the issue of deep learning models relying on spurious clues for predictions, such as background scenes. This problem can significantly impact the performance of open-set action recognition when testing samples differ in scene distributions from training samples. To tackle this, we introduce an adversarial scene reconstruction module and an adaptive adversarial scene classification module in SOAR. The former prevents the decoder from reconstructing the video background using video features, thereby reducing background information in feature learning. The latter aims to confuse scene type classification by emphasizing the action foreground, facilitating the learning of scene-invariant information. We also conduct an experiment to measure the extent of scene bias, finding that current open-set action recognizers exhibit bias towards scenes. In comparison, our proposed SOAR method effectively mitigates this bias. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our proposed modules.
