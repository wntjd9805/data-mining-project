In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the concept of "model guidance" to improve the performance and generalization of deep neural networks. Model guidance involves regularizing the explanations provided by the models to ensure that they are based on the correct features. While several techniques have been proposed for model guidance, their effectiveness has only been tested on simple or synthetic datasets.To better understand the impact of different design choices in model guidance, this study conducts a comprehensive evaluation on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and MS COCO 2014 datasets. The evaluation includes various loss functions, attribution methods, models, and levels of guidance depth. Additionally, the study focuses on efficiency by using cheaper bounding box annotations instead of segmentation masks, which are usually more expensive to obtain. The robustness of model guidance is also assessed under limited or coarse annotations.The study introduces the EPG score as a new evaluation metric and loss function called "Energy loss." Optimizing for the Energy loss leads to models that prioritize object-specific features, even when using bounding box annotations that include background regions. The results demonstrate that model guidance can improve generalization, particularly when faced with distribution shifts.The code for implementing model guidance is available at the following link: https://github.com/sukrutrao/Model-Guidance.
