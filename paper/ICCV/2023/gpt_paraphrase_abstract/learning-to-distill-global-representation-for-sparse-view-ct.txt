Sparse-view computed tomography (CT) is a technique that uses a small number of projections to reconstruct tomographic images, reducing radiation dose to patients and speeding up data acquisition. However, these reconstructed images often contain strong artifacts, limiting their diagnostic value. Current approaches in sparse-view CT focus on using raw data for better information recovery, but they still suffer from secondary artifacts, particularly in scenarios with very few projections, and their applicability to different scanners and protocols is limited. This raises the question of whether image post-processing methods have reached their limit. In this paper, we propose a new image post-processing method called Global Representation (GloRe) distillation framework for sparse-view CT, or GloReDi. Firstly, we use Fourier convolution to learn GloRe, which allows each element in GloRe to have a wide receptive field across the entire image. Secondly, unlike previous methods that only use full-view images for supervision, we propose to distill GloRe from intermediate-view reconstructed images that have not been explored before. The success of GloRe distillation is attributed to two key components: representation directional distillation, which aligns the GloRe directions, and band-pass-specific contrastive distillation, which enhances clinically important details. Extensive experiments show that GloReDi outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including dual-domain approaches. The source code for GloReDi is available at https://github.com/longzilicart/GloReDi.
