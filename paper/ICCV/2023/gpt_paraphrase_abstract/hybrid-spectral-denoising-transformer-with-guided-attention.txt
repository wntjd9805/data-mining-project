This paper introduces a Hybrid Spectral Denoising Transformer (HSDT) for denoising hyperspectral images. The transformer model is adapted to overcome the limitations of CNN-based methods in capturing global and local spatial-spectral correlations, while maintaining efficiency and flexibility. The HSDT combines the benefits of Spatial-Spectral Separable Convolution (S3Conv), Guided Spectral Self-Attention (GSSA), and Self-Modulated Feed-Forward Network (SM-FFN). S3Conv serves as a lightweight alternative to 3D convolution, extracting spatial-spectral correlated features for hyperspectral images of any band count. GSSA performs 3D self-attention across spectral bands, guided by learnable queries encoding spectral signatures. This enhances the model's ability to identify global spectral correlations with linear complexity. SM-FFN introduces self-modulation to intensify activations in informative regions, further enhancing the aggregated features. Extensive experiments on various datasets with simulated and real-world noise demonstrate that HSDT outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods while maintaining low computational overhead.
