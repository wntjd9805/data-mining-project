The interpretation of deep neural network predictions has been extensively studied in computer vision research. Existing gradient-based interpretation methods lack robustness and flexibility in incorporating prior knowledge of sparsity and group-sparsity structures. This paper introduces MoreauGrad, an interpretation scheme based on the Moreau envelope of the classifier neural network. MoreauGrad provides a smooth and robust interpretation of multi-layer neural networks and can be efficiently computed using first-order optimization methods. Additionally, MoreauGrad can be combined with L1-norm regularization techniques to produce sparse or group-sparse explanations, which are important in various deep learning applications. Experimental results on standard computer vision datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MoreauGrad compared to standard gradient-based interpretation methods.
