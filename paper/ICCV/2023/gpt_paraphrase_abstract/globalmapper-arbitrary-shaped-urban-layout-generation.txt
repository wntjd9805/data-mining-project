Modeling and designing urban building layouts is a topic of great interest in computer vision, computer graphics, and urban applications. These layouts consist of a collection of buildings within city blocks that are connected by a network of roads. We have observed that building layouts are discrete structures, composed of multiple rows of buildings with different shapes. We believe that these layouts can be simplified using skeletonization techniques, which map any irregular city block shape to a standardized form. Therefore, we propose an automatic method for generating building layouts using graph attention networks. Our approach is capable of producing realistic urban layouts based on any given road network, and it allows for conditional generation using learned priors. Through our experiments and user study, we have demonstrated that our method outperforms previous layout generation networks. We have also shown that it can successfully handle layouts with arbitrary city block shapes and buildings of varying shapes by generating layouts for 28 large cities.
