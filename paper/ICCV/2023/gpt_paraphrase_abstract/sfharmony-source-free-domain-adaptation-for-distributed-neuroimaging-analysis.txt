To address the issue of combining data from different scanners and studies in clinical neuroimaging populations, we propose a method called SFHarmony. This method utilizes Unsupervised Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) to overcome the domain shift caused by different MRI scanners and the privacy concerns associated with sharing personal neuroimaging data.SFHarmony models the imaging features as a Gaussian Mixture Model and minimizes an adapted Bhattacharyya distance between the source and target features. This allows us to create a model that performs well for the target data while having a shared feature representation across different data domains. Importantly, our method does not require access to the source data for adaptation or target labels.We have tested the performance of SFHarmony on both simulated and real domain shifts and found that it is applicable to classification, segmentation, and regression tasks without any changes to the algorithm. Our method outperforms existing SFDA approaches in various realistic data scenarios, demonstrating its potential utility for MRI harmonization and general SFDA problems.To access our code, please visit https://github.com/nkdinsdale/SFHarmony.
