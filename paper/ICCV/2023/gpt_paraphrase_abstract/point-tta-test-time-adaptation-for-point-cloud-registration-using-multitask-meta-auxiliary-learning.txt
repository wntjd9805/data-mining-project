We propose Point-TTA, a new framework for improving the generalization and performance of point cloud registration (PCR) models. While learning-based approaches have made significant progress, they struggle to generalize to unknown testing environments due to variations in 3D scans. Existing methods train a single generic model and apply it to all instances during testing, which may not handle all variations optimally. To address this, we introduce a test-time adaptation approach for PCR. Our model can adapt to unseen distributions at test-time without prior knowledge of the test data. We incorporate three self-supervised auxiliary tasks into our model, which are optimized alongside the primary PCR task. When presented with a test instance, our model adapts using these auxiliary tasks, and the updated model is used for inference. During training, we employ a meta-auxiliary learning approach to train our model, ensuring that the adapted model via auxiliary tasks enhances the accuracy of the primary task. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our approach in improving the generalization of point cloud registration and outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.
