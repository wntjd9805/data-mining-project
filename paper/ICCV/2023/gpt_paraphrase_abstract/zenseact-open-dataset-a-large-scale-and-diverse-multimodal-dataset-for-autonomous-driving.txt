We introduce the Zenseact Open Dataset (ZOD), a diverse and large-scale dataset for autonomous driving (AD). Unlike existing datasets, ZOD focuses on long-range capabilities and offers the highest range and resolution sensors. It covers an area 9 times larger than other datasets and includes detailed keyframe annotations for 2D and 3D objects, road instance/semantic segmentation, traffic sign recognition, and road classification. This combination of features will facilitate advancements in long-range perception and multi-task learning. The dataset is composed of Frames, Sequences, and Drives, providing data diversity and support for spatio-temporal learning, sensor fusion, localization, and mapping. Frames consist of 100k curated camera images with two seconds of supporting sensor data, while Sequences and Drives include the entire sensor suite for 20 seconds and a few minutes, respectively. ZOD is the only large-scale AD dataset released under a permissive license, allowing for both research and commercial use. More information and a comprehensive devkit can be found at zod.zenseact.com.
