In this study, we introduce the concept of Incremental Multilingual Text Recognition (IMLTR) within the framework of incremental learning (IL). Traditional multilingual text recognition systems are limited to a fixed set of languages, making it challenging to handle new languages or adapt to changing data distributions. IMLTR tackles this problem by introducing languages in batches. However, IMLTR faces the challenge of rehearsal-imbalance, which refers to the uneven distribution of sample characters in the rehearsal set used to retain old data. To overcome this issue, we propose a Multiplexed Routing Network (MRN). MRN trains a recognizer for each language encountered and learns a language domain predictor based on the rehearsal set to weigh the recognizers. By using recognizers derived from the original data, MRN reduces reliance on older data and effectively combats catastrophic forgetting, a major issue in IL. We evaluate MRN on the MLT17 and MLT19 datasets and find that it outperforms existing general-purpose IL methods by significant margins, with average accuracy improvements ranging from 10.3% to 35.8% under different settings. The code for the proposed MRN is available at https://github.com/simplify23/MRN.
