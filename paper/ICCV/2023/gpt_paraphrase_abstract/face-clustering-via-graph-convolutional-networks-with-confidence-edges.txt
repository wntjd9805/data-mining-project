Face clustering, a popular method for annotating unlabeled images, has seen significant advancements through the use of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) on affinity graphs. However, these graphs often contain vertex pairs with inconsistent similarities and labels, which negatively impacts the model's performance. While previous efforts have addressed this issue, further exploration of feature information is necessary. In this study, we introduce the concept of confidence edges and utilize them in graph construction. We propose a novel confidence-GCN that clusters face images by deriving more confidence edges. Firstly, we enhance Local Information Fusion to obtain a more accurate similarity metric by considering vertex neighbors. Then, we employ Unsupervised Neighbor Determination to eliminate low-quality edges based on similarity differences. We emphasize that the remaining edges contain the most valuable information. Lastly, the confidence-GCN utilizes the graph and fully leverages the confidence edges for clustering. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses existing methods on face and person datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, comparable results are obtained on the fashion dataset.
