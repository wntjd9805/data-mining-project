Heterogeneous image fusion (HIF) techniques aim to improve image quality by merging complementary information from images captured by different sensors. Deep unfolding network (DUN)-based methods have shown promising results in HIF, but they have two main issues: a lack of a degradation-resistant fusion model and inadequate consideration of the structural properties of DUNs, making them vulnerable to degradation scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Degradation-Resistant Unfolding Network (DeRUN) for the HIF task. DeRUN introduces a novel HIF model for degradation resistance and derives its optimization procedures. We incorporate the optimization unfolding process into DeRUN for end-to-end training. To ensure the robustness and efficiency of DeRUN, we employ a joint constraint strategy and a lightweight partial weight sharing module. In addition, we propose a gradient direction-based entropy loss with powerful texture representation capacity to train DeRUN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeRUN outperforms existing methods on four HIF tasks and downstream applications, with lower computational and memory costs.
