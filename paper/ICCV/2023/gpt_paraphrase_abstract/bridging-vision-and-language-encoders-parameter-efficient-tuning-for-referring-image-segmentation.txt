Parameter Efficient Tuning (PET) has become popular in reducing parameters while maintaining performance and saving hardware resources. However, few studies have explored its application in dense prediction tasks and the interaction between modalities. This paper investigates the efficient tuning problem in referring image segmentation and proposes a new adapter, called Bridger, to facilitate the exchange of cross-modal information and inject task-specific information into the pre-trained model. Additionally, a lightweight decoder is designed for image segmentation. Our approach achieves comparable or superior performance with only 1.61% to 3.38% updates to the backbone parameters, as demonstrated on challenging benchmarks.
