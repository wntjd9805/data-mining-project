Abstract
We study the problem of list-decodable mean estimation for bounded covariance distributions. Speciﬁcally, we are given a set T of points in Rd with the promise that an unknown α-fraction of points in T , where 0 < α < 1/2, are drawn from an unknown mean and bounded covariance distribution D, and no assumptions are made on the remaining points. The goal is to output a small list of hypothesis vectors such that at least one of them is close to the mean of D. We give the
ﬁrst practically viable estimator for this problem. In more detail, our algorithm is sample and computationally efﬁcient, and achieves information-theoretically near-optimal error. While the only prior algorithm for this setting inherently relied on the ellipsoid method, our algorithm is iterative and only uses spectral techniques.
Our main technical innovation is the design of a soft outlier removal procedure for high-dimensional heavy-tailed datasets with a majority of outliers. 1
