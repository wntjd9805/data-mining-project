Abstract
We propose a novel approach that integrates machine learning into compartmental disease modeling (e.g., SEIR) to predict the progression of COVID-19. Our model is explainable by design as it explicitly shows how different compartments evolve and it uses interpretable encoders to incorporate covariates and improve perfor-mance. Explainability is valuable to ensure that the model’s forecasts are credible to epidemiologists and to instill conﬁdence in end-users such as policy makers and healthcare institutions. Our model can be applied at different geographic resolutions, and we demonstrate it for states and counties in the United States. We show that our model provides more accurate forecasts compared to the alternatives, and that it provides qualitatively meaningful explanatory insights. 1

Introduction
The rapid spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has had a signiﬁcant impact on humanity. Accurately forecasting the progression of COVID-19 can help (i) healthcare institutions to ensure sufﬁcient supply of equipment and personnel to minimize fatalities, (ii) policy makers to consider potential outcomes of their policy decisions, (iii) manufacturers and retailers to plan their business decisions based on predicted attenuation or recurrence of the pandemic and (iv) the general populace to have conﬁdence in the choices made by the above actors.
Data is one of the greatest assets of the modern era, including for healthcare [1]. We aim to exploit this abundance of data for COVID-19 forecasting. From available healthcare supply to mobility indices, many information sources are expected to have predictive value for forecasting the spread of
COVID-19. Data-driven time-series forecasting has enjoyed great success, particularly with advances in deep learning [2, 3, 4]. However, several features of the current pandemic limit the success of standard time-series forecasting methods:
• Because there is no close precedent for the COVID-19 pandemic, it is necessary to integrate existing data with priors based on epidemiological knowledge of disease dynamics.
• The data generating processes are non-stationary because progression of the disease inﬂuences public policy and individuals’ public behaviors, and vice versa.
• There are many potential sources of data, but their causal impact on the disease is unclear, and their impact on the progression of the disease is unknown.
• The problem is non-identiﬁable as most infected can be undocumented.
• Data sources are noisy due to reporting issues or due to data collection problems.
• Beyond accuracy, explainability is desired – the users, either from healthcare or policy or business angles, should be able to interpret the results in a meaningful way for optimal strategic planning. 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada.
Figure 1: Our approach is based on distilling the inductive bias from compartmental models (as exempliﬁed here for the popular SIR, Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, model) into a computational graph, where the transitions depend on the related covariates.
Compartmental models, such as the SIR and SEIR [5] models, are widely used for disease modeling by healthcare and public authorities. Such models represent the number of people in each of the compartments (see Fig. 1) and model the transitions between them via differential equations.
Compartmental models often have several shortcomings: (i) only few learnable parameters resulting low model capacity (ii) non-stationary dynamics due to static rates in the differential equations; (iii) no covariates to extract information; (iv) assumptions on well-mixed compartments, i.e. each individual is statistically identical to others in the same compartment [6]; (v) no information sharing across time or geography, and (vi) non-identiﬁability – identical results may arise from different parametrizations [7].
While preserving interpretability for domain experts, we aim for accurate forecasts that go beyond the capabilities of standard compartmental models by utilizing rich datasets with high temporal and spatial granularity. Our approach is based on integrating covariate encoding into compartment transitions to extract relevant information via end-to-end learning (Fig. 1). In this way, we provide an inherently interpretable model that reﬂects the inductive biases of epidemiology. To get high accuracy, we introduce several innovative contributions: 1. We extend the standard SEIR model to also include compartments for undocumented cases and hospital resource usage. Our end-to-end modeling framework can infer meaningful estimates for undocumented cases even if there is no direct supervision for them. 2. The disease dynamics vary over time, e.g., as mobility reduces, the spreading would decay. To accurately reﬂect such dynamics, we propose time-varying encoding of the covariates. 3. We propose learning mechanisms to improve generalization while learning from limited training data, using (i) masked supervision from partial observations, (ii) partial teacher-forcing to minimize error propagation, (iii) regularization and (iv) cross-location information-sharing.
We demonstrate our approach for COVID-19 forecasting for the United States (US), the country that has suffered from the highest number of conﬁrmed cases and deaths as of October 2020. For both at State- and County-level granularities, we show that our model outperforms commonly-used alternatives. Beyond accurate forecasts, we show how our model can be used for insights towards better understanding of COVID-19 pandemic. 2
