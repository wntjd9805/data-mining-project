Abstract
Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state-of-the-art results when ﬁne-tuned on down-stream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manipulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge-intensive tasks, their perfor-mance lags behind task-speciﬁc architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research prob-lems. Pre-trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory can overcome this issue, but have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. We explore a general-purpose ﬁne-tuning recipe for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) — models which combine pre-trained parametric and non-parametric memory for language generation. We introduce
RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq model and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We compare two RAG formulations, one which conditions on the same retrieved passages across the whole generated sequence, and another which can use different passages per token. We ﬁne-tune and evaluate our models on a wide range of knowledge-intensive NLP tasks and set the state of the art on three open domain QA tasks, outperforming parametric seq2seq models and task-speciﬁc retrieve-and-extract architectures. For language generation tasks, we ﬁnd that RAG models generate more speciﬁc, diverse and factual language than a state-of-the-art parametric-only seq2seq baseline. 1

Introduction
Pre-trained neural language models have been shown to learn a substantial amount of in-depth knowl-edge from data [47]. They can do so without any access to an external memory, as a parameterized implicit knowledge base [51, 52]. While this development is exciting, such models do have down-sides: They cannot easily expand or revise their memory, can’t straightforwardly provide insight into their predictions, and may produce “hallucinations” [38]. Hybrid models that combine parametric memory with non-parametric (i.e., retrieval-based) memories [20, 26, 48] can address some of these issues because knowledge can be directly revised and expanded, and accessed knowledge can be inspected and interpreted. REALM [20] and ORQA [31], two recently introduced models that combine masked language models [8] with a differentiable retriever, have shown promising results, 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada.

Figure 1: Overview of our approach. We combine a pre-trained retriever (Query Encoder + Document
Index) with a pre-trained seq2seq model (Generator) and ﬁne-tune end-to-end. For query x, we use
Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) to ﬁnd the top-K documents zi. For ﬁnal prediction y, we treat z as a latent variable and marginalize over seq2seq predictions given different documents. but have only explored open-domain extractive question answering. Here, we bring hybrid parametric and non-parametric memory to the “workhorse of NLP,” i.e. sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models.
We endow pre-trained, parametric-memory generation models with a non-parametric memory through a general-purpose ﬁne-tuning approach which we refer to as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
We build RAG models where the parametric memory is a pre-trained seq2seq transformer, and the non-parametric memory is a dense vector index of Wikipedia, accessed with a pre-trained neural retriever. We combine these components in a probabilistic model trained end-to-end (Fig. 1). The retriever (Dense Passage Retriever [26], henceforth DPR) provides latent documents conditioned on the input, and the seq2seq model (BART [32]) then conditions on these latent documents together with the input to generate the output. We marginalize the latent documents with a top-K approximation, either on a per-output basis (assuming the same document is responsible for all tokens) or a per-token basis (where different documents are responsible for different tokens). Like T5 [51] or BART, RAG can be ﬁne-tuned on any seq2seq task, whereby both the generator and retriever are jointly learned.
There has been extensive previous work proposing architectures to enrich systems with non-parametric memory which are trained from scratch for speciﬁc tasks, e.g. memory networks [64, 55], stack-augmented networks [25] and memory layers [30]. In contrast, we explore a setting where both parametric and non-parametric memory components are pre-trained and pre-loaded with extensive knowledge. Crucially, by using pre-trained access mechanisms, the ability to access knowledge is present without additional training.
Our results highlight the beneﬁts of combining parametric and non-parametric memory with genera-tion for knowledge-intensive tasks—tasks that humans could not reasonably be expected to perform without access to an external knowledge source. Our RAG models achieve state-of-the-art results on open Natural Questions [29], WebQuestions [3] and CuratedTrec [2] and strongly outperform recent approaches that use specialised pre-training objectives on TriviaQA [24]. Despite these being extractive tasks, we ﬁnd that unconstrained generation outperforms previous extractive approaches.
For knowledge-intensive generation, we experiment with MS-MARCO [1] and Jeopardy question generation, and we ﬁnd that our models generate responses that are more factual, speciﬁc, and diverse than a BART baseline. For FEVER [56] fact veriﬁcation, we achieve results within 4.3% of state-of-the-art pipeline models which use strong retrieval supervision. Finally, we demonstrate that the non-parametric memory can be replaced to update the models’ knowledge as the world changes.1 2 Methods
We explore RAG models, which use the input sequence x to retrieve text documents z and use them as additional context when generating the target sequence y. As shown in Figure 1, our models x) with parameters ⌘ that returns (top-K truncated) leverage two components: (i) a retriever p⌘(z 1) parametrized distributions over text passages given a query x and (ii) a generator p✓(yi| x, z, y1:i

To train the retriever and generator end-to-end, we treat the retrieved document as a latent variable.
We propose two models that marginalize over the latent documents in different ways to produce a distribution over generated text. In one approach, RAG-Sequence, the model uses the same document to predict each target token. The second approach, RAG-Token, can predict each target token based on a different document. In the following, we formally introduce both models and then describe the p⌘ and p✓ components, as well as the training and decoding procedure. 2.1 Models
RAG-Sequence Model The RAG-Sequence model uses the same retrieved document to generate the complete sequence. Technically, it treats the retrieved document as a single latent variable that x) via a top-K approximation. Concretely, the is marginalized to get the seq2seq probability p(y top K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and the generator produces the output sequence probability for each document, which are then marginalized,

In the RAG-Token model we can draw a different latent document for each
RAG-Token Model target token and marginalize accordingly. This allows the generator to choose content from several documents when producing an answer. Concretely, the top K documents are retrieved using the retriever, and then the generator produces a distribution for the next output token for each document, before marginalizing, and repeating the process with the following output token, Formally, we deﬁne: pRAG-Token(y x)

Finally, we note that RAG can be used for sequence classiﬁcation tasks by considering the target class as a target sequence of length one, in which case RAG-Sequence and RAG-Token are equivalent. 2.2 Retriever: DPR
The retrieval component p⌘(z

Product Search (MIPS) problem, which can be approximately solved in sub-linear time [23]. We use a pre-trained bi-encoder from DPR to initialize our retriever and to build the document index. This retriever was trained to retrieve documents which contain answers to TriviaQA [24] questions and
Natural Questions [29]. We refer to the document index as the non-parametric memory.

BART was pre-trained using a denoising objective and a variety of different noising functions. It has obtained state-of-the-art results on a diverse set of generation tasks and outperforms comparably-sized T5 models [32]. We refer to the BART generator parameters ✓ as the parametric memory henceforth.

We jointly train the retriever and generator components without any direct supervision on what document should be retrieved. Given a ﬁne-tuning training corpus of input/output pairs (xj, yj), we 3

We do not ﬁnd this step necessary for strong performance, and keep the document encoder (and index) ﬁxed, only ﬁne-tuning the query encoder BERTq and the BART generator. log p(yj| j  

To estimate the probability of an hypothesis y we run an additional forward pass for each document z for which y does not appear in the beam, multiply generator probability with p⌘(z x) and then sum the probabilities across beams for the marginals. We refer to this decoding procedure as “Thorough Decoding.” For longer can become large, requiring many forward passes. For more efﬁcient decoding, output sequences, 0 where y was not generated during beam x, zi) we can make a further approximation that p✓(y search from x, zi.

| 3 Experiments
We experiment with RAG in a wide range of knowledge-intensive tasks. For all experiments, we use a single Wikipedia dump for our non-parametric knowledge source. Following Lee et al. [31] and
Karpukhin et al. [26], we use the December 2018 dump. Each Wikipedia article is split into disjoint 100-word chunks, to make a total of 21M documents. We use the document encoder to compute an embedding for each document, and build a single MIPS index using FAISS [23] with a Hierarchical
Navigable Small World approximation for fast retrieval [37]. During training, we retrieve the top k documents for each query. We consider k for training and set k for test time using dev 5, 10
} data. We now discuss experimental details for each task. 2{ 3.1 Open-domain Question Answering
Open-domain question answering (QA) is an important real-world application and common testbed for knowledge-intensive tasks [20]. We treat questions and answers as input-output text pairs (x, y) and train RAG by directly minimizing the negative log-likelihood of answers. We compare RAG to the popular extractive QA paradigm [5, 7, 31, 26], where answers are extracted spans from retrieved documents, relying primarily on non-parametric knowledge. We also compare to “Closed-Book
QA” approaches [52], which, like RAG, generate answers, but which do not exploit retrieval, instead relying purely on parametric knowledge. We consider four popular open-domain QA datasets: Natural
Questions (NQ) [29], TriviaQA (TQA) [24]. WebQuestions (WQ) [3] and CuratedTrec (CT) [2]. As
CT and WQ are small, we follow DPR [26] by initializing CT and WQ models with our NQ RAG model. We use the same train/dev/test splits as prior work [31, 26] and report Exact Match (EM) scores. For TQA, to compare with T5 [52], we also evaluate on the TQA Wiki test set. 3.2 Abstractive Question Answering
RAG models can go beyond simple extractive QA and answer questions with free-form, abstractive text generation. To test RAG’s natural language generation (NLG) in a knowledge-intensive setting, we use the MSMARCO NLG task v2.1 [43]. The task consists of questions, ten gold passages retrieved from a search engine for each question, and a full sentence answer annotated from the retrieved passages. We do not use the supplied passages, only the questions and answers, to treat 4
MSMARCO as an open-domain abstractive QA task. MSMARCO has some questions that cannot be answered in a way that matches the reference answer without access to the gold passages, such as
“What is the weather in Volcano, CA?” so performance will be lower without using gold passages.
We also note that some MSMARCO questions cannot be answered using Wikipedia alone. Here,
RAG can rely on parametric knowledge to generate reasonable responses. 3.3
Jeopardy Question Generation
To evaluate RAG’s generation abilities in a non-QA setting, we study open-domain question gen-eration. Rather than use questions from standard open-domain QA tasks, which typically consist of short, simple questions, we propose the more demanding task of generating Jeopardy questions.
Jeopardy is an unusual format that consists of trying to guess an entity from a fact about that entity.
For example, “The World Cup” is the answer to the question “In 1986 Mexico scored as the ﬁrst country to host this international sports competition twice.” As Jeopardy questions are precise, factual statements, generating Jeopardy questions conditioned on their answer entities constitutes a challenging knowledge-intensive generation task.
We use the splits from SearchQA [10], with 100K train, 14K dev, and 27K test examples. As this is a new task, we train a BART model for comparison. Following [67], we evaluate using the
SQuAD-tuned Q-BLEU-1 metric [42]. Q-BLEU is a variant of BLEU with a higher weight for matching entities and has higher correlation with human judgment for question generation than standard metrics. We also perform two human evaluations, one to assess generation factuality, and one for speciﬁcity. We deﬁne factuality as whether a statement can be corroborated by trusted external sources, and speciﬁcity as high mutual dependence between the input and output [33]. We follow best practice and use pairwise comparative evaluation [34]. Evaluators are shown an answer and two generated questions, one from BART and one from RAG. They are then asked to pick one of four options—quuestion A is better, question B is better, both are good, or neither is good. 3.4 Fact Veriﬁcation
FEVER [56] requires classifying whether a natural language claim is supported or refuted by
Wikipedia, or whether there is not enough information to decide. The task requires retrieving evidence from Wikipedia relating to the claim and then reasoning over this evidence to classify whether the claim is true, false, or unveriﬁable from Wikipedia alone. FEVER is a retrieval problem coupled with an challenging entailment reasoning task. It also provides an appropriate testbed for exploring the RAG models’ ability to handle classiﬁcation rather than generation. We map FEVER class labels (supports, refutes, or not enough info) to single output tokens and directly train with claim-class pairs. Crucially, unlike most other approaches to FEVER, we do not use supervision on retrieved evidence. In many real-world applications, retrieval supervision signals aren’t available, and models that do not require such supervision will be applicable to a wider range of tasks. We explore two variants: the standard 3-way classiﬁcation task (supports/refutes/not enough info) and the 2-way (supports/refutes) task studied in Thorne and Vlachos [57]. In both cases we report label accuracy. 4 Results 4.1 Open-domain Question Answering
Table 1 shows results for RAG along with state-of-the-art models. On all four open-domain QA tasks, RAG sets a new state of the art (only on the T5-comparable split for TQA). RAG combines the generation ﬂexibility of the “closed-book” (parametric only) approaches and the performance of
"open-book" retrieval-based approaches. Unlike REALM and T5+SSM, RAG enjoys strong results without expensive, specialized “salient span masking” pre-training [20]. It is worth noting that RAG’s retriever is initialized using DPR’s retriever, which uses retrieval supervision on Natural Questions and TriviaQA. RAG compares favourably to the DPR QA system, which uses a BERT-based “cross-encoder” to re-rank documents, along with an extractive reader. RAG demonstrates that neither a re-ranker nor extractive reader is necessary for state-of-the-art performance.
There are several advantages to generating answers even when it is possible to extract them. Docu-ments with clues about the answer but do not contain the answer verbatim can still contribute towards a correct answer being generated, which is not possible with standard extractive approaches, leading 5

Furthermore, RAG can generate correct answers even when the correct answer is not in any retrieved document, achieving 11.8% accuracy in such cases for NQ, where an extractive model would score 0%. 4.2 Abstractive Question Answering
As shown in Table 2, RAG-Sequence outperforms BART on Open MS-MARCO NLG by 2.6 Bleu points and 2.6 Rouge-L points. RAG approaches state-of-the-art model performance, which is impressive given that (i) those models access gold passages with speciﬁc information required to generate the reference answer, (ii) many questions are unanswerable without the gold passages, and (iii) not all questions are answerable from Wikipedia alone. Table 3 shows some generated answers from our models. Qualitatively, we ﬁnd that RAG models hallucinate less and generate factually correct text more often than BART. Later, we also show that RAG generations are more diverse than
BART generations (see §4.5). 4.3
Jeopardy Question Generation
Table 2 shows that RAG-Token performs better than RAG-Sequence on Jeopardy question generation, with both models outperforming BART on Q-BLEU-1. Table 4 shows human evaluation results, over 452 pairs of generations from BART and RAG-Token. Evaluators indicated that BART was more factual than RAG in only 7.1% of cases, while RAG was more factual in 42.7% of cases, and both
RAG and BART were factual in a further 17% of cases, clearly demonstrating the effectiveness of
RAG on the task over a state-of-the-art generation model. Evaluators also ﬁnd RAG generations to be more speciﬁc by a large margin. Table 3 shows typical generations from each model.
Jeopardy questions often contain two separate pieces of information, and RAG-Token may perform best because it can generate responses that combine content from several documents. Figure 2 shows an example. When generating “Sun”, the posterior is high for document 2 which mentions “The
Sun Also Rises”. Similarly, document 1 dominates the posterior when “A Farewell to Arms” is generated. Intriguingly, after the ﬁrst token of each book is generated, the document posterior ﬂattens.
This observation suggests that the generator can complete the titles without depending on speciﬁc documents. In other words, the model’s parametric knowledge is sufﬁcient to complete the titles. We
ﬁnd evidence for this hypothesis by feeding the BART-only baseline with the partial decoding "The
Sun. BART completes the generation "The Sun Also Rises" is a novel by this author of "The Sun
Also Rises" indicating the title "The Sun Also Rises" is stored in BART’s parameters. Similarly,
BART will complete the partial decoding "The Sun Also Rises" is a novel by this author of "A with "The Sun Also Rises" is a novel by this author of "A Farewell to Arms". This example shows how parametric and non-parametric memories work together—the non-parametric component helps to guide the generation, drawing out speciﬁc knowledge stored in the parametric memory. 4.4 Fact Veriﬁcation
Table 2 shows our results on FEVER. For 3-way classiﬁcation, RAG scores are within 4.3% of state-of-the-art models, which are complex pipeline systems with domain-speciﬁc architectures and substantial engineering, trained using intermediate retrieval supervision, which RAG does not require. 6

For 2-way classiﬁcation, we compare against Thorne and Vlachos [57], who train RoBERTa [35] to classify the claim as true or false given the gold evidence sentence. RAG achieves an accuracy within 2.7% of this model, despite being supplied with only the claim and retrieving its own evidence.
We also analyze whether documents retrieved by RAG correspond to documents annotated as gold evidence in FEVER. We calculate the overlap in article titles between the top k documents retrieved by RAG and gold evidence annotations. We ﬁnd that the top retrieved document is from a gold article in 71% of cases, and a gold article is present in the top 10 retrieved articles in 90% of cases. 4.5 Additional Results
Generation Diversity Section 4.3 shows that RAG models are more factual and speciﬁc than
BART for Jeopardy question generation. Following recent work on diversity-promoting decoding
[33, 59, 39], we also investigate generation diversity by calculating the ratio of distinct ngrams to total ngrams generated by different models. Table 5 shows that RAG-Sequence’s generations are more diverse than RAG-Token’s, and both are signiﬁcantly more diverse than BART without needing any diversity-promoting decoding.
Retrieval Ablations A key feature of RAG is learning to retrieve relevant information for the task.
To assess the effectiveness of the retrieval mechanism, we run ablations where we freeze the retriever during training. As shown in Table 6, learned retrieval improves results for all tasks. We compare
RAG’s dense retriever to a word overlap-based BM25 retriever [53]. Here, we replace RAG’s retriever with a ﬁxed BM25 system, and use BM25 retrieval scores as logits when calculating p(z x). Table 6 show the results. For FEVER, BM25 performs best, perhaps since FEVER claims are heavily entity-centric and thus well-suited for word overlap-based retrieval. Differentiable retrieval improves results on all other tasks, especially for Open-Domain QA, where it is crucial.

Index hot-swapping An advantage of non-parametric memory models like RAG is that knowledge can be easily updated at test time. Parametric-only models like T5 or BART need further training to update their behavior as the world changes. To demonstrate, we build an index using the DrQA [5]
Wikipedia dump from December 2016 and compare outputs from RAG using this index to the newer index from our main results (December 2018). We prepare a list of 82 world leaders who had changed between these dates and use a template “Who is {position}?” (e.g. “Who is the President of Peru?”) 7

Label Accuracy 75.1 91.6 72.9 89.4 74.5 90.6 to query our NQ RAG model with each index. RAG answers 70% correctly using the 2016 index for 2016 world leaders and 68% using the 2018 index for 2018 world leaders. Accuracy with mismatched indices is low (12% with the 2018 index and 2016 leaders, 4% with the 2016 index and 2018 leaders).
This shows we can update RAG’s world knowledge by simply replacing its non-parametric memory.
Effect of Retrieving more documents Models are trained with either 5 or 10 retrieved latent documents, and we do not observe signiﬁcant differences in performance between them. We have the
ﬂexibility to adjust the number of retrieved documents at test time, which can affect performance and runtime. Figure 3 (left) shows that retrieving more documents at test time monotonically improves
Open-domain QA results for RAG-Sequence, but performance peaks for RAG-Token at 10 retrieved documents. Figure 3 (right) shows that retrieving more documents leads to higher Rouge-L for
RAG-Token at the expense of Bleu-1, but the effect is less pronounced for RAG-Sequence. h c t a
