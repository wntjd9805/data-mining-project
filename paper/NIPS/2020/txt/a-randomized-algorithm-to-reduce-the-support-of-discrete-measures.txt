Abstract
Given a discrete probability measure supported on N atoms and a set of n real-valued functions, there exists a probability measure that is supported on a subset of n + 1 of the original N atoms and has the same mean when inte-grated against each of the n functions. If N (cid:29) n this results in a huge reduc-tion of complexity. We give a simple geometric characterization of barycen-ters via negative cones and derive a randomized algorithm that computes this new measure by “greedy geometric sampling”. We then study its properties, and benchmark it on synthetic and real-world data to show that it can be very beneﬁcial in the N (cid:29) n regime. A Python implementation is available at https://github.com/FraCose/Recombination_Random_Algos. 1

Introduction
Discrete probability measures are central to many inference tasks, for example as empirical measures.
In the “big data” regime, where the number N of samples is huge, this often requires to construct a reduced summary of the original measure. Often this summary is constructed by sampling n points at random out of the N points, but Tchakaloff’s theorem suggests that there is another way.
Theorem 1 (Tchakaloff [1]). Let µ be a discrete probability measure that is supported on N points in a space X . Let { f1, . . . , fn} be a set of n real-valued functions fi : X → R, n < N. There exists a discrete probability measure ˆµ such that supp( ˆµ) ⊂ supp(µ), | supp( ˆµ)| ≤ n + 1, and
EX∼µ [ fi(X)] = EX∼ ˆµ [ fi(X)] for all i ∈ {1, . . . , n}. (1)
We introduce a randomized algorithm that computes ˆµ efﬁciently in the n (cid:28) N regime.
