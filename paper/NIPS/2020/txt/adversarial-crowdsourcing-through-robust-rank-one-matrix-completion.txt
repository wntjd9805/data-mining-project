Abstract
We consider the problem of reconstructing a rank-one matrix from a revealed subset of its entries when some of the revealed entries are corrupted with perturbations that are unknown and can be arbitrarily large. It is not known which revealed entries are corrupted. We propose a new algorithm combining alternating minimization with extreme-value ﬁltering and provide sufﬁcient and necessary conditions to recover the original rank-one matrix. In particular, we show that our proposed algorithm is optimal when the set of revealed entries is given by an Erd˝os-Rényi random graph.
These results are then applied to the problem of classiﬁcation from crowdsourced data under the assumption that while the majority of the workers are governed by the standard single-coin David-Skene model (i.e., they output the correct answer with a certain probability), some of the workers can deviate arbitrarily from this model. In particular, the “adversarial” workers could even make decisions designed to make the algorithm output an incorrect answer. Extensive experimental results show our algorithm for this problem, based on rank-one matrix completion with perturbations, outperforms all other state-of-the-art methods in such an adversarial scenario.1 1

Introduction
Matrix completion [10] [9] [13] refers to the problem of recovering a low-rank matrix from a subset of its entries. A fundamental challenge in the study of matrix completion is that, in some applications, the revealed entries will be inaccurate or corrupted. When these perturbations can be arbitrarily large, we will refer to the problem as “robust matrix completion.” In particular, the motivating application for this paper is estimation of worker reliability in crowdsourcing [30] [41] [21][19][45], where this issue appears if some workers deviate from their instructions.
The simplest and one of the most widely used crowdsourcing models is Dawid & Skene’s (D&S) single coin model [6]. In the D&S model, the workers are assumed to make mistakes independently of other workers and with the same error probability for each task. It has previously been observed that optimal estimation in the D&S model requires estimation of worker reliabilities [1], which in turn can be framed as a rank-one matrix completion problem [30].
In the case when some of the workers are poorly described by the D&S model or even consciously acting to subvert the underlying algorithm, the problem is naturally framed as a robust rank-one matrix completion problem. The motivating scenario is either a platform such as Amazon Mechanical
Turk where workers without a long record of reliability typically have cheaper rates, or estimation from online ratings on a platform such as Yelp, where there is strong incentive for business owners to write fake reviews. 1The code is available on https://github.com/maqqbu/MMSR 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada.
We propose a new algorithm for robust rank-one matrix completion which, in at least one regime, is provably optimal. We then perform a computational study which compares our method to twelve state-of-the-art methods from the crowdsourcing literature on both synthetic and real world datasets (in the latter case, we introduce the corrupted workers ourselves), and show that our method strongly outperforms all of them in this adversarial setting.
