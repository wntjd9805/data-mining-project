Abstract
We study the problem of node classiﬁcation on graphs with few-shot novel labels, which has two distinctive properties: (1) There are novel labels to emerge in the graph; (2) The novel labels have only a few representative nodes for training a clas-siﬁer. The study of this problem is instructive and corresponds to many applications such as recommendations for newly formed groups with only a few users in online social networks. To cope with this problem, we propose a novel Meta Transformed
Network Embedding framework (MetaTNE), which consists of three modules: (1)
A structural module provides each node a latent representation according to the graph structure. (2) A meta-learning module captures the relationships between the graph structure and the node labels as prior knowledge in a meta-learning manner.
Additionally, we introduce an embedding transformation function that remedies the deﬁciency of the straightforward use of meta-learning. Inherently, the meta-learned prior knowledge can be used to facilitate the learning of few-shot novel labels. (3) An optimization module employs a simple yet effective scheduling strategy to train the above two modules with a balance between graph structure learning and meta-learning. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that MetaTNE brings a huge improvement over the state-of-the-art methods. 1

Introduction
Graphs are ubiquitously used to represent data in a wide range of ﬁelds, including social network analysis, bioinformatics, recommender systems, and computer network security. Accordingly, graph analysis tasks, such as node classiﬁcation, link prediction, and community detection, have a signiﬁcant impact on our lives in reality. In this paper, we focus on the task of node classiﬁcation. Particularly, we consider the classiﬁcation of few-shot novel labels, which means there are some novel labels to emerge in the graph of interest and the novel labels usually have only a few representative nodes including the positive and the negative (i.e., holding and not holding the novel labels, respectively).
Hereafter, we refer to the available positive and negative nodes of a label as the support nodes of that label. The study of Node Classiﬁcation on graphs with Few-shot Novel Labels (NCFNL) is instructive for many practical applications. Let us consider the following scenarios.

are willing to join their new social media groups. Through NCFNL, these organizations can predict other users’ preferences based on positive and negative responses of a few users and provide better services or recommendations without too much bother for users. (2) For biological protein-protein networks, some researchers may discover a new biological function of certain proteins. Given a few proteins with and without a speciﬁc function, the study of NCFNL could predict whether other proteins have the function, which helps recommend new directions for wet laboratory experimentation.
Some straightforward ways could be derived from existing unsupervised or semi-supervised network embedding methods while suffer from low performance, and please refer to § 2 for detailed discus-sions. To tackle this problem, we argue that different labels in a graph share some intrinsic evolution patterns (e.g., the way a label propagates along the graph structure according to the proximities between nodes). Assuming that there are a set of labels that have sufﬁcient support nodes (e.g., interest groups that have existed and evolved for a long time in online social networks and protein functions that biologists are already familiar with), we desire to extract the common patterns from the graph structure and these labels and then utilize the found patterns to help recognize few-shot novel labels. However, the relationships between the graph structure and node labels are complex and there could be various propagation patterns between nodes. It remains challenging to design a model to capture all the patterns, and how to apply them to novel labels still needs to be further studied.
Overview of Our Approach.
Inspired by recent advances in few-shot learning through meta-learning [22, 7, 25, 13], we cast the problem of NCFNL as a meta-learning problem and propose a novel Meta Transformed Network Embedding framework, namely MetaTNE, which allows us to exploit the common patterns. As shown in Fig. 1, our proposed framework consists of three modules: the structural module, the meta-learning module, and the optimization module. Given a graph and a set of labels (called known labels) with sufﬁcient support nodes, the structural module ﬁrst learns a latent representation for each node according to the graph structure. Then, considering that we ultimately expect to recognize few-shot novel labels, we propose the meta-learning module to simulate the few-shot scenario during the training phase instead of directly performing optimization over all known labels. Moreover, most existing meta-learning works [7, 25] focus on image- and text-related tasks, while the graph structure is more irregular in nature. To adequately exploit the complex and multifaceted relationships between nodes, we further design an embedding transformation function to map the structure-only (or task-agnostic) node representations to the task-speciﬁc ones for different few-shot classiﬁcation tasks. To some extent, the meta-learning module implicitly encodes the shared propagation patterns of different labels through learning a variety of tasks. Finally, the optimization module is proposed to train the preceding two modules with a simple yet effective scheduling strategy in order to ensure the training stability and the effectiveness. One advantage of MetaTNE is that, after training, it is natural to directly apply the learned meta-learning module to few-shot novel labels.
Our main contributions are summarized as follows:
• We explore to only use the graph structure and some known labels to study the problem of NCFNL.
Compared with previous graph convolution based works [40, 34] that rely on high-quality node content for feature propagation and aggregation, our work is more challenging and at the same time more applicable to content-less scenarios.
• We propose an effective framework to solve NCFNL in a meta-learning manner. Our framework is able to generalize to classifying emerging novel labels with only a few support nodes. In particular, we design a transformation function that captures the multifaceted relationships between nodes to facilitate applying meta-learning to the graph data.
• We conduct extensive experiments on four publicly available real-world datasets, and empirical results show that MetaTNE achieves up to 150.93% and 47.58% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art methods in terms of Recall and F1, respectively. 2
