Abstract
We study the problem of outlier robust high-dimensional mean estimation under a
ﬁnite covariance assumption, and more broadly under ﬁnite low-degree moment assumptions. We consider a standard stability condition from the recent robust statistics literature and prove that, except with exponentially small failure prob-ability, there exists a large fraction of the inliers satisfying this condition. As a corollary, it follows that a number of recently developed algorithms for robust mean estimation, including iterative ﬁltering and non-convex gradient descent, give optimal error estimators with (near-)subgaussian rates. Previous analyses of these algorithms gave signiﬁcantly suboptimal rates. As a corollary of our approach, we obtain the ﬁrst computationally efﬁcient algorithm with subgaussian rate for outlier-robust mean estimation in the strong contamination model under a ﬁnite covariance assumption. 1
