Transplant organs are a limited resource in the medical field. The challenge lies in the uniqueness of each organ and the varied responses of patients to them, creating a complex problem for machine learning. Two main challenges are present: (i) assigning organs to patients in the most optimal way; (ii) accurately estimating potential outcomes for each patient and organ. This paper introduces OrganITE, a methodology that considers both estimated outcomes and organ scarcity when assigning organs to patients. By accounting for organ scarcity, we significantly increase the total number of life years across the population compared to existing approaches that prioritize current organ availability. Additionally, we propose a personalized treatment model that addresses the complexity of the organ space. Our method is tested on real and simulated data, resulting in an additional year of life expectancy compared to existing organ-to-patient policies.
