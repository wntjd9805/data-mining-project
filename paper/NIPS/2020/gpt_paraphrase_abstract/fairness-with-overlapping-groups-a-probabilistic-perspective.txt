We propose a new approach to algorithmically fair prediction problems that aims to ensure fairness metrics across multiple overlapping groups. By using probabilistic population analysis, we uncover the Bayes-optimal classifier, which serves as a benchmark for fair classification. Our approach unifies existing group-fair classification methods and can be extended to various non-decomposable multiclass performance metrics and fairness measures. The Bayes-optimal classifier also inspires consistent procedures for fair classification with overlapping groups. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms baselines in terms of balancing fairness and performance.
