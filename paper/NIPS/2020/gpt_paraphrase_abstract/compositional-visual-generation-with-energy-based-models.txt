This paper explores the capability of energy-based models to compose complex concepts by combining probability distributions. By combining distributions of smiling face images and male faces, for instance, the model can generate smiling male faces. This allows for the generation of natural images that satisfy conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations of concepts. The compositional generation abilities of the model are evaluated using the CelebA dataset. The model also demonstrates the ability to learn and incorporate new concepts continuously, as well as infer concept properties underlying an image.
