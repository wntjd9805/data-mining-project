Normalizing flows are effective in modeling flexible probability distributions efficiently. However, they often assume a flat geometry, which is not suitable for data described on Riemannian manifolds like spheres, tori, and hyperbolic spaces. To address this issue, we propose Riemannian continuous normalizing flows. This model allows for the parametrization of probability measures on smooth manifolds by defining flows as solutions to ordinary differential equations. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in both synthetic and real-world data compared to standard flows or projected flows.
