The brain modifies synaptic strengths during learning, but the specific rules governing this process are unknown. This study uses simulated experiments with artificial neural networks to generate a dataset of learning trajectories. Linear and non-linear classifiers are trained to identify learning rules based on observable features. The results show that different classes of learning rules can be distinguished based on aggregate statistics of weights, activations, and layer-wise activity changes. These findings generalize to limited access to the trajectory and different network architectures and learning curricula. The study suggests that activation patterns from electrophysiological recordings of post-synaptic activities may be a reliable way to identify learning rules.
