This paper presents a theoretical analysis of recommendation systems in an online environment, where items are recommended to users sequentially. Each round involves a randomly selected user from a group of m users requesting a recommendation. The decision-maker observes the user and selects an item from a collection of n items. It is important to note that the same item cannot be recommended twice to the same user. The probabilities of user preference for each item are unknown. The performance of the recommendation algorithm is evaluated based on its regret, compared to an Oracle algorithm that has knowledge of these probabilities. We explore different assumptions about these probabilities and establish lower bounds on regret for each assumption. We also develop algorithms that achieve these lower bounds. Notably, our analysis unveils the relative impact of different components of regret, namely the constraint of not repeating items to the same user, learning user preferences, and understanding the underlying structure.
