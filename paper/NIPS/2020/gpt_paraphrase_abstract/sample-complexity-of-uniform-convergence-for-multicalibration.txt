The increasing interest in fairness within machine learning systems, particularly in relation to societal concerns, has led to the development of the multicalibration methodology. This study focuses on addressing the multicalibration error separately from the prediction error, recognizing the trade-off between fairness and accuracy and the need for societal decision-making regarding this trade-off. The research provides sample complexity bounds that ensure the empirical and true multicalibration errors are close, regardless of accuracy. These results are more general than previous bounds, applicable to both agnostic and realizable settings, and not dependent on a specific algorithm. Additionally, they improve upon previous multicalibration sample complexity bounds and offer uniform convergence guarantees for the calibration error.
