Detecting brain activation in cognitive tasks or clinical conditions using non-invasive techniques like MEG or EEG is challenging due to high-dimensional statistical inference and spatio-temporal data with autocorrelated noise. To address this, we propose the desparsiﬁed multi-task Lasso (d-MTLasso) estimator, which is tailored for high-dimensional linear models and can handle temporal data corrupted with autocorrelated noise. We combine d-MTLasso with spatially constrained clustering and ensembling to reduce data dimension and mitigate the arbitrary choice of clustering. This results in the ensemble of clustered desparsiﬁed multi-task Lasso (ecd-MTLasso) estimator, which offers statistical guarantees and allows for trading spatial specificity for sensitivity. Extensive simulations and empirical results on MEG datasets demonstrate the high recovery performance of ecd-MTLasso and its practical benefit of providing a statistically principled way to threshold MEG/EEG source maps.
