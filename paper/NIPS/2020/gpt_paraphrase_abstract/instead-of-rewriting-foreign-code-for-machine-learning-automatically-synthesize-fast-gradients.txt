Enzyme1 is a powerful automatic differentiation (AD) compiler plugin designed for the LLVM compiler framework. It enables the synthesis of gradients for programs written in various languages, such as C, C++, Fortran, Julia, Rust, Swift, and MLIR, by targeting the LLVM intermediate representation (IR). Unlike traditional tools, Enzyme performs AD on optimized IR, resulting in a significant speedup. In fact, on a machine-learning benchmark suite, Enzyme achieves a geometric mean speedup of 4.2 times compared to AD on unoptimized IR. By packaging Enzyme for popular machine learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, developers can conveniently access gradients of foreign code with state-of-the-art performance. This allows for the direct integration of foreign code into existing machine learning workflows.
