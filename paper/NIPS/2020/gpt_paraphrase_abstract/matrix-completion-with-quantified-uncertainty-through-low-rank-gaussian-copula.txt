This paper introduces a new framework for imputing missing values in large datasets, addressing the lack of uncertainty estimation in existing algorithms. The proposed model, called the Low Rank Gaussian Copula, combines Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis with marginal transformations to better match the data distribution. It can handle various types of data and provides quantified uncertainty for each imputation. The model's fitting time scales linearly with the dataset size. Experimental results demonstrate its superior imputation accuracy for different data types, including those with high rank. The uncertainty measure effectively predicts imputation error, with lower uncertainty associated with lower error. The resulting confidence intervals for real-valued data are well-calibrated.
