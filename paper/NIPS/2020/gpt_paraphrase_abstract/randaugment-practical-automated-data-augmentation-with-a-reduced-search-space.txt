Automated data augmentation strategies have shown impressive results in image classification and object detection. However, their widespread implementation is hindered by the need for a separate and costly search phase. To address this issue, previous approaches used a smaller proxy task, but it remained uncertain if the optimized hyperparameters from the proxy task were truly optimal for the actual task. In this study, we propose a new approach that simplifies the design of automated data augmentation strategies. Instead of searching for multiple augmentation parameters independently, we demonstrate that searching for a single parameter that controls all operations is sufficient. This significantly reduces the search space from 1032 to 102 potential candidates, making automated data augmentation more computationally efficient and eliminating the need for a separate proxy task. Despite these simplifications, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets. We achieve an accuracy of 84.7% on EfÔ¨ÅcientNet-B7, a 1.0% improvement over baseline augmentation, and a 0.4% improvement over AutoAugment on the ImageNet dataset. Furthermore, our method also improves object detection performance on COCO by 1.0-1.3% compared to the baseline augmentation method. The code for our method is available online.
