TriTPP is a novel type of non-recurrent temporal point process (TPP) model that takes advantage of parallel computing. Unlike existing TPP models that rely on sequential processing, TriTPP utilizes normalizing flows to enable parallel sampling and likelihood computation. This new approach maintains the flexibility of recurrent neural network (RNN)-based methods but significantly speeds up the sampling process. As a result, TriTPP can be effectively used for variational inference in continuous-time discrete-state systems. The benefits of TriTPP are demonstrated through experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
