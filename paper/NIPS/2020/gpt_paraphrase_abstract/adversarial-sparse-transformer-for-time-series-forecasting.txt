Various methods have been suggested for time series forecasting, particularly for predicting business demand. However, these approaches have two main limitations. Firstly, most point prediction models only provide an exact value for each time step, lacking flexibility to capture data stochasticity. Even probabilistic prediction methods face the same issue. Additionally, many of these models use an auto-regressive generative mode, which leads to error accumulation during inference when the network's own output replaces the ground-truth provided during training. Consequently, these models may struggle to forecast time series over long periods due to error accumulation. To address these challenges, we introduce a new time series forecasting model called Adversarial Sparse Transformer (AST), which is based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). AST employs a Sparse Transformer as the generator to learn a sparse attention map for time series forecasting, while a discriminator enhances prediction performance at the sequence level. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.
