Feedforward networks (FFN) are widely present in neural systems and are extensively studied for their role in signal and information transmission. While neurons in different layers of FFNs often possess unique characteristics, the impact of this layer-to-layer heterogeneity on network-level information processing remains unexplored. This study demonstrates that the diversity of cellular properties across layers enhances signal and information transmission in FFNs. Specifically, each layer of neurons in the network demodulates signal distortions introduced by preceding layers, thereby improving the transfer of information carried by spike signals. Consequently, this mechanism fosters reliable transmission of spike signals and information in deep FFNs. The findings highlight the significance of different cell types within neural circuits, as they contribute to various computational functions and collectively facilitate information processing.
