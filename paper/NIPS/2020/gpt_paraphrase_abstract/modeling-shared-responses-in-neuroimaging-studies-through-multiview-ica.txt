Group studies with large cohorts of subjects are crucial for making general conclusions about the organization of brain function. However, analyzing data from multiple subjects is challenging due to the significant variability in anatomy, functional topography, and stimulus response across individuals. This difficulty is particularly pronounced when studying ecologically relevant conditions like movie watching, which lacks well-defined cognitive operations. To address this issue, we propose a new model called MultiView Independent Component Analysis (ICA) for group studies. In our model, each subject's data is represented as a combination of shared independent sources and noise. Unlike most group-ICA procedures, our model's likelihood can be computed directly. We have developed a robust and fast quasi-Newton method to maximize the likelihood. We have demonstrated the efficacy of our approach using fMRI data, where our model shows improved sensitivity in identifying common sources among subjects. Additionally, the sources identified by our model exhibit less variability between sessions compared to other methods. Furthermore, when applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data, our method achieves more accurate source localization on phantom data. Finally, when applied to a dataset of 200 subjects, our model reveals a clear sequence of evoked activity in both sensor and source space.
