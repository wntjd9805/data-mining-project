We present a novel neural network family that can predict the behaviors of physical systems by learning the constraints that govern them. Central to our approach is a neural projection operator, which is a lightweight network with a recursive architecture. This operator enforces learned constraints and predicts the different behaviors exhibited by various physical systems. Our inspiration for the neural projection operator comes from the position-based dynamics model commonly used in the gaming and visual effects industries to integrate different fast physics simulators. Our method can automatically uncover a wide range of constraints from observational data, such as length, angle, bending, collision, and boundary effects, without the need for any prior knowledge of connectivity. We introduce a multi-group point representation and a configurable network connection mechanism to handle complex physical systems by incorporating prior inputs. We validate the effectiveness of our approach by successfully learning challenging physical systems, including rigid bodies with intricate geometries, ropes with varying length and bending, articulated soft and rigid bodies, and multi-object collisions with complex boundaries.
