We propose a novel approach called Adversarial Style Mining (ASM) to address the problem of One-Shot Unsupervised Domain Adaptation. In this scenario, only one unlabeled target sample is available for adaptation, making it more challenging than traditional approaches. Conventional methods often fail due to the scarcity of target data. ASM combines a style transfer module and a task-specific module in an adversarial manner. The style transfer module searches for stylized images that are difficult to solve in the target domain, thereby enhancing adaptation performance in a data-scarce scenario. The adversarial learning framework benefits both modules through competition. Extensive experiments on cross-domain classification and segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that ASM achieves state-of-the-art performance in the one-shot setting.
