Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have achieved significant success in sequential prediction tasks. However, they often fail to satisfy certain model properties or patterns that the target sequence should follow. This is especially challenging for predicting large-scale and complex Cyber-Physical Systems. To address this issue, we propose STLnet, a novel learning framework that incorporates temporal logic-based guidance to enhance RNN learning. By leveraging auxiliary knowledge of model properties, STLnet produces more robust models for improved future predictions. Our framework can be applied to various sequential deep learning models and is trained end-to-end with back-propagation. We validate the effectiveness of STLnet using real-world city data, where it not only enhances prediction accuracy but also ensures the satisfaction of model properties and enhances the robustness of RNNs.
