Social media has become a popular platform for citizens to engage in political discussions and stay informed about social issues. However, the algorithm-driven nature of social media has contributed to the polarization of opinions by reinforcing users' existing beliefs. To address this issue, researchers are exploring ways to redesign content-recommendation algorithms in order to reduce societal polarization. This study focuses on allocating seed users to opposing campaigns with the aim of maximizing the number of users exposed to both campaigns. The problem is challenging but can be approached using a greedy algorithm that provides a provable approximation guarantee. Additionally, a scalable method is introduced to estimate the expected co-exposure using random reverse-reachable sets. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments conducted on real-world social networks.
