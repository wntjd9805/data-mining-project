Bayesian optimization is a framework for optimizing functions that are expensive to evaluate. In this paper, the authors propose an efficient implementation of multi-step lookahead Bayesian optimization. Previous approaches either ignore the long-term impact of immediate decisions or are computationally expensive. The authors solve this problem by optimizing all decision variables in the full tree jointly, instead of solving nested optimization problems. They also introduce an efficient method for implementing multi-step Gaussian process "fantasization." The proposed method, called multi-step expected improvement, is computationally tractable and outperforms existing methods on various benchmarks.
