The advancement of machine learning is driven by the introduction of benchmark datasets that challenge existing algorithms. Creating datasets to test specific properties and weaknesses of learning algorithms is crucial for innovation in the field. To address this, we present Synbols, a tool that quickly generates new datasets with diverse latent features displayed in low-resolution images. Synbols utilizes the extensive range of symbols in the Unicode standard and the variety of artistic fonts available from the open font community. Through a user-friendly interface, our tool allows for the rapid creation of different distributions of latent features, including textures and occlusions. We demonstrate the versatility of Synbols by using it to examine the limitations and flaws of standard learning algorithms in various learning scenarios, such as supervised learning, active learning, out-of-distribution generalization, unsupervised representation learning, and object counting.
