We examine the estimation of generalized structural equation models (SEMs) by formulating them as linear operator equations and treating them as min-max games. Both players in the game are represented by neural networks (NNs), which are trained using stochastic gradient descent. We demonstrate global convergence in an overparametrized setting, where the number of neurons is increasing. Our approach incorporates techniques from online learning and local linearization of NNs, surpassing the current state-of-the-art in various aspects. This is the first time an estimation procedure for SEMs based on NNs has been provided with provable convergence, eliminating the need for sample splitting.
