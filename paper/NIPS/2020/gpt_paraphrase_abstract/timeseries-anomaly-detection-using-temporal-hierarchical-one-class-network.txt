We present the Temporal Hierarchical One-Class (THOC) network, a model for detecting anomalies in real-world timeseries data. The THOC network utilizes a dilated recurrent neural network with skip connections to capture the complex temporal dynamics at multiple scales. By employing a hierarchical clustering process, we define a one-class objective called Multiscale Vector Data Description, which enables the accurate capture of temporal dynamics using a set of multi-resolution temporal clusters. Additionally, we encourage orthogonality between the hypersphere centers and introduce a self-supervision task in the temporal domain to enhance representation learning. The entire model is trained end-to-end. Through extensive empirical studies on various real-world timeseries, we demonstrate that the THOC network outperforms recent deep learning baselines in detecting anomalies.
