Deep learning methods have been successful in predicting node-level and graph-level properties in graphs. However, existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) do not consider subgraphs, making it difficult to handle subgraph prediction tasks in various important applications. Subgraph prediction tasks present unique challenges as subgraphs have complex internal topology and also carry information about their position and connectivity relative to the underlying graph. To address this, we propose SUBGNN, a subgraph neural network that learns disentangled subgraph representations. SUBGNN introduces a novel subgraph routing mechanism that propagates neural messages between the subgraph components and randomly sampled anchor patches from the underlying graph. This approach leads to highly accurate subgraph representations. SUBGNN includes three channels, each designed to capture a specific aspect of subgraph topology, and experimental results show that these channels successfully capture the intended properties. We also create new synthetic and real-world subgraph datasets. Experimental results on eight datasets demonstrate that SUBGNN outperforms strong baseline methods, including node-level and graph-level approaches, by 19.8%. SUBGNN performs exceptionally well on challenging biomedical datasets with complex subgraph topology and multiple disconnected components.
