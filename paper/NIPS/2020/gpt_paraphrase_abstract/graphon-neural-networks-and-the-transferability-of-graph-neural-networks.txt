Graph neural networks (GNNs) use graph convolutions to extract local features from network data. These convolutions incorporate information from neighboring nodes using shared coefficients. As these coefficients are not graph-dependent, they can be used to define GNNs on different graphs. This prompts the examination of GNN transferability across graphs. This study introduces graphon NNs as GNN limit objects and presents a bound on the difference between the output of a GNN and its limit graphon-NN. This bound diminishes as the number of nodes increases, provided the graph convolutional filters are bandlimited in the graph spectral domain. This finding establishes a tradeoff between the discriminability and transferability of GNNs.
