This study introduces the Dirichlet Graph Variational Autoencoder (DGVAE), which utilizes graph cluster memberships as latent factors. The research aims to enhance the understanding and performance of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) in graph generation by connecting them with balanced graph cut. The reconstruction term of DGVAE is interpreted as a balanced graph cut, and a new variant of Graph Neural Network (GNN) called Heatts is proposed to improve the encoding process by utilizing Taylor series for fast computation of heat kernels. Experimental results on graph generation and clustering confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
