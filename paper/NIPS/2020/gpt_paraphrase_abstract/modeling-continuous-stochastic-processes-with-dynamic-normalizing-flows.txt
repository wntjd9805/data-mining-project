We propose a new type of normalizing flows, which transform a simple base distribution into a complex target distribution. Our approach involves a differential deformation of the Wiener process to create a rich time series model. This model inherits the advantageous properties of the base process, such as efficient computation of likelihoods and marginals. Additionally, our continuous treatment allows for the modeling of irregular time series with an independent arrival process, enabling straightforward interpolation. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate that our model outperforms variationalRNN and latent ODE baselines in terms of flexibility and desirable properties.
