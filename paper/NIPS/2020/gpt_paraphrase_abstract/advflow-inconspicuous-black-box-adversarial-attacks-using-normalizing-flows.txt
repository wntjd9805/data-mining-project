This paper introduces a new method called AdvFlow, which is a black-box adversarial attack technique for image classifiers. The method uses normalizing flows to model the density of adversarial examples around a target image. The generated adversaries closely resemble clean data, making them difficult to detect. Experimental results demonstrate that AdvFlow performs competitively compared to existing attack methods on defended classifiers.
