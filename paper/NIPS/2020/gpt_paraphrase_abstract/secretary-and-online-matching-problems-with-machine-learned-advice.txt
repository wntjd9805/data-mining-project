The traditional analysis of online algorithms can be overly pessimistic when the input instance is not in the worst-case scenario. Machine learning approaches, on the other hand, excel at predicting future outcomes by leveraging patterns in past inputs. However, these predictions can sometimes be very poor. Building on recent research, we enhance three well-known online settings with machine learning predictions and develop algorithms that take these predictions into consideration. We focus on the classical secretary problem, online bipartite matching, and the graphic matroid secretary problem. Our algorithms still provide worst-case performance guarantees when the predictions are subpar, but they achieve a better competitive ratio compared to the best-known classical online algorithm when the predictions are sufficiently accurate. We establish a trade-off between the competitive ratios achieved in these two scenarios for each algorithm.
