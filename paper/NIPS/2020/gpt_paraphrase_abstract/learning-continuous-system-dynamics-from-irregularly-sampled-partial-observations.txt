This paper introduces a novel approach called LG-ODE for learning system dynamics from irregularly-sampled and partial observations in multi-agent dynamic systems with known graph structure. Existing algorithms assume regularly sampled observations and full object visibility, which is impractical in many applications. LG-ODE addresses this challenge by simultaneously learning high-dimensional trajectory embeddings and inferring continuous latent system dynamics. It utilizes a graph neural network encoder to infer initial states from irregularly-sampled partial observations and employs neuralODE to infer complex continuous-time latent dynamics. Experimental results on various datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
