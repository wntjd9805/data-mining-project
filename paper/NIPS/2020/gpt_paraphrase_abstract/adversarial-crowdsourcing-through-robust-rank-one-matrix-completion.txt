We address the problem of reconstructing a rank-one matrix from a subset of its entries, in the presence of unknown and potentially large perturbations. We propose a novel algorithm that combines alternating minimization with extreme-value filtering. We also establish sufficient and necessary conditions for successfully recovering the original rank-one matrix. Our algorithm is shown to be optimal when applied to a set of revealed entries generated by an Erd˝os-Rényi random graph. We then apply our results to the problem of classification from crowdsourced data, assuming that some workers may deviate from the standard model. These "adversarial" workers could intentionally provide incorrect answers to mislead the algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithm, based on rank-one matrix completion with perturbations, outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in such adversarial scenarios.
