We propose a new unsupervised generative model that can separate object identity from other low-level factors in datasets with imbalanced classes. We address the limitations of InfoGAN's assumption of uniformity and show that it fails to properly disentangle object identity in imbalanced data. Our approach focuses on discovering the discrete latent factor of variation that remains invariant to identity-preserving transformations in real images. This factor is then used as a signal to learn the appropriate latent distribution that represents object identity. Experimental results on both artificial (MNIST, 3D cars, 3D chairs, ShapeNet) and real-world (YouTube-Faces) imbalanced datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in successfully disentangling object identity as a latent factor of variation.
