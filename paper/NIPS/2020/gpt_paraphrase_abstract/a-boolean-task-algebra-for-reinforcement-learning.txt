Lifelong-learning agents must possess the ability to combine learned skills in order to tackle unfamiliar tasks. In this study, we introduce a formalization of task composition using Boolean algebra. This enables us to express new tasks in terms of negation, disjunction, and conjunction of a set of base tasks. By acquiring goal-oriented value functions and constraining task transition dynamics, an agent can successfully solve these new tasks without any additional learning. We demonstrate that by appropriately combining these value functions, we can immediately obtain optimal policies for all tasks that can be expressed using the Boolean algebra. Two domains, including a complex video game environment that requires function approximation, were used to validate our approach. In these domains, the agent first acquires a set of basic skills and then combines them to solve an exponentially large number of new tasks.
