Efficient adversarial attacks on tree-based ensembles like gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs) and random forests (RFs) pose a challenge due to their non-continuous nature and lack of gradients. Existing efficient attacks are not applicable, and decision-based black-box attacks cannot leverage the structure of trees. In our study, we propose a discrete search problem specifically designed for tree ensembles. The objective is to find a valid "leaf tuple" that leads to misclassification with the shortest distance from the original input. Using a simple and effective greedy algorithm, we optimize the adversarial example by moving the leaf tuple within a hamming distance of 1. Experimental results on large GBDT and RF models demonstrate that our method is significantly faster than previous approaches and generates smaller adversarial examples compared to decision-based black-box attacks.
