Motivated by pricing applications in online advertising, we investigate a modified version of linear regression called Myersonian regression. This involves finding a linear function f : RdR that accurately approximates a set of points (xi, vi)[0, 1]. In this variant, we incur a loss of vi vi when f (xi) > vi, which is relevant in economic scenarios where we design pricing policies for differentiated items. The loss represents the difference between the performance of our policy and the optimal Myerson prices. We prove that solving Myersonian regression exactly is NP-hard and there is no fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for it, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis is true. However, we present a polynomial-time approximation scheme that achieves an ✏m additive approximation to the optimal revenue and can be computed in time O(exp(poly(1/✏))poly(m, n)). This algorithm is stable and performs well across different sample distributions.
