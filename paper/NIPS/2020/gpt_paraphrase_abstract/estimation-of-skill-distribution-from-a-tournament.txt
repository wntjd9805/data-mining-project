This paper examines the problem of learning the skill distribution of a group of agents through pairwise games in a tournament. The likelihoods of game outcomes are determined by the Bradley-Terry-Luce model, where an agent's probability of winning is based on its skill level relative to the sum of skill levels. The goal is to learn the skill distribution from noisy observations. The paper proposes a simple algorithm that can achieve near-optimal results in estimating the skill density, as long as the density is smooth. The algorithm combines prior work on learning skill parameters with kernel density estimation. The paper also establishes lower bounds that prove the optimality of the algorithm. The algorithm is applied to soccer leagues, cricket world cups, and mutual funds, providing insights into the skill levels and performance of these entities. The results reveal the presence of low-quality mutual funds before the 2008 financial crisis and the dominance of skilled funds afterward. The entropy of the learned distribution serves as a measure of skill and provides explanations for popular beliefs about the quality of sporting events, such as soccer league rankings.
