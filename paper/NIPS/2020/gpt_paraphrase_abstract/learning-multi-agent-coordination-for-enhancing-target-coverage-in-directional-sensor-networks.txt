The problem of achieving maximum target coverage in directional sensor networks is challenging due to the random movement of targets and limited sensor coverage range. In order to address this problem, we propose a Hierarchical Target-oriented Multi-Agent Coordination (HiT-MAC) approach that divides the problem into two levels: target assignment and target tracking. The coordinator assigns targets to executors based on global monitoring, and the executors focus on tracking their assigned targets. To enhance the learning process, we introduce practical methods such as a self-attention module, marginal contribution approximation, and goal-conditional observation filter. Empirical results show that HiT-MAC outperforms baselines in terms of coverage rate, learning efficiency, and scalability. An ablative analysis is also conducted to assess the effectiveness of the introduced components in the framework.
