We investigate the problem of navigating to a specific object category in unfamiliar environments, known as object goal navigation. Existing end-to-end learning-based navigation approaches struggle with this task due to limitations in exploration and long-term planning. To address this, we propose a modular system called "Goal-Oriented Semantic Exploration" that constructs an episodic semantic map to efficiently explore the environment based on the goal object category. Our model surpasses various baselines, including end-to-end learning-based and map-based methods, as demonstrated in visually realistic simulation environments. It also achieved first place in the CVPR-2020 Habitat ObjectNav Challenge. Ablation analysis reveals that our model learns semantic priors of object arrangements in a scene, enabling efficient exploration. The versatility of our module design allows us to transfer the model to a real-world mobile robot platform, achieving similar performance for object goal navigation.
