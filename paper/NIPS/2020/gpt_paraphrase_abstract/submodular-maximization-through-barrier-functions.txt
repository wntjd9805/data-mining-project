This paper presents a new method for maximizing constrained submodular functions, inspired by barrier functions in continuous optimization. The method improves both the running time and guarantee of constrained submodular maximization. Specifically, the paper proposes a potential function that can be approximately minimized to find a feasible set with a 2(k+1+ε)-approximation factor. This approximation factor can be further improved to (k+1+ε) using an enumeration technique. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on various real-world applications, such as movie recommendation, YouTube video summarization, Twitter feeds and Yelp business locations, and set cover problems.
