We explore the problem of selecting items with the highest quality score while ensuring differential privacy. The exponential mechanism is commonly used for this task, but we propose a new mechanism that provides better results. Through careful analysis of privacy constraints, our mechanism consistently achieves an expected score at least as high as the exponential mechanism, with potential improvements up to a factor of two. Moreover, our mechanism is easy to implement and operates efficiently.
