Feature attribution (FA) is crucial in neuroscience for accurately understanding behaviors and diseases. However, predicting class relevance from brain images is challenging due to phenotypic heterogeneity and natural variation. We propose a new framework using VAE-GAN to create class-specific FA maps. This disentangles class relevance from background features, resulting in meaningful maps. We validate our method on dementia, aging, and lesion detection datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline methods. Importantly, our approach allows exploration of phenotype variation through latent space sampling.
