Deep probabilistic generative models allow for modeling the likelihoods of high-dimensional data. Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples by setting a likelihood threshold is an important application of generative modeling. However, recent studies have shown that probabilistic generative models may assign higher likelihoods to certain types of OOD samples, rendering likelihood threshold-based OOD detection rules problematic. To address this issue, various OOD detection methods have been proposed for deep generative models. This paper highlights that many of these methods fail when applied to Variational Auto-encoders (VAEs). As an alternative, the paper introduces Likelihood Regret, an efficient OOD score for VAEs. Through benchmarking against existing approaches, empirical results demonstrate that Likelihood Regret achieves the best overall performance in OOD detection when applied to VAEs.
