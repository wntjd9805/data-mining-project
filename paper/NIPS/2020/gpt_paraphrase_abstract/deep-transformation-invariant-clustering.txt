Recent advancements in image clustering have primarily focused on improving deep representations. In contrast, we propose a distinct approach that avoids relying on abstract features. Instead, our method involves learning to predict transformations and conducting clustering directly in the pixel space. This learning process seamlessly integrates with gradient-based training of K-means and Gaussian mixture models, eliminating the need for additional loss or hyper-parameters. As a result, we introduce two new frameworks for deep transformation-invariant clustering, where prototypes and transformations are jointly learned. Our approach utilizes deep learning modules to achieve invariance to spatial, color, and morphological transformations. It is conceptually straightforward and offers various advantages, such as easy adaptability of desired invariance and a clear interpretability of cluster centers and assignments. Our novel approach demonstrates competitive and promising performance on standard image clustering benchmarks. Furthermore, we validate its robustness and improved interpretability by visualizing clustering results on real photograph collections.
