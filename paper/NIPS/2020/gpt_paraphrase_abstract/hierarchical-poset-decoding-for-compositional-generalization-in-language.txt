We present a new approach to human language understanding that considers the partially ordered set (poset) structure of semantics. Existing encoder-decoder models lack the ability to properly handle poset structures, leading to poor compositional generalization. Our proposed hierarchical poset decoding paradigm addresses this issue by enforcing partial permutation invariance in semantics and capturing high-level structures of posets. We evaluate our approach on a natural language question answering dataset designed to measure compositional generalization, and our results demonstrate better performance compared to existing decoders. The output format of the answers is abstract.
