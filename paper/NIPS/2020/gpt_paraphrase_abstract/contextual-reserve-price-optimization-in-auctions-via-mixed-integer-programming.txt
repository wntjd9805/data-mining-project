This study focuses on learning a linear model for determining the reserve price in an auction, in order to maximize revenue from the seller's perspective. The researchers first demonstrate that solving this problem efficiently is highly unlikely unless a specific hypothesis fails. They then propose a robust mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation that accurately represents the nonconvex and discontinuous expected reward function associated with the problem. The authors also establish that this MIP formulation is the most suitable for a single impression revenue function. However, given the computational complexity of solving the MIP formulation, the study explores the performance of its linear programming (LP) relaxation as an alternative. Unfortunately, the researchers discover that in the worst case scenario, the optimal objective value of the LP relaxation can be significantly larger than the optimal objective value of the true problem. The study concludes by presenting computational results that demonstrate the superiority of the MIP formulation and its LP relaxation over existing algorithms, using both real and synthetic datasets. Overall, the research highlights the potential of optimization methodologies like MIP in accurately modeling inherent discontinuities in machine learning problems.
