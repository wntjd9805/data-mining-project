The neural tangent kernels (NTK) have been widely used to model training dynamics in overparametrized neural networks (NNs). However, NTKs are not as effective as real-world NNs in terms of generalization. This is because NTKs lack label awareness, making them less locally elastic compared to NNs. This paper introduces a new approach to address this performance gap by incorporating label-awareness into the NTK. The proposed method involves using two label-aware kernels, which combine a label-agnostic component with a hierarchy of label-aware components that have increasing complexity of label dependence. This is achieved through the Hoeffding decomposition. Theoretical and empirical evidence is provided to demonstrate that models trained with these label-aware kernels better simulate NNs in terms of generalization and local elasticity.
