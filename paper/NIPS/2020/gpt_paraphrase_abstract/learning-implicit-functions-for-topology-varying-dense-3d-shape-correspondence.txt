This paper aims to develop a method for learning dense 3D shape correspondence for topology-varying objects in an unsupervised manner. Traditional approaches estimate the occupancy of a 3D point based on a shape latent code. In contrast, our novel method generates a part embedding vector for each 3D point, assuming that it is similar to its corresponding point in another 3D shape of the same object category. We achieve dense correspondence by mapping the part embedding to a corresponding 3D point using an inverse function. Both functions are learned together with the encoder that generates the shape latent code, using multiple loss functions. During inference, our algorithm can automatically determine if there is a correspondence on the target shape for an arbitrary point selected on the source shape, and also provide the corresponding semantic point if it exists. This mechanism is particularly beneficial for man-made objects with different part compositions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through unsupervised 3D semantic correspondence and shape segmentation. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/liuf1990/Implicit_Dense_Correspondence.
