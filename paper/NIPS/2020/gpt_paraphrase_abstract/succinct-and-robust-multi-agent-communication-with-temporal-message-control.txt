New research has indicated that incorporating communication between agents can greatly enhance the overall performance of cooperative Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). However, current communication methods often necessitate agents to exchange an excessive number of messages during runtime through a reliable communication channel, making it impractical for real-world scenarios. This paper introduces Temporal Message Control (TMC), a straightforward yet effective approach to achieve concise and resilient communication in MARL. TMC utilizes a temporal smoothing technique to significantly reduce the amount of information exchanged between agents. Experimental results demonstrate that TMC considerably reduces inter-agent communication overhead without compromising accuracy. Additionally, TMC exhibits superior robustness against transmission loss in lossy networking environments compared to existing approaches.
