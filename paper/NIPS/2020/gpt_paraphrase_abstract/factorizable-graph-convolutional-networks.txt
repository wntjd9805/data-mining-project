Graphs are commonly used to represent connections between entities, but these connections are often complex and represented as a single edge. For example, in a social network, different types of relationships between users, such as friends and colleagues, are hidden behind a single edge. This paper introduces a new graph convolutional network called FactorGCN, which explicitly separates these intertwined relationships in a graph. FactorGCN takes a simple graph as input and separates it into multiple factorized graphs, each representing a distinct and separated relationship between nodes. The node features are then aggregated separately in each factorized graph to generate disentangled features, resulting in improved performance for various tasks. The effectiveness of FactorGCN is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing promising results in terms of disentangling and feature aggregation. The code for FactorGCN is publicly available on GitHub.
