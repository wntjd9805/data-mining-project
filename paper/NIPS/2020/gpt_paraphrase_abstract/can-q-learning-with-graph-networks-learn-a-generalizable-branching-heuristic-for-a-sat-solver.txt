Graph-Q-SAT is a Boolean SAT solver that utilizes value-based reinforcement learning (RL) with Graph Neural Networks for function approximation. It is a complete SAT solver that can provide either a satisfying assignment or proof of unsatisfiability, which is crucial for various SAT applications. Unlike traditional branching heuristics used in SAT solvers, Graph-Q-SAT is trained to analyze the structure of a specific problem instance in order to make better decisions early in the search process. The training of Graph-Q-SAT is efficient and does not require extensive dataset preparation or feature engineering. By interfacing with the MiniSat solver, we train Graph-Q-SAT using RL and demonstrate that it can solve SAT problems in fewer iterations, reducing the required time by 2-3X. Additionally, Graph-Q-SAT exhibits generalization capabilities by successfully solving unsatisfiable SAT instances and problems with significantly more variables than it was trained on. The reduction in the number of iterations also leads to decreased wall clock time for larger problems. Furthermore, when tested on a different task family, Graph-Q-SAT shows positive zero-shot transfer behavior. Although further research is necessary to apply Graph-Q-SAT to modern SAT solving settings and reduce wall clock time, it serves as a compelling proof-of-concept that RL with Graph Neural Networks can learn a versatile branching heuristic for SAT search.
