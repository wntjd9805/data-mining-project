We examine the computational complexity of effectively learning halfspaces in the distribution-independent agnostic PAC model, specifically considering Lp perturbations. We propose an efficient learning algorithm and demonstrate that this problem is computationally challenging. Notably, we establish that the case of L perturbations is inherently more difficult than the case of 2 perturbations.
