We introduce a technique to learn generalized Hamiltonian decompositions of ordinary differential equations using noisy time series measurements. Our approach enables the simultaneous learning of a continuous time model and a scalar energy function for any dynamical system. This method allows for the incorporation of strong physics-based assumptions into the learned governing equations. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our method builds upon and unifies previous research on deep learning with physics-based priors. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to learning continuous time models from the weak form of the governing equations, which is computationally less demanding than conventional adjoint methods.
