We present a neural network (NN) method for fitting and predicting implied volatility surfaces (IVSs) in the financial industry. Unlike typical NN applications, these models are used by practitioners to replicate market prices and value financial instruments. Therefore, achieving low training losses and good generalization capabilities are equally important. It is crucial for IVS models to generate realistic option prices without any arbitrage opportunities. To ensure this, we propose a method that penalizes the loss using soft constraints, guaranteeing the absence of arbitrage. Our approach can be combined with standard IVS models, providing a neural network-based correction when these models fail to replicate observed market prices. This allows practitioners to use our method as an additional tool alongside traditional methods. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, especially when dealing with sparse or erroneous data. We also quantify the model's prediction uncertainty in regions with limited observations. Additionally, we explore the advantages of deeper neural networks compared to shallower ones and examine other network architecture properties. We benchmark our method against standard IVS models by evaluating its performance on both training and testing sets, highlighting its ability to reproduce observed prices and predict new ones.
