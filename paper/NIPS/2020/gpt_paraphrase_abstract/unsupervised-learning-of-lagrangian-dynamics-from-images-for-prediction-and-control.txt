Recent approaches in neural networks for modeling the dynamics of physical systems have focused on incorporating Lagrangian or Hamiltonian structures to improve prediction and generalization. However, these approaches face challenges when dealing with high-dimensional data like images, as they either lose interpretability or can only be applied to specific examples. In this study, we propose a new unsupervised neural network model that learns Lagrangian dynamics from images while maintaining interpretability, which enhances prediction and control. Our model achieves this by inferring Lagrangian dynamics on generalized coordinates that are simultaneously learned with a coordinate-aware variational autoencoder (VAE). The VAE is specifically designed to account for the geometric properties of physical systems consisting of multiple rigid bodies in the plane. By inferring interpretable Lagrangian dynamics, our model effectively learns the properties of the physical system, such as kinetic and potential energy. This enables long-term prediction of dynamics in the image space and the synthesis of energy-based controllers. Overall, our approach combines interpretability and learning capabilities to better understand and control the dynamics of physical systems based on image data.
