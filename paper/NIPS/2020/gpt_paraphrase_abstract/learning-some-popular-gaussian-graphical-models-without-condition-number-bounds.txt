Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) are widely used in machine learning and various scientific fields. Typically, the number of available samples is much smaller compared to the dimension, and sparsity is assumed. While there are algorithms like Graphical Lasso and CLIME that can recover the graph structure with fewer samples, they rely on assumptions that limit their applicability to settings with long-range dependencies. In this study, we present the first polynomial-time algorithms for learning attractive GGMs and walk-summable GGMs without any assumptions on the well-conditioning of the precision matrix. Our algorithms can handle strong dependencies among variables and have the ability to recover the structure even in the presence of long dependency chains. We also conducted experiments that demonstrate the limitations of existing algorithms in settings with long dependencies, where our algorithms excel.
