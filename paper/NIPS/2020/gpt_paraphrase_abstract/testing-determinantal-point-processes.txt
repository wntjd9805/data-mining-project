This paper explores a new perspective on determinantal point processes (DPPs), which are widely used probabilistic models of diversity. The focus of this study is on property testing of distributions. The goal is to determine, with sample access to an unknown distribution q over subsets of a ground set, whether q is a DPP distribution or significantly different from all DPP distributions in terms of its `1-distance. The paper introduces the first algorithm for testing DPPs and establishes a matching lower bound on the sample complexity of DPP testing, with some logarithmic factors. This lower bound also has implications for the difficulty of testing the more general class of log-submodular distributions.
