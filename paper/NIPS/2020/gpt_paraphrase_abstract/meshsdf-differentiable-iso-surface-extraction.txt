Geometric Deep Learning has made significant progress using continuous Deep Implicit Fields, allowing detailed modeling of surfaces without relying on a 3D Euclidean grid. However, these methods are not suitable for applications requiring an explicit mesh-based surface representation due to the inability to differentiate the underlying implicit field. This study proposes a differentiable approach to generating explicit surface mesh representations from Deep Signed Distance Functions. By understanding how perturbations affect surface geometry, the 3D location of surface samples can be differentiated with respect to the deep implicit field. This enables the creation of MeshSDF, an end-to-end differentiable mesh representation that can vary its topology. The proposed method is validated through Single-View Reconstruction and Physically-Driven Shape Optimization, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms.
