Coresets are compact data summaries used for model training, particularly in handling large data streams with limited resources. Current approaches are only suitable for basic models like k-means and logistic regression. In this study, we introduce a new method for constructing coresets using cardinality-constrained bilevel optimization. We illustrate how our framework can effectively generate coresets for deep neural networks and showcase its practical advantages in continual learning and streaming scenarios.
