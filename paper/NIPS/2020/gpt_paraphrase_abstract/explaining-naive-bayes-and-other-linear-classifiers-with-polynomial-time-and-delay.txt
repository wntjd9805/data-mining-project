Recent research has introduced the concept of PI-explanations for Naive Bayes Classifiers (NBCs). These explanations consist of minimal sets of feature-value pairs that are sufficient for making accurate predictions. Previous methods for computing PI-explanations were time and space intensive, but we propose a new algorithm that can compute one PI-explanation for an NBC in a much faster log-linear time. This algorithm is also applicable to linear classifiers. Additionally, we demonstrate that the enumeration of PI-explanations can be achieved with a polynomial delay. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of these new algorithms compared to previous approaches. We also explore different ways to evaluate the quality of heuristic explanations.
