This paper presents a new attention network called RegionAttention Network (RANet) that models the relationship between object regions for semantic segmentation. RANet divides the image into object regions and selects representative information from each region. Unlike previous methods, RANet configures information pathways between pixels in different regions, allowing for region interaction and context exchange to enhance all pixels in the image. The authors jointly train the construction of object regions, selection of representative content, configuration of information pathways, and context exchange between pixels to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive evaluations on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that RANet achieves state-of-the-art results. The code for RANet is available at: https://github.com/dingguo1996/RANet.
