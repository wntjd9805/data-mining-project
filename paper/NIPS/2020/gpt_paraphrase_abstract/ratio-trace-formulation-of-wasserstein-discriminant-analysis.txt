We present a new approach to solve the Wasserstein Discriminant Analysis (WDA) problem by reformulating it as a ratio trace problem. Our algorithm, based on eigensolvers, efficiently computes the discriminative subspace of WDA, offering a more stable alternative to the original trace ratio formulation and its gradient-based algorithm. In addition, we provide a rigorous convergence analysis for our proposed algorithm, which is a crucial aspect missing in current literature. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by combining WDA with low-dimensional clustering techniques like K-means for sub-space clustering. Promising results are obtained from numerical experiments on real datasets, highlighting the usefulness of the ratio trace formulation of WDA in both classification and clustering tasks.
