A new approach is proposed for optimizing black-box simulators using differentiable local surrogate models. In fields like physics and engineering, simulators with non-differentiable models and intractable likelihoods are commonly used. However, optimizing these models is challenging, especially when they are stochastic. To address this, deep generative models are used to approximate the simulator in local areas of the parameter space. These local surrogate models can then approximate the gradient of the simulator, allowing for gradient-based optimization of simulator parameters. When the simulator's dependence on the parameter space is limited to a low dimensional submanifold, our method achieves faster convergence to minima compared to other methods such as Bayesian optimization, numerical optimization, and approaches using score function gradient estimators.
