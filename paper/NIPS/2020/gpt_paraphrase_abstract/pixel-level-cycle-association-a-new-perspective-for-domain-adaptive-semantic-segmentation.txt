This study focuses on domain adaptive semantic segmentation, which involves training a model to predict pixel-level information in a target domain using only annotations from a different domain. Previous methods have used adversarial training to minimize the domain discrepancy, but these approaches often overlook pixel-wise relationships and lack discriminative power. In this paper, the authors propose a new approach that establishes pixel-level cycle associations between source and target pixel pairs, strengthening their connections to reduce the domain gap and enhance feature discriminability. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, GTAV → Cityscapes and SYNTHIA → Cityscapes, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, outperforming previous state-of-the-art approaches. The method can be trained in one stage with no additional parameters, serving as a general framework for future research in domain adaptive semantic segmentation.
