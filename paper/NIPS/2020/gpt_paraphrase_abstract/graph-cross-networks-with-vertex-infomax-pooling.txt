We present a new approach called Graph Cross Network (GXN) that enables comprehensive feature learning from multiple scales of a graph. GXN utilizes trainable hierarchical representations of the graph to facilitate the exchange of intermediate features across scales and promote information flow. It incorporates two key components: a novel vertex infomax pooling (VIPool) that constructs trainable multiscale graphs, and a feature-crossing layer that allows for feature interchange between scales. VIPool selects the most informative vertices by estimating the mutual information between vertex and neighborhood features. The feature-crossing layer enhances information flow and enriches multiscale features by merging intermediate features from different scales. The unique cross shape of the feature-crossing layer distinguishes GXN from other multi-scale architectures. Experimental results demonstrate that GXN improves classification accuracy by 2.12% and 1.15% on average for graph classification and vertex classification, respectively. Additionally, VIPool consistently outperforms other graph-pooling methods when applied to the same network.
