Deep learning faces challenges in safety-critical applications due to its vulnerability to adversarial attacks and large network sizes. Previous research has focused on either robust training or network pruning individually, with limited exploration of their joint application. Existing pruning strategies designed for benign training perform poorly when combined with robust training techniques. To address this, we propose a pruning approach that incorporates the robust training objective and uses it to guide the selection of connections to prune. We formulate the pruning objective as an empirical risk minimization problem and solve it efficiently using SGD. Our approach, HYDRA1, achieves compressed networks with both high benign and robust accuracy. We validate our approach on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets using four robust training techniques. We also discover highly robust sub-networks within non-robust networks. Our code and compressed networks are publicly available.
