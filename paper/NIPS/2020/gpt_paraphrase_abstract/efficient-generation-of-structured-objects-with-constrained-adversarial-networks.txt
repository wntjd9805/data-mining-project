A solution to the struggle of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in generating structured objects like molecules and game maps is proposed. The problem lies in the difficulty of acquiring hard requirements, such as chemical validity for molecules, from examples alone. To address this, Constrained Adversarial Networks (CANs) are introduced as an extension of GANs. CANs embed constraints into the model during training by penalizing the generator based on the allocation of mass to invalid structures. Unlike other generative models, CANs allow for efficient inference of valid structures and the ability to enable or disable learned constraints during inference. CANs can handle various logical constraints and utilize knowledge compilation techniques to evaluate the disagreement between the model and the constraints effectively. The setup is further expanded to include hybrid logical-neural constraints for capturing complex constraints like graph reachability. Extensive empirical analysis demonstrates that CANs can efficiently generate valid structures that are both of high quality and novel.
