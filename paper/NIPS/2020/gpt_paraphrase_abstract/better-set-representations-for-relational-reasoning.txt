The integration of relational reasoning into neural networks has significantly expanded their capabilities. Relational reasoning differs from standard vector representations as it operates on sets of entities. However, existing methods for relational reasoning extract entities by interpreting latent feature representations directly, disregarding set permutational invariance and resulting in fundamental representational limitations. To address this issue, we propose a network module called Set Refiner Network (SRN). Through synthetic image experiments, we demonstrate that our approach effectively decomposes objects without explicit supervision. Furthermore, we incorporate our module into existing relational reasoning models and observe significant improvements in prediction performance and robustness on various relational reasoning tasks.
