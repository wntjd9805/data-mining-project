Graph neural networks need to process graphs in a way that is independent of how the graph is described. Traditionally, this has meant that the network must be able to handle node permutations. However, we demonstrate that a more general concept called naturality is enough for a graph network to be well-defined. This opens up a wider range of graph networks. We introduce global and local natural graph networks, with the latter being as scalable as traditional message passing graph neural networks but more flexible. We provide an example of a natural network on graphs using an equivariant message network parameterization, which performs well on various benchmarks.
