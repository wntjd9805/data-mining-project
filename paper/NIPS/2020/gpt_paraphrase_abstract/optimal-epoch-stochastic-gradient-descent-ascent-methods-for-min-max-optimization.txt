The Epoch gradient descent method (Epoch-GD) is a breakthrough for stochastic strongly convex minimization, achieving optimal convergence rates. However, extending it to solve stochastic min-max problems with strong convexity and strong concavity remains an open question. This study presents a sharp analysis of the epoch-wise stochastic gradient descent ascent method (Epoch-GDA) for solving strongly convex strongly concave (SCSC) min-max problems without imposing additional assumptions. This is the first result showing that Epoch-GDA can achieve optimal rates for the duality gap of general SCSC min-max problems. The generalization of Epoch-GD to Epoch-GDA is non-trivial and requires novel technical analysis. Furthermore, the key lemma can also be used to prove the convergence of Epoch-GDA for weakly-convex strongly-concave min-max problems, leading to nearly optimal complexity without relying on smoothness or other structural conditions.
