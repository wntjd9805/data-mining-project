We have developed a new framework called SOLOv2 that achieves high-performance instance segmentation in a simple, direct, and fast manner. Our approach builds upon the principles of the SOLO method and introduces a novel instance mask representation scheme. This scheme dynamically segments each instance in an image without relying on bounding box detection. It involves predicting mask kernels and learning mask features to generate object masks. Additionally, we have devised a matrix non-maximum suppression (NMS) technique, called Matrix NMS, which significantly reduces inference overhead. Matrix NMS performs NMS with parallel matrix operations, resulting in improved results. Our experiments demonstrate that SOLOv2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with high efficiency, making it suitable for both mobile and cloud applications. We have also developed a lightweight version of SOLOv2 that runs at 31.3 FPS and achieves 37.1% AP on COCO test-dev. Furthermore, our results in object detection and panoptic segmentation, derived from the SOLOv2 mask, highlight its potential as a strong baseline for various instance-level recognition tasks. The code for SOLOv2 is available at https://git.io/AdelaiDet.
