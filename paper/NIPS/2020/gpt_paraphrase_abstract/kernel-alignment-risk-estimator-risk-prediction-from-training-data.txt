We examine the risk of Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) for a given kernel and ridge parameter, using independent and identically distributed observations. We introduce two concepts: the Signal Capture Threshold (SCT) and the Kernel Alignment Risk Estimator (KARE). The SCT, determined by the data distribution, identifies the components of the data captured by the KRR predictor and approximates the expected risk. The KARE, which depends on the training data rather than the true distribution, provides an explicit approximation of the KRR risk. We approach the regression problem from a functional perspective and analyze the Stieltjes transform of general Wishart random matrices to obtain key results. Assuming the universality of KRR moments based on the first two moments of the observations, we derive the mean and variance of the KRR predictor. We validate our findings on the Higgs and MNIST datasets using different classical kernels, demonstrating that the KARE accurately approximates the risk. With the KARE, one can directly compare kernel and hyperparameter choices based on the training set, making it a promising data-driven method for selecting kernels that generalize well.
