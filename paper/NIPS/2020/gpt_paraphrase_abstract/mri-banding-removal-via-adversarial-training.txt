The use of deep learning techniques to reconstruct MR images from sub-sampled Cartesian data often results in a characteristic banding artifact, especially in low signal-to-noise areas of the image. These unnatural artifacts have hindered the clinical use of machine-learning based MRI reconstructions. To address this issue, we propose a technique that utilizes an adversarial loss to penalize and reduce the appearance of banding structures without the need for human annotation. This approach can be seamlessly integrated into existing reconstruction methods that employ supervised machine learning. We conducted a blind comparison against a strong baseline method, evaluated by expert radiologists, and our approach was ranked superior in banding removal without any significant loss of detail. A reference implementation of our technique is provided in the supplementary material.
