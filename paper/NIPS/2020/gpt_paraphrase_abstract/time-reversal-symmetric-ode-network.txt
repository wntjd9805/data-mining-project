The concept of time-reversal symmetry, where the behavior of a system remains unchanged when time is reversed, is a fundamental aspect of classical and quantum mechanics. This study introduces a new loss function that quantifies the adherence of ordinary differential equation (ODE) networks to this symmetry. The loss function measures the differences in time evolution between forward and backward dynamics of ODE networks. A novel framework called Time-Reversal Symmetric ODE Networks (TRS-ODENs) is then proposed, which utilizes this loss function to learn the dynamics of physical systems more efficiently. TRS-ODENs are evaluated on various classical dynamics, demonstrating their ability to learn accurate time evolution from noisy and complex trajectories. Furthermore, even for systems lacking full time-reversal symmetry, TRS-ODENs outperform baseline methods in terms of predictive performance.
