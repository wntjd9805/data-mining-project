We investigate the problem of cluster recovery in the semi-supervised active clustering framework. Our objective is to accurately identify all clusters using as few queries as possible. We extend the previous assumption of spherical clusters to include ellipsoidal clusters with margin, allowing for transformations such as rotations, axis scalings, and point deletions. Despite this more general setting, we demonstrate that it is still feasible to recover the clustering exactly with a logarithmic number of queries relative to the input points. Our algorithm requires O(k3 ln k ln n) oracle queries and (cid:101)O(kn + k3) time to achieve zero misclassification error. The complexity of the problem depends exponentially on the dimensionality of the clusters. Our algorithm is straightforward to implement and can also utilize low-stretch separators, a type of ellipsoid with additional theoretical guarantees. Experimental results on large synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
