The theory of discrete-time online learning has been successfully applied in various decision-making problems under uncertainty. However, certain applications, such as contractual hiring and server allocation, involve actions with outcomes observed after random and action-dependent time intervals. Additionally, ethical and economic concerns may require fairness and task completion within specified deadlines. To address these challenges, we propose a continuous-time online learning framework with fairness considerations. This framework is based on continuous-time utility maximization and can recover different allocation rules, including reward-maximizing, max-min fair, and proportionally fair rules. We also characterize the optimal offline policy that allocates time between actions in a fair manner and imposes deadlines to maximize efficiency. In the absence of statistical knowledge, we introduce a novel online learning algorithm that utilizes dual ascent optimization for time averages. We prove that this algorithm achieves a regret bound of O(Bâˆ’1/2), where B is the total time budget.
