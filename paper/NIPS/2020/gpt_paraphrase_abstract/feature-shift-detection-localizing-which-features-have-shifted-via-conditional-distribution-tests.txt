Current methods for detecting distribution shifts can determine if a shift has occurred, but they cannot pinpoint the specific features responsible for the shift. This is problematic in situations like military sensor networks, where it is crucial to identify which sensors have been compromised. To address this issue, we introduce a formalization of the problem as multiple conditional distribution hypothesis tests. We propose non-parametric and parametric statistical tests for efficient and flexible detection. To calculate test statistics for all dimensions in a single pass, we suggest using a test statistic based on the density model score function. This approach allows for the use of any density model, including deep density models like normalizing flows or autoregressive models. We also develop methods for detecting and locating shifts in multivariate time-series data, demonstrating our findings through various scenarios using simulated and real-world attack models.
