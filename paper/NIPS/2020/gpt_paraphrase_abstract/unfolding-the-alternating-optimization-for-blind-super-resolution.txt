Previous blind super resolution (SR) methods consist of two separate steps: estimating the blur kernel from a low-resolution (LR) image and then restoring the SR image based on the estimated kernel. However, these two steps are not well compatible with each other, as even a small error in the estimation of the blur kernel can greatly affect the performance of the restoration step. Moreover, the first step can only utilize limited information from the LR image, making it difficult to accurately predict the blur kernel.To address these issues, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm that combines the estimation of the blur kernel and the restoration of the SR image into a single model. We introduce two convolutional neural modules: Restorer and Estimator. Restorer restores the SR image using the predicted kernel, while Estimator estimates the blur kernel with the assistance of the restored SR image. We alternate between these two modules in a repeated manner and unfold this process to create an end-to-end trainable network.By incorporating information from both the LR and SR images, our Estimator module can more easily estimate the blur kernel. Additionally, our Restorer module is trained using the kernel estimated by the Estimator, rather than the ground-truth kernel. This makes the Restorer module more tolerant to estimation errors from the Estimator.We conducted extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and real-world images, and our model consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and processing speed.
