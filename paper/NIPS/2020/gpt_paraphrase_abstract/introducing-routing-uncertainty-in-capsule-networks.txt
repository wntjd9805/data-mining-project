Rather than using inefficient local iterative routing between adjacent capsule layers, we propose a different approach that considers the uncertainty in part-object assignment. Instead of local routing iterations, we use variational inference in a probabilistic capsule network to determine part-object connections. This method significantly speeds up the process without compromising performance. We also incorporate global context by introducing global latent variables that directly influence the objective function, and update them discriminatively based on the minimum description length principle. Our focus is on enhancing capsule network properties, and through thorough evaluation on pose-aware tasks, we have observed performance improvements compared to previous methods while maintaining computational efficiency.
