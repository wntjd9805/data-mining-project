We address the problem of controlling a linear dynamical system with stochastic noise, adversarially chosen costs, and bandit feedback. In this setting, only the cost incurred by the learner is observed instead of the entire cost function. We propose an efficient algorithm that achieves regret that increases with the square root of the time horizon ùëá for strongly convex and smooth costs. We also extend this result to general convex, possibly non-smooth costs, and non-stochastic system noise. Our algorithm incorporates a novel technique for dealing with the bandit optimization of loss functions with memory.
