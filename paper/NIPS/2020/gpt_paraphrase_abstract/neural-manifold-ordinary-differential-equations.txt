In this paper, we explore the use of normalizing flows on manifolds in deep generative modelling. Previous approaches have created flow models for specific cases, but they require manual design for each manifold, limiting their generality and flexibility. To address this, we introduce Neural Manifold Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), a manifold version of Neural ODEs. This allows us to construct Manifold Continuous Normalizing Flows (MCNFs) that can be applied to any manifold using only local geometry. MCNFs also enable the computation of probabilities with continuous change of variables, making flow construction simple and expressive. Our experiments show that utilizing continuous manifold dynamics significantly improves density estimation and downstream tasks.
