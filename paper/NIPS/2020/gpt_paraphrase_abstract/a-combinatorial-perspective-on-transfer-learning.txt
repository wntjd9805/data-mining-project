This study explores how humans are not only capable of learning complex skills, but also possess the ability to quickly adapt and acquire new skills in a constantly changing environment. The researchers investigate how learning modular solutions can enable effective generalization to unseen and potentially differently distributed data. They propose that the combination of task segmentation, modular learning, and memory-based ensembling can lead to generalization across an exponentially increasing number of unseen tasks. To implement this idea, they utilize the Forget-Me-Not Process for task segmentation and memory-based ensembling, along with Gated Linear Networks that employ a modular and local learning mechanism. The system developed demonstrates several desirable properties of continual learning, including resilience to catastrophic forgetting, absence of negative transfer, and increasing positive transfer as more tasks are encountered. The system also performs competitively compared to both offline and online methods on standard continual learning benchmarks.
