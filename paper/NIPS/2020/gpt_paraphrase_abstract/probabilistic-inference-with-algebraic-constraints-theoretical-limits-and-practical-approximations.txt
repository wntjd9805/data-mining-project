Weighted model integration (WMI) is a framework for advanced probabilistic inference in hybrid domains. This involves dealing with distributions that have both continuous and discrete random variables, as well as complex logical and arithmetic constraints. This study aims to enhance the WMI framework both theoretically and algorithmically. The authors examine the limits of tractability for WMI inference, specifically in terms of sparsity and diameter of a problem's dependency structure. They find that exact inference is only efficient when the structure is tree-shaped with a logarithmic diameter. While this deepens the theoretical understanding, it makes exact WMI solvers impractical for large problems. To address this, the authors propose an approximate solver that performs exact inference on an approximate model. This solver uses iterative message passing in a relaxed problem structure to recover lost dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach can handle larger problems that were previously challenging for exact solvers, while still providing accurate approximations.
