Existing methods for point completion, which involve estimating missing shape from partial point clouds, often struggle to accurately represent the diverse topologies and surface details of real-world objects. In response to this limitation, we propose a skeleton-bridged point completion network (SK-PCN) that improves shape completion. Our method begins by predicting the 3D skeleton of a partial scan to capture the global structure, and then completes the surface by learning displacements from the skeletal points. By separating the shape completion into structure estimation and surface reconstruction, we simplify the learning process and enhance the ability to capture on-surface details. Additionally, to address missing features in the input points, SK-PCN incorporates a local adjustment strategy that combines the input point cloud with our predictions for surface refinement. Compared to previous methods, our skeleton-bridged approach better supports point normal estimation, resulting in a more accurate full surface mesh beyond point clouds. Qualitative and quantitative experiments on both point cloud and mesh completion demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods across various object categories.
