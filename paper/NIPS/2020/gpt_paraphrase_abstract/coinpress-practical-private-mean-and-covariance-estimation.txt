We introduce novel differentially private estimators for calculating the mean and covariance of sub-Gaussian data with multivariate characteristics. These estimators are designed to be highly accurate even with small sample sizes. Through theoretical analysis and practical experimentation on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms. Our results indicate that our estimators achieve error rates that align with the best theoretical bounds, surpassing the performance of previous methods. Notably, previous estimators lack empirical accuracy for small sample sizes, are ineffective for multivariate data, or rely on strong prior parameter estimates.
