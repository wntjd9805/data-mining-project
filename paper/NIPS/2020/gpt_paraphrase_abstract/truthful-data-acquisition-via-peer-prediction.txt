The abstract discusses the problem of purchasing data for machine learning or statistical estimation. The data analyst has a budget to buy datasets from various data providers, but cannot evaluate the collected data without test data. Payments to data providers are based solely on the collected datasets. The problem is examined in the Bayesian paradigm and in two scenarios: (1) data collected once, and (2) data collected repeatedly with each day's data drawn independently from the same distribution. The mechanisms proposed ensure that truthfully reporting one's dataset is always an equilibrium by using peer prediction techniques. Providers are paid based on the mutual information between their reported data and other providers' reported data. The mechanisms can also discourage misreports that would result in inaccurate predictions, depending on the data distribution. Additionally, the mechanisms guarantee individual rationality and budget feasibility for certain distributions in the first setting and for all distributions in the second setting.
