Probabilistic forecasting is the process of predicting a range of possible future outcomes. This paper focuses on applying this approach to non-stationary time series, which is a difficult but crucial task. The authors propose a model called STRIPE, which represents structured diversity based on shape and time features. The goal of STRIPE is to provide accurate and sharp predictions while also accounting for uncertainty. It is independent of the forecasting model used and incorporates a diversification mechanism based on determinantal point processes (DPP). The authors introduce two differentiable DPP kernels that model diverse trajectories in terms of shape and time. They also develop an iterative sampling mechanism to control the diversity structure. Experimental results on synthetic datasets demonstrate that STRIPE outperforms existing methods in representing diversity without sacrificing accuracy. The authors emphasize the importance of the iterative sampling scheme and using different criteria to measure quality and diversity. Furthermore, experiments on real datasets show that STRIPE surpasses state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting approaches in terms of the best sample prediction.
