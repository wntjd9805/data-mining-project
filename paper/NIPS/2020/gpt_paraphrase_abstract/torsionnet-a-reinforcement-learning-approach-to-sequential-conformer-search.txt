The prediction of molecular geometry for flexible molecules, also known as conformer search, has long been a challenge in computational chemistry. This is a crucial task in determining the relationship between the structure and activity of various substances, including biomolecules and common materials. While significant computational resources are dedicated to Monte Carlo and Molecular Dynamics methods for generating diverse conformer sets for medium to large molecules, chemoinformatic conformer search methods struggle with these complex molecules. To address this, we introduce TorsionNet, a highly efficient sequential conformer search technique that utilizes reinforcement learning under the rigid rotor approximation. The model is trained using curriculum learning, which maximizes a new thermodynamics-based metric called the Gibbs Score. Our experimental results demonstrate that TorsionNet outperforms the top chemoinformatics method by a factor of four on large branched alkanes and by several orders of magnitude on the previously unexplored biopolymer lignin, which has applications in renewable energy. TorsionNet also surpasses the more exhaustive but computationally intensive Self-Guided Molecular Dynamics sampling method.
