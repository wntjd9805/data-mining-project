The objective of clustering is to categorize similar objects into meaningful groups. This is typically achieved by utilizing a known similarity measure between the objects. However, when this measure is not readily available and only ordinal comparisons, such as "object i is more similar to j than to k," are observed, the clustering process becomes less understood. In this study, we address this issue through a two-step procedure: first, we estimate a pairwise similarity matrix based on the comparisons, and then we employ a clustering method that relies on semi-definite programming (SDP). Theoretically, we demonstrate that our approach can accurately recover a predetermined clustering using a nearly optimal number of passive comparisons. Furthermore, we validate our theoretical findings through empirical experiments and showcase the effectiveness of our method on real-world data.
