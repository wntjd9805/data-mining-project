We enhance randomized smoothing by incorporating parameterized transformations and certifying robustness in the parameter space. This presents a challenge due to the inability to directly certify the perturbed image, caused by the non-composition of image transformations. To overcome this, we introduce three defenses with different guarantees based on bounding the interpolation error. Notably, in the individual case, we demonstrate an efficient method to compute the inverse of an image transformation, allowing us to provide individual guarantees in real-time. Our implementation of these methods can be found at https://github.com/eth-sri/transformation-smoothing.
