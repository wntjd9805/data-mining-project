This study focuses on understanding the correlation structure of intervention functions in a causal model's directed acyclic graph (DAG). This is particularly relevant in fields like healthcare and operations research, where studying the causal effects of interventions on different subsets of variables is common. The paper introduces a new model called DAG-GP, which is a multi-task causal Gaussian process. DAG-GP allows for information sharing across continuous interventions and different variables. It can handle various data availability assumptions and captures the correlation between functions with different dimensional input spaces using an integral operator. The paper provides theoretical results on how to formulate the DAG-GP model based on the DAG. Experimental results show that DAG-GP outperforms single-task models in terms of prediction accuracy and calibrated uncertainties. It also helps expedite the selection of optimal interventions in sequential decision-making frameworks like active learning or Bayesian optimization.
