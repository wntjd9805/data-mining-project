Machine learning is a valuable tool for predicting human-related outcomes. However, it also has the power to influence user behavior in order to achieve better results. The current approach to learning predictive models does not take into account the impact of user actions or provide any guarantees about their effects. In this study, we propose a framework for learning accurate predictors that considers the interactions between the learned model and user decisions. To achieve this, we introduce a technique called look-ahead regularization, which encourages predictive models to induce actions that improve outcomes by anticipating user actions. This regularization adjusts the uncertainty estimates based on the distribution of model-induced actions. Our experiments, conducted on both real and synthetic data, demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.
