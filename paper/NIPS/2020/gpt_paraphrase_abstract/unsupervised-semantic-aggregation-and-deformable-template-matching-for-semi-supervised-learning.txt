Unlabeled data learning has gained attention recently, but extracting high-level semantic features through unsupervised learning alone remains challenging. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) shows promise in leveraging a small number of samples. This paper proposes a framework called Unsupervised Semantic Aggregation and Deformable Template Matching (USADTM) for SSL. The goal is to enhance classification performance with limited labeled data and reduce the cost of data annotation. The framework combines unsupervised semantic aggregation using Triplet Mutual Information (T-MI) loss to generate semantic labels for unlabeled data. These labels are then aligned with the actual classes using labeled data. Additionally, a feature pool storing labeled samples is dynamically updated to assign proxy labels for unlabeled data, which are used as targets for cross-entropy minimization. Extensive experiments across four standard semi-supervised learning benchmarks demonstrate that USADTM achieves top performance, such as 90.46% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 40 labels and 95.20% accuracy with 250 labels.
