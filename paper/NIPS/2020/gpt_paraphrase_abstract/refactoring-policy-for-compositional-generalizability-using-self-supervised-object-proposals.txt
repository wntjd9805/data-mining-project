We investigate the acquisition of a policy that can generalize in a compositional manner. To achieve this, we introduce a two-step methodology that transforms a high-reward teacher policy into a student policy with a strong inductive bias for generalization. Specifically, we develop a student policy based on a graph neural network, which focuses on objects obtained through self-supervised learning from images. Through empirical evaluation on four challenging tasks that demand compositional generalizability, our approach outperforms baseline methods, demonstrating its superior performance.
