This study explores the problem of semi-supervised partial label learning, which addresses the challenge of assigning candidate label sets to training examples in a cost-effective and time-efficient manner. The approach utilizes unlabeled data to aid model induction alongside partial label training examples. Label propagation is employed to establish the labeling confidence of partial label examples, followed by the introduction of maximum margin formulation to jointly enable the induction of a predictive model and the estimation of labeling confidence over unlabeled data. The formulation emphasizes confidence-rated margin maximization and confidence manifold preservation across both partial label examples and unlabeled data. The study demonstrates that the predictive model and labeling confidence can be solved through alternating optimization, which offers quadratic programming solutions in alternating steps. Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed semi-supervised partial label learning approach.
