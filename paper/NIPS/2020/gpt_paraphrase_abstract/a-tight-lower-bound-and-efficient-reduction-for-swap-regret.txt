This paper demonstrates the importance of swap regret as a performance measure for online decision-making algorithms in repeated games. It establishes a lower bound for swap regret, which is dependent on the number of time steps and available actions. The lower bound is tight up to a constant and resolves an open problem mentioned in a previous book. Additionally, the paper presents a computationally efficient method for converting no-external-regret algorithms to no-swap-regret algorithms. This method improves upon previous results by providing a better regret bound in various settings, including full-information and bandit settings.
