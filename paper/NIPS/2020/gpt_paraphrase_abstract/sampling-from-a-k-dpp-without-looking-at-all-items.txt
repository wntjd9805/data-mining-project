Determinantal point processes (DPPs) are a valuable probabilistic model for selecting a diverse subset from a large collection of items. They have applications in various fields such as summarization, stochastic optimization, and active learning. The objective is to sample a subset of size k from n items, where the probability of selection is based on the determinant of the kernel matrix induced by the subset (referred to as k-DPP). However, existing k-DPP sampling algorithms require a preprocessing step that is computationally expensive and impractical for large datasets. One approach to address this issue is to subsample a fraction of the data uniformly and perform k-DPP sampling on those items. However, this method does not guarantee that the resulting sample will resemble the target distribution over the original dataset. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called ↵-DPP, which efficiently generates a smaller set of k items by adaptively building a sufficiently large uniform sample of data. Importantly, this algorithm ensures that the generated set is drawn exactly from the target distribution defined on all n items. Our empirical results demonstrate that ↵-DPP produces a k-DPP sample after observing only a small fraction of all elements, resulting in significantly faster performance compared to the current state-of-the-art. The implementation of ↵-DPP can be found at https://github.com/guilgautier/DPPy/.
