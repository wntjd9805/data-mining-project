This paper introduces parametric instance classification (PIC) for unsupervised visual feature learning. Unlike current approaches that use a non-parametric dual-branch method for instance discrimination, PIC directly performs parametric instance classification using a single branch. This results in a simple framework similar to supervised classification without the issue of information leakage. The study demonstrates that the straightforward PIC framework can be just as effective as state-of-the-art approaches like SimCLR and MoCo v2 by adapting common component settings. Additionally, the paper proposes two new techniques to enhance the effectiveness and practicality of PIC. The first technique is a sliding-window data scheduler that addresses the infrequent instance visiting problem in PIC, improving its effectiveness. The second technique is a negative sampling and weight update correction approach, which reduces training time and GPU memory consumption while enabling PIC to be applied to a large number of training images. The authors hope that the PIC framework can serve as a simple baseline for future research. The code and network configurations can be found at https://github.com/bl0/PIC.
