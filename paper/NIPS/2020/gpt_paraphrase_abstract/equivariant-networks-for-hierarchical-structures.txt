Although deep learning can be applied to various primitive data structures using invariant and equivariant maps, there is a lack of formalism for dealing with hierarchical structures. This is a significant problem as many practical structures consist of hierarchies of simple building blocks such as sequences of sets, graphs of graphs, or multiresolution images. We propose that the symmetry of a hierarchical structure can be represented as the "wreath product" of the symmetries of the building blocks. We express the equivariant map for the hierarchy by combining the equivariant linear layers of the building blocks in an intuitive manner. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by applying it to the semantic segmentation of point-cloud data. By imposing a hierarchy of translation and permutation symmetries on the data through voxelization, we achieve state-of-the-art results on SEMANTIC3D, S3DIS, and VKITTI, which are some of the largest real-world point-cloud benchmarks.
