We propose GRAPE, a graph-based framework for machine learning with missing data. GRAPE addresses the issue of missing data by representing observations and features as nodes in a bipartite graph, and observed feature values as edges. It formulates feature imputation as an edge-level prediction task and label prediction as a node-level prediction task, which are then solved using Graph Neural Networks. Unlike existing imputation models that have strong prior assumptions and cannot learn from downstream tasks, and label prediction models that involve heuristics and scalability issues, GRAPE provides a unified approach for both tasks. Experimental results on nine benchmark datasets demonstrate that GRAPE outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving 20% lower mean absolute error for imputation tasks and 10% lower for label prediction tasks.
