Deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods for training real-world robots are limited by the lack of available training data. This study aims to overcome this limitation by training an RL agent to align a Mach-Zehnder interferometer using images of interference fringes captured by a monocular camera. The agent is trained in a simulated environment without any predetermined features or knowledge of the physics involved. After training, the agent is transferred to a physical interferometer. By incorporating domain randomizations to simulate uncertainties in physical measurements, the agent successfully aligns the interferometer without any additional adjustments, performing at the level of a human expert.
