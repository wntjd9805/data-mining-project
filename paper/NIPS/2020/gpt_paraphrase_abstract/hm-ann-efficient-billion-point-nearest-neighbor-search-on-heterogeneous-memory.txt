Current approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms face a tradeoff between query speed and accuracy due to limited main memory capacity. To achieve fast query response, these algorithms must either restrict the number of data points or use compressed vectors, which compromises search accuracy. However, the introduction of heterogeneous memory (HM) provides an opportunity to increase memory capacity and overcome this tradeoff. By using HM, a single machine can store billions of data points in main memory without the need for data compression. Nevertheless, HM consists of both fast but small memory and slow but large memory, and using HM inefficiently significantly slows down query time. In this study, we propose a novel graph-based similarity search algorithm called HM-ANN that considers both memory and data heterogeneity. This algorithm enables billion-scale similarity search on a single node without compression. Our experiments on two billion-sized datasets, BIGANN and DEEP1B, demonstrate that HM-ANN outperforms state-of-the-art compression-based solutions such as L&C and IMI+OPQ in terms of recall-vs-latency, achieving 46% higher recall under the same search latency. Additionally, we enhance existing graph-based methods (HNSW and NSG) with two strong baseline implementations on HM. At the billion-point scale, HM-ANN is 2X and 5.8X faster than our HNSW and NSG baselines, respectively, while maintaining the same level of accuracy.
