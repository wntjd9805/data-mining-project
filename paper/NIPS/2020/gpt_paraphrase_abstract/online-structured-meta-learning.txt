Learning quickly is crucial for machine intelligence in online platforms. Meta-learning, which transfers knowledge from learned tasks, is effective in continuously updating the model. However, current online meta-learning algorithms have limitations when tasks have distinct and difficult to share information. To address this, we propose an online structured meta-learning (OSML) framework. Inspired by human knowledge organization and hierarchical feature representation, OSML disentangles the meta-learner into a meta-hierarchical graph with different knowledge blocks. When encountering a new task, it constructs a meta-knowledge pathway by utilizing relevant knowledge blocks or exploring new ones. This allows the model to quickly adapt to the new task. Additionally, new knowledge is incorporated into the selected blocks. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and interpretability of our framework for both homogeneous and heterogeneous tasks.
