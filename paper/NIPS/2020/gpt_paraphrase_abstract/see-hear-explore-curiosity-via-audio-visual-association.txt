Reinforcement learning faces the challenge of exploration, and curiosity-driven exploration often relies on predicting the future. However, this can be difficult due to uncertainty. In this study, we propose a different form of curiosity that rewards novel connections between different senses. By incorporating multiple modalities, our approach enhances exploration efficiency. Inspired by the importance of both sight and sound in human exploration, we demonstrate the benefits of using an audio-visual association model in guiding learning agents without external rewards. Our experiments on Atari environments and Habitat (a navigation simulator) support the effectiveness of our method.
