This paper introduces a dynamic algorithm for the submodular maximization under a cardinality constraint problem. The problem involves finding the optimal set of at most k elements from a ground set V, based on a given monotone submodular function f. This problem has various applications in machine learning and combinatorial optimization. The proposed algorithm can handle a stream of inserts and deletes of elements in V, and maintains a (1/2 - ε)-approximation of the optimal set for any sequence of updates. The algorithm has an amortized update time of O(k^2ε^-3 · log^5 n), where n is the maximum size of V.
