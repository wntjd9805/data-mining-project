This abstract discusses the concept of causal graph discovery, which involves finding causal relationships from observational data. The authors propose a new algorithm called Priv-PC, which improves both utility and running time compared to existing methods. Priv-PC uses a privacy-preserving approach called sieve-and-examine, which filters out insignificant queries using a small privacy budget and focuses on accurate answers for significant queries. The authors also perform a sensitivity analysis on conditional independence tests, such as conditional Kendall's τ and conditional Spearman's ρ. The Priv-PC algorithm is evaluated on seven public datasets and compared to state-of-the-art methods, showing significant speedup and better utility. The implementation of Priv-PC, including the code used in the evaluation, is accessible at a specific GitHub repository.
