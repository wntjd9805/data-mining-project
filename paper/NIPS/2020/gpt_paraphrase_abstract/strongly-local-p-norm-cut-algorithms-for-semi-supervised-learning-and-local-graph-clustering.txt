Graph based semi-supervised learning involves learning a labeling function for graph nodes using a few example nodes. The graph's edges indicate similarity of labels. This problem is closely related to local graph clustering or community detection. Existing methods based on eigenvector, spectral, random walk, or linear system have difficulty capturing the correct boundary of a target label or cluster. 1-norm or maxflow-mincut methods capture the boundary but cannot grow from a small seed set, and hybrid procedures require difficult parameter setting. To address these limitations, we propose a generalization of the objective function involving p-norms. We present a strongly local algorithm to solve the p-norm cut problem efficiently. Our method can also handle other types of nonlinear objective functions. We provide theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on synthetic and real-world datasets.
