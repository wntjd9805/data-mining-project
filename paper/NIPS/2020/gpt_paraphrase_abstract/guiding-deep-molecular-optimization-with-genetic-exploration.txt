We propose genetic expert-guided learning (GEGL), a new approach for training a deep neural network (DNN) to generate molecules with desired properties. GEGL incorporates a "genetic expert improvement" procedure to generate high-quality targets for the DNN. Experimental results demonstrate that GEGL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various optimization tasks. For instance, GEGL achieves a score of 31.40 in the penalized octanol-water partition coefficient optimization, surpassing the best-known score of 27.22. Additionally, GEGL achieves the highest score in 19 out of 20 tasks in the GuacaMol benchmark and obtains a perfect score in three tasks. The training code is available at the provided GitHub link.
