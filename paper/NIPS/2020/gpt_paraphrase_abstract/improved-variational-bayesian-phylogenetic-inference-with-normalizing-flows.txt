Variational Bayesian phylogenetic inference (VBPI) is a useful method for estimating phylogenetic posteriors efficiently. However, the current approach of using diagonal Lognormal branch length approximation has limitations in accurately approximating the distributions. In this study, we propose a new approach called VBPI-NF, which incorporates deep learning techniques to enhance phylogenetic posterior estimation. By employing carefully designed permutation equivariant transformations to handle the non-Euclidean branch length space, VBPI-NF utilizes normalizing flows to offer a diverse range of flexible branch length distributions that can be applied to different tree topologies. Our results demonstrate that VBPI-NF significantly outperforms the standard VBPI on challenging real data Bayesian phylogenetic inference problems. Additionally, exploring the structured parameterization in these permutation equivariant transformations reveals additional benefits in terms of amortization.
