Recent research by Seshadhri et al. suggests that low-dimensional embeddings, commonly used in modeling and analyzing complex networks, are unable to capture the local structure present in these networks. They demonstrate that networks generated from natural low-dimensional models cannot simultaneously exhibit sparsity and high triangle density, which are characteristic features of real-world networks. However, we present findings that challenge this conclusion by revealing the dependence of Seshadhri et al.'s results on the specific model they employ, rather than the inherent low-dimensional structure of complex networks. By slightly modifying their model, we are able to generate sparse graphs with high triangle density. Intriguingly, this modified model also enables exact low-dimensional factorizations of numerous real-world networks. We propose a straightforward algorithm based on logistic principal component analysis (LPCA) that successfully identifies these exact embeddings. Furthermore, we conduct a series of extensive experiments that confirm the capability of extremely low-dimensional embeddings to capture the local structure in real-world networks.
