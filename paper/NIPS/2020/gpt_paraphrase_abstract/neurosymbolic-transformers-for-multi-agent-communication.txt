In this study, we investigate the problem of inferring communication structures for cooperative multi-agent planning while minimizing communication. We measure communication by the maximum degree of the communication graph, which is important when agents have limited bandwidth. However, minimizing communication is difficult due to the complex nature of the decision space and objective. Traditional methods like training neural networks with gradient descent cannot solve this problem. To address this, we propose a new algorithm that combines a programmatic communication policy and a transformer policy network. First, we train the transformer policy to generate a soft communication graph. Then, we synthesize a programmatic communication policy to harden this graph, creating a neurosymbolic transformer. Our experiments show that our approach can generate low-degree communication graphs while maintaining near-optimal performance.
