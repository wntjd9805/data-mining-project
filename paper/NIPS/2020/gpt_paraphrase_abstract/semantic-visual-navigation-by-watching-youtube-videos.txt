This paper explores the utilization of semantic cues and statistical patterns found in real-world environments to enhance navigation efficiency in unfamiliar settings. The authors propose a method that learns and applies these semantic cues by analyzing YouTube videos. However, this approach is challenging due to the lack of labeled actions or goals in the videos, as well as the possibility of suboptimal behavior being depicted. To address these challenges, the authors employ Q-learning on pseudo-labeled transition quadruples, consisting of an image, action, next image, and reward. The results demonstrate that off-policy Q-learning from passive data effectively learns meaningful semantic cues for navigation. When incorporated into a hierarchical navigation policy, these cues lead to improved efficiency in the ObjectGoal task within visually realistic simulations. Remarkably, the approach achieves a relative improvement of 15-83% compared to end-to-end RL, behavior cloning, and classical methods, all while minimizing direct interaction requirements.
