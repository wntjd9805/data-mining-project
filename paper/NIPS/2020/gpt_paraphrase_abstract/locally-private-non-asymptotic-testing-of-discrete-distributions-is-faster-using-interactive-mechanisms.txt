We examine separation rates for testing discrete distributions, such as multinomial distributions, while adhering to the constraint of Î±-local differential privacy. We develop efficient randomized algorithms and testing methods for both non-interactive and sequentially interactive privacy mechanisms. The separation rates are faster when all sequentially interactive privacy mechanisms are allowed. We provide general information theoretical bounds to demonstrate the optimality of our algorithms compared to other privacy mechanisms and testing procedures in typical scenarios. We consider examples of testing uniform, polynomially decreasing, and exponentially decreasing distributions.
