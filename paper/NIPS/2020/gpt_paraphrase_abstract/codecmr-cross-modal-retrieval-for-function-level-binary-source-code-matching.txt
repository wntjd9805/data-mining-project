Binary source code matching is crucial in computer security as it enhances reverse engineering accuracy and efficiency. Existing studies have focused on extracting code literals and using traditional matching algorithms, but these methods have limitations and require expert experience. To address this, we propose a cross-modal retrieval network that combines Deep Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network (DPCNN) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) for feature extraction in source code and binary code respectively. We also incorporate neural network-based models to capture code literals and implement "norm weighted sampling" for negative sampling. Our model outperforms other methods in two datasets, offering higher accuracy and requiring less expert experience.
