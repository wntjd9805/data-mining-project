The effectiveness of gradient-based algorithms in optimizing non-convex functions in high dimensions is still not fully understood. This study focuses on the dynamics of gradient flow for phase retrieval from random measurements. When the ratio of measurements to input dimension is small, the dynamics gets stuck in spurious minima with large basins of attraction. However, above a critical ratio, these critical points become unstable and develop a negative direction towards the signal. Through numerical experiments, it is observed that in this regime, the gradient flow algorithm is not trapped and instead drifts away from the spurious critical points along the unstable direction, leading to successful discovery of the global minimum. This phenomenon is characterized using tools from statistical physics and is related to a BBP-type transition in the Hessian of the spurious minima.
