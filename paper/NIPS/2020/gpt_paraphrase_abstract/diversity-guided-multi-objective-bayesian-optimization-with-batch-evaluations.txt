A new multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm is proposed in this study. The algorithm aims to balance trade-offs between conflicting objectives in science, engineering, and design optimization problems. It automates the process of finding the optimal solutions, known as Pareto-optimal, while minimizing the number of evaluations required. To further reduce evaluation time, the algorithm selects the best batch of samples to be evaluated in parallel. It approximates and analyzes a piecewise-continuous Pareto set representation, allowing for a batch selection strategy that optimizes both hypervolume improvement and diversity of selected samples. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods. The code for the algorithm is available at https://github.com/yunshengtian/DGEMO.
