The brain incorporates uncertainty in its processing, such as predicting rewards in different spatial locations. To handle uncertainty, the brain may use Gaussian process (GP) regression, which is a nonlinear regression framework. I propose that the brain implements GP regression and present neural networks (NNs) that simulate this process. The first layer neurons, like hippocampal place cells, represent the evaluations of the GP kernel. Output neurons in areas like the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) encode both the average prediction and the uncertainty. To account for biological plasticity, which is not captured by the weights of a NN implementing exact GP regression, I suggest approximations that follow local (anti-)Hebbian synaptic learning rules. This neural network approximation performs well compared to other sparse GP approximations and achieves similar predictive accuracy.
