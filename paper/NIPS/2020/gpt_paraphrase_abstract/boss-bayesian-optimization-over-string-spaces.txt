This article introduces a novel Bayesian optimization (BO) method that directly operates on raw strings. It utilizes string kernels and genetic algorithms within BO loops, which is a new approach in this field. Previous applications of BO on strings faced challenges in mapping inputs into a smooth and unconstrained latent space, requiring significant computational and data resources to learn this projection. Instead, our method builds a robust Gaussian process surrogate model using string kernels that naturally accommodate variable length inputs. Additionally, it efficiently maximizes the acquisition function for spaces with syntactical constraints. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in optimization compared to existing approaches, even in scenarios where syntax is governed by a context-free grammar.
