Conditional estimation given specific covariate values is widely applicable in various fields, including engineering, social sciences, and natural sciences. Existing non-parametric estimators primarily focus on structured homogeneous data, making them vulnerable to adversarial noise and performing poorly with limited sample sizes. To address these challenges, we propose a novel distributionally robust estimator that generates non-parametric local estimates by minimizing the worst-case conditional expected loss within a Wasserstein ambiguity set encompassing all adversarial distributions. Despite the general complexity of this task, the local estimator can be efficiently obtained through convex optimization in widely applicable scenarios, while remaining robust against data corruption and heterogeneity. Experimental results using synthetic and MNIST datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of this new class of estimators.
