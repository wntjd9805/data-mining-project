In social systems, the pursuit of self-interest by individuals can sometimes harm the overall well-being of the group, resulting in social dilemmas. To address this conflict, a central designer can intervene by either redesigning the system or providing incentives for individuals to change their behavior. However, for intervention to be effective, the designer must understand how individuals will respond, which is determined by their often unknown payoff functions. Therefore, it is necessary to learn about the individuals before intervening. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for learning and intervention in games, integrating the equilibria of games into an optimization framework. To facilitate the backward propagation through game equilibria, two approaches are proposed: one based on explicit differentiation and the other based on implicit differentiation. Both approaches involve differentiating through a projection operator. The correctness of both approaches is established, and the conditions under which one approach is preferable to the other are identified. The analytical findings are validated using various real-world problems.
