SURF is an algorithm that approximates distributions using piecewise polynomials. It is simple, as it replaces complex optimization techniques with empirical probability approximation and divide-and-conquer to merge the pieces. It is universal because it accurately approximates a wide range of common distributions based on known polynomial approximation results. It is robust to distribution mis-specification, estimating any distribution to a distance less than three times that of the nearest polynomial piece. It is fast, with optimal sample complexity and near sample-linear running time. In experiments, SURF performs better than other algorithms.
