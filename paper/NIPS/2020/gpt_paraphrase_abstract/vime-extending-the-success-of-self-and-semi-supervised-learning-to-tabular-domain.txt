This paper introduces self- and semi-supervised learning frameworks called VIME for tabular data, which have been successful in training machine learning models with limited labeled data in image and language domains. Existing methods rely on the specific structure of image and language data, making them unsuitable for tabular data. VIME addresses this gap by proposing novel frameworks that include a pretext task of estimating mask vectors from corrupted tabular data and a tabular data augmentation method. The proposed framework is evaluated on multiple tabular datasets from different domains, such as genomics and clinical data, and outperforms existing baseline methods.
