This paper addresses the problem of separating domain-specific characteristics from domain-invariant representations in visual domain adaptation. Existing methods lack flexibility in handling real-world situations and tend to be suboptimal in removing domain-specific properties. The authors propose a heuristic search perspective approach, where heuristic representations are identified as the characteristics that lead to larger domain discrepancies. A principled framework called Heuristic Domain Adaptation (HDA) is formulated, which uses cosine similarity scores and independence measurements as constraints during the learning procedure. A constraint enforcing the final range of heuristic network output to be small is also derived. The authors propose a Heuristic Domain Adaptation Network (HDAN) that explicitly learns domain-invariant and domain-specific representations with the mentioned constraints. Extensive experiments show that HDAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in unsupervised DA, multi-source DA, and semi-supervised DA. The code is available at https://github.com/cuishuhao/HDA.
