Human-Object Interaction (HOI) involves interactions between humans, objects, and implicit verbs. Instead of directly mapping pixels to HOI semantics, we present a new approach called HOI Analysis, inspired by Harmonic Analysis. Like Harmonic Analysis, which represents signals as a combination of basic waves, we argue that coherent HOI can be broken down into isolated human and object components, which can then be integrated back into coherent HOI. Additionally, transformations between human-object pairs with the same HOI can be more easily achieved through integration and decomposition. This approach allows us to represent the implicit verb in the transformation function space. To implement these transformations and improve HOI detection, we propose the Integration-Decomposition Network (IDN), which achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular HOI detection benchmarks. The code for IDN can be found at https://github.com/DirtyHarryLYL/HAKE-Action-Torch/tree/IDN-(Integrating-Decomposing-Network).
