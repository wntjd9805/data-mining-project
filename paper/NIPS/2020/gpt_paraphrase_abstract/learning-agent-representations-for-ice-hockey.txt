Agent modeling in team sports is a promising field that can have a significant impact in real-world applications. However, a major challenge in modeling professional players is the large number of players involved, many of whom have limited participation in a season. This makes it difficult to apply existing agent representation models to the sports domain. In this paper, we propose a new approach for agent representations in professional ice hockey using a Markov game model. Our method involves generating player representations through a variational encoder that embeds player information with latent variables. The encoder learns a shared prior that allows it to capture statistical information across players with different participation rates. To capture the complex dynamics of sequential sports data, we introduce a Variational Recurrent Ladder Agent Encoder (VaRLAE) that provides a contextualized player representation with a hierarchy of latent variables. We evaluate our approach on three major sports analytics tasks using a large dataset of over 4.5 million events. Our experimental results demonstrate that our VarLAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in identifying the acting player, estimating expected goals, and predicting the final score difference.
