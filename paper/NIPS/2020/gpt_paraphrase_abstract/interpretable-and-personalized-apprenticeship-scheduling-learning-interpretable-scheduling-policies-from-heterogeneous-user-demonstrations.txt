Resource scheduling and coordination in hospitals and factories is a complex optimization problem that involves allocating agents to tasks while considering time and resource constraints. Currently, human domain experts manually handle this task by using their experience and strategies acquired over the years. However, there is a need to extract and incorporate this domain knowledge into a learning framework that can scale beyond the capabilities of a single expert, especially in safety-critical domains. To address this, we propose a personalized and interpretable apprenticeship scheduling algorithm that can understand and replicate the decision-making criteria of human task demonstrators. This algorithm utilizes a non-parametric approach to extract an interpretable representation of the demonstrators. In synthetic domains, our algorithm achieves near-perfect accuracy, and in a real-world planning domain, it outperforms other methods with an accuracy of 88.22%. Additionally, our user study confirms that our methodology produces more interpretable and user-friendly models compared to neural networks.
