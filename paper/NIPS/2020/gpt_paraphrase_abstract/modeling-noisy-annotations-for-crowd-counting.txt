Traditional crowd counting algorithms based on crowd density maps do not consider annotation noise. In this study, we introduce a model to capture annotation noise using a random variable with a Gaussian distribution and determine the probability density function (pdf) of crowd density values for each spatial location in an image. We approximate the joint distribution of density values using a full covariance multivariate Gaussian density and derive a low-rank approximation for practical implementation. By training a crowd density map estimator using our proposed loss function, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on three large-scale crowd counting datasets, confirming its effectiveness. Furthermore, our trained model successfully predicts the locations of individuals despite the presence of noisy training data, demonstrating the robustness of our loss function to annotation noise.
