This paper introduces a new approach to online influence maximization (OIM) in social networks, specifically focusing on the linear threshold (LT) model. Unlike previous studies that focus on the independent cascade (IC) model, this paper considers the node-level feedback in OIM. This presents a challenge as the observations are random and only provide aggregated effects from groups of nodes. To address this, the paper proposes an algorithm called LT-LinUCB that incorporates ideas from linear bandits and is consistent with the observed feedback. By proving the group observation modulated (GOM) bounded smoothness property, the paper provides a novel result on the influence difference based on random observations. The regret of the algorithm is shown to be of order ËœO(poly(m)pT), where m is the number of edges and T is the number of rounds. This is the first theoretical result of such order for OIM under the LT model. Additionally, the paper presents another algorithm called OIM-ETC, which has a regret bound of O(poly(m) T 2/3). This algorithm is model-independent, simple, and has fewer requirements on online feedback and offline computation.
