We present a new Bayesian optimisation (BO) algorithm that addresses the issue of unknown search spaces. Traditional BO assumes knowledge of the search space, but this is often not the case. Our algorithm expands and shifts the search space iteratively, using a hyperharmonic series to control the expansion rate. Additionally, we introduce a variant of our algorithm that works well in high-dimensional spaces. Theoretical analysis shows that both algorithms achieve sub-linear growth in cumulative regret. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world optimisation tasks demonstrate that our algorithms outperform current state-of-the-art methods for BO in unknown search spaces.
