This abstract discusses a proposal to incorporate the relationship between facial expressions and action units into a deep learning framework for joint facial expression recognition and action unit detection. The authors suggest using a constraint optimization method to encode the probabilistic dependencies between expressions and action units into a Bayesian Network, which is then integrated into the deep learning framework as weak supervision for an action unit detection model. A data-driven facial expression recognition model is also constructed. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through evaluations on benchmark datasets, showing improved performance for both the facial expression recognition model and the action unit detection model. The proposed action unit detection model is shown to achieve competitive performance without the need for action unit annotations. Additionally, the authors show that the Bayesian Network capturing the generic knowledge generalizes well to different datasets.
