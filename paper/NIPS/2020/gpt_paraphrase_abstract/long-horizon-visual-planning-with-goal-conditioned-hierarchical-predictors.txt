We propose a framework for visual prediction and planning that overcomes the limitations of current approaches. Our framework includes a class of latent space goal-conditioned predictors (GCPs) which improve planning efficiency by considering goal information. We also demonstrate how GCPs can be formulated as hierarchical models, allowing for long-term prediction and the generation of complete sequences. This hierarchical approach enables the design of an effective planning algorithm that optimizes trajectories in a coarse-to-fine manner. By utilizing goal-conditioning and hierarchical prediction, GCPs allow for the successful completion of visual planning tasks with longer horizons than previously achievable.
