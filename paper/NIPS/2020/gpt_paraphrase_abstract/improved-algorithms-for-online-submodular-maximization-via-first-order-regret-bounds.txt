We examine the problem of maximizing nonnegative submodular functions in an online scenario. At each time step, an algorithm selects a set from a feasible family, and an adversary reveals a submodular function. Our objective is to design an efficient algorithm that minimizes the expected approximate regret.   In this study, we propose a general approach to improve regret bounds in online submodular maximization by utilizing first-order regret bounds for online linear optimization.   For monotone submodular maximization with a matroid constraint, we present an efficient algorithm that achieves a regret of (1 - c/e - ε) with a complexity of O((p*k*T*ln(n/k))), where n represents the size of the ground set, k is the matroid rank, ε is a constant, and c denotes the average curvature. This regret bound surpasses previous results by Streeter et al. (2009) and Golovin et al. (2014), even without assuming any curvature (i.e., taking c = 1).   For nonmonotone submodular functions without constraints, we propose an algorithm with regret O(√(n*T)), improving upon the findings of Roughgarden and Wang (2018) with a 1/2-regret. Our approach is based on Blackwell approachability, and we introduce a first-order regret bound for the Blackwell instances that arise in this context.
