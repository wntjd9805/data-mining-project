Recent advancements in automatically searching augmentation policies have greatly improved the performance of various tasks. However, the evaluation process for these policies, which determines their effectiveness, is often time-consuming. Many opt for quicker evaluations at the expense of reliability. This study delves into the dynamics of augmented model training and proposes a proxy task called Augmentation-Wise Weight Sharing (AWS) that offers a fast and accurate evaluation process. Extensive analysis confirms the superiority of this approach in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. The augmentation policies discovered using this method outperform existing auto-augmentation search techniques. For CIFAR-10, our method achieves a top-1 error rate of 1.24%, currently the best performance without additional training data. On ImageNet, the top-1 error rate for ResNet-50 is reduced by 3.34% compared to the baseline augmentation, resulting in a rate of 20.36%.
