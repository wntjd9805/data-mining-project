Effective intersection control is crucial for reducing traffic congestion and vehicular emissions, especially in developing countries where air pollution has become a life-threatening issue. This study introduces EcoLight, a cost-effective intersection control system designed for regions with limited budgets and poor network connectivity. EcoLight utilizes advanced Deep Reinforcement Learning techniques to learn efficient control strategies offline, but operates on inexpensive embedded devices that can function independently on the road without relying on server connectivity. By optimizing various metrics such as throughput and travel time, EcoLight aims to improve both average and worst case performance. The system's effectiveness is evaluated using open-source datasets from New York as well as a custom dataset from a developing region.
