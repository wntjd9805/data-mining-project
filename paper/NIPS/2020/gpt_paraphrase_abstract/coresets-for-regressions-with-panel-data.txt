This paper addresses the use of coresets for regression problems in panel data settings. It introduces the concept of coresets for different types of regression problems in panel data and proposes efficient algorithms to construct coresets. These coresets have a size that depends on the error parameter and the number of regression parameters, rather than the number of individuals or time units. The approach is based on the Feldman-Langberg framework, which involves bounding the "total sensitivity" by considering the maximum influences of individual-time pairs. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, where the constructed coresets are significantly smaller than the full dataset and improve the computational efficiency of regression computation.
