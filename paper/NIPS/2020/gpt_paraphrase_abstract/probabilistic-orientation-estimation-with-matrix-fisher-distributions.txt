This paper focuses on utilizing deep neural networks to estimate probability distributions for 3D rotations (SO(3)). The task of learning to regress models to rotations is challenging due to the topological differences between RN and SO(3). To address this issue, a neural network is employed to generate parameters for a matrix Fisher distribution, as these parameters can be mapped to R9. By utilizing a negative log likelihood loss for this distribution, a convex loss function is obtained with respect to the network outputs. Through optimization of this loss, significant improvements are achieved on various challenging datasets, including Pascal3D+ and ModelNet10-SO(3).
