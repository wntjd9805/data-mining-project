The abstract presents findings that demonstrate the effectiveness of using a Fourier feature mapping in enabling a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to learn high-frequency functions in low-dimensional problem domains. This has implications for computer vision and graphics, where MLPs are used to represent complex 3D objects and scenes. The study utilizes concepts from the neural tangent kernel (NTK) literature to show that standard MLPs have slow convergence to high frequency signal components. To address this, a Fourier feature mapping is employed to transform the NTK into a stationary kernel with adjustable bandwidth. The abstract proposes a method for selecting problem-specific Fourier features, which significantly enhances the performance of MLPs in low-dimensional regression tasks relevant to computer vision and graphics.
