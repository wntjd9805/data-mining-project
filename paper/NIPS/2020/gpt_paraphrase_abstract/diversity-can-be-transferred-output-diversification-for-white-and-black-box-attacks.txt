Adversarial attacks often involve introducing random perturbations to the inputs, typically drawn from uniform or Gaussian distributions. These perturbations are typically used to initialize optimization-based white-box attacks or generate update directions in black-box attacks. However, these simple perturbations may not be optimal as they do not take into account the specific model being targeted. In order to enhance the effectiveness of these attacks, we propose a new sampling strategy called OutputDiversiÔ¨Åed Sampling (ODS). ODS aims to maximize the diversity in the output of the target model among the generated samples. Despite being a gradient-based strategy, the diversity offered by ODS can be transferred and utilized in both white-box and black-box attacks using surrogate models. We conducted empirical experiments to validate our approach and found that ODS significantly improves the performance of existing white-box and black-box attacks. In fact, ODS reduces the number of queries required for state-of-the-art black-box attacks on ImageNet by half.
