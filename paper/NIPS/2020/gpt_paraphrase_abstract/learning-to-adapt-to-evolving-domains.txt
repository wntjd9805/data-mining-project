Domain adaptation involves transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. While existing methods have made significant progress in adapting discrete domains, they may not be practical for real-world applications where target data are constantly changing. This poses challenges for traditional domain adaptation approaches: (1) they are designed for stationary target domains and may fail in non-stationary environments, and (2) they need to maintain competence on previous target data as new data arrives. To address these challenges, we propose a meta-adaptation framework that allows the learner to adapt to continually evolving target domains without forgetting. Our framework consists of two components: a meta-objective for learning representations that can adapt to changing domains, enabling unsupervised domain adaptation through meta-learning, and a meta-adapter that learns to adapt without forgetting, preserving knowledge from previous target data. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on benchmark datasets for evolving domain adaptation.
