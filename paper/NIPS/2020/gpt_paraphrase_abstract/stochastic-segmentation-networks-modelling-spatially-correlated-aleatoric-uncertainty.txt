Current deep learning methods lack the ability to estimate and predict multiple plausible hypotheses in image segmentation, particularly in medical imaging where experts often disagree on object boundaries. This paper introduces stochastic segmentation networks (SSNs), a probabilistic approach to model aleatoric uncertainty in any image segmentation network architecture. Unlike pixel-wise estimation approaches, SSNs model joint distributions over entire label maps, allowing for the generation of multiple coherent hypotheses for a single image. By utilizing a low-rank multivariate normal distribution over the logit space, the probability of the label map given the image can be efficiently computed by a neural network without changing the underlying architecture. The proposed method was evaluated on real-world medical data, including lung nodules in 2D CT and brain tumors in 3D multimodal MRI scans, and demonstrated superior performance in modeling correlated uncertainty in ambiguous images compared to state-of-the-art methods. SSNs offer simplicity, flexibility, and efficiency in their implementation.
