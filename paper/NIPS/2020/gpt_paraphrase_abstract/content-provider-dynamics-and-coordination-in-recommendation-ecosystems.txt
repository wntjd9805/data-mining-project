Recommendation systems, such as YouTube, consist of content consumers (viewers) and content providers (creators). While recommending relevant content is well-established, ensuring high social welfare for all stakeholders is still in early stages. This study examines content creation dynamics using game theory. Using a simplified model suggested by previous studies, we demonstrate that the dynamics always reach a pure Nash Equilibrium (PNE), although the convergence rate can be exponential. Additionally, we propose an efficient algorithm for computing PNE through a separate combinatorial optimization problem.
