We present a new framework for inference in hidden Markov models (HMMs) that addresses the issue of likelihood misspecification. Our framework, based on Generalized Bayesian Inference (GBI), allows for general filtering recursions in HMMs that can handle model misspecification. By using the Î²-divergence, we develop robust procedures for inference against observation contamination. We implement our framework using sequential Monte Carlo methods (SMC), which can easily be adapted to the new setting. We test our approach on object tracking and Gaussian process regression problems and find that it outperforms standard filtering algorithms and other robust filters in terms of performance.
