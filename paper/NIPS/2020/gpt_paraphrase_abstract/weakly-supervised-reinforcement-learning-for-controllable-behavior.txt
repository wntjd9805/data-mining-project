Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful method for learning how to solve tasks by taking actions. However, in many scenarios, an agent needs to narrow down the vast range of possible tasks to the specific task it is currently required to solve. Is it possible to limit the task space to those that have semantic meaning? In this study, we propose a framework that utilizes weak supervision to automatically distinguish the subset of tasks that are semantically meaningful from the large set of nonsensical tasks. We demonstrate that this learned subset allows for efficient exploration and provides a representation that captures the distance between different states. By applying our approach to various challenging continuous control problems based on vision, we observe significant performance improvements, especially in more complex environments.
