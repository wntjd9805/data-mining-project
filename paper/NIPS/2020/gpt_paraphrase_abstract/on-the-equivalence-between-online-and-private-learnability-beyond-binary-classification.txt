Alon et al. [4] and Bun et al. [10] have recently demonstrated that online learnability and private PAC learnability are equivalent when it comes to binary classification. In this study, we aim to investigate whether this equivalence holds true for multi-class classification and regression as well. Initially, we establish that private learnability implies online learnability in both settings. To achieve this, we introduce a new variant of the Littlestone dimension that relies on a tolerance parameter and an expanded definition of threshold functions beyond binary classification. Furthermore, we discover that while online learnability still implies private learnability in multi-class classification, existing proof techniques encounter substantial challenges in the regression setting. Although the equivalence for regression remains uncertain, we present significant sufficient conditions for a class that is online learnable to also be privately learnable.
