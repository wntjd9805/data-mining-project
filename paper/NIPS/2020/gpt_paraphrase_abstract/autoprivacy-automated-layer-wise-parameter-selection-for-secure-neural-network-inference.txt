The Hybrid Privacy-Preserving Neural Network (HPPNN) is a promising solution for secure Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS). However, it suffers from long inference latency, causing dissatisfaction with MLaaS. This is primarily due to the high computational overhead of the linear layers implemented by Homomorphic Encryption (HE). Previous HPPNNs select large HE parameters to maintain noise budgets, without considering the error tolerance capability of the network. To address this issue, this paper proposes AutoPrivacy, an automated layer-wise parameter selector that utilizes deep reinforcement learning. AutoPrivacy determines a set of HE parameters for each linear layer in the HPPNN, resulting in faster and more accurate secure neural network inference. Compared to previous HPPNNs, the AutoPrivacy-optimized HPPNNs reduce inference latency by 53% to 70%, while maintaining negligible loss of accuracy.
