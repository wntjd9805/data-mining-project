Continuous-time event data, such as individual behavior data and financial transactions, pose challenges for modeling due to the need to predict both event types and occurrence times. The current state-of-the-art approach, recurrent neural networks, assumes all event sequences come from the same data distribution. However, in reality, event sequences may come from different sources with distinct characteristics. This paper proposes a novel approach that extends neural marked point process models to handle mixtures of latent embeddings, where each mixture component represents the traits of a specific user. The proposed method incorporates a latent variable that encodes user characteristics, trained using amortized variational inference. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach in terms of various predictive metrics, including log-likelihood, next event ranking, and source-of-sequence identification.
