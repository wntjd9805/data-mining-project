We propose a new method to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of deep learning models in mapping genomic DNA sequences to functional molecular readouts. These models often suffer from overfitting and produce noisy and unreliable results. To overcome these challenges, we introduce an attribution prior that penalizes high-frequency components of the Fourier spectrum of input-level attribution scores. We evaluate different model architectures and show that our attribution prior significantly improves stability, interpretability, and performance, particularly when training data is limited. Additionally, our method enables the identification of biologically meaningful sequence motifs within regulatory elements with greater sensitivity and precision. The attribution prior is applicable to various model architectures and experimental assays, providing consistent improvements across different experiments. This work represents a significant step forward in enhancing the reliability of deep learning models for understanding the regulatory code of the genome.
