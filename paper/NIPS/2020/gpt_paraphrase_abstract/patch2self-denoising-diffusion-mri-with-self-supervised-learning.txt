Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI) is currently the sole noninvasive technique for evaluating the microstructure and reconstructing white-matter pathways in the human brain. However, DWI data often contains significant additive noise from various sources, which necessitates noise suppression prior to microstructure analysis. In this study, we present Patch2Self, a self-supervised learning approach for denoising DWI data. Patch2Self employs the entire volume to train a locally linear denoiser that has full-rank capability. By leveraging the oversampled q-space of DWI data, Patch2Self is able to distinguish between structure and noise without relying on explicit models for either. Our results demonstrate that Patch2Self effectively improves both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of microstructure modeling, fiber bundle tracking, and model estimation compared to other unsupervised methods. These findings were observed in both real and simulated DWI data.
