We propose a new type of implicit networks called multiscale deep equilibrium model (MDEQ) for large-scale and highly hierarchical pattern recognition tasks. The MDEQ solves for and backpropagates through multiple equilibrium points of different feature resolutions simultaneously, using implicit differentiation to avoid storing intermediate states and minimizing memory consumption. This allows the model to learn multi-resolution features that can be used for various tasks and loss functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MDEQs on two vision tasks: ImageNet classification and semantic segmentation on high-resolution Cityscapes images. In both cases, MDEQs achieve performance comparable to or better than recent competitive computer vision models. This is the first time an implicit deep learning approach has achieved such performance and scale. The code and pre-trained models can be found at [website].
