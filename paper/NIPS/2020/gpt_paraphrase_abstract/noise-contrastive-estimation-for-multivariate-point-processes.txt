We propose a method to reduce the computational cost of maximum likelihood estimation for generative models with positive and negative terms in the log-likelihood. Specifically, for a temporal multivariate point process, we use noise-contrastive estimation, a less expensive stochastic objective. Our approach has provable guarantees for optimality, consistency, and efficiency. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves the same level of log-likelihood on held-out data with considerably fewer function evaluations and less wall-clock time.
