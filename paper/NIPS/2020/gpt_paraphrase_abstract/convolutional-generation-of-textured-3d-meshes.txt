This study addresses the limitation of recent generative models for 2D images, which lack the ability to reason in 3D. To overcome this limitation, the researchers utilize differentiable rendering techniques to develop a framework capable of generating triangle meshes and high-resolution texture maps. They achieve this using 2D supervision from single-view natural images. The novelty of their work lies in encoding the mesh and texture as semantically aligned 2D representations, allowing for easy modeling using a 2D convolutional GAN. The effectiveness of their method is demonstrated on Pascal3D+ Cars and CUB datasets, both in unconditional settings and when the model is conditioned on various factors such as class labels, attributes, and text. Additionally, the researchers propose an evaluation methodology that separately assesses the quality of the mesh and texture.
