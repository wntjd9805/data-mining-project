We present a new approach called Inference Stage Optimization (ISO) to improve the generalizability of 3D human pose estimation models. These models often struggle when faced with new scenarios and unseen poses. Our key insight is that even unlabeled target data contains valuable information about its underlying distribution. To leverage this information, ISO performs geometry-aware self-supervised learning (SSL) on each target instance and updates the 3D pose model before making predictions. This allows the model to quickly adapt to the target scenario and improve its generalization performance. We also propose an online mode for sequential target data, which further enhances the effectiveness of ISO. Through extensive analysis on various benchmarks, we demonstrate that ISO achieves state-of-the-art results, with a 9.7% improvement on the previous best performance.
