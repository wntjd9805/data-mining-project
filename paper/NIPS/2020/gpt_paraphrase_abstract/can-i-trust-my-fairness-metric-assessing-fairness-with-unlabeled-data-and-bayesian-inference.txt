We explore the challenge of evaluating group fairness with limited labeled data but abundant unlabeled data. To address this, we propose a Bayesian framework that combines labeled and unlabeled data to generate more accurate and precise estimates compared to methods solely relying on labeled data. Our approach involves estimating scores for unlabeled examples in each group using a hierarchical latent variable model based on labeled examples. This enables us to infer posterior distributions and quantify uncertainty for various group fairness metrics. Through experiments on popular fairness datasets, sensitive attributes, and predictive models, we demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces estimation error consistently. The results highlight the advantages of utilizing both unlabeled data and Bayesian inference for assessing the fairness of prediction models.
