The Raven's Progressive Matrices test is a multiple-choice intelligence test that involves completing a 3 Ã— 3 grid of abstract images. Previous approaches to this test have focused on selecting the correct answer from the given choices. However, in this study, we aim to generate a correct answer without seeing the choices, which is a more challenging task. Our proposed neural model incorporates various advancements in generative models, such as utilizing multiple pathways within the same network and employing the reparameterization trick to ensure compatibility between encodings. Additionally, we apply dynamic variational losses and a complex perceptual loss coupled with a selective backpropagation procedure. Our algorithm not only generates a set of plausible answers but also performs competitively with state-of-the-art methods in multiple-choice tests. The answer format only presents the abstraction.
