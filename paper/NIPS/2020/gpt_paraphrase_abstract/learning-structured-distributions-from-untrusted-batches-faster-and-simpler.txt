This paper addresses the problem of learning from untrusted batches, originally introduced by Qiao and Valiant. Previous research by Jain and Orlitsky proposed a semidefinite programming approach using the cut-norm, which achieved optimal error in polynomial time. Chen et al. considered a variation of the problem where the underlying distribution has specific structures, such as log-concave or monotone hazard rate. They presented an algorithm that achieves the same error with a sample complexity that is sublinear in the size of the distribution. They used Haar wavelets and achieved quasi-polynomial time complexity. In this paper, we combine the approaches from Jain and Orlitsky and Chen et al. to create an algorithm that has the advantages of both: it runs in polynomial time and can exploit the structure of the distribution to achieve sublinear sample complexity. We also simplify the approach of Jain and Orlitsky by eliminating the need for SDP rounding and providing a more direct interpretation using soft filtering, a recent technique in robust estimation. We validate the effectiveness of our algorithms through preliminary experimental evaluations.
