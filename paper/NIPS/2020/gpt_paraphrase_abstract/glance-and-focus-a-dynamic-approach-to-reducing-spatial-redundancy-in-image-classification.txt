We propose a new framework for efficient image classification using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). By selectively processing smaller inputs from the original image using reinforcement learning, we can achieve adaptive inference at test time. This means that the model can stop computation once it is confident in its prediction, reducing computational cost. Our framework is compatible with various lightweight CNNs and consistently improves the computational efficiency of deep models without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that our method reduces the latency of MobileNet-V3 on an iPhone XS Max by 20%.
