We propose a novel approach called Stein self-repulsive dynamics to generate diverse samples from complex distributions. Our method involves incorporating Stein variational gradient as a repulsive force to push Langevin dynamics samples away from previous trajectories. This simple concept effectively reduces auto-correlation in Langevin dynamics, resulting in an increased effective sample size. Importantly, our theoretical analysis confirms that the addition of the repulsive force does not compromise the accuracy of the asymptotic stationary distribution, thanks to the unique properties of the Stein variational gradient. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms vanilla Langevin dynamics in terms of sample efficiency and uncertainty estimation.
