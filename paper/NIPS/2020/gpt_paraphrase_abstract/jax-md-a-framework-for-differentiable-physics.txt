JAX MD is a software package designed for differentiable physics simulations, particularly molecular dynamics. It offers various physics simulation environments, interaction potentials, and neural networks that can be seamlessly integrated without additional coding. The simulations themselves are differentiable functions, allowing for meta-optimization by differentiating entire trajectories. The package leverages spatial partitioning and other primitive operations to enable scaling to large particle numbers on a single GPU, making it adaptable for workloads beyond molecular dynamics. The capabilities of JAX MD are demonstrated through examples like incorporating graph neural networks into traditional simulations, meta-optimization via particle packings minimization, and a multi-agent flocking simulation.
