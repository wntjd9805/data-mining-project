The understanding of the connections between biomedical terms is crucial in the fight against diseases. Previous attempts to use machine learning for hypothesis generation have been limited in capturing the temporal dynamics of term relations and considering unobserved connections as irrelevant. To overcome these limitations, we present a new approach that predicts future connectivity on a dynamic graph using positive-unlabeled learning. We introduce a variational inference model to estimate the positive prior and incorporate it into the learning of term embeddings for link prediction. Our experiments on biomedical datasets and a COVID-19 dataset confirm the effectiveness of our model.
