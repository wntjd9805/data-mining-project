Recent advancements in geometric deep learning have introduced neural networks that enable inference tasks on three-dimensional geometric data by defining convolution and pooling operations on triangle meshes. However, existing methods either treat the input mesh as a graph without utilizing specific geometric properties for feature aggregation and downsampling, or they are tailored for meshes but rely on a rigid definition of convolution that fails to capture the local topology of the mesh effectively. To address these limitations and combine the benefits of both approaches, we propose a method that extends a primal-dual framework from graph-neural-network literature to triangle meshes. Our approach defines convolutions on two types of graphs constructed from the input mesh and incorporates features for both edges and faces of the 3D mesh using an attention mechanism. Additionally, we introduce a pooling operation with a precise geometric interpretation that can handle variations in mesh connectivity by clustering mesh faces based on the task at hand. Theoretical insights are provided using tools from the mesh-simplification literature, and experimental validation demonstrates comparable or superior performance to the state of the art in shape classification and shape segmentation tasks.
