This paper presents a novel approach to address the issue of noisy labels in deep neural networks. Unlike existing methods that rely on the posterior probability of a noisy classifier, our method focuses on the spatial behavior of data in the latent representational space. By utilizing the high-order topological information of the data, we are able to effectively gather clean data and train a high-quality model. Theoretical analysis confirms that our topological approach guarantees a high probability of collecting clean data. Empirical results demonstrate that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques and exhibits robustness against various types and levels of noise.
