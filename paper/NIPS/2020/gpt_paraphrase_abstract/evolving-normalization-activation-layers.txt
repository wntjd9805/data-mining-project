The proposal suggests an automated approach to designing normalization layers and activation functions in deep networks. Instead of designing them separately, the proposal suggests unifying them into a single computation graph and evolving its structure using basic mathematical functions. This approach leads to the discovery of EvoNorms, a set of new normalization-activation layers with unique structures that go beyond existing design patterns. The proposal addresses the challenge of searching through a large and sparse space by developing efficient rejection protocols and using multi-objective evolution to optimize each layer's performance. Experimental results show that EvoNorms perform well on various image classification models and also transfer well to other tasks such as instance segmentation and image synthesis, outperforming other types of normalization layers in many cases.
