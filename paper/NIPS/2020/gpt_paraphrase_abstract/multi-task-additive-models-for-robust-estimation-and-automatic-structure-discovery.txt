Additive models have gained significant attention for regression estimation and variable selection in high-dimensional datasets. However, these models are typically limited to single-task learning frameworks that rely heavily on prior knowledge about variable structures and are evaluated using the mean squared error criterion. In real-world scenarios with high-dimensional observations, such as Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) data, the performance of existing methods may suffer due to complex non-Gaussian noise and a lack of prior knowledge about variable structures. To address this issue, we propose Multi-task Additive Models (MAM), a new class of additive models that integrates the mode-induced metric, structure-based regularizer, and additive hypothesis spaces into a bilevel optimization framework. Our approach is suitable for high-dimensional data with different types of complex noise, such as skewed noise, heavy-tailed noise, and outliers, and does not rely on prior knowledge about variable structures. We provide a smooth iterative optimization algorithm with guaranteed convergence to efficiently implement MAM. Experimental results on simulations and CMEs analysis demonstrate that our approach offers competitive performance for robust estimation and automatic structure discovery.
