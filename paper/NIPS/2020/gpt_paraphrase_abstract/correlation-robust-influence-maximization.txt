We propose a new model for the problem of maximizing influence in a network. Unlike the traditional model, our model considers an adversarial diffusion process that is tailored to the choice of seed set. This means that instead of assuming independence among influence relationships, we aim to find a seed set that maximizes the expected influence under the worst correlation scenario. We demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently compute this worst-case influence, and although the optimization problem is difficult, we can guarantee an approximation ratio of (1-1/e). Additionally, we analyze the structure of the adversary's diffusion process and compare it to existing models. In addition to computational advantages, we also show through numerical experiments that the assumption of independence may lead to suboptimal results.
