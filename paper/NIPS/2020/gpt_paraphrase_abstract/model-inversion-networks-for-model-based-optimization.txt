This study focuses on solving data-driven optimization problems where the objective is to find an input that maximizes a score or reward function using a dataset of inputs and their corresponding scores. When the inputs are high-dimensional and valid inputs are a small subset of this space (e.g., valid protein sequences or natural images), traditional optimization becomes extremely challenging as the optimizer needs to avoid invalid inputs. To tackle this issue, we propose using model inversion networks (MINs), which learn a mapping from scores to inputs. MINs can handle high-dimensional input spaces and utilize logged data for both contextual and non-contextual optimization problems. They can also work with offline data sources as well as actively collected data. We evaluate the effectiveness of MINs on various high-dimensional optimization problems involving images, protein designs, neural network controller parameters, and bandit optimization using logged data.
