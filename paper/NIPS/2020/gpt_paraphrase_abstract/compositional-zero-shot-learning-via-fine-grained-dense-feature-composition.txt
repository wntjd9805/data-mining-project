We present a new generative model for zero-shot learning, which can identify fine-grained classes without any training examples. Our research indicates that generating overall features for unseen classes is inadequate in capturing the subtle differences between classes. To address this, we propose a feature composition framework that extracts attribute-based features from training samples and combines them to create detailed features for unseen classes. This approach allows us to selectively compose features using relevant training samples, resulting in diverse composed features. Instead of creating a global feature for each unseen class, we utilize all attribute-based features to construct a dense representation that includes fine-grained attribute details. To recognize unseen classes, we introduce a unique training method that employs a discriminative model to construct features and subsequently trains itself using these features. This eliminates the need for separate generative models. Experimental results on popular datasets, including DeepFashion, AWA2, CUB, and SUN, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods.
