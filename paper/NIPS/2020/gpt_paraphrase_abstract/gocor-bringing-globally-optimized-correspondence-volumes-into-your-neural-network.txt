The feature correlation layer is an important component in computer vision problems that involve matching between image pairs. However, the current method of point-to-point feature comparison is not effective in distinguishing between similar regions in an image, which negatively impacts performance. To address this issue, we propose GOCor, a fully differentiable dense matching module that replaces the feature correlation layer. Our module generates a correspondence volume by considering similar regions in the scene and also learns spatial matching priors to resolve ambiguities. Extensive experiments show that integrating GOCor into state-of-the-art networks improves performance in tasks such as geometric matching, optical flow, and dense semantic matching. The code and trained models for GOCor will be available on github.com/PruneTruong/GOCor.
