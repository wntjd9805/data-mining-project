Dealing with multi-relational graphs using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is challenging due to their evolving nature and the presence of newly emerged entities with few links. To address this challenge, we propose a few-shot out-of-graph link prediction problem where we predict links between both seen and unseen nodes, with only a few edges per node. We introduce a novel transductive meta-learning framework called Graph Extrapolation Networks (GEN) that learns node embeddings for inductive inference and link prediction for transductive inference. To model uncertainty in transductive link prediction, we incorporate a stochastic embedding layer. Our model outperforms relevant baselines in knowledge graph completion and drug-drug interaction prediction tasks.
