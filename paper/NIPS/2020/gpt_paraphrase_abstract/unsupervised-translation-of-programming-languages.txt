A transcompiler, also referred to as a source-to-source translator, is a system used to convert source code from one high-level programming language to another. It is commonly employed for the purpose of interoperability and migrating codebases from outdated or deprecated languages to modern ones. These transcompilers typically rely on manual rewrite rules applied to the abstract syntax tree of the source code. However, the resulting translations often lack readability, fail to adhere to the conventions of the target language, and require manual modifications for proper functioning. Consequently, the overall translation process is time-consuming and costly, requiring expertise in both the source and target languages.While neural models have demonstrated superior performance in natural language translation, their application in transcompilation has been limited due to the scarcity of parallel data in this domain. This paper proposes the utilization of recent techniques in unsupervised machine translation to develop a fully unsupervised neural transcompiler. The model is trained on source code obtained from open-source projects on GitHub, and it exhibits high accuracy in translating functions between C++, Java, and Python. Notably, our method relies solely on monolingual source code, eliminating the need for expertise in either the source or target language, and can be easily extended to other programming languages. Additionally, we construct and release a test set consisting of 852 parallel functions, accompanied by unit tests to verify the accuracy of the translations. Our model surpasses rule-based commercial baselines by a significant margin.
