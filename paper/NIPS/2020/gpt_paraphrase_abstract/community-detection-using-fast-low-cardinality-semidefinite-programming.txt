Modularity maximization is a widely used method for analyzing network community structure. However, solving the optimization problem associated with it is challenging. Existing algorithms like Louvain and Leiden employ heuristics to escape local optima but still rely on a greedy step that can lead to being stuck. In this study, we introduce a novel low-cardinality algorithm that extends the local update approach by maximizing a semidefinite relaxation based on max-k-cut. Our proposed algorithm is scalable and achieves global semidefinite optimality in small cases. Furthermore, it outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in real-world datasets without significant additional time. This approach also paves the way for scaling up semidefinite programming for sparse solutions, rather than low-rank ones.
