Despite recent advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), explaining the predictions made by GNNs remains a difficult challenge. Current methods focus on providing local explanations, which only interpret the important subgraph structure and node features for a single instance. This approach leads to customized explanations for each instance, lacking a global understanding of the GNN model and hindering its generalizability in the inductive setting. Additionally, explaining a set of instances, such as graphs of a given class, is challenging using existing methods. To address these challenges, we propose PGExplainer, a parameterized explainer for GNNs. PGExplainer utilizes a deep neural network to parameterize the explanation generation process, allowing for a natural approach to explaining multiple instances collectively. Compared to existing methods, PGExplainer demonstrates better generalization ability and easy applicability in an inductive setting. Experimental results on synthetic and real-life datasets show highly competitive performance, with up to 24.7% relative improvement in AUC for explaining graph classification compared to the leading baseline.
