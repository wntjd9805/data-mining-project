Flow models have made significant advancements in modeling ordinal discrete data like images and audio. However, when these models are used for discrete data, dequantization is typically employed to handle their continuous nature, resulting in lower bound estimates of likelihood. In this paper, we introduce a new class of flows called subsetflows, which can transform finite volumes in a computationally tractable manner, enabling exact likelihood computation for discrete data. We show that ordinal discrete autoregressive models, including WaveNets, PixelCNNs, and Transformers, can be represented as single-layer flows based on subsetflows. By formulating the models as flows, we compare their performance when trained and evaluated using either the exact likelihood or the dequantization lower bound. Furthermore, we explore multilayer flows composed of PixelCNNs and non-autoregressive coupling layers and achieve state-of-the-art results on the CIFAR-10 dataset for flow models trained with dequantization.
