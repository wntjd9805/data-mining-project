A discrete probability measure supported on N atoms and a set of n real-valued functions can be reduced in complexity by finding a probability measure supported on a subset of n + 1 of the original N atoms that has the same mean when integrated against each of the n functions. We propose a simple geometric characterization of barycenters using negative cones and develop a randomized algorithm that computes this new measure through "greedy geometric sampling". By studying its properties and testing it on synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the potential benefits of this approach in scenarios where N is much larger than n. A Python implementation of our algorithm is available at https://github.com/FraCose/Recombination_Random_Algos.
