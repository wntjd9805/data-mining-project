This study examines the possibility of machines learning and utilizing variables, similar to how humans do, without any prior human engineering. The authors propose Uniﬁcation Networks, a differentiable neural network approach that can extract invariants from examples and use them to solve tasks. The key feature of this architecture is soft uniﬁcation, which allows the network to identify variables and learn invariants by generalizing parts of the input. The authors evaluate their approach on five datasets and show that learning invariants captures patterns in the data and enhances performance compared to baseline methods.
