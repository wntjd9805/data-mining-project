Optimal Transport (OT) distances, like Wasserstein, have found applications in various fields such as GANs and domain adaptation. However, OT is sensitive to outliers in the data due to the equal weighting of all samples in its objective function. To address this issue, previous studies have proposed robust formulations of OT with unbalanced marginal constraints. Nevertheless, applying these methods to deep learning problems, like GANs and domain adaptation, is challenging due to the instability of their dual optimization solvers. This paper presents a solution by introducing a computationally-efficient dual form of robust OT optimization that is suitable for modern deep learning applications. The effectiveness of this formulation is demonstrated in GANs and domain adaptation tasks. The proposed optimization method allows training of top-performing GAN models on datasets corrupted with outlier distributions. Additionally, the robust OT formulation improves accuracy in domain adaptation when compared to standard adversarial adaptation methods.
