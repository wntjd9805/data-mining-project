The abstract discusses the importance of stationary stochastic processes (SPs) in probabilistic models for spatio-temporal data. These SPs leverage the statistical symmetry of physical phenomena to aid in generalization. The abstract introduces the Convolutional Neural Process (ConvNP), which adds translation equivariance to Neural Processes (NPs) and extends convolutional conditional NPs to incorporate dependencies in the predictive distribution. This allows ConvNPs to be used in settings that require coherent samples. Additionally, a new maximum-likelihood objective is proposed to simplify the framework and improve performance. The abstract concludes by highlighting the strong performance and generalization capabilities of ConvNPs in various tasks involving real-world spatio-temporal data.
