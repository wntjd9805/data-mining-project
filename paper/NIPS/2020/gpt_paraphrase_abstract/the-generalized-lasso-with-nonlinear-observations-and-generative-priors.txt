This paper examines the problem of estimating a signal from noisy non-linear measurements. The signal is assumed to be in the range of an L-Lipschitz continuous generative model with bounded k-dimensional inputs. The paper considers sub-Gaussian measurements, which are common in various measurement models such as linear, logistic, 1-bit, and quantized models. The impact of adversarial corruptions on these measurements is also taken into account. The analysis is based on a generalized Lasso approach. The paper provides a non-uniform recovery guarantee, stating that under i.i.d. Gaussian measurements, a sufficient number of samples can lead to recovery with a small error. The approach is also robust to adversarial noise. The paper applies this result to neural network generative models and discusses extensions to other models and non-i.i.d. measurements. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the result can be extended to a uniform recovery guarantee under the assumption of a local embedding property, which is satisfied by 1-bit and censored Tobit models.
