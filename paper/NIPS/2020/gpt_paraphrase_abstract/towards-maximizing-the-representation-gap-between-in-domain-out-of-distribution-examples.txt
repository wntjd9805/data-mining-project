The Dirichlet Prior Network (DPN) is an uncertainty estimation approach that effectively models various types of predictive uncertainty. However, when faced with in-domain examples that have high data uncertainties across multiple classes, the DPN model tends to generate representations that are difficult to distinguish from out-of-distribution (OOD) examples, thus impacting its OOD detection performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new loss function for DPN that aims to enhance the distinction between in-domain and OOD examples. Our experimental results consistently show that our proposed approach significantly improves OOD detection performance.
