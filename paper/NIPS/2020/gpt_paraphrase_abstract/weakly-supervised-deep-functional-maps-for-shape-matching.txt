Recent advancements in deep functional maps have led to the development of various methods, ranging from fully supervised to unsupervised approaches, each utilizing different loss functions and regularization terms. However, it remains unclear what the essential components are for a deep functional map pipeline and whether these components can encompass and generalize the recent work in this field. Through empirical evidence, we demonstrate the minimum requirements for achieving state-of-the-art results using different loss functions, both in supervised and unsupervised settings. Additionally, we introduce a novel framework that excels in full-to-full and partial-to-full shape matching, surpassing even fully supervised methods, on multiple benchmark datasets.
