This paper aims to enhance object detection performance by combining verification and regression methodologies in neural networks. The current state-of-the-art object detection method, RepPoints, heavily relies on regression for object localization, which can be improved. To address this, we introduce verification tasks into RepPoints, resulting in RepPoints v2. Through experiments on the COCO object detection benchmark, we demonstrate that RepPoints v2 consistently outperforms the original RepPoints by approximately 2.0 mAP. Additionally, RepPoints v2 achieves a 52.1 mAP on COCO test-dev using a single model. Furthermore, we show that this approach can be applied to elevate other object detection frameworks and tasks like instance segmentation. The code for RepPoints v2 is available at https://github.com/Scalsol/RepPointsV2.
