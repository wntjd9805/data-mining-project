Localization by image retrieval is a cost-effective and scalable method that relies on simple mapping and matching techniques. However, the accuracy of localization depends on the quality of the image features, which are often obtained using contrastive learning. Most contrastive learning strategies aim to distinguish between different classes, but in the context of localization, there is no natural definition of classes. To overcome this issue, images are artificially divided into positive and negative classes based on their geometric proximity to anchor images. This approach poses problems for learning localization features, as the supervision for images near the proximity threshold is inherently ambiguous. In this paper, we propose a novel technique that utilizes soft positive and negative assignments for contrastive learning, avoiding the issues associated with artificial divisions. Our approach gradually distinguishes between close and far images in both geometric and feature space. Experiments conducted on four large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that our soft contrastive learning method outperforms the current state-of-the-art approach for retrieval-based visual localization.
