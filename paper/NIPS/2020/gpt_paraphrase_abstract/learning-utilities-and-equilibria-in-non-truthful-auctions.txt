In auctions where participants may not be truthful, an agent's strategy depends on the strategies of their opponents and the prior distribution of their private information. The set of Bayes Nash equilibria is typically influenced by the prior. Using the First Price Auction as an example, we demonstrate that approximately O(n/(epsilon)^2) samples from the prior, with n agents, are sufficient for an algorithm to learn the interim utilities for all monotone bidding strategies. This number of samples also allows for the learning of all approximate equilibria. We provide a nearly matching lower bound for the sample complexity of learning utilities. Additionally, we examine a scenario where agents must pay a cost to determine their own types and find a connection between this setting and the first price auction. We show that approximately O(n/(epsilon)^2) samples are enough to estimate utilities and equilibria in a descending auction that is near welfare-optimal. In the process, we improve upon the sample complexity bound for the Pandora's Box problem, a model for sequential consumer search.
