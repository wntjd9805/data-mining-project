The Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) has been successful in various graph-based learning tasks. It has been extended to handle multi-relational graphs and hypergraphs. However, real-world datasets involving text and knowledge have more complex relationships, including multi-relational, recursive, and ordered hyperedges. Adapting MPNN to handle variable-sized hyperedges in these structures poses unique challenges. In this study, we propose a unified framework called G-MPNN, which combines existing MPNNs for different structures. Additionally, we introduce MPNN-R, an extension of the framework specifically designed to handle recursively-structured data. Experimental results show the effectiveness of both G-MPNN and MPNN-R. The code for these models is available.
