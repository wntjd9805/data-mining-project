This study aims to develop a learnable output representation that can generate continuous, high-resolution outputs of various shapes. Previous research has used neural networks to represent 3D surfaces implicitly, which has improved resolution and the ability to represent different topologies. However, these neural implicit representations are limited to closed surfaces, which poses challenges in data pre-processing and the generation of open surfaces. To address this limitation, the authors propose Neural Distance Fields (NDF), a neural network-based model that predicts the unsigned distance field for arbitrary 3D shapes using sparse point clouds. NDF can represent surfaces at high resolutions without requiring closed surface data, expanding the range of shapes that can be generated. The model allows for the extraction of surfaces as dense point clouds and meshes, as well as the calculation of surface normals and rendering using sphere tracing. The authors also demonstrate that NDF can be used for multi-target regression and can approximate open surfaces such as curves, manifolds, and functions. Experimental results on ShapeNet dataset show that NDF outperforms existing methods in reconstructing shapes with inner structures. The code for NDF is available for research purposes.
