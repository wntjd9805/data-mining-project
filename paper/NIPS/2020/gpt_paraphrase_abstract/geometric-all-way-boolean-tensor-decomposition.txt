The use of Boolean tensors to represent high dimensional logical data collected on various domains has become widespread. Decomposing a binary tensor into the Boolean sum of multiple rank-1 tensors, also known as Boolean Tensor Decomposition (BTD), is a challenging problem that is NP-hard. Existing BTD methods have been limited by their computational cost, especially when applied to large scale or higher order tensors. To address this issue, we introduce a computationally efficient BTD algorithm called Geometric Expansion for all-order Tensor Factorization (GETF), which identifies the rank-1 basis components of a tensor sequentially from a geometric perspective. We provide rigorous theoretical analysis to validate the effectiveness and efficiency of GETF in decomposing all-order tensors. Experimental results using both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that GETF outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and extraction of latent structures. Additionally, GETF is significantly faster, being an order of magnitude quicker than existing approaches.
