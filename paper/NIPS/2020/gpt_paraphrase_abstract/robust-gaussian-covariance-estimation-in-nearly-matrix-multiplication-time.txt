The problem of robust covariance estimation in high-dimensional statistics involves finding the best estimate of the covariance matrix, given a set of samples corrupted by outliers. Previous research has developed an algorithm that achieves near-optimal error with a runtime that depends on the number of samples, dimensionality, and condition number of the covariance matrix. However, when the fraction of corrupted samples is small, the runtime becomes prohibitively large. In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed that achieves the same statistical guarantees but with a runtime that only depends on the matrix multiplication time and the condition number. The runtime of the new algorithm is independent of the fraction of corrupted samples. When the covariance matrix is well-conditioned, the runtime of the new algorithm matches that of the fastest algorithm for covariance estimation without outliers, demonstrating the ability to achieve robustness at no additional computational cost.
