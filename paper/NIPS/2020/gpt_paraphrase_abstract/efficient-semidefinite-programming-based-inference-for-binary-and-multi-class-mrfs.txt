Probabilistic inference in pairwise Markov Random Fields (MRFs) is a fundamental problem in probabilistic graphical models. While semidefinite programming relaxations have been a powerful tool for analyzing probabilistic inference, their practicality has been limited due to the high computational cost of typical solvers. This paper presents an efficient method for computing the partition function or MAP estimate in a pairwise MRF by utilizing a coordinate-descent-based fast semidefinite solver. Additionally, the semidefinite relaxations are extended from binary MRFs to the multi-class setting, and a compact relaxation is developed that can be efficiently solved using the solver. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of solution quality and speed, as demonstrated on benchmark problems. Furthermore, the approach is scalable to large MRF domains such as fully-connected pairwise CRF models used in computer vision.
