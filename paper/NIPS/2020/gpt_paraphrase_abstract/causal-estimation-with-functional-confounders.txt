Causal inference relies on two key assumptions: ignorability and positivity. This study focuses on a specific scenario called estimation with functional confounders (EFC), where the true confounder value can be expressed as a function of the observed data. In this setting, ignorability is met, but positivity is violated, making causal inference generally impossible. However, we identify two cases where causal effects can be estimated. First, we explore interventions on a subset of the treatment known as functional interventions, and propose a condition called functional positivity for estimating their effects. Second, we develop conditions for nonparametric effect estimation based on the gradient fields of the functional confounder and the true outcome function. To estimate effects under these conditions, we introduce Level-set Orthogonal Descent Estimation (LODE). We also provide error bounds for LODE's effect estimates, evaluate our methods using simulated and real data, and empirically demonstrate the value of EFC.
