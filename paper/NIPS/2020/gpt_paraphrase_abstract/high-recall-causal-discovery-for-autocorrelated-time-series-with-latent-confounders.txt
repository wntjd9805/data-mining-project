We introduce a novel approach to causal discovery from observational time series, considering both linear and nonlinear relationships and accounting for latent confounders. We find that existing methods like FCI have limited success in identifying causal relationships in autocorrelated time series, primarily due to the small effect size of conditional independence tests. To address this issue, we propose an iterative procedure that incorporates orientation rules to identify causal parents early in the process. We demonstrate that our method is order-independent and achieves high recall in simulations with autocorrelated continuous variables, while controlling false positives. The performance of our method improves with stronger autocorrelation. Python code for all methods used in our simulations is available at github.com/jakobrunge/tigramite.
