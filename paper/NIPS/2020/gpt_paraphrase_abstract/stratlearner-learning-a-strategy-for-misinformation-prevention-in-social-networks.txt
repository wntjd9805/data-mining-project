This paper explores the possibility of learning a strategy to solve a combinatorial optimization problem without knowing its objective function. The focus is on the misinformation prevention problem, where the goal is to learn a strategy to compute protectors against future attackers based on examples of attacker-protector pairs. The authors propose a structured prediction framework that uses random features constructed through distance functions on randomly sampled subgraphs to parameterize the scoring function. This leads to a kernelized scoring function with weights that can be learned using the large margin method. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can generate near-optimal protectors without any knowledge of the diffusion model, and it outperforms other graph-based and learning-based methods significantly.
