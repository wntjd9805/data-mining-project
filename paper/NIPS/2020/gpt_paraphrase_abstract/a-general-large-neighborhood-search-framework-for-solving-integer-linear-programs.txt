This paper examines a data-driven algorithm design strategy for solving large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. The objective is to develop new approaches that can consistently outperform existing solvers in terms of time efficiency. The focus is on solving integer linear programs, utilizing the large neighborhood search (LNS) paradigm. LNS selects a subset of variables to optimize while keeping the rest fixed, making it compatible with any existing solver. This allows LNS to benefit from the well-designed heuristics and complete approaches of these solvers. The study demonstrates that a strong neighborhood selector can be learned using imitation and reinforcement learning techniques. Extensive empirical validation in bounded-time optimization shows that our LNS framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art commercial solvers like Gurobi.
