Differentially private algorithms often rely on sampling from the distribution exp(−f), where f is a suitable function. However, when the domain of the distribution is high-dimensional, sampling can be computationally difficult. Using heuristic sampling schemes like Gibbs sampling does not guarantee privacy. Polynomial-time algorithms based on log-concave sampling work for convex functions, but with large polynomials. Langevin dynamics-based algorithms offer faster alternatives under certain distance measures. In this study, we demonstrate rapid convergence of these algorithms under distance measures more appropriate for differential privacy. For smooth, strongly-convex functions, we present the first evidence of convergence in Rényi divergence, enabling fast differentially private algorithms. Our techniques are simple and applicable to underdamped Langevin dynamics as well.
