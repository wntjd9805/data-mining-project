Graph convolution networks (GCNs) are widely used for graph classification. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both graph topology and node attributes. While several attack and defense algorithms have been developed, there is currently no robustness certification for GCN-based graph classification under topological perturbations with both local and global budgets. This paper introduces the first certification method for this problem. The proposed approach leverages Lagrange dualization and convex envelope to provide tight approximation bounds that can be efficiently computed using dynamic programming. When combined with robust training, this method enables a larger number of graphs to be certified as robust.
