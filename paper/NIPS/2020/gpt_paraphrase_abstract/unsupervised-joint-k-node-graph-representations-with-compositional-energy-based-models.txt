Current methods for learning unsupervised graph representations in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) focus on predicting observed edges to learn node and edge representations. While these approaches have improved node classification tasks, they are ineffective in representing larger sets of nodes (k>2). This paper presents MHM-GNN, an inductive unsupervised graph representation method that combines joint k-node representations with energy-based models (hypergraph Markov networks) and GNNs. To address the intractability of the loss resulting from this combination, the optimization is equipped with a loss upper bound using a finite-sample unbiased Markov Chain Monte Carlo estimator. Experimental results demonstrate that the unsupervised joint k-node representations produced by MHM-GNN outperform existing approaches in the literature.
