A new approach called CogMol (Controlled Generation of Molecules) is proposed for designing effective drugs to target the unique SARS-CoV-2 virus. CogMol combines pre-training of a molecular SMILES Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a controlled sampling scheme guided by attribute predictors. It leverages a protein-molecule binding affinity predictor trained on large data sets to generate optimal drug-like molecules for new viral targets. The framework was applied to three SARS-CoV-2 target proteins and generated novel candidates at both the molecular and chemical scaffold levels. CogMol also includes in silico screening for toxicity assessment, synthetic feasibility prediction, and docking simulations to evaluate binding to target proteins. The docking simulations showed favorable binding of the generated molecules to the target protein structures. The majority of designed compounds had low predicted toxicity and high synthetic feasibility compared to approved drugs. Overall, CogMol enables the design of synthesizable, low-toxicity, and target-specific drug-like molecules without the need for fine-tuning or target structure information.
