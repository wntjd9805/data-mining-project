We have developed a new compression algorithm for LiDAR sensor data streams that effectively reduces storage requirements. Our algorithm takes advantage of spatio-temporal relationships among multiple LiDAR sweeps to reduce the bitrate of both geometry and intensity values. To achieve this, we have introduced a unique conditional entropy model that considers coarse level geometry and previous sweeps' geometric and intensity information to determine the probabilities of the octree symbols. This probability information is then used to encode the entire data stream into a more compact form. Our experiments have shown that our method significantly decreases the joint geometry and intensity bitrate compared to existing LiDAR compression techniques, achieving reductions of 7-17% and 6-19% on the UrbanCity and SemanticKITTI datasets, respectively.
