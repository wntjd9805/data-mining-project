This study proposes an unsupervised learning framework for combinatorial optimization (CO) problems on graphs. The goal is to find integral solutions of high quality even without labeled instances. The approach is inspired by ErdÀùos' probabilistic method and involves using a neural network to parameterize a probability distribution over sets. By optimizing the network with an appropriate loss function, the learned distribution is able to contain a low-cost integral solution that satisfies the constraints of the CO problem with controlled probability. The probabilistic proof of existence is then used to decode the desired solutions. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through experiments on the maximum clique problem and local graph clustering, where the method achieves competitive results on both real datasets and challenging synthetic instances.
