This study addresses the challenge of accounting for intra-set dependent features among elements in reasoning over an unordered instance composed of vectors. The property of permutation equivariance, where the elements' features remain unchanged regardless of the input's order, poses a difficult constraint for neural architectures. While previous approaches have suggested global pooling and attention-based solutions, these may not effectively capture intradependencies. To overcome this, the authors propose a more general formulation using ordinary differential equations (ODE) called Exchangeable Neural ODE (ExNODE). This module can be applied to both discriminative and generative tasks. The study also introduces a VAE-based model for temporal set modeling, extending set modeling to the temporal dimension. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to strong baselines.
