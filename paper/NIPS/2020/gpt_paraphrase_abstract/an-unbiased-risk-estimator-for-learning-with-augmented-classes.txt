This paper investigates the problem of learning with augmented classes (LAC), where new classes that were not observed during training may appear during testing. Previous studies have focused on discovering these augmented classes based on geometric properties, which yielded promising results but lacked theoretical understanding, particularly in terms of generalization ability. In this paper, we demonstrate that by using unlabeled training data to estimate the potential distribution of augmented classes, we can establish an unbiased risk estimator for the LAC problem, assuming certain mild conditions. This provides a foundation for developing a reliable approach with theoretical guarantees. Furthermore, our proposed approach is capable of adapting to complex and changing environments, where augmented classes may emerge and the prior knowledge of known classes may also change. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach.
