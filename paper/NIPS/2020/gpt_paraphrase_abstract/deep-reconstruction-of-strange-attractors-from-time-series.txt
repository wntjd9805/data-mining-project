Many methods for inferring latent dynamics from limited measurements assume that the measurements have higher dimensionality than the underlying system. However, we explore the opposite scenario where hidden governing coordinates must be inferred from a low-dimensional time series. Inspired by classical analysis techniques for chaotic attractors, we introduce a new embedding technique using an autoencoder trained with a novel latent-space loss function. Our technique outperforms existing methods in reconstructing synthetic and real-world strange attractors, and it also creates consistent representations for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the versatility of our technique by discovering dynamical attractors in various systems, including patient electrocardiograms, household electricity usage, neural spiking, and eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser. This highlights the wide range of applications for our technique in exploratory data analysis.
