This study presents TGLS, a new framework for unsupervised Text Generation by Learning from Search. The approach involves using a powerful search algorithm, such as simulated annealing, to evaluate the quality of sentences based on a heuristic measure. A conditional generative model is then trained using the search results to learn from them and reduce noise. This search and learning process can be repeated to improve performance. The effectiveness of TGLS is demonstrated in two real-world natural language generation tasks: unsupervised paraphrasing and text formalization. The results show that TGLS outperforms unsupervised baseline methods in both tasks and achieves comparable performance to strong supervised methods in paraphrase generation.
