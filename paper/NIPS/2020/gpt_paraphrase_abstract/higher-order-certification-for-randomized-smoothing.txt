Randomized smoothing is a defense mechanism against adversarial attacks that has achieved state-of-the-art provable robustness against certain perturbations. While previous studies have extended the guarantees to other metrics, the current framework's certified safety region can be arbitrarily small compared to the optimal. In this study, we propose a framework to improve the certified safety region without altering the underlying smoothing scheme. Our theoretical contributions include generalizing the certification for randomized smoothing by reformulating the certified radius calculation as an optimization problem. We also provide methods to calculate the certified safety region using different orders of information and design efficient estimators for relevant statistics. By combining these contributions, we are able to certify significantly larger safety regions than current methods. Our approach achieves notable improvements on certified radii for different attacks on CIFAR10 and Imagenet datasets. Additionally, our framework may provide a way to overcome current limitations in achieving higher magnitudes of certified radii without relying on data-dependent smoothing techniques.
