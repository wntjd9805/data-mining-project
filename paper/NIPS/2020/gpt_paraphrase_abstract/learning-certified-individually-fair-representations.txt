Fair representation learning is a useful approach for ensuring fairness while still maintaining usefulness for users. Individual fairness, which ensures similar treatment for similar individuals, is a desirable set of fairness constraints. This study introduces a novel method that allows data consumers to obtain certificates of individual fairness for both existing and new data points. The method involves mapping similar individuals to close latent representations and using this proximity to certify individual fairness. By ensuring that all similar individuals are at a maximum distance, data consumers can certify individual fairness by proving the robustness of their classifiers. The approach was evaluated on five real-world datasets and various fairness constraints, showing its effectiveness and scalability.
