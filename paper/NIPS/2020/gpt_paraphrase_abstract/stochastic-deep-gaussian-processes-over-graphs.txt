This paper introduces Stochastic Deep Gaussian Processes over Graphs (DGPG), a deep Gaussian model that learns the mappings between input and output signals in graph domains. The latent variables' approximate posterior distributions are obtained using variational inference, and the evidence lower bound is optimized using a recursive sampling scheme. The Bayesian non-parametric nature of the model prevents overfitting, while its deep structure allows it to learn complex relationships. Experimental results demonstrate that DGPG outperforms a Gaussian-based approach and performs competitively with a state-of-the-art method in traffic flow prediction, across both small and large datasets. Furthermore, the model can capture uncertainties in a mathematically principled manner and automatically identify relevant vertices and features for prediction.
