Deep generative models often struggle in real-world scenarios due to the diversity of natural datasets. This diversity arises from the presence of different types of features (categorical, ordinal, continuous, etc.) and the variations in the marginal distributions of features of the same type. To address this issue, we introduce a modified version of variational autoencoders (VAEs) called VAEM, which is designed specifically for handling heterogeneous data. VAEM is a deep generative model that undergoes a two-stage training process. In the first stage, it creates a more uniform representation of the data, which is then used by the second stage to overcome the challenges posed by the heterogeneous nature of the data. We also extend VAEM to handle partially observed data and demonstrate its effectiveness in tasks such as data generation, missing data prediction, and sequential feature selection. Our experiments highlight the ability of VAEM to expand the range of real-world applications where deep generative models can be successfully utilized.
