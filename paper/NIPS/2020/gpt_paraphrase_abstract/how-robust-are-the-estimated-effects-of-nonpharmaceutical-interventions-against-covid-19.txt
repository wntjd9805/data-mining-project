This study examines the impact of modeling assumptions on the effectiveness estimates of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) against COVID-19. Two advanced models are investigated, and six variations with different structural assumptions are proposed. The study focuses on the generalizability of NPI effectiveness estimates to unseen countries and their sensitivity to unobserved factors. Models that consider noise in disease transmission perform well. The robustness of estimates to different epidemiological parameters and data choices is also evaluated. Results suggest that models assuming transmission noise produce consistently robust results. The study concludes by discussing the interpretation of NPI effectiveness estimates when common assumptions do not hold.
