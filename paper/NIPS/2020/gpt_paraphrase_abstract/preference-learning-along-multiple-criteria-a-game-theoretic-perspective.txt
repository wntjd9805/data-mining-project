The extensive literature on ranking from ordinal data offers various methods to aggregate overall preferences from pairwise comparisons. One such method is the von Neumann winner, which is derived from Nash equilibriums in zero-sum games based on preference matrices. However, real-world problems often involve multiple criteria with different pairwise preferences for each criterion. To address this, we propose a generalization of the von Neumann winner concept using Blackwell's approachability. Our framework allows for non-linear aggregation of preferences across criteria and extends the linearization-based approach from multi-objective optimization. Theoretical analysis shows that the Blackwell winner in a multi-criteria problem can be computed as a solution to a convex optimization problem. Moreover, through random samples of pairwise comparisons, we demonstrate that a simple estimator achieves optimal or near-optimal minimax sample complexity. We also provide a practical application of our framework in a user study on autonomous driving, where the Blackwell winner outperforms the von Neumann winner in overall preferences.
