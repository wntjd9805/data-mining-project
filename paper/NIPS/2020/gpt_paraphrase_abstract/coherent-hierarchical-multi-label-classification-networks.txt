Hierarchical multi-label classification (HMC) is a complex classification task that adds a constraint on classes by using a hierarchy. In this study, we introduce C-HMCNN(h), a new method for HMC problems. C-HMCNN(h) utilizes the hierarchy information to generate predictions that align with the constraint and enhance performance. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that C-HMCNN(h) outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of performance.
