This study focuses on the need for reliable inference methods in bandit algorithms, which are increasingly used in scientific and industrial applications. The research introduces the Batched OLS estimator (BOLS) as an alternative to the ordinary least squares estimator (OLS) for data collected in batches using bandit algorithms. The study proves that OLS is not asymptotically normal on data collected with standard bandit algorithms when there is no unique optimal arm, leading to potential errors and inaccurate confidence intervals. On the other hand, BOLS is shown to be asymptotically normal on data collected from both multi-arm and contextual bandits, and it can handle non-stationarity in the baseline reward.
