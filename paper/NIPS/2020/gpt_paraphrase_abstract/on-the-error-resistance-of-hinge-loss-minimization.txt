This study investigates the resilience of commonly used machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines, to errors in training data. The authors identify specific conditions under which these algorithms can accurately learn the correct classifier. By establishing a unified framework, the researchers demonstrate the robustness of these algorithms across different data models and types of errors. The findings suggest that if the data meets certain criteria, such as linear separability with a non-trivial margin and near isotropic and logconcave class-conditional distributions, surrogate loss minimization algorithms can achieve negligible error even when a significant proportion of examples are adversarially mislabeled.
