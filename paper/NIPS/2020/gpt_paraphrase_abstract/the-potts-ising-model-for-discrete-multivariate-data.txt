Modeling dependencies in high-dimensional multivariate discrete data is a difficult task. The Potts model is commonly used for this purpose, but it becomes impractical when there are a large number of categories due to the high number of parameters required. In this study, we propose a modified version of the Potts model that retains its versatility while reducing the number of parameters. This modified model, called the Potts-Ising model, allows for general categorical marginals and Ising-type multivariate dependence. By doing so, we are able to decrease the number of parameters from â„¦(d2K2) to O(d2 + Kd), where K represents the number of categories and d represents the data dimension. We demonstrate that fitting the Potts-Ising model is as computationally complex as fitting an Ising model. Specifically, by utilizing the neighborhood regression framework, the model can be fitted by solving d separate logistic regressions. Through experiments on real data, we compare the performance of our model with existing approaches and show its ability to accurately capture multivariate dependencies.
