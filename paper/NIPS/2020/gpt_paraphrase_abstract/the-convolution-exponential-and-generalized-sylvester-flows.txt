This paper presents a novel approach for constructing linear flows using the exponential of a linear transformation. Unlike traditional methods, this linear transformation does not need to be invertible itself. The exponential function offers several advantageous properties, such as guaranteed invertibility, ease of computing its inverse, and a log Jacobian determinant equal to the trace of the linear transformation. The key insight is that the exponential can be computed implicitly, enabling the utilization of convolutional layers. Leveraging this insight, the authors introduce two new types of invertible transformations called convolution exponentials and graph convolution exponentials. These transformations maintain the equivariance of their underlying transformations. Furthermore, the authors propose Convolutional Sylvester Flows, which generalize Sylvester Flows and incorporate the convolution exponential as a basis change. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the convolution exponential surpasses other linear transformations in generative flows on CIFAR10 dataset, while the graph convolution exponential enhances the performance of graph normalizing flows. Moreover, Convolutional Sylvester Flows exhibit improved performance in terms of log-likelihood compared to residual flows as a generative flow model.
