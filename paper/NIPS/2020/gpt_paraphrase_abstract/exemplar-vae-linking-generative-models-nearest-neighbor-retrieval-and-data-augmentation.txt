Exemplar VAEs are a type of generative models that combine parametric and non-parametric approaches. These models incorporate a non-parametric prior in the latent space using a Parzen window estimator. To generate samples, an exemplar is randomly selected from a training set and transformed into a latent code and a new observation. We propose retrieval augmented training (RAT) to accelerate Exemplar VAE training by using approximate nearest neighbor search in the latent space to establish a lower bound on log marginal likelihood. To improve generalization, the model parameters are learned using exemplar leave-one-out and subsampling techniques. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Exemplar VAEs in tasks such as density estimation and representation learning. Notably, when applied to permutation invariant MNIST and Fashion MNIST datasets, generative data augmentation using Exemplar VAEs reduces classification error from 1.17% to 0.69% and from 8.56% to 8.16%, respectively.
