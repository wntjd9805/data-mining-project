With the growing importance of power management in contemporary data centers, there is an increasing need to scale computing resources dynamically in order to reduce energy consumption. This study introduces a new approach to the traditional online speed scaling problem by incorporating machine learning predictions about the future. Building upon previous research on learning-augmented online algorithms, we propose a novel algorithm that seamlessly integrates predictions and offers superior performance compared to other online algorithms when the accuracy of predictions is high. Furthermore, even in cases where predictions are highly inaccurate, our algorithm still maintains reliable guarantees. To substantiate our claims, we provide both theoretical analysis and experimental results.
