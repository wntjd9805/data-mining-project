The sliding window model of computation is used when data is continuously arriving, but only the latest elements should be used for analysis. The objective is to develop algorithms that efficiently update the solution with each arrival instead of recomputing it from the beginning. This study focuses on k-clustering problems like k-means and k-median. We propose simple and practical algorithms that offer better performance guarantees compared to previous methods. Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate that our approaches store only a small portion of the data, are significantly faster, and produce solutions with slightly higher costs than algorithms with access to the full dataset.
