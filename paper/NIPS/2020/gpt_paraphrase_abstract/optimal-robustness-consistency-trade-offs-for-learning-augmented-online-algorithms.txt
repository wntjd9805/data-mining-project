This paper explores the use of machine-learned predictions to enhance the performance of online algorithms. The objective is to develop algorithms that are both consistent and robust, ensuring good performance even when predictions are accurate and maintaining worst-case guarantees. Previous research by Lykouris and Vassilvit-skii (ICML '18) and Kumar, Purohit, and Svitkina (NeurIPS '18) has examined the trade-offs between robustness and consistency in various online problems. However, the extent to which these trade-offs are necessary remains an open question. In this study, we present novel lower bounds for competitive analysis using machine-learned predictions, focusing on the ski rental and non-clairvoyant scheduling problems. Our findings offer optimal trade-offs in different scenarios. Presented at the 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020) in Vancouver, Canada.
