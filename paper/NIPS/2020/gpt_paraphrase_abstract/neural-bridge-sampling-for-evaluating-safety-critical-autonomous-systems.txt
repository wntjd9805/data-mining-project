This study focuses on the use of learning-based methodologies in safety-critical domains such as autonomous driving and medical robotics. Real-world testing for dangerous events is expensive and impractical due to their rarity. To address this, the researchers propose a probabilistic approach to safety evaluation in simulation. They introduce a new method that combines exploration, exploitation, and optimization techniques to identify failure modes and estimate their occurrence rate. The method is proven to be both statistically and computationally efficient. The researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through various scenarios, showcasing its usefulness in rapid sensitivity analysis and model comparison for the development and testing of safety-critical autonomous systems.
