We suggest utilizing hyperedge replacement graph grammars, known as factor graph grammars (FGGs), for factor graphs. FGGs have the ability to generate sets of factor graphs and offer a broader range of model descriptions compared to plate notation, dynamic graphical models, case-factor diagrams, and sum-product networks. Additionally, FGGs allow for inference without the need to enumerate all the generated factor graphs. In situations involving finite variable domains (potentially infinite graph sets), a variation of variable elimination for FGGs enables precise and manageable inference. In scenarios with finite graph sets (potentially infinite variable domains), an FGG can be transformed into a single factor graph suitable for standard inference techniques.
