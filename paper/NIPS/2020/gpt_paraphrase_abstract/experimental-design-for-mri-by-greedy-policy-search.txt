Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly accelerated through subsampling in clinical practice. However, the current methods for designing these subsampling strategies rely on heuristics. In this study, we propose using policy gradient methods to learn experimental design strategies for accelerated MRI. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that a simple greedy approach produces solutions that are almost as effective as the more complex non-greedy approach. We hypothesize that the higher variance in the gradient estimates of the non-greedy objective contributes to this phenomenon. Furthermore, we find that non-greedy models struggle to adapt their policies to individual MR images due to this variance, which is essential for improving subsampling designs. Our empirical findings highlight the importance of adaptivity in enhancing subsampling strategies for accelerated MRI.
