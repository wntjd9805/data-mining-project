Bayesian optimization (BO) has been successful in applications where sample efficiency is important. However, it struggles in high-dimensional parameter spaces. To address this issue, we propose a method that incorporates domain knowledge by leveraging the geometry of non-Euclidean search spaces. By using Riemannian manifolds theory, our approach utilizes geometry-aware Gaussian processes to learn structure-preserving mappings and optimize the acquisition function of BO in low-dimensional latent spaces. We conducted tests on benchmark artificial landscapes and found that our approach outperforms other high-dimensional BO methods and consistently optimizes objective functions.
