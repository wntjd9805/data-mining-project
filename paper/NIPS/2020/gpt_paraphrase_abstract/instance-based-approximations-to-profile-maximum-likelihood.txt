This paper presents a new algorithm for approximating the profile maximum likelihood (PML) distribution, an important factor in estimating symmetric properties. The algorithm matches the efficiency of previous algorithms for computing approximate PML distributions, but performs better when there are fewer distinct observed frequencies. This improvement is achieved by utilizing new sparsity structures in the approximate PML distributions and introducing a new matrix rounding algorithm. Based on this result, the paper also introduces the first computationally efficient implementation of PseudoPML, a framework for estimating various symmetric properties. The paper further provides efficient PML-based estimators for distributions with low profile entropy, a measure of complexity. Finally, a simpler and more practical implementation of PseudoPML is presented, which achieves the same theoretical guarantees as the best-known estimator and is evaluated through empirical analysis.
