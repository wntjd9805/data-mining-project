We introduce Neural Mesh Flow (NMF), a method for generating two-manifold meshes for genus-0 shapes. NMF is a shape auto-encoder that utilizes Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) blocks to progressively deform a spherical mesh and learn accurate mesh geometry. Unlike previous methods, NMF does not require explicit mesh-based regularization, making it simpler to train. Our experiments show that NMF enables various applications including single-view mesh reconstruction, global shape parameterization, texture mapping, shape deformation, and correspondence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NMF generates manifold meshes that are more suitable for physically-based rendering and simulation. The code and data for NMF are publicly available.
