Reinforcement learning problems often require a distribution of tasks or environments for training, but creating such distributions can be time-consuming and prone to errors. We propose Unsupervised Environment Design (UED) as an alternative approach, where developers provide environments with unknown parameters and these parameters are used to automatically generate a distribution of solvable environments. Existing methods for generating environments have limitations, such as the inability to create structured or adaptable environments. To address this, we introduce a second agent called the antagonist, which works with the environment-generating adversary to generate structured and solvable environments. This technique, called Protagonist Antagonist Induced Regret Environment Design (PAIRED), produces a curriculum of increasingly complex environments and enables better performance in novel environments.
