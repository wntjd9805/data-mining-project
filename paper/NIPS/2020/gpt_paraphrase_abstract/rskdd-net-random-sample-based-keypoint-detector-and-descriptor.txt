This paper introduces a new approach called RSKDD-Net for large scale point cloud registration. The RSKDD-Net utilizes random sampling to efficiently select candidate points and employs a learning-based method to generate key-points and descriptors simultaneously. To address the information loss caused by random sampling, the RSKDD-Net introduces a novel random dilation cluster strategy to expand the receptive field of each sampled point. Additionally, an attention mechanism is applied to aggregate the positions and features of neighboring points. In order to train the descriptor in a weakly supervised manner, a matching loss is proposed. The performance of the RSKDD-Net is evaluated on two large scale outdoor LiDAR datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art results with over 15 times faster processing speed compared to existing methods. The code for the RSKDD-Net implementation is available at https://github.com/ispc-lab/RSKDD-Net.
