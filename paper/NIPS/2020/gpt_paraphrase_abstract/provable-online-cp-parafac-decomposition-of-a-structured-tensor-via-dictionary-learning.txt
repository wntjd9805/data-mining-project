We address the problem of decomposing a structured 3-way tensor into its constituent Canonical Polyadic (CP) factors. This decomposition, similar to singular value decomposition (SVD) for tensors, reveals the interactions between the tensor dimensions. However, due to the unknown factors, the optimization problems involved are inherently non-convex. Current guaranteed algorithms for handling this non-convexity have irreducible error and are limited to cases where all factors have the same structure. In this study, we propose a provable algorithm for online structured tensor factorization. Our algorithm assumes that one factor follows incoherence conditions while the others are sparse. With mild conditions on initialization, rank, and sparsity, our algorithm achieves exact recovery of the factors (up to scaling and permutation) at a linear rate. Additionally, our experimental evaluations on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate superior performance compared to similar techniques.
