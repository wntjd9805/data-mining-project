This paper examines the problem of jointly matching and clustering multiple graphs that belong to different groups. Both graph matching and clustering are difficult tasks, and a joint solution is desirable because the two tasks are naturally connected. The paper proposes a graduated assignment procedure that iteratively performs soft matching and clustering, with separate parameters for the two tasks. This technique can also be used for end-to-end learning, allowing the learning of keypoint feature extraction CNNs without ground-truth supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms learning-free algorithms and performs comparably to supervised graph matching approaches. The source code for this method is publicly available as part of the ThinkMatch module.
