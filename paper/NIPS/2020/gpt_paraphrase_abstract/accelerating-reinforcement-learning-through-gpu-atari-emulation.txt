CuLE (CUDA Learning Environment) is a CUDA version of Atari Learning Environment (ALE) designed for developing deep reinforcement algorithms. Unlike existing CPU-based emulators, CuLE resolves many limitations and can be easily scaled across multiple GPUs. By utilizing GPU parallelization, CuLE is capable of running numerous games simultaneously and rendering frames directly on the GPU, thus eliminating the bottleneck caused by limited CPU-GPU communication bandwidth. Remarkably, CuLE achieves a frame generation rate of up to 155 million frames per hour on a single GPU, a feat previously only attainable through a cluster of CPUs. In addition to highlighting the disparities between CPU and GPU emulators in the context of reinforcement learning, this study demonstrates the effective use of CuLE's high throughput by efficiently batching training data, resulting in accelerated convergence for A2C+V-trace.
