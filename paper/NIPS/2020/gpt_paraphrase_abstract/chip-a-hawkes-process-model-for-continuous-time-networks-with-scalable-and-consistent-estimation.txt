We present the Community Hawkes Independent Pairs (CHIP) generative model, designed for networks that involve timestamped relational events, forming a continuous-time network. By applying spectral clustering to an aggregated adjacency matrix created from the CHIP model, we achieve reliable community detection as the number of nodes and time duration increases. We also introduce accurate and computationally efficient estimators for the model parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that the CHIP model and estimation procedure are scalable to large networks with thousands of nodes, and outperform other continuous-time network models on various real networks.
