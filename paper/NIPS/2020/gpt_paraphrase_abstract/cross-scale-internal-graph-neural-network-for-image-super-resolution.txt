The prior knowledge of non-local self-similarity in natural images has been extensively studied for image restoration. However, existing deep non-local methods for single image super-resolution (SISR) only utilize patches within the same scale of the low-resolution input image, limiting the restoration to the same-scale information and ignoring potential high-resolution cues from other scales. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called cross-scale internal graph neural network (IGNN). By constructing a cross-scale graph, we identify similar patches across different scales and aggregate the corresponding high-resolution patches to enhance the recovery of detailed textures in the low-resolution image. Additionally, these internal LR/HR exemplars specific to the image are valuable complements to the external information learned from the training dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of IGNN compared to state-of-the-art SISR methods, including existing non-local networks, on standard benchmarks.
