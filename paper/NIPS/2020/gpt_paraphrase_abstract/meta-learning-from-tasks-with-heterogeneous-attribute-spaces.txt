We present a novel meta-learning approach that can train a model on tasks with different attribute spaces, enabling it to solve new tasks with varying attribute spaces using limited labeled data. Existing meta-learning methods assume shared attribute spaces across tasks, making them unsuitable for tasks with different attribute sizes. Our model uses an inference network to infer latent representations of attributes and responses from a small number of labeled instances. These representations are then used by a prediction network to predict responses for unlabeled instances. By leveraging attribute and response representations, our method can make accurate predictions even when attribute and response sizes differ across tasks. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and 59 datasets in OpenML demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in predicting responses for new tasks with heterogeneous attribute spaces.
