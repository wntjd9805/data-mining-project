This abstract discusses the Bayesian optimization of objective functions that involve a black-box function F and a risk measure œÅ, which is computed based on the randomness introduced by a random variable W. These types of problems commonly occur in decision making under uncertainty, such as portfolio optimization and robust systems design. The abstract introduces a new family of Bayesian optimization algorithms that take advantage of the structure of the objective function to improve sampling efficiency. Instead of directly modeling the objective function, these algorithms model F as a Gaussian process and use the resulting posterior distribution to determine which points to evaluate. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through various numerical experiments.
