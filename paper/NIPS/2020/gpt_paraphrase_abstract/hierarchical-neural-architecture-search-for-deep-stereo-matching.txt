Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been successfully used to automate the design of neural networks for high-level vision tasks like classification and semantic segmentation. NAS allows the network to choose from different operations to find the best architecture for the given problem. However, NAS has not been as successful in low-level geometric vision tasks like stereo matching due to the large size of existing deep stereo matching networks designed by humans. Applying NAS directly to these massive structures is computationally expensive. This paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical NAS framework for deep stereo matching that incorporates task-specific human knowledge. The framework optimizes the entire pipeline of deep stereo matching, including feature extraction, feature volume construction, and dense matching. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep stereo matching architectures in terms of accuracy, network size, and inference speed. The code for the framework is available at LEAStereo.
