We explore the problem of maximizing a non-monotone, non-negative submodular function while adhering to a matroid constraint. The previous best-known deterministic approximation ratio for this problem is 1/4-(epsilon) with a time complexity of O((n^4/(epsilon)) log n). However, we demonstrate that this ratio can be improved to 1/4 with a time complexity of O(nr). Additionally, we introduce a more practical algorithm called TwinGreedyFast, which achieves a deterministic ratio of 1/4-(epsilon) with a nearly-linear running time of O(n^epsilon). Our approach involves simultaneously constructing two candidate solution sets using a greedy search, which allows us to exploit the properties of independence systems and obtain better performance bounds. In the context of a p-set system constraint, TwinGreedyFast achieves a deterministic ratio of 2p+2-(epsilon) with the same time complexity. To demonstrate the practicality of our approach, we evaluated TwinGreedyFast's performance on two network applications. Our empirical results indicate that TwinGreedyFast outperforms existing deterministic and randomized algorithms with efficient implementations for our problem.
