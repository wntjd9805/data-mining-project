This paper proposes a collision avoidance method for multi-robot systems that addresses the challenges of uncertainty, non-determinism, and lack of complete information. The method, called Probabilistic SafetyBarrier Certificates (PrSBC), incorporates both measurement uncertainty and motion uncertainty. It utilizes Control Barrier Functions to define a space of control actions that are probabilistically safe and have provable theoretical guarantees. By converting the chance constrained safety set into deterministic control constraints with PrSBC, the method modifies an existing controller to find an alternative safe controller using quadratic programming. The approach does not require any assumptions about the form of uncertainty, except for finite support, and provides worst-case guarantees. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through experiments in realistic simulation environments.
