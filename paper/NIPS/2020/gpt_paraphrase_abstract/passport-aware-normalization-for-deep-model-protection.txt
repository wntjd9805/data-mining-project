Deep learning has been successful in various applications, but it is also vulnerable to intellectual property (IP) infringement. This poses a threat to the interests of the original model owner due to the significant cost involved in designing and training a good model. Existing methods for deep model IP protection have flaws, such as susceptibility to ambiguity attacks or requiring changes to the target network structure, leading to performance degradation. In response, we propose a new approach called passport-aware normalization. This formulation can be applied to most existing normalization layers without altering the target model's structure. It involves adding a passport-aware branch during joint training, which is discarded during inference unless there is suspicion of stolen IP. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in image and 3D point recognition models. It is robust against common attack techniques and ambiguity attacks. By combining it with trigger-set based methods, both black-box and white-box verification can be achieved, enhancing the security of deep learning models in real systems.
