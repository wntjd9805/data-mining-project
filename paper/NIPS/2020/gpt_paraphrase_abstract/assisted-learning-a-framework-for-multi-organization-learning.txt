In many AI scenarios, collaboration between different organizations or agents is crucial to achieve specific goals. However, organizations often impose strict security measures to protect their proprietary information, which hinders collaboration. To address this issue, we present the Assisted Learning framework, which allows organizations to assist each other in supervised learning tasks without sharing sensitive data or algorithms. Instead, organizations share non-sensitive statistics and incorporate feedback from others to improve predictive performance. Theoretical and experimental studies, including real-world medical benchmarks, demonstrate that Assisted Learning can achieve high learning performance comparable to centralized approaches.
