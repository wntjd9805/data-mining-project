The prediction of trajectories in scenarios involving multiple agents and entities is a difficult task in various domains, including traffic prediction, pedestrian tracking, and path planning. To address this challenge, we propose a comprehensive framework that incorporates important factors of motion, such as inertia, relative motion, intents, and interactions. Our approach utilizes a relational model to effectively capture the interactions between agents in different environments. Additionally, we introduce a novel attention mechanism that accounts for the inherent fuzziness of human decision-making, enabling continuous-valued decisions and corresponding response learning. Our architecture outperforms existing predictive models in various domains, including human crowd trajectories, US freeway traffic, NBA sports data, and physics datasets. Through ablation and augmentation studies, we gain insights into the decision-making process and the factors contributing to the performance improvements in our model.
