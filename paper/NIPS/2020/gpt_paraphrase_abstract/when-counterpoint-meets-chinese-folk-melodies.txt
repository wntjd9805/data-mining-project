This paper introduces FolkDuet, a reinforcement learning-based system for generating countermelodies in Chinese folk music. Due to the lack of Chinese folk duet data, FolkDuet utilizes two reward models based on Bach chorales and monophonic Chinese folk melodies. An interaction reward model is trained on Bach chorales' outer parts to capture counterpoint interaction, while a style reward model is trained on Chinese folk song melodies to capture melodic patterns. By combining these rewards, FolkDuet's generator produces countermelodies that maintain the Chinese folk style. The system operates in real-time, enabling interactive human-machine duet improvisation. Experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the baselines in terms of both subjective and objective measures.
