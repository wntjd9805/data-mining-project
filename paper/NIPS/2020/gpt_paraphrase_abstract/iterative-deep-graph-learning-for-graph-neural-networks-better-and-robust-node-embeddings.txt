In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called IterativeDeep Graph Learning (IDGL) that simultaneously learns the structure and embedding of a graph. The main idea behind IDGL is to improve the graph structure by enhancing node embeddings, and vice versa. We use an iterative method that stops when the learned graph structure is similar enough to the optimized graph for downstream prediction tasks. To control the quality of the learned graph, we treat the graph learning problem as a similarity metric learning problem and employ adaptive graph regularization. Additionally, we propose IDGL-ANCH, a scalable version of IDGL, which reduces time and space complexity while maintaining performance by using an anchor-based approximation technique. Our experiments on nine benchmarks demonstrate that our IDGL models consistently outperform or match state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, IDGL is more robust to adversarial graphs and applicable to both transductive and inductive learning.
