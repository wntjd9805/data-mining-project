This article proposes a framework for maximizing expected reward while dealing with limited resources. The framework, called Dynamic Resource Allocator (DRA), penalizes precise representations of action-values in memory and allocates more resources to items that have a higher impact on cumulative rewards. DRA also learns faster when starting with a higher resource budget and explains why frontal cortical areas in biological brains are more engaged in early stages of learning. This work offers a solution for learning how to allocate costly resources to uncertain memories in a way that can adapt to environmental changes.
