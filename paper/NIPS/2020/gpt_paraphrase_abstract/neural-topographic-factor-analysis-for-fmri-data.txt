Neuroimaging studies generate large amounts of spatio-temporal data for a limited number of participants and stimuli. However, researchers rarely explore how individuals differ from each other, which can be addressed even with small sample sizes using appropriate statistical tools. In this study, we propose Neural Topographic Factor Analysis (NTFA), a probabilistic model that identifies embeddings for participants and stimuli. These embeddings enable us to interpret variations between participants and stimuli as meaningful information rather than random noise. We assess the effectiveness of NTFA using data from our own pilot experiment and two publicly available datasets. Our results demonstrate that inferring representations for participants and stimuli enhances the ability to predict outcomes for unseen data compared to previous topographic methods. Additionally, we show that the inferred latent factor representations have practical applications in tasks such as analyzing multivoxel patterns and functional connectivity.
