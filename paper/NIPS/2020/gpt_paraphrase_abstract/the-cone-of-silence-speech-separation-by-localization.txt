We propose a method for localizing and separating multiple speakers in a recording using a deep network. Our approach focuses on isolating sources within a specific angular region, determined by an angle of interest and angular window size. By iteratively decreasing the window size, we can effectively locate and separate all speakers in logarithmic time. Our algorithm is capable of handling an unknown number of speakers, even if they are moving, and performs well in the presence of background noise. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both source separation and source localization.
