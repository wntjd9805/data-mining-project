The ideal point model is a widely used preference model in recommendation systems. It represents a user as a vector u and a collection of items x1, . . . , xN in a shared low-dimensional space. The vector u represents the user's ideal combination of features for their most preferred item. The assumption in this model is that a smaller distance between u and an item xj suggests a stronger preference for xj. Previous research has typically assumed the distance to be Euclidean, but this neglects the possibility of feature interactions and the user's underlying preferences. In this study, we address the problem of learning an ideal point representation when the distance metric is an unknown Mahalanobis metric. We propose a new approach to estimate the user's ideal point and the Mahalanobis metric based on paired comparisons of item preferences. This problem can be seen as a special case of a more general metric learning problem where some point locations are unknown beforehand. Our algorithm is validated through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness.
