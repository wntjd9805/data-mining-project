This study focuses on efficient inference and learning in switching Gaussian linear dynamical systems. It introduces a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter and a corresponding Monte Carlo objective to improve forecasting capabilities. The classical model is extended by incorporating conditionally linear state-to-switch dynamics, while maintaining the partial tractability of the conditional Gaussian linear part. To handle more complex non-linear emission models and multivariate observations, an auxiliary variable approach with a decoder-type neural network is utilized. A Monte Carlo objective is proposed, which takes advantage of the conditional linearity by computing closed-form conditional expectations and using a factorized proposal distribution. The approach is evaluated on various time series forecasting datasets and image streams of simulated physical systems, demonstrating better forecasting performance compared to other deep state-space models.
