The abstract discusses the importance of maximizing a monotone submodular function under a constraint in various applications such as data summarization, sparse regression, and coverage problems. The problem is studied in a fully dynamic setting, where elements can be added and removed. A randomized algorithm is proposed, which maintains a data structure with efficient update time and provides an approximate solution. The algorithm is evaluated through empirical analysis.
