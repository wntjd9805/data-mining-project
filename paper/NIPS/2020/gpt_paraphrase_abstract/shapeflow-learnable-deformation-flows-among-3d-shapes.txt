ShapeFlow is a model that enables the learning of a deformation space for 3D shapes that have significant variations within a class. This model allows for the creation of a multi-template deformation space that is not dependent on the shape's topology, while still maintaining fine geometric details. Unlike generative spaces, which directly decode a latent vector into a shape, a deformation space decodes a vector into a continuous flow that can transform a source shape into a target shape. This enables the separation of geometric style from structural pose. The deformation between geometries is parametrized as a learned continuous flow field using a neural network. This approach ensures that the deformations have desirable properties, such as being bijective, free from self-intersections, and preserving volume. The effectiveness of this learned deformation space is demonstrated in various applications, including shape generation through deformation, geometric style transfer, unsupervised learning of a consistent parameterization for entire classes of shapes, and shape interpolation.
