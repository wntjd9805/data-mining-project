The problem of estimating the effect of continuous-valued interventions, such as treatments with dosage parameters, has received less attention compared to discrete interventions. This paper introduces SCIGAN, a model based on modified generative adversarial networks (GANs), to address this problem. SCIGAN is flexible and can estimate counterfactual outcomes for multiple continuous interventions simultaneously. The model uses a modified GAN to generate counterfactual outcomes, which are then used to train an inference model capable of estimating these outcomes for new samples. To handle the challenges of continuous interventions, a novel hierarchical discriminator architecture is proposed. The paper also provides theoretical support for the use of GANs and the hierarchical discriminator. Experimental results show improvements over existing benchmark models using a new semi-synthetic data simulation for continuous interventions.
