Causal discovery plays a crucial role in human cognition as it enables us to understand our environment and predict outcomes in new scenarios. This study focuses on the task of discovering causal relationships from videos without knowledge of the true graph structure. The objective is to uncover the dependencies between environmental and object variables, determining the type and strength of interactions that affect the behavior of the system. The proposed model consists of a perception module for extracting meaningful and consistent keypoints from images, an inference module to determine the graph distribution based on these keypoints, and a dynamics module to predict future outcomes based on the inferred graph. The model assumes access to different system configurations and environmental conditions, allowing it to discover the correct causal graph without explicit interventions. The model's effectiveness is evaluated in various scenarios, such as multi-body interactions and different fabric shapes. Experimental results show that the model accurately identifies interactions from image sequences and makes long-term predictions. Furthermore, the model's causal structure enables it to make counterfactual predictions and extrapolate to unseen interaction graphs or graphs of different sizes.
