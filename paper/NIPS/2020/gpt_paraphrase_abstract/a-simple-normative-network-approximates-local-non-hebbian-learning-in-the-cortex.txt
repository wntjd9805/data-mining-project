The brain uses relevant information from sensory data to guide behavior. Research in neuroscience shows that cortical neurons process sensory inputs based on instructive signals that provide context and task-relevant information. In this study, we adopt a normative approach and model these instructive signals as supervisory inputs that guide the projection of the sensory data. We mathematically formulate this as a Reduced-Rank Regression (RRR) problem, which includes methods like Reduced-Rank Mean Square Error (RRMSE) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). We develop new offline and online optimization algorithms, referred to as Bio-RRR, which can be implemented using neural networks with learning rules resembling calcium plateau potential observed in the cortex. We explain how the calcium plateau potential can be interpreted as an error signal that propagates backwards. Our results show that our biologically plausible algorithms perform comparably to existing implementations of RRMSE and CCA, despite relying solely on local learning rules.
