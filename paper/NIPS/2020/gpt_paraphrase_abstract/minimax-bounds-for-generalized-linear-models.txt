We introduce a novel set of minimax prediction error bounds for generalized linear models that outperform previous findings in scenarios where the design matrix lacks structure, such as cases where it is wide or does not have full column rank. In addition to the standard L2 risks, we investigate a group of entropic risks that capture both prediction and estimation risks. By conducting a thorough analysis of Fisher information, we unveil how the spectrum of the design matrix reveals underlying structural dependencies. Our approach, which deviates from the traditional metric entropy approach, is versatile and can be applied to various other contexts.
