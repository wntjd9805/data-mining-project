This study focuses on the challenge of controlling a linear dynamical system in the presence of adversarial perturbations. The controller only has access to the scalar loss feedback, and the specific loss function is unknown. We present an effective sublinear regret algorithm for this problem, regardless of whether the system is known or unknown. The main challenge lies in the relationship between the loss and past controls. To address this, we introduce an efficient algorithm for bandit convex optimization in loss functions with memory, which may have significance beyond this specific problem.
