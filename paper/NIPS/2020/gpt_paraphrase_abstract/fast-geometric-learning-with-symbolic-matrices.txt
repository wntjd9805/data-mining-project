Our extension for machine learning frameworks enables the use of geometric methods that rely on tensors encoded with symbolic formulas and data arrays. This extension provides comprehensive support for CPUs and GPUs, combining a versatile user interface with fast runtimes and low memory usage. Unlike general purpose acceleration frameworks like XLA, our library converts generic Python code into binaries that are as competitive as state-of-the-art geometric libraries such as FAISS, while offering greater flexibility. We have extensively evaluated our library on various problems, including Gaussian modelling, K-nearest neighbors search, geometric deep learning, non-Euclidean embeddings, and optimal transport theory. In practical scenarios involving geometric problems with sample sizes ranging from 103 to 106 and dimensions from 1 to 100, our library significantly accelerates GPU implementations compared to baseline approaches by up to two orders of magnitude.
