Submodularity is a well-studied property of set functions that describes a diminishing returns property when adding elements to a set. This concept has been extended to sequence functions, where the order of adding elements is important. This paper focuses on the problem of robust sequence submodular maximization with cardinality constraints. The goal is to find a sequence that maximizes the submodular function value while being resilient to the removal of a subset of elements. Unlike robust submodular maximization for set functions, sequence functions present new challenges due to multiple definitions of submodularity and the need to consider both forward and backward monotonicity. To address these challenges, two robust greedy algorithms are proposed. One algorithm achieves a constant approximation ratio but is only robust against the removal of a subset of contiguous elements. The other algorithm is robust against the removal of any arbitrary subset of selected elements but requires a stronger assumption and its approximation ratio depends on the number of removed elements. The analysis is further generalized by considering approximate versions of sequence submodularity and backward monotonicity.
