We examine the problem of robust and adaptive model predictive control (MPC) for a linear system with unknown parameters. We aim to prevent failures in critical settings while handling non-convex costs commonly found in practical problems. Existing theory only addresses quadratic costs, limiting applications to stabilization and tracking tasks. To address this limitation, we integrate tools from various communities, including non-asymptotic linear regression, interval prediction, and tree-based planning. We combine and adapt the guarantees provided by each tool, presenting the first comprehensive suboptimality analysis for this problem. Our approach is flexible, allowing for multiple models and incorporating a data-driven robust model selection strategy to relax modeling assumptions. We prioritize tractability throughout the method and demonstrate its effectiveness in two challenging simulated environments.
