This paper presents a new methodology called Pontryagin Differentiable Programming (PDP) that offers a unified framework for solving various learning and control tasks. PDP is distinct from existing methods in two ways. Firstly, it differentiates through Pontryagin's Maximum Principle, allowing the analytical derivative of a trajectory to be obtained with respect to adjustable parameters within an optimal control system. This facilitates end-to-end learning of dynamics, policies, and control objectives. Secondly, an auxiliary control system is proposed in the backward pass of the PDP framework, where the output of this system represents the analytical derivative of the original system's trajectory with respect to the parameters. This can be iteratively solved using standard control tools. Three learning modes of PDP are explored: inverse reinforcement learning, system identification, and control/planning. The effectiveness of PDP is demonstrated on various high-dimensional systems, such as a multi-link robot arm, a 6-DoF maneuvering quadrotor, and a 6-DoF rocket powered landing.
