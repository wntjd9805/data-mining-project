Learning a causal directed acyclic graph from data is a difficult task with an unsolvable combinatorial problem. A novel approach tackles this problem by transforming it into a continuous constrained optimization problem, solved using the augmented Lagrangian method. However, existing methods based on this approach do not utilize interventional data, which can greatly enhance identifiability. This study presents a new method that uses neural networks to leverage interventional data, grounded in theory. By incorporating expressive neural architectures like normalizing flows, we demonstrate the flexibility of the continuous-constrained framework. Our approach outperforms existing methods in various scenarios, including cases with perfect or imperfect interventions where the targeted nodes may be unknown.
