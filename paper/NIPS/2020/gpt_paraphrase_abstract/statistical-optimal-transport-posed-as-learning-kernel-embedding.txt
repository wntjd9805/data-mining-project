This study introduces a new approach to statistical Optimal Transport (OT), aiming to estimate the optimal transport plan between given source and target marginal distributions using only samples. The approach involves learning the transport plan's kernel mean embedding based on sample-based estimates of marginal embeddings. To prevent overfitting, the proposed estimator employs maximum mean discrepancy-based regularization, which complements the commonly used Ï†-divergence (entropy) based regularization in existing estimators. The study demonstrates that, under mild conditions, the transport plan and the Barycentric-projection based transport map can be accurately recovered with a sample complexity that is independent of the dimension. Additionally, the kernel mean embeddings allow for out-of-sample estimation. The study proves an appropriate representer theorem and formulates the estimator as a kernelized convex problem, which could potentially be applied to OT in non-standard domains. Empirical results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
