The Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) technique is widely used to sample from complex continuous distributions. However, it cannot be applied to distributions that include both discrete and continuous variables. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new approach called mixed HMC (M-HMC). M-HMC is a family of algorithms that allows for simultaneous updates of discrete and continuous variables, resulting in more frequent updates of the discrete variables while maintaining the ability to suppress random-walk behavior. We provide theoretical analysis of M-HMC and present an efficient implementation using Laplace momentum, which adds minimal overhead compared to existing HMC methods. We demonstrate the superior performance of M-HMC through numerical experiments on Gaussian mixture models, variable selection in Bayesian logistic regression, and correlated topic models.
