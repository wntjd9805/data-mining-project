We thoroughly investigate the combination of Generative Adversarial Networks and learned compression to create an advanced generative lossy compression system. Our research focuses on normalization layers, generator and discriminator architectures, training techniques, and perceptual losses. Unlike prior work, our system produces visually appealing reconstructions that closely resemble the original input, operates effectively at various bitrates, and can be applied to high-resolution images. We bridge the gap between theoretical rate-distortion-perception principles and practical implementation by conducting quantitative evaluations using various perceptual metrics and a user study. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches, even when using higher bitrates.
