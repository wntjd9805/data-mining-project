We propose a new family of reparameterizable distributions that are more modular and flexible than the Gumbel-Softmax distribution, which is commonly used as a relaxation of discrete distributions. Our approach involves transforming Gaussian noise into a one-hot approximation using an invertible function composed of a modified softmax. This function can incorporate various transformations for different purposes, such as the stick-breaking procedure for distributions with countably infinite support or normalizing flows for increased flexibility. Our construction has theoretical advantages over the Gumbel-Softmax, including a closed form KL divergence, and performs significantly better in various experiments.
