Conditional Value at Risk (CVAR), a type of risk measure widely used in mathematical finance, is gaining attention in machine learning for regularization and fairness. This study introduces a generalization bound for learning algorithms that minimize the CVAR of the empirical loss. The bound, similar to PAC-Bayesian type, ensures small error when the empirical CVAR is small. By simplifying the estimation of CVAR to estimating an expectation, the study also provides concentration inequalities for CVAR even with unbounded random variables.
