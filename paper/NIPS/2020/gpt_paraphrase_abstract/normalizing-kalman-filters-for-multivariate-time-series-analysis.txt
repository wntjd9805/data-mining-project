This paper introduces a new approach to modeling large, complex, and multivariate time series panels using a probabilistic framework. The proposed method combines classical state space models with deep learning techniques by incorporating normalizing flows. This integration helps address inaccuracies caused by idealized assumptions in state space models. The resulting model is highly flexible and maintains the desirable properties of state space models, such as accounting for uncertainty and observation errors, tractable inference, efficient sampling, and good generalization performance, even with limited data. The approach is demonstrated to be competitive with state-of-the-art deep learning methods for forecasting real-world data and handling different levels of missing data.
