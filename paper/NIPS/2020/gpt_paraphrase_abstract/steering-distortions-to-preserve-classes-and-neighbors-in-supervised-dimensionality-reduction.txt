Nonlinear dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data is a difficult task due to the presence of distortions in the low-dimensional embedding. It is challenging to determine which distortions are the most important to avoid. However, when data is annotated into known classes, this annotation can be used to guide the embedding process and prevent distortions that negatively impact class separation. This paper introduces a new supervised mapping method called ClassNeRV, which incorporates class annotation into a stress function that evaluates embedding quality based on false neighbors and missed neighbors. ClassNeRV is based on the theoretical framework of methods derived from Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE). Unlike previous methods, ClassNeRV strikes a balance between preserving neighbor structure and achieving class separation. Experimental results demonstrate that ClassNeRV outperforms nine other state-of-the-art alternatives in preserving both neighbor structure and class separation.
