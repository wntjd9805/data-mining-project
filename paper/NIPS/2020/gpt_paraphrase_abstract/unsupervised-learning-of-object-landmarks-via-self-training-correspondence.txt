This paper presents a novel approach to the unsupervised discovery of object landmarks. Unlike existing methods, this approach focuses on two new perspectives: self-training and correspondence. Self-training involves starting with generic keypoints and progressively improving the detector to become more specialized in recognizing object landmarks. Correspondence is identified as a crucial aspect of unsupervised landmark discovery, and an optimization scheme is proposed that involves clustering to recover landmark correspondence across different images and learning an object landmark descriptor without labels. Compared to previous approaches, this method is capable of learning landmarks that can capture significant changes in viewpoint. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through experiments on challenging datasets such as LS3D, BBCPose, and Human3.6M.
