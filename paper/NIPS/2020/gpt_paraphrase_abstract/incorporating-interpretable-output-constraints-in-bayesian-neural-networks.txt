A new framework called Output-Constrained Bayesian Neural Networks (OC-BNNs) is introduced to incorporate task-specific constraints into supervised models. These constraints include expert knowledge, safety, and fairness. OC-BNNs use a probabilistic approach and a prior to effectively integrate these constraints into the model. This framework is consistent with the Bayesian framework for uncertainty quantification and allows for black-box inference. Unlike traditional Bayesian neural networks, OC-BNNs enable the inclusion of functional knowledge without requiring expertise in machine learning. The effectiveness of OC-BNNs is demonstrated on real-world datasets in various domains such as healthcare, criminal justice, and credit scoring.
