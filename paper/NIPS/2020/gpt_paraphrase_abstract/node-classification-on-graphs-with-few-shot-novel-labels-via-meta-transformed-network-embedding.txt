We investigate the problem of node classification on graphs with few-shot novel labels. This problem is characterized by the emergence of novel labels in the graph and the limited availability of representative nodes for training a classifier. This problem is relevant to various applications, such as providing recommendations for newly formed groups in online social networks. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework called MetaTNE, which consists of three modules. The structural module assigns a latent representation to each node based on the graph structure. The meta-learning module captures the relationship between the graph structure and the node labels as prior knowledge using a meta-learning approach. Additionally, we introduce an embedding transformation function to enhance the effectiveness of meta-learning. This prior knowledge obtained through meta-learning facilitates the learning of few-shot novel labels. The optimization module employs a simple scheduling strategy to train the structural and meta-learning modules, striking a balance between graph structure learning and meta-learning. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MetaTNE outperforms state-of-the-art methods significantly.
