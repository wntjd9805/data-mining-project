We present Dual-Resolution Correspondence Networks (DualRC-Net), a method for establishing dense pixel-wise correspondences between images. DualRC-Net utilizes both coarse- and fine-resolution feature maps to obtain accurate correspondences. Coarse maps generate a coarse 4D correlation tensor, which is refined using a learnable consensus module. Fine-resolution maps are then used to generate dense correspondences based on the refined coarse tensor. By focusing on a limited number of high-confidence matches, DualRC-Net improves matching reliability and localization accuracy without the need for expensive convolution kernels. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on popular benchmark datasets such as HPatches, InLoc, and Aachen Day-Night.
