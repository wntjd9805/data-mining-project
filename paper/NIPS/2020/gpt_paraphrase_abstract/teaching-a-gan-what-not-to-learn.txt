Generative adversarial networks (GANs) were initially designed as unsupervised generative models that learn to mimic a specific distribution. However, variants like conditional GANs and auxiliary-classifier GANs (ACGANs) have expanded the scope of GANs to supervised and semi-supervised learning by incorporating labeled data and multi-class discriminators. In this study, we propose a novel approach to the supervisedGAN problem inspired by the philosophy of Persian poet Rumi, who emphasized the importance of knowing what to ignore. In our framework, we not only provide positive data for the GAN to model but also introduce negative samples for the GAN to avoid, which we refer to as the Rumi framework. This formulation enables the discriminator to better represent the target distribution by penalizing undesirable generated samples, leading to accelerated learning for the generator. We present a modified version of the standard GAN (SGAN) and least-squares GAN (LSGAN) within the Rumi framework. Experimental results on various datasets including MNIST, Fashion MNIST, CelebA, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate the advantages of our reformulation. Additionally, we apply the proposed framework to address the problem of learning under-represented classes in imbalanced datasets, achieving significantly lower FID scores compared to standard GAN frameworks and demonstrating superior generalization capabilities.
