We introduce a novel approach for non-blind image deblurring that combines classical techniques with deep learning. Instead of directly deblurring the image in the standard image space, we propose a method that performs a deconvolution process in a feature space. This is achieved by integrating a classical Wiener deconvolution framework with learned deep features. To enhance the deblurring process and recover fine details and small-scale structures, we utilize a multi-scale feature refinement module. The proposed model is trained end-to-end and evaluated on both simulated and real-world image blur scenarios. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our deep Wiener deconvolution network produces deblurred results with significantly fewer artifacts compared to existing methods. Furthermore, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art non-blind image deblurring methods by a large margin in terms of quantitative evaluation.
