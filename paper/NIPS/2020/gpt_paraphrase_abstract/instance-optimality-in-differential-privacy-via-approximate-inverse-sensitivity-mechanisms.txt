We investigate and propose algorithms in differential privacy that achieve the best possible results for specific instances. We expand and approximate the inverse sensitivity mechanism to achieve this. We present two approximation approaches: one that only requires knowledge of local sensitivities, and another that uses gradient-based approximation for optimization problems. These methods are efficiently calculable for a wide range of functions. We also provide lower bounds for vector-valued functions that are specific to each instance, showing that our mechanisms are almost optimal under certain assumptions. We demonstrate that minimax lower bounds may not accurately represent the difficulty of a problem in general, as our algorithms can significantly outperform them for well-behaved instances. Lastly, we apply our approximation framework to create private mechanisms for unbounded-range mean estimation, principal component analysis, and linear regression. Our mechanisms for principal component analysis offer an efficient differentially private algorithm with near-optimal rates.
