We present a new approach to unsupervised learning for 3D shape correspondence. Our method integrates a multiscale matching pipeline into a deep neural network, based on the current leading technique called smooth shells. Unlike previous methods that require a time-consuming stochastic search for initial poses, our approach learns good initializations directly from the input surfaces. We achieve this by developing a differentiable hierarchical matching pipeline derived from entropy regularized optimal transport, which is combined with a local feature extractor using smooth, truncated spectral convolution filters. Our unsupervised method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on multiple datasets, even compared to recent supervised methods. We also demonstrate effective generalization by applying our learned filters to examples that differ significantly from the training set.
