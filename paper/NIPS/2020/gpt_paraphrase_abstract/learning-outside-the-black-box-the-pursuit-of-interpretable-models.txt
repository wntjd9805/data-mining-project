This paper introduces an algorithm that addresses the challenge of interpreting machine learning models, which has hindered their deployment outside the machine learning community. The algorithm generates a continuous global interpretation for any continuous black-box function by utilizing Meijer G-functions as ridge functions instead of polynomial splines. This choice allows for differentiability in the parameters, enabling efficient tuning through gradient descent. By applying the algorithm to five well-known datasets and two common machine learning algorithms, the study demonstrates that it produces accurate and concise interpretations. These interpretations facilitate understanding of feature importance and interactions. Overall, the proposed algorithm represents a significant advancement compared to previous approaches.
