We present a novel approach for accurately detecting feature edges in 3D point cloud data. Our method involves representing these edges as parametric curves such as lines, circles, and B-splines. To achieve this, we train a deep neural network called PIE-NET to infer the parameters of these curves. Our network uses a region proposal architecture, where the first module suggests a comprehensive set of edge and corner points, and the second module ranks each proposal for consideration. We evaluate our technique on the ABC dataset, the largest publicly available dataset of CAD models, through ablation studies. We compare our results with traditional processing pipelines and a recent deep learning-based edge detector called EC-Net. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, it demonstrates robustness across different shape categories.
