We investigate the problem of learning Ising models in a scenario where some samples from the underlying distribution can be corrupted. Our goal is to design estimators that are statistically optimal in a high-dimensional scaling, where the number of nodes, edges, and maximal node degree can increase as the sample size grows. Our approach involves utilizing moments of the distribution and employing novel reductions to univariate estimation. The estimators we propose achieve an optimal dependence on the fraction of corrupted data, independent of the dimension, in the contaminated setting. Additionally, they provide high-probability error guarantees with optimal sample complexity. We validate our theoretical findings through simulations.
