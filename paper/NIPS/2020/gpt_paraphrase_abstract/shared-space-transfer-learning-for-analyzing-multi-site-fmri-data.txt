This paper presents a new approach called SharedSpace Transfer Learning (SSTL) for improving the performance of Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) in task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. MVPA is used to differentiate cognitive tasks performed by subjects, but it requires a well-designed feature set and a sufficient sample size. However, fMRI datasets are often noisy, high-dimensional, expensive to collect, and have small sample sizes. Additionally, training a robust predictive model that can analyze multi-site fMRI datasets with homogeneous cognitive tasks poses additional challenges.SSTL addresses these challenges by functionally aligning multi-site fMRI datasets and enhancing prediction performance in each site. The approach first extracts common features for all subjects within each site and then applies transfer learning to map these site-specific features to a shared space that is independent of any particular site. The use of a scalable optimization procedure allows effective handling of high-dimensional fMRI datasets. This procedure extracts common features for each site using a single-iteration algorithm and maps these site-specific common features to the shared space.The proposed method is evaluated by transferring between different cognitive tasks. Through comprehensive experiments, it is demonstrated that SSTL outperforms other state-of-the-art analysis techniques in terms of prediction performance.
