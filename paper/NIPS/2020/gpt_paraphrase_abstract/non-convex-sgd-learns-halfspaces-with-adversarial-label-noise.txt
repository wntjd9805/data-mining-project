We investigate the problem of learning homogeneous halfspaces in the distribution-specific PAC model without prior knowledge. We demonstrate that non-convex SGD effectively reaches a solution with a misclassification error of O(opt) + ε for various structured distributions, such as log-concave distributions. Here, opt represents the misclassification error of the most accurate halfspace. In contrast, we prove that optimizing any convex surrogate necessarily results in a misclassification error of ω(opt), even when dealing with Gaussian marginals.
