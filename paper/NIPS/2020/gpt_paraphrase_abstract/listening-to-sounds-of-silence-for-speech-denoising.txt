We propose a deep learning model for speech denoising, a significant challenge in audio analysis. By observing that there are often short pauses between sentences or words in human speech, we exploit these silent intervals to develop an automatic speech denoising model. These intervals reveal not only the presence of noise but also its time-varying characteristics, enabling the model to learn and suppress noise dynamics in the speech signal. Our experiments on various datasets demonstrate the crucial role of detecting silent intervals in speech denoising. Furthermore, our method surpasses several state-of-the-art denoising techniques, including those that solely rely on audio input and those that require audiovisual information. Moreover, our model exhibits excellent generalization capabilities, successfully denoising spoken languages that were not seen during training.
