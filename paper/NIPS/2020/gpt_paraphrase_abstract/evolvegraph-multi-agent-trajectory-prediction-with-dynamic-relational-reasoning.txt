This paper presents a trajectory forecasting framework called EvolveGraph, which focuses on understanding and accurately predicting the trajectories of multiple interacting agents. The framework utilizes latent interaction graphs to recognize and predict the relational structure among heterogeneous agents. It also considers the uncertainty of future behaviors by providing multi-modal prediction hypotheses. The framework addresses the need for dynamic relational reasoning and adaptively evolving the interaction graphs due to evolving interactions and different modalities of evolution. The paper introduces a double-stage training pipeline to improve training efficiency and model performance. The framework is evaluated on synthetic physics simulations and real-world benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art prediction accuracy.
