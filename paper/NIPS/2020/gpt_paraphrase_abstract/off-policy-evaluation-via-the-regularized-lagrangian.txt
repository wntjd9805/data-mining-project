The DICE family of estimators has advanced off-policy evaluation using behavior-agnostic data. These estimators correct for stationary distribution but have different derivations and objective functions. This paper unifies the estimators as regularized Lagrangians of the same linear program. The unification allows for the development of new DICE estimators with improved performance. By analyzing these estimators mathematically and empirically, it is found that dual solutions offer more flexibility in balancing optimization stability and estimation bias, resulting in superior estimates in practice.
