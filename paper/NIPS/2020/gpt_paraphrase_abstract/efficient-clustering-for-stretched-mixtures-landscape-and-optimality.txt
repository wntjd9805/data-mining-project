This paper addresses a clustering problem involving unlabeled samples drawn from a balanced mixture of two elliptical distributions. The goal is to develop a classifier that can estimate the labels. Traditional methods like PCA and k-means struggle when the components of the mixture are stretched instead of being spherical. To overcome this issue, we propose a non-convex program that seeks an affine transform to convert the data into a one-dimensional point cloud concentrated around -1 and 1, making clustering easier. Our contributions are twofold: (1) we demonstrate that the non-convex loss function has desirable geometric properties when the sample size is larger than a constant multiple of the dimension, and (2) we leverage this to prove that an efficient first-order algorithm can achieve nearly optimal statistical precision without requiring good initialization. Additionally, we introduce a general methodology that allows for flexible choices of feature transforms and loss objectives in clustering.
