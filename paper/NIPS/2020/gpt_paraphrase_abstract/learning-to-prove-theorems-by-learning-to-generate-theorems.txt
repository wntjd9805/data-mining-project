Automated theorem proving is an important task in AI. Although deep learning has shown promise in training theorem provers, there is a shortage of human-written theorems and proofs for supervised learning. To overcome this limitation, we propose using a neural generator to automatically create theorems and proofs for training a theorem prover. Our experiments on real-world tasks show that incorporating synthetic data from our approach enhances the performance of the theorem prover and advances the field of automated theorem proving inMetamath. The code for our approach is available at https://github.com/princeton-vl/MetaGen.
