In recent years, there has been growing interest in topological data analysis as a method for utilizing geometric structures in data analysis and learning. One key concept in this field is persistence, which examines how shape measures change as a scale parameter varies. While there are frameworks that support statistics and machine learning in this context, they mainly focus on single-parameter settings. However, in many applications, there are multiple parameters, such as scale and density, that need to be considered. Unfortunately, there is a lack of concise representations for applying statistics and machine learning in the setting of multiparameter persistence. To address this, we propose a new descriptor called the Multiparameter Persistence Image. This descriptor is suitable for machine learning and statistical frameworks, is resilient to data perturbations, offers higher resolution than existing slicing-based descriptors, and can be efficiently computed on realistic-sized datasets. We validate its effectiveness by comparing its performance to other multiparameter descriptors in various classification tasks.
