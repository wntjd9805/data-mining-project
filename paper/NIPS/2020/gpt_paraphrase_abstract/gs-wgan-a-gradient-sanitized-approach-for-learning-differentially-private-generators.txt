The availability of abundant data has led to the growth of machine learning applications in various fields. However, sensitive data, such as medical data, cannot be shared due to privacy concerns, limiting progress in those domains. To address this, we introduce Gradient-sanitized Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (GS-WGAN), which allows the release of sanitized versions of sensitive data while ensuring privacy. Unlike previous methods, our approach can distort gradient information more accurately, enabling the training of deeper models that generate more informative samples. Furthermore, our formulation supports training GANs in both centralized and decentralized data scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of metrics like sample quality and across multiple datasets.
