In this study, we analyze the effectiveness of iterative Hessian sketch in solving least-squares problems. We utilize recent findings from random matrix theory regarding the spectrum of matrices projected with subsampled randomized Hadamard transform and truncated Haar matrices. This allows us to compare and evaluate the performance of these algorithms with unprecedented precision. Our contributions include a new formula for calculating the second moment of the inverse of projected matrices. We also derive simple closed-form expressions for optimal step-sizes and convergence rates. Interestingly, our results demonstrate that the convergence rate of Haar and randomized Hadamard matrices is equivalent, and they outperform Gaussian random projections in the asymptotic sense. These techniques can be applied to other algorithms that utilize random dimension reduction.
