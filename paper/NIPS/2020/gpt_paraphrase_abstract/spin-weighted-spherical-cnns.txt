Learning equivariant representations is a promising approach to enhance the generalization performance of deep neural networks by reducing sample and model complexity. Spherical CNNs have been successful in producing SO(3)-equivariant representations of spherical inputs. However, there are two main types of spherical CNNs. The first type involves lifting inputs to functions on the rotation group SO(3) and applying convolutions on the group, which is computationally expensive due to the extra dimension. The second type applies convolutions directly on the sphere, but is limited to zonal filters, resulting in limited expressivity. In this paper, we propose a novel spherical CNN that enables the use of anisotropic filters in an efficient manner without leaving the spherical domain. Our approach leverages spin-weighted spherical functions, which were originally introduced in the study of gravitational waves in physics. These complex-valued functions on the sphere undergo phase changes upon rotation. By defining a convolution between spin-weighted functions, we construct a CNN based on this concept. Moreover, these spin-weighted functions can be interpreted as spherical vector fields, making our method applicable to tasks involving vector fields as inputs or outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches in various tasks, including spherical image classification, 3D shape classification, and semantic segmentation of spherical panoramas.
