This paper addresses the issue of multi-view data clustering when the data matrices corresponding to different views are not fully aligned. Instead, only a small portion of the matrices has established correspondence. This partially view-aligned problem (PVP) requires significant effort to capture or establish the aligned multi-view data. To tackle this challenging problem, the authors propose a novel method called partially view-aligned clustering (PVC). PVC utilizes a differentiable surrogate of the non-differentiable Hungarian algorithm and incorporates it as a pluggable module. This allows for the establishment of category-level correspondence in a latent space learned by a neural network, while also learning a common space across different views using the aligned data. The experimental results demonstrate promising outcomes of the proposed method in clustering partially view-aligned data.
