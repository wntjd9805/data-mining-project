Current methods for estimating depth or disparity often produce inaccurate results when the actual values do not align with predefined discrete values. Additionally, the use of regression loss to indirectly learn the distribution exacerbates issues in ambiguous areas around object boundaries. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel neural network architecture that can output any depth value, paired with a new loss function based on the Wasserstein distance between the predicted and true distributions. Our approach is validated across various tasks, such as stereo disparity, depth estimation, and 3D object detection. Notably, it significantly reduces errors in ambiguous regions, particularly around object boundaries crucial for precise object localization in 3D. As a result, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D object detection for autonomous driving. The code for our approach can be found at https://github.com/Div99/W-Stereo-Disp.
