The problem of designing revenue-maximizing auctions beyond a single item has remained open in mechanism design. Recent research in "differentiable economics" has utilized deep learning tools to learn effective mechanisms. One such architecture, RegretNet, can model auctions with varying numbers of items and participants and is trained to be empirically strategyproof. However, this property is not exactly verified, leaving room for market participants to exploit loopholes. To address this, we propose using techniques from the neural network verification literature to explicitly verify strategyproofness under a specific valuation profile. This involves modifying the RegretNet architecture to accurately represent it in an integer program. We train our network and generate certificates in different scenarios, including those where the optimal strategyproof mechanism is unknown.
