Recent interest has focused on exploring generative goals for counterfactual reasoning, specifically individualized treatment effect (ITE) estimation. However, current solutions do not adequately address unique issues in causal inference, such as covariate balancing and counterfactual validation. To improve ITE estimation in terms of flexibility, scalability, and accuracy, we introduce a new generative Bayesian estimation framework. This framework combines representation learning, adversarial matching, and causal estimation. Through the Robinson decomposition, we derive a reformulated variational bound that explicitly targets causal effect estimation rather than specific predictive goals. Our method considers representation uncertainties and resolves representation imbalance through a Fenchel mini-max game, enhancing counterfactual generalization. The proposed approach is supported by new theory and is robust to unobservable latent confounders. We extensively test our method against competing solutions using various simulation setups and real-world datasets, yielding promising results.
