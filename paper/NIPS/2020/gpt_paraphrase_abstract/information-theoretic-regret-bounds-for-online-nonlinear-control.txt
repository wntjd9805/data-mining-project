This study focuses on sequential control in an unknown, nonlinear dynamic system. The system dynamics are modeled as an unknown function in a known Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, allowing for discrete and continuous control inputs and non-smooth, non-differentiable dynamics. The main result of this study is the Lower Confidence-based Continuous Control (LC3) algorithm, which has a nearly optimal O(T) regret bound against the optimal controller in episodic settings, where T is the number of episodes. The regret bound does not depend explicitly on the dimension of the system dynamics, which can be infinite, but instead relies on information theoretic quantities. Empirical evidence shows the effectiveness of the LC3 algorithm in various nonlinear control tasks and highlights the benefits of exploration in learning model dynamics.
