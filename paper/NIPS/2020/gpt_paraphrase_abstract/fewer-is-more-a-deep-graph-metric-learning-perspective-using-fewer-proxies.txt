This paper introduces a new approach called ProxyGML for deep metric learning, focusing on graph classification. Unlike previous methods that sample from a mini-batch, ProxyGML uses multiple global proxies to approximate the original data points for each class. To capture local neighbor relationships, a small number of proxies are selected to construct similarity subgraphs. A reverse label propagation algorithm adjusts neighbor relationships according to ground-truth labels, enabling the learning of a discriminative metric space. Experimental results on popular datasets demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of ProxyGML compared to existing methods. The source code is available at the provided GitHub link.
