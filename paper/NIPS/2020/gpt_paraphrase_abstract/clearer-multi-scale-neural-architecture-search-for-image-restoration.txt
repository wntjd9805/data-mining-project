We introduce a new method called CLEARER, which is a neural architecture search (NAS) specifically designed for image restoration. Unlike traditional handcrafted methods, CLEARER utilizes a multi-scale search space consisting of three task-flexible modules: Parallel, Transition, and Fusion. These modules allow for the integration of multi-resolution features and the preservation of channels and spatial-resolution. We also propose novel losses that balance the tradeoff between model complexity and performance, as well as relax the discrete architecture parameters into a continuous distribution. This enables the use of a differentiable strategy for searching when to fuse or extract multi-resolution features, addressing the discretization issue faced by gradient-based NAS. Our experiments demonstrate the promising performance of CLEARER compared to other image denoising and deraining methods. The code is available at https://github.com/limit-scu.
