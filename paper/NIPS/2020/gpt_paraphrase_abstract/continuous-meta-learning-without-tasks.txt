Meta-learning is a promising approach for efficiently learning from a variety of tasks. However, current meta-learning research focuses on segmented tasks, where data is divided into separate tasks for training and learning. This limits its applicability to settings where task segmentation is not available, like continuous online learning with unsegmented time series data. To address this, we propose a method called meta-learning via online changepoint analysis (MOCA), which combines a meta-learning algorithm with a differentiable Bayesian change-point detection scheme. This allows for training and testing directly on time series data without the need for task segmentation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MOCA on nonlinear meta-regression and meta-image-classification benchmarks.
