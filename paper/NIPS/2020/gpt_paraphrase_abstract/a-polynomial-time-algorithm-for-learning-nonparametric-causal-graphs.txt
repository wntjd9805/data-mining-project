We present a polynomial-time algorithm that can learn a nonlinear, nonparametric directed acyclic graphical (DAG) model from data. Our analysis is not dependent on any specific model assumptions such as linearity, additivity, independent noise, or faithfulness. Instead, we focus on the residual variances, which are similar to those used in previous work on linear models with equal variances. We show that our algorithm has a finite-sample guarantee and that its additional cost compared to an optimal algorithm with oracle knowledge is linear in the dimension of the data and the number of samples. Furthermore, we perform a simulation study to compare our algorithm with existing approaches.
