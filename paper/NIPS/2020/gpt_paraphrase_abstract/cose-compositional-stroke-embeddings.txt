We introduce a new model for generating complex free-form structures, specifically stroke-based drawings. Existing methods focus on sequence-based models for simple objects or text, but our approach considers drawings as collections of strokes that can form intricate structures like flow-charts. Our method utilizes an innovative auto-encoder to convert variable-length strokes into a fixed-dimensional latent space. This representation allows a relational model in the latent space to better understand stroke relationships and predict future strokes. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate that our approach accurately models individual strokes and the overall composition of larger diagram drawings. Our model is suitable for interactive tasks such as auto-completing diagrams. The code and models are publicly available at https://eth-ait.github.io/cose.
