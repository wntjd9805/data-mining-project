We examine the scenario where players utilize either the Hedge algorithm or its optimistic variant to play a game with n actions repeatedly for T rounds. In the case of two-player games, we demonstrate that the regret of optimistic Hedge decreases at a rate of O(1/T 5/6), which is an improvement from the previous rate of O(1/T 3/4) stated by Syrgkanis, Agarwal, Luo, and Schapire. On the other hand, we prove that the convergence rate of vanilla Hedge is not better than O(1/âˆšT), addressing an unanswered question posed by Syrgkanis, Agarwal, Luo, and Schapire. For general m-player games, we show that the swap regret of each player decreases at a rate of O(m1/2(n log n/T)3/4) when they combine optimistic Hedge with the classical external-to-internal reduction of Blum and Mansour. Through established connections, our new regret bounds imply faster convergence to coarse correlated equilibria in two-player games and to correlated equilibria in multiplayer games.
