The problem of switching-constrained online convex optimization (OCO) is investigated in this paper, where the player has a limited number of opportunities to change their action. While the discrete version of this online learning task has been extensively studied, previous work in the continuous setting has not determined the minimax rate nor achieved it algorithmically. This paper establishes that T-round switching-constrained OCO with fewer than K switches has a minimax regret of Θ(T√), which holds true even for higher dimensions. The lower bound in higher dimensions is proven using an orthogonal subspace argument. In one dimension, a novel adversarial strategy yields a lower bound of O(T√), but a more involved minimax analysis is required for a precise understanding with constants. To establish the tighter one-dimensional result, the fugal game relaxation is introduced, which has a minimax regret lower bound equal to that of switching-constrained OCO. The fugal game is shown to have a minimax regret of at least T√, thereby establishing the optimal minimax lower bound in one dimension. Additionally, a mini-batching algorithm is presented to provide an upper bound of O(T√) independent of dimension, leading to the conclusion that the minimax regret of switching-constrained OCO is Θ(T√) for any K. This stands in sharp contrast to its discrete counterpart, the switching-constrained prediction-from-experts problem, which experiences a phase transition in minimax regret between low-switching and high-switching regimes.
