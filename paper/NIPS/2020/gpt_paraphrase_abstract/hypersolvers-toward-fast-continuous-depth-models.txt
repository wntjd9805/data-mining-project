The emergence of the infinite-depth paradigm, as pioneered by Neural ODEs, has sparked a resurgence in the search for new deep learning techniques inspired by dynamical systems. However, their application to large-scale problems has been challenging due to limited computational scalability. This study introduces hypersolvers, which are neural networks designed to efficiently solve ODEs with guaranteed accuracy. By combining hypersolvers with Neural ODEs, we achieve cost-effective inference and open up new possibilities for practical implementation of continuous-depth models. Experimental evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate consistent pareto efficiency compared to traditional numerical methods, particularly in tasks like continuous normalizing flows.
