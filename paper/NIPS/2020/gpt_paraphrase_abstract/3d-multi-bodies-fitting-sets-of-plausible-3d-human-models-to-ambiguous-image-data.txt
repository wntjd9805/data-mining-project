This study focuses on the challenge of generating detailed 3D reconstructions of humans from single and partially obstructed viewpoints. Due to limited visual evidence, it is difficult to determine a unique 3D reconstruction. Therefore, the goal is to recover multiple plausible reconstructions that align with the input data. To address this, the authors propose using a 3D model, like SMPL, to parametrize the potential body shapes and poses. They suggest that modeling uncertainties can be more effectively handled by incorporating a generative model that constrains the hypotheses to a manifold of plausible human poses. To achieve this, a multi-hypothesis neural network regressor is trained using a best-of-M loss. The results demonstrate that their approach surpasses alternative methods in recovering ambiguous poses using standard benchmarks for 3D humans, as well as heavily occluded versions of these benchmarks.
