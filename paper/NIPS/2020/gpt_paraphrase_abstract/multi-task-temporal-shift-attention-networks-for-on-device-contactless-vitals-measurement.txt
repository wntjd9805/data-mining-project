During the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of telehealth and remote health monitoring has grown significantly. This is expected to have a lasting impact on healthcare practices. These tools offer several benefits, including reducing the risk of infection for patients and medical staff, improving accessibility to healthcare services, and allowing providers to see more patients. However, accurately measuring vital signs without direct contact with patients is a challenge. In this study, we propose a novel approach using video-based and on-device optical technology to measure cardiopulmonary vital signs. Our method utilizes a multi-task temporal shift convolutional attention network (MTTS-CAN) and enables real-time measurements on mobile platforms. We tested our system on an ARM CPU and achieved high accuracy with a processing speed of over 150 frames per second, making it suitable for real-time applications. Through extensive experimentation on large benchmark datasets, we found that our approach significantly reduces measurement errors by 20% to 50% and performs well across different datasets.
