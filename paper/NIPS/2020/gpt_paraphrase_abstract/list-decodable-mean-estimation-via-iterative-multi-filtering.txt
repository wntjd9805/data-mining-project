We investigate the problem of estimating the mean in a list-decodable manner for distributions with bounded covariance. Specifically, we are provided with a set of points in Rd, where an unknown fraction α, where 0 < α < 1/2, is drawn from an unknown distribution D with a bounded covariance. No assumptions are made about the remaining points. The objective is to produce a small list of possible mean vectors, with at least one of them being close to the mean of D. We propose a practical and efficient algorithm that achieves near-optimal error. Unlike previous methods that relied on the ellipsoid method, our algorithm is iterative and utilizes spectral techniques. Our key technical contribution is the development of a soft outlier removal procedure for high-dimensional datasets with heavy-tailed distributions and a majority of outliers.
