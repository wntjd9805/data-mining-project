Non-linear spectral decompositions of images using total variation and other one-homogeneous functionals have become increasingly popular. These decompositions have the ability to extract spectral components that correspond to objects of different sizes and contrasts, allowing for various image processing applications. However, the process of obtaining this decomposition is computationally intensive, requiring the solution of multiple non-smooth optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a neural network approximation of the non-linear spectral decomposition, which provides a significant speedup compared to traditional GPU implementations. Our network, called TVSpecNET, is able to learn the underlying partial differential equation (PDE) implicitly and inherits the invariances of the model-based transform despite being entirely data-driven. This approach is the first attempt at learning a non-linear spectral decomposition of images, offering both computational advantages and the potential to study neural networks that can decompose images based on user-defined spectral components rather than handcrafted functionals.
