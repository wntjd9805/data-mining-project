Signed distance fields (SDFs) are widely used to represent 3D meshes, but they struggle with reconstructing non-convex shapes. One approach to address this issue is to incorporate a constructive solid geometry framework (CSG) that decomposes shapes into primitives. However, existing methods for CSG reconstruction are supervised and require the entire CSG parse tree during training. In contrast, we propose UCSG-NET, a model that extracts a CSG parse tree without supervision. Our model predicts primitive parameters and binarizes their SDF representation using a differentiable indicator function. It also discovers the structure of a Boolean operators tree and dynamically selects operator combinations to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. We evaluate our method on 2D and 3D autoencoding tasks and demonstrate that the predicted parse tree can be used in CAD software.
