This study examines the long-term effects of fairness criteria on population well-being in decision making processes. It focuses on the dynamics of population qualification and algorithmic decisions within a partially observed Markov decision problem framework. By analyzing the equilibrium of these dynamics, the study evaluates how static fairness constraints impact group well-being in terms of equality and improvement. The findings demonstrate that static fairness constraints can either enhance or worsen inequality based on the driving force behind qualification transitions and the influence of sensitive attributes on feature distributions. The study also explores potential interventions that can effectively improve group qualification or promote equality. Through theoretical analysis and experiments on real-world datasets, the study demonstrates the usefulness of its framework in facilitating social science research.
