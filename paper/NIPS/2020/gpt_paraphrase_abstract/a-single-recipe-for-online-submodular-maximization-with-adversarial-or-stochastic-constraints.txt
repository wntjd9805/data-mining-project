This paper presents a study on an online optimization problem where the reward functions are DR-submodular. The objective is to maximize the total reward while satisfying average convex constraints. The problem is approached under both adversarial and stochastic models for the convex constraints. The paper proposes a single algorithm that achieves sub-linear regret and sub-linear constraint violation bounds without prior knowledge of the regime. The results improve upon existing bounds for linear cumulative constraints and provide the first sub-linear bounds for general convex long-term constraints.
