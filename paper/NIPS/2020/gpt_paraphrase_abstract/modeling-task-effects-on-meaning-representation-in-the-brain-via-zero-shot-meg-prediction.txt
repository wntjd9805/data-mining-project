The representation of meaning in the brain is still a major question in neuroscience. Is a word always represented the same way, or does the task being performed affect its representation? Previous research has shown that brain activity differs across tasks when participants read the same word. However, it is not yet understood how the task itself contributes to this difference. In this study, we used Magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record brain activity while participants answered questions about concrete nouns. We examined how the task (the question being asked) affected the processing of the noun by predicting MEG recordings based on both the noun's semantics and the task. By comparing these predictions to novel tasks and nouns, we tested several hypotheses about task-stimulus interactions. Our findings show that incorporating task semantics significantly improves the prediction of MEG recordings for all participants. This improvement occurs around 475-550ms after the word is presented, which is considered to be the end of semantic processing. These results suggest that only the end of semantic processing is influenced by the task, posing a challenge for future research to develop hypotheses about earlier task effects based on the task and stimuli.
