Clustering is a crucial topic in algorithms, with applications in machine learning, computer vision, statistics, and other research fields. Traditional graph clustering aims to find clusters with low conductance, but these objectives are limited to undirected graphs and do not consider inter-cluster relationships. To address this, we focus on directed graphs and their structural information between clusters. By using the Hermitian matrix representation of digraphs, we propose an algorithm for digraph clustering that has a nearly-linear runtime and can be implemented in sublinear time under reasonable assumptions. Our theoretical work is validated through extensive experiments on the UN Comtrade Dataset, where our algorithm's output clustering reveals the relationships and evolution of clusters (countries) based on their import and export records, aligning with known facts in international trade.
