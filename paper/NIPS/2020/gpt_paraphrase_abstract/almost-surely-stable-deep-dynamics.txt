We present a technique for learning deep neural network based dynamic models that are provably stable using observed data. Our focus is on discrete-time stochastic dynamic models, which are commonly used in practical applications such as estimation and control. However, ensuring stability becomes more challenging in these cases. Our approach involves incorporating a Lyapunov neural network into the dynamic model, which automatically satisfies the stability criterion. We propose two methods for achieving this: one utilizes the convexity of the Lyapunov function, while the other enforces stability through an implicit output layer. We provide numerical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of each approach.
