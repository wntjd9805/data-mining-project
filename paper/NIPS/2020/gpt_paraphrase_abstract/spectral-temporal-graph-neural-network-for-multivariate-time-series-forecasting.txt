Multivariate time-series forecasting is a challenging task that requires considering both temporal correlations within a series and correlations between different series. Previous approaches have focused on capturing temporal correlations in the time domain and relying on predefined priors for inter-series relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (StemGNN) to enhance the accuracy of multivariate time-series forecasting. StemGNN captures both inter-series correlations and temporal dependencies simultaneously in the spectral domain. It utilizes Graph Fourier Transform (GFT) to model inter-series correlations and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to model temporal dependencies within an end-to-end framework. By applying GFT and DFT, the spectral representations exhibit clear patterns that can be effectively predicted using convolution and sequential learning modules. Importantly, StemGNN automatically learns inter-series correlations from the data without relying on predefined priors. We conduct extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of StemGNN.
