Recent advancements in neural networks have allowed for the replication of energy conservation laws through the learning of continuous-time differential equations. However, this capability has been limited to continuous time and overlooks other important physical laws. This study introduces a deep energy-based physical model that incorporates a specific differential geometric structure. This structure naturally leads to the conservation or dissipation of energy and the preservation of mass. Additionally, to ensure energetic behavior in discrete time, an automatic discrete differentiation algorithm is proposed, enabling neural networks to utilize the discrete gradient method.
