We introduce a new system called 'Audeo' that takes video frames of a pianist playing the piano as input and generates music corresponding to the video. The conversion of visual cues into music poses a difficult challenge, and it is uncertain whether it can be achieved. Our primary objective is to investigate the feasibility of this transformation and identify the cues and components that can establish the connection between visual events and sounds. To accomplish this, we have developed a comprehensive pipeline consisting of three components. Firstly, we translate the video frames of the keyboard and hand movements into a symbolic representation called Piano-Roll (Roll), which indicates the keys pressed at each time step. Next, we modify the Roll to make it suitable for audio synthesis by incorporating temporal correlations. This step is crucial for generating meaningful music. Finally, we employ Midi synthesizers to produce realistic music. Audeo successfully and seamlessly converts video to audio with minimal setup requirements. We evaluate Audeo using piano performance videos from YouTube and find that the generated music is of satisfactory audio quality and can be accurately identified by popular music recognition software. The source code and examples are available in a GitHub repository.
