Autonomous part assembly is a challenging but important task in 3D computer vision and robotics. Similar to assembling IKEA furniture, an intelligent agent must understand the 3D geometry of the parts, propose pose estimations, and use robotic planning and control to put them together. This paper focuses on the pose estimation aspect, using geometric and relational reasoning to determine the position and orientation of each part. The goal is to predict a 6-DoF pose for each part that results in a complete 3D shape. To solve this problem, we introduce an assembly-oriented dynamic graph learning framework that utilizes a graph neural network. This framework refines the assembly process sequentially, adjusting part features and relations in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our experiments and comparisons with baseline methods confirm the effectiveness of our approach.
