The problem we address in this study is finding the shortest path between a source and a destination in a graph, where the lengths of the edges are unknown. Instead of knowing the exact edge lengths, we have hints or predictions from machine learning models that have been trained on historical data and other contextual information from the network. We also assume that we can obtain the true length of any potential path by probing the network, but each probe introduces a delay. Our objective is to minimize the number of probes while still finding a path that is close to optimal with a high probability. We formalize this problem and present efficient approximation algorithms based on certain assumptions. We validate the performance of our algorithms using real data.
