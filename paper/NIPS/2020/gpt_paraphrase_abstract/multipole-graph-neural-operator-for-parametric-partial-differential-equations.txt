Using deep learning methods to simulate physical systems and solve partial differential equations (PDEs) faces challenges in structuring physics-based data for neural networks. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become popular for this task as they can model particle interactions and discretize continuum models effectively. However, current graph constructions for these tasks often neglect long-range interactions due to computational complexity issues, leading to errors that do not allow for generalization under mesh refinement. To address this, we propose a novel multi-level graph neural network framework inspired by multipole methods, which captures interactions at all ranges with linear complexity. Our multi-level formulation combines GNNs with multi-resolution matrix factorization of the kernel by recursively adding inducing points. Experimental results confirm that our multi-graph network can learn discretization-invariant solution operators for PDEs and can be evaluated in linear time.
