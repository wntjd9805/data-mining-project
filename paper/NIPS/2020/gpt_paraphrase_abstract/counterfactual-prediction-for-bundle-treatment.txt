Estimating the counterfactual outcome of different treatments using observational data is crucial for decision making in various fields. Bundle treatment, commonly used in recommendation systems and online marketing, poses a challenge due to its high dimensional binary vector representation, which makes it difficult to eliminate confounding bias. To address this, we propose a novel method called variational sample re-weighting (VSR). By assuming the presence of a low dimensional latent structure underlying bundle treatment, we use learned latent representations to decorrelate treatments and confounders, thereby eliminating confounding bias. Through extensive experiments, we validate that our re-weighted dataset improves the accuracy of predictive models for counterfactual outcome prediction.
