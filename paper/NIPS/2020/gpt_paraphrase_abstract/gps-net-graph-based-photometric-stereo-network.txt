This abstract discusses the limitations of current learning-based photometric stereo methods in predicting surface normals. It introduces a Graph-based Photometric Stereo Network that combines per-pixel and all-pixel processing to incorporate both inter-image and intra-image information. For per-pixel processing, the Unstructured Feature Extraction Layer is proposed to connect input image-light pairs into graph structures, while Structure-aware Graph Convolution filters balance the input data. For all-pixel processing, the Normal Regression Network efficiently utilizes spatial information to predict a detailed surface normal map. Experimental results demonstrate the method's excellent performance under different lighting distributions.
