We present a framework that enhances the capabilities of graph convolutional networks (GCNs) in scenarios without an input graph, and improves their resilience against adversarial attacks. Our approach involves a joint probabilistic model that incorporates a prior distribution over graphs and a likelihood based on GCNs. We have developed a stochastic variational inference algorithm to simultaneously estimate the graph posterior and the GCN parameters. To overcome the challenge of propagating gradients through discrete latent variables, we utilize their continuous relaxations called Concrete distributions. Through experiments on real datasets, we demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art Bayesian and non-Bayesian graph neural network algorithms in semi-supervised classification tasks, even in the absence of graph data and under adversarial perturbations to the network structure.
