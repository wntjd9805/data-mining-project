A conventional camera often struggles with capturing real-world scenes that have a high dynamic range, resulting in over- or under-exposure. On the other hand, a modulo camera combined with a Markov random field (MRF) based unwrapping algorithm has the potential to achieve unlimited dynamic range. However, this approach faces challenges such as modulus-intensity ambiguity, strong local contrast, and color misalignment, leading to poor performance. This paper introduces a new method called UnModNet, which reformulates the modulo image unwrapping problem as a series of binary labeling problems. It proposes a modulo edge-aware model that iteratively estimates the binary rollover masks of the modulo image for unwrapping. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can reliably generate 12-bit HDR images from 8-bit modulo images, and it is significantly faster than the previous MRF-based algorithm due to GPU acceleration.
