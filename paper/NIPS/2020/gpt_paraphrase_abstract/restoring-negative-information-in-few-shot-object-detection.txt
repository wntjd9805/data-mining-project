Few-shot learning is a new challenge in deep learning that aims to generalize deep neural networks (DNNs) on new classes with few labeled samples. While previous research has focused on few-shot image classification, this paper focuses on few-shot object detection. Initial approaches to few-shot object detection have neglected the importance of negative proposals, which are crucial for embedding space learning. To address this, the paper introduces a new metric learning framework and inference scheme that incorporates both negative and positive representatives. The proposed method significantly improves the state-of-the-art solutions for few-shot object detection, as demonstrated by experiments on ImageNet-LOC and PASCAL VOC datasets. The code for this work is available on GitHub.
