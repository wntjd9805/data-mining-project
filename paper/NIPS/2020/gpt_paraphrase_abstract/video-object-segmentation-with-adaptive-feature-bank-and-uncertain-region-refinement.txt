This paper introduces a novel framework for semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS) that is based on matching algorithms. Previous studies have shown that matching-based algorithms can achieve impressive VOS performance by creating feature banks to store relevant information for region matching and classification. However, the efficient organization of information in the growing feature bank has not been thoroughly explored, resulting in suboptimal design. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive feature bank update scheme that can dynamically incorporate new features and discard outdated ones. Additionally, we have developed a new confidence loss and a fine-grained segmentation module to improve the accuracy of segmentation in uncertain regions. Our algorithm surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods on public benchmarks.
