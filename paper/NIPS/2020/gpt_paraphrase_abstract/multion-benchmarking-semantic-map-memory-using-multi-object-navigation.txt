Navigating in realistic 3D environments is difficult due to limited observation and the need for effective planning. Previous studies have shown that using map-like memory can be beneficial for long-horizon navigation tasks. However, there hasn't been a thorough investigation into the impact of maps on navigation tasks of different complexities. To address this, we introduce the multiON task, which involves navigating to a specific sequence of objects in a realistic environment. This task tests the ability of navigation agents to locate previously observed goal objects. Through a series of experiments, we find that as task complexity increases, navigation performance significantly declines. Surprisingly, a simple semantic map agent performs well compared to more complex neural image feature map agents. Even the oracle map agents achieve relatively low performance, suggesting the need for further research in training navigation agents using maps.
