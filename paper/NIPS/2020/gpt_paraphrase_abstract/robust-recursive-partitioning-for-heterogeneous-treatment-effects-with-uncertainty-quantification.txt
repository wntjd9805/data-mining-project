Subgroup analysis is crucial in various fields, including medicine, public policy, and recommender systems. It allows for the identification of specific patient groups that are likely to benefit from a particular treatment or drug. However, current methods have limitations such as relying on a specific algorithm for estimating treatment effects, overlooking variances within identified subgroups, and lacking accurate confidence estimates. To address these weaknesses, a new approach called R2P is proposed. R2P allows for the use of any algorithm to estimate treatment effects and provides robust uncertainty quantification. Experiments using synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate that R2P creates partitions that are more homogeneous within groups and more heterogeneous across groups compared to other methods. Additionally, R2P produces narrower confidence intervals with a predetermined coverage guarantee.
