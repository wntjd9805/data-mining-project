This paper aims to address the limitations of current video object segmentation pipelines. Firstly, we propose incorporating a cyclic mechanism into the standard semi-supervised process to improve the robustness of representations. By utilizing an accurate reference mask in the initial frame, we are able to mitigate the problem of error propagation. Additionally, we introduce a simple gradient correction module that extends the offline pipeline to an online method, while still maintaining efficiency. Lastly, we develop a cycle effective receptive field (cycle-ERF) based on gradient correction, which offers a new perspective for analyzing object-specific regions of interest. Through comprehensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, such as DAVIS17 and Youtube-VOS, we demonstrate that the cyclic mechanism improves segmentation quality.
