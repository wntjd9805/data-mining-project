G-META is a novel meta-learning algorithm for graphs that can adapt quickly to new tasks even when data is limited. It utilizes local subgraphs to transfer specific information and learn transferable knowledge through meta gradients. The algorithm learns from data points in other graphs or related label sets to adapt to new tasks using only a few nodes or edges. The effectiveness of G-META is supported by theoretical justification, as evidence for predictions can be found in the local subgraph surrounding the target node or edge. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that G-META outperforms existing methods by up to 16.3%. It is capable of learning in challenging few-shot learning scenarios that involve new graphs and unseen labels. Additionally, G-META can scale to large graphs, as demonstrated on a dataset with 1,840 graphs, surpassing prior work in terms of graph quantity.
