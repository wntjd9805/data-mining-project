Memories from the past play a crucial role in cognitive tasks like understanding stories. The retention of memories over medium and long time scales in the brain is thought to be facilitated by Hebbian-type synaptic plasticity. However, it is not clear how these plasticity processes are integrated with computations in cortical networks. In this study, we present a neural network model called HebbianMemory Networks (H-Mems) that incorporates a core hetero-associative network subject to Hebbian plasticity. We demonstrate that the network can be optimized to utilize Hebbian plasticity processes for its computations. H-Mems are capable of memorizing associations between stimulus pairs in a single exposure and using these associations for future decision-making. Moreover, they can successfully tackle complex question-answering tasks based on synthetic stories. Our findings highlight the ability of neural network models to enhance their computations through simple Hebbian plasticity processes.
