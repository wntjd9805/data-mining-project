We examine the problem of estimating the mean in high-dimensional data while accounting for outliers. We focus on cases where there is a finite covariance assumption or finite low-degree moment assumptions. By analyzing a stability condition commonly used in robust statistics, we demonstrate that a significant portion of the inliers satisfy this condition with a negligible probability of failure. This implies that various algorithms for robust mean estimation, such as iterative filtering and non-convex gradient descent, provide optimal or nearly optimal error estimators with subgaussian rates. Previous analyses of these algorithms have yielded suboptimal rates. Additionally, our approach yields the first computationally efficient algorithm with a subgaussian rate for outlier-robust mean estimation in the strong contamination model under a finite covariance assumption.
