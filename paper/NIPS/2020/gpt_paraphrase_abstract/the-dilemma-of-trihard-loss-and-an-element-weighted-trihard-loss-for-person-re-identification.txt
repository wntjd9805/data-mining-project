TriHard loss, a variant of triplet loss, is designed to enhance the performance of metric learning networks by incorporating hard triplets. However, during training, there is a challenge in handling hard negative samples that have similar characteristics to the anchors and positive samples in a batch. This dilemma hinders the learning of mutual features within classes. To address this issue, various methods have been developed and tested. Additionally, an element-weighted TriHard loss is proposed to selectively increase the distance between specific elements of feature vectors, which represent the distinct characteristics between anchors and hard negative samples. The effectiveness of these approaches is evaluated on Market1501 and MSMT17 datasets, where the results surpass the current state-of-the-art baselines.
