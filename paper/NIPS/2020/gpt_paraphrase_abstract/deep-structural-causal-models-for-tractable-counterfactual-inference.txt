We present a novel method for constructing structural causal models (SCMs) using deep learning techniques. Our approach incorporates normalizing flows and variational inference to efficiently estimate exogenous noise variables, a critical step in counterfactual reasoning that is lacking in current deep causal learning methods. We validate our framework using both synthetic data generated from MNIST and a real-world medical dataset consisting of brain MRI scans. Results from our experiments demonstrate the successful training of deep SCMs capable of all three levels of causation: association, intervention, and counterfactuals. This innovative approach offers a powerful solution for addressing causal inquiries in imaging applications and other fields.
