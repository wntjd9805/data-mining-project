The self-organization of complex patterns through local interactions is a captivating phenomenon in natural and artificial systems. While cellular automata serve as examples of such systems, understanding their mechanisms is challenging and new patterns are usually discovered through manual tuning and exploration. The problem of automated diversity-driven discovery in these systems has been recently introduced, emphasizing the importance of autonomous exploration and unsupervised representation learning. This paper introduces the concept of Meta-diversity search, highlighting that there is no singular "interesting" diversity as it depends on the observer and their motives. Through experiments with a continuous game-of-life system, it is shown that using monolithic architectures for behavioral embedding design biases the discoveries towards the interests of the end-user. To address this, a dynamic and modular architecture is proposed, enabling unsupervised learning of a hierarchy of diverse representations. Combined with intrinsically motivated goal exploration algorithms, this system acts as a discovery assistant that can adapt its diversity search based on user preferences with minimal feedback.
