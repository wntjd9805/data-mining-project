This study focuses on enhancing online algorithms with machine learned (ML) advice. Specifically, we investigate the multi-shop ski rental (MSSR) problem, which extends the classical ski rental problem. In MSSR, different shops offer varying prices for buying and renting skis, requiring skiers to make decisions on when and where to purchase. We develop deterministic and randomized online algorithms that demonstrate improved performance when utilizing one or multiple ML predictions to inform decision-making. These algorithms operate without any knowledge of the ML prediction's quality or error type. They remain robust even when the predictors perform poorly, but their performance improves with more accurate predictions. Extensive experiments using synthetic and real-world data confirm our theoretical findings and demonstrate superior performance compared to algorithms that rely solely on online decision making.
