Haplotype assembly and viral quasispecies reconstruction are complex tasks in analyzing genomic mixtures using sequencing data. Current methods struggle to accurately solve this problem with low runtimes, especially as the number and length of components increase. To address this, this paper proposes a read clustering method using a convolutional auto-encoder. This method projects sequenced fragments to a low-dimensional space and estimates the probability of the read origin using learned embedded features. Consensus sequences are then used to reconstruct the components. The proposed method efficiently handles massive numbers of long reads through mini-batch stochastic gradient descent and dimension reduction. Experiments on different types of data show that the proposed method performs well in accurately reconstructing haplotypes and viral quasispecies, often surpassing state-of-the-art methods.
