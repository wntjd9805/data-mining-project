We propose a new learning framework for solving simultaneous inference and estimation problems of diffusions on networks. Our framework is based on neural mean-field dynamics and is derived from the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. It utilizes the exact evolution of node infection probabilities, obtained through a delay differential equation with memory integral. This equation is approximated using learnable time convolution operators, resulting in a structured and interpretable recurrent neural network (RNN). By using cascade data, our framework can learn both the structure of the diffusion network and the evolution of infection probabilities, which are crucial for downstream applications like influence maximization. We also establish connections between parameter learning and optimal control. Empirical study demonstrates the versatility and robustness of our approach, outperforming existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency on synthetic and real-world data.
