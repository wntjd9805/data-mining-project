New technologies have allowed us to collect large amounts of multi-omics data, which helps us understand how different molecules interact in living systems. To study these interactions, we have developed a new method called BayesianRelational Learning (BayReL). BayReL uses known relationships between molecules and learns latent variables specific to each data type. It also creates a graph that represents the interactions between different data types. Our experiments show that BayReL performs better than existing methods in identifying meaningful interactions.
