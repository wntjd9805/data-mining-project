We examine the estimation of the number of symbols that appear at least µ times in a sample of size a · n, based on a sample of size n. This problem includes the well-known issue of inferring the number of unseen species. We aim to determine the maximum value of a for which accurate prediction is possible. We solve this problem by establishing that the limit of estimation is approximately (log n)/µ, with matching lower and upper bounds. This result also applies to the case of µ = 1, which corresponds to the recent findings on the unseen species problem. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the excellent performance of our proposed estimator in practical scenarios. Additionally, the estimator is computable in linear time as it is a linear combination of empirical counts of symbols.
