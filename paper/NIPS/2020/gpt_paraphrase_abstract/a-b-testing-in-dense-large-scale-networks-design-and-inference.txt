Designing experiments and estimating treatment effects in large-scale networks, particularly in the presence of strong interference, is a difficult and significant problem. Existing methods tend to perform poorly as the network density increases. This paper introduces a new approach to accurately estimate the causal effects of a specific set of treatments in a dense large-scale network. The first step involves creating an approximate randomized controlled experiment by solving an optimization problem that allocates treatments considering competition among neighboring nodes. Then, an importance sampling adjustment is applied to correct for any remaining bias in estimating average treatment effects caused by the approximation. Theoretical guarantees are provided, and robustness is confirmed through a simulation study. Additionally, the scalability and usefulness of the proposed method are validated in a real-world experiment conducted on a large social network.
