Two different approaches have been studied for computing gradients in the time domain during the training of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). The first approach involves computing gradients based on changes in spike activation, while the second approach involves computing gradients based on changes in spike timing. This study compares these two methods and proposes a new supervised learning method that combines them. The proposed method effectively utilizes individual spikes by adjusting spike timings and generating/removing spikes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
