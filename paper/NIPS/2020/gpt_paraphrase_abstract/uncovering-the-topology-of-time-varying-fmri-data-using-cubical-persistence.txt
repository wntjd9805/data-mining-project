Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is an important tool for studying cognitive processes in humans. However, analyzing fMRI data poses challenges due to noise and individual variations in brain representation. To address this, we propose a new topological approach that represents each time point in fMRI data as a persistence diagram of topological features, specifically high-dimensional voids in the data. This representation is not reliant on voxel-by-voxel correspondence and is robust to noise. By clustering these time-varying persistence diagrams, we can identify meaningful groupings among participants and study within-subject brain state trajectories during a specific task. In this study, we applied clustering and trajectory analysis techniques to participants watching the movie 'Partly Cloudy'. Our findings reveal significant differences in brain state trajectories and overall topological activity between adults and children watching the same movie.
