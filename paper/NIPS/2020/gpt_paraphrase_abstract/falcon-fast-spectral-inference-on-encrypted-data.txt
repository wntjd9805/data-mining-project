Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is a promising security solution for Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS). It allows a client to encrypt their data and send it to a server for processing without decryption, ensuring data privacy. However, existing HE-enabled Neural Networks (HENNs) have high computational overheads. This paper introduces Falcon, a fast deep neural network that uses a Homomorphic Discrete Fourier Transform (HDFT) with block-circulant matrices to support spectral operations. Falcon also includes efficient methods like Homomorphic Spectral Convolution and Homomorphic Spectral Fully Connected operations to reduce inference latency. Experimental results show that Falcon achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and reduces inference latency by 45.45% to 85.34% compared to previous HENNs on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
