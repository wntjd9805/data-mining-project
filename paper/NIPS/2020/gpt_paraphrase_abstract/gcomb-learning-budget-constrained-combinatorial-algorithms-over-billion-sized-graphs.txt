Interest in using machine learning to discover heuristics for combinatorial problems on graphs has grown. However, existing techniques have mainly focused on obtaining high-quality solutions and have not addressed scalability to billion-sized graphs or the impact of budget constraints. This paper proposes a framework called GCOMB to address these gaps. GCOMB trains a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) using a novel probabilistic greedy mechanism to predict node quality. It also utilizes a Q-learning framework and importance sampling to handle the combinatorial nature of the problem efficiently. Extensive experiments on real graphs demonstrate that GCOMB is 100 times faster and slightly better in quality than current state-of-the-art algorithms for learning combinatorial algorithms. Furthermore, a case study on the practical problem of Influence Maximization (IM) shows that GCOMB is 150 times faster than the specialized IM algorithm IMM, while maintaining similar quality.
