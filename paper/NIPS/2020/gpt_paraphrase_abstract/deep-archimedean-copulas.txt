This study addresses the challenge of modeling joint densities of random variables using machine learning and statistics. Copulas, which are joint cumulative distribution functions with uniform marginal distributions, are commonly used to capture interdependencies separately from marginals. While copulas are widely utilized in statistics, they have not been extensively explored in the realm of modern deep learning. This paper presents ACNet, a new differentiable neural network architecture that enforces structural properties and allows for learning a specific type of copula known as Archimedean Copulas. Unlike other methods like Generative Adversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, or Normalizing Flow methods that learn densities or the generative process directly, ACNet learns a generator of the copula, which implicitly defines the cumulative distribution function of a joint distribution. The network parameters of ACNet are given a probabilistic interpretation, which is then used to derive a simple yet efficient sampling algorithm for the learned copula. Experimental results demonstrate that ACNet can approximate common Archimedean Copulas and generate new copulas that potentially offer better fits to data.
