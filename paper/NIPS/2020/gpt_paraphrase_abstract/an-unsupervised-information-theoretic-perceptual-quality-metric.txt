Building models of human perception has been a difficult task. While hand-designed models like MS-SSIM are popular due to their simplicity and speed, recent deep learning approaches have shown better performance. However, these approaches rely on supervised data, which can be expensive to obtain. To address this, we propose a new metric called Perceptual Information Metric (PIM) that combines information-theoretic objective functions, a computational architecture inspired by the human visual system, and unsupervised training on video frames. Our experiments demonstrate that PIM is competitive with supervised metrics in assessing image quality and even outperforms them in ranking image compression methods. Additionally, PIM proves to be robust across different architectural details, as shown in experiments using the ImageNet-C dataset.
