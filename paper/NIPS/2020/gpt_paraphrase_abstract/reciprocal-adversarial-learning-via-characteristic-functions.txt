Generative adversarial nets (GANs) are widely used for complex distribution tasks. To address training instability and mode collapse, a variant of GANs employs the integral probability metric (IPM) as the loss function. This paper proposes a generalization by comparing distributions using the characteristic function (CF), which contains all information about a distribution. The phase and amplitude of the CF are shown to balance generation accuracy and diversity. An efficient sampling strategy is developed to calculate CFs, and an equivalence between embedded and data domains is established. This leads to a GAN structure called reciprocal CF GAN (RCF-GAN), which utilizes only two modules and a simple training strategy to generate clear images and achieve bi-directional generation and reconstruction. Experimental results validate the superior performance of RCF-GAN in both generation and reconstruction.
