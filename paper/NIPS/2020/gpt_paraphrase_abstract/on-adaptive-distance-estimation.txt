We present a static data structure that estimates distances in a dataset. It supports adaptive queries and has low memory consumption. The structure provides a fast query time and guarantees accuracy even when queries are chosen adaptively. Previous methods do not offer error guarantees in this setting. Our memory consumption is slightly more than storing the dataset explicitly, but our query time is much faster. We discuss applications in nearest neighbor search and nonparametric estimation. Our method can be applied to other domains with minimal overhead. The answer format is abstract.
