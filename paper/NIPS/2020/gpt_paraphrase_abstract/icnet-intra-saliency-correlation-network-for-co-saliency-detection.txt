This study focuses on co-saliency detection (Co-SOD) and the importance of both intra-saliency and inter-saliency cues. Previous methods have produced coarse results due to hand-crafted features. Data-driven models have emphasized inter-saliency cues but neglected the potential of intra-saliency cues. To address this, the authors propose an Intra-saliency Correlation Network (ICNet) that extracts intra-saliency cues from single image saliency maps (SISMs) and obtains inter-saliency cues through correlation techniques. They use normalized masked average pooling (NMAP) to extract latent intra-saliency categories and semantic features as intra cues. A correlation fusion module (CFM) is employed to obtain inter cues by exploiting correlations between the intra cues and single-image features. To improve Co-SOD performance, a category-independent rearranged self-correlation feature (RSCF) strategy is proposed. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that ICNet outperforms previous methods. Abla-tion studies confirm the effectiveness of the contributions.
