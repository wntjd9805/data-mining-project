Learning with label noise that is specific to each instance is difficult because it is challenging to accurately model this type of noise. However, research has shown that humans perceive instances by breaking them down into parts. Therefore, annotators are more likely to label instances based on their parts rather than the entire instance, which can lead to incorrect mappings from parts to classes and result in instance-dependent label noise. In this paper, we propose a solution by approximating the instance-dependent label noise using part-dependent label noise. We achieve this by approximating the transition matrix for an instance using a combination of the transition matrices for its parts. We learn the transition matrices for parts by leveraging anchor points, which are data points that belong to a specific class with high certainty. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods for learning from instance-dependent label noise.
