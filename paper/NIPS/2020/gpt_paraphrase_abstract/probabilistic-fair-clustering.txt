This study focuses on clustering problems where a decision-maker aims to minimize an objective function by providing a clustering of vertices in a metric graph. Fair clustering also takes into account the representation of colors (group membership) in the clustering. Previous research in fair clustering assumes complete knowledge of group membership. However, this paper introduces the concept of imperfect knowledge of group membership through probabilistic assignments and presents algorithms with approximation ratio guarantees for this scenario. Additionally, the study addresses the problem of "metric membership" where group membership has an order and distance. Experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithms and compare them with baselines, highlighting the challenges when group membership is not known deterministically.
