The abstract discusses the issue of incomplete and over-speciÔ¨Åed knowledge bases (KBs) and their inability to answer certain queries. Query embedding (QE) techniques have been proposed to address this, where KB entities and queries are represented jointly in an embedding space to support relaxation and generalization in KB inference. However, experiments show that QE systems may disagree with deductive reasoning on certain answers. To solve this, a new QE method that is more faithful to deductive reasoning is introduced, leading to better performance on complex queries with incomplete KBs. Additionally, incorporating this new QE module into a neural question-answering system significantly improves its performance compared to the current state-of-the-art.
