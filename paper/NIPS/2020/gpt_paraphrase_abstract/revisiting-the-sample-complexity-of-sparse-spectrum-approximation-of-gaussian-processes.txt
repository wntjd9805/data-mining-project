We present a novel and scalable approximation method for Gaussian processes that provides provable guarantees across its entire parameter space. Our approximation is derived from an enhanced analysis of sparse spectrum Gaussian processes (SSGPs) and demonstrates that, under a specific data disentangling condition, the prediction and model evidence of an SSGP closely approximate those of a full GP with a low sample complexity requirement. Additionally, we introduce a new auto-encoding algorithm that identifies a latent space capable of disentangling latent input coordinates into distinct clusters, enabling our sample complexity analysis. Our proposed method is evaluated on various benchmarks, yielding promising results that align with our theoretical analysis.
