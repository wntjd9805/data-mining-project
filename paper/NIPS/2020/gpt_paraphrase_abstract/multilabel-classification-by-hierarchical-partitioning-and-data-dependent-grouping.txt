This study focuses on the problem of multilabel classification, where each data instance is assigned to multiple classes from a large set of classes. The binary label vectors in these problems are very sparse and may have an unknown hierarchical structure. The authors propose a method that leverages the sparsity and hierarchy of the label vectors to embed them in a low-dimensional space using label groupings. This enables the classification problem to be solved in a lower dimensional space and then the labels are obtained in the original space using a defined lifting process. The method is based on previous work on group testing for multilabel classification and introduces a data-dependent grouping approach using low-rank Nonnegative Matrix Factorization. Additionally, a hierarchical partitioning approach is presented to divide the label space into smaller sub-problems based on the label hierarchy in large-scale problems. This allows for independent solving of the sub-problems using the grouping approach. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed methods achieve competitive accuracy with significantly lower computational costs compared to other popular methods.
