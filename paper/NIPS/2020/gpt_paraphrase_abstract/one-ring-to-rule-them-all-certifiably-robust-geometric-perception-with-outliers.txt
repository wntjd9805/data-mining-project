We present a novel framework for designing algorithms that can accurately perceive geometric information in the presence of a large number of outliers. Our approach involves using a truncated least squares (TLS) cost function, known for its robustness to outliers but challenging optimization characteristics. We demonstrate that TLS estimation can be reformulated as an optimization problem over polynomials, and Lasserre's hierarchy of convex moment relaxations can effectively obtain the global minimum of this nonconvex problem. Additionally, we exploit the sparsity of the objective and constraint polynomials and utilize basis reduction techniques to reduce the size of the resulting semidefinite program without compromising its accuracy. We also develop dual optimality certifiers using sums-of-squares relaxation, allowing for the computation of suboptimality gap and potential certification of global optimality for any candidate solution. Our dual certifiers utilize Douglas-Rachford Splitting to solve a convex feasibility semidefinite program. Through numerical experiments on various perception problems, we demonstrate the effectiveness, correctness, and scalability of our proposed framework, even for large-scale problems that cannot be solved by current semidefinite program solvers.
