This study explores the relationship between linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for molecules. It finds that GCNs, although similar to LCAO, have unnecessary nonlinearity and deep architecture. Additionally, molecular GCNs are shown to have a poorer basis function set compared to the standard one used in theoretical calculations or quantum chemical simulations. To address these issues, the authors propose the quantum deep field (QDF), a machine learning model based on quantum physics, specifically density functional theory (DFT). The QDF model is designed as a single linear layer GCN with two vanilla feedforward neural networks to learn energy functional and Hohenberg-Kohn map. These networks incorporate nonlinearity inherent in quantum physics and DFT. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the QDF model for molecular energy prediction tasks, showcasing high extrapolation performance by training with small molecules and testing with large molecules. The authors argue for evaluating ML models based on physics using extrapolation settings rather than focusing on interpolation accuracy within benchmark datasets. This approach can lead to reliable and practical applications like fast, large-scale molecular screening for discovering effective materials.
