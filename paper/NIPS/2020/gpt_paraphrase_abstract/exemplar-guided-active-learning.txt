This study addresses the issue of efficiently labeling a small portion of a large unlabeled dataset with a limited budget. The focus is on word sense disambiguation in natural language processing. The candidate labels in the knowledge base may not accurately represent the data, as some labels may be rare in modern English while others may be missing from the knowledge base. The goal is to develop a classifier that performs well on common classes while minimizing the annotation of examples from rare classes. The challenge lies in the unknown distribution of common and rare labels, which may have extreme skew. To tackle this, the study proposes an active learning approach that utilizes contextual embedding spaces from modern language models to identify rare classes. Additionally, a stopping rule is incorporated to disregard classes that are proven to occur below the desired frequency threshold. The algorithm's cost is shown to be only logarithmically higher than a hypothetical approach with complete knowledge of label frequencies. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating automated search can significantly reduce the number of samples needed to achieve target accuracy levels.
