This abstract discusses the benefits of parsing sentences into syntax trees for natural language processing (NLP) applications. It introduces transition-based parsers, which construct trees by executing actions in a state transition system. These parsers are computationally efficient and can use machine learning to predict actions based on partial trees. However, existing transition-based parsers are based on a shift-reduce transition system, which does not align with how humans parse sentences. Psychological research suggests that human parsing is incremental, with one token being added at each step to grow a single parse tree. To address this, the paper proposes a new transition system called attach-juxtapose, which is strongly incremental. It represents a partial sentence using a single tree, with each action adding exactly one token to the tree. Based on this system, the paper develops a strongly incremental parser that encodes the partial tree using a graph neural network and predicts actions at each step. The parser is evaluated on the Penn Treebank and Chinese Treebank datasets, outperforming existing parsers on PTB and establishing a new state of the art on CTB.The code for the parser is available at https://github.com/princeton-vl/attach-juxtapose-parser.
