Graph neural networks have shown strong performance in various applications by effectively representing graph-structured data. Recent studies have highlighted the potential for further enhancing these representations through auxiliary tasks. However, the exploration of auxiliary tasks for heterogeneous graphs, which contain diverse types of nodes and edges with rich semantic information, is limited. In this study, we propose a novel self-supervised auxiliary learning method for training graph neural networks on heterogeneous graphs. Our method utilizes meta-paths, which are composite relations of multiple edge types, to predict meta-paths as auxiliary tasks while learning the primary task. This approach can be seen as a form of meta-learning. By identifying effective auxiliary tasks and automatically balancing them, our method enhances the primary task without requiring manual labeling or additional data. We validate our approach through experiments, which consistently demonstrate improved performance in link prediction and node classification on heterogeneous graphs.
