Modeling the complex spatial and temporal correlations in correlated time series data is crucial for understanding traffic dynamics and predicting future traffic patterns. Previous studies have focused on developing complex graph neural network architectures to capture shared patterns using predefined graphs. However, this paper argues that learning node-specific patterns is essential for accurate traffic forecasting and that predefined graphs are unnecessary. To address this, the authors propose two adaptive modules: the Node Adaptive Parameter Learning (NAPL) module, which captures node-specific patterns, and the Data Adaptive Graph Generation (DAGG) module, which infers the interdependencies among different traffic series automatically. Additionally, they introduce the Adaptive Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (AGCRN), which utilizes these modules and recurrent networks to automatically capture fine-grained spatial and temporal correlations in traffic series. Experimental results on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that AGCRN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods without relying on predefined spatial connections.
