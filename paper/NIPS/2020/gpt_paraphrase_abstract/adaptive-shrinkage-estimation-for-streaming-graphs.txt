Networks are a common way to represent complex systems in various fields of study. Understanding and modeling these systems often involves considering higher-order dependencies. However, in practical applications like online social networks, networks are typically huge, dynamic, and continuously updated. Due to their size and streaming nature, it is difficult to fully observe and analyze these networks. This presents a challenge in studying the higher-order structural and connectivity patterns of streaming networks. This study focuses on the problem of estimating higher-order dependencies using adaptive sampling. A new adaptive, single-pass sampling framework and unbiased estimators are proposed for analyzing large streaming networks. The algorithms use adaptive techniques to identify informative edges, allowing for efficient estimation of higher-order structures from small samples. Additionally, a novel James-Stein shrinkage estimator is introduced to reduce estimation errors. The approach is analytic, computationally efficient, and can be updated incrementally in a streaming setting. Numerical experiments on large networks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to baseline methods.
