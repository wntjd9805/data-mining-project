We introduce a new type of repeated games called contextual games, where contextual information is considered in each round. Through kernel-based regularity assumptions, we establish a connection between different contexts and game outcomes. We propose a novel online algorithm that takes advantage of these correlations to minimize the contextual regret experienced by individual players. We define contextual Coarse Correlated Equilibria (c-CCE) and optimal contextual welfare for this game class and demonstrate that c-CCEs and optimal welfare can be achieved when players' contextual regrets disappear. We conduct a traffic routing experiment to validate our findings, showing that our algorithm outperforms baselines that do not utilize contextual information or game correlations, resulting in improved performance and higher welfare.
