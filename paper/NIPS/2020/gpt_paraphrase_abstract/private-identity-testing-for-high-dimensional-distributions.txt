We introduce new differential privacy identity testers for commonly studied classes of multivariate product distributions: product distributions over {±1}d and Gaussians in Rd with known covariance. Our testers have better sample complexity compared to previous techniques and are the first to achieve the optimal sample complexity of O(d1/2/α2) in many cases. We develop two types of testers that balance sample complexity and computational complexity. Additionally, we establish a connection between testing a subset of multivariate product distributions and testing univariate distributions, allowing us to determine upper and lower bounds for testing this subset of product distributions.
