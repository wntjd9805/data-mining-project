We propose a self-adaptive learning method for removing moiré artifacts in high-frequency images using an additional defocused moiré-free blur image. Our model consists of two sub-networks that work iteratively to remove moiré patterns and restore image details. One sub-network removes moiré patterns from the input image, while the other estimates the blur kernel from the blur image. The two sub-networks are jointly optimized. Our method outperforms existing methods and can generate high-quality demoiréd results. It also generalizes well to removing moiré artifacts caused by display screens. We also introduce a new moiré dataset that includes real texture moiré patterns, which is the first of its kind.
