We provide exponential limits for the estimation error of the plug-in estimator used for weighted areas under the ROC curve. These limits apply to both individual score functions and across various classes of functions, with their complexity being managed through Gaussian or Rademacher averages. These findings support the use of learning algorithms that choose score functions to maximize the empirical partial area under the curve (pAUC). Furthermore, they demonstrate the application of recent developments in nonlinear empirical processes theory.
