This paper presents a straightforward method for analyzing and controlling Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to synthesize images with interpretable changes, such as altering viewpoint, aging, lighting, and time of day. By utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in either latent space or feature space, significant latent directions are identified. These directions are then used to define numerous interpretable controls through layer-wise perturbation. Additionally, the study demonstrates that BigGAN can be controlled using layer-wise inputs in a similar manner to StyleGAN. The results exhibit qualitative matches to edit directions obtained from previous supervised approaches.
