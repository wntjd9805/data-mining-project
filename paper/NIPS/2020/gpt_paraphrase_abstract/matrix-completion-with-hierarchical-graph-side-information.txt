We present a matrix completion problem that uses social or item similarity graphs as additional information. We develop an efficient algorithm that starts with hierarchical graph clustering and then refines estimates on both graph clustering and matrix ratings. Using a hierarchical stochastic block model and a low-rank rating matrix model, we show that our algorithm achieves the optimal sample complexity derived from maximum likelihood estimation. This means that exploiting the hierarchical structure of social graphs leads to a significant improvement in sample complexity compared to simply identifying different groups. We conduct experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to validate our theoretical results and demonstrate better performance compared to other matrix completion algorithms that utilize graph side information.
