DBSCAN is a popular clustering algorithm that uses a neighborhood graph to determine clusters. However, computing the full graph can be computationally expensive. To address this issue, we propose a variant called SNG-DBSCAN that uses a subsampled neighborhood graph. This variant only requires similarity queries for pairs of points and avoids complex data structures. The runtime of SNG-DBSCAN is determined by the sampling rate. We demonstrate that a sampling rate of s << log n is sufficient for statistical cluster recovery guarantees, resulting in improved complexity. Experimental analysis shows that subsampling as little as 0.1% of the neighborhood graph can lead to significant speedup and reduction in RAM usage compared to scikit-learn's DBSCAN implementation, while maintaining competitive clustering performance.
