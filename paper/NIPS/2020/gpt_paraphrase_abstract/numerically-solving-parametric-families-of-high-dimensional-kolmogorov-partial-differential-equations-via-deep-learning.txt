We introduce a deep learning algorithm that can solve high-dimensional linear Kolmogorov partial differential equations (PDEs) parametrized by families. Our approach involves transforming the numerical approximation of the entire family of PDEs into a single statistical learning problem using the Feynman-Kac formula. Through successful numerical experiments, we validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm in solving heat equations and Black-Scholes option pricing models with affine-linear coefficient functions. Remarkably, our findings show that a single deep neural network, trained on simulated data, can learn the solution functions for an entire family of PDEs across a full space-time region. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method overcomes the curse of dimensionality, setting it apart from conventional numerical methods for PDEs.
