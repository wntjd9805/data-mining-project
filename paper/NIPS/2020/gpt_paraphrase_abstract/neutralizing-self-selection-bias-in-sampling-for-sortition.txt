Sortition is a political system where randomly selected citizens make decisions. The traditional method of selecting a sortition panel is through uniform sampling without replacement, which is considered fair. However, in reality, sampling without replacement is not feasible due to a fraction of citizens refusing to participate and different demographic groups having varying participation rates. To address this issue, we propose a sampling algorithm that ensures equal representation probabilities for all citizens while meeting demographic quotas. Our algorithm requires participation probabilities, which are not directly observable. We demonstrate how to learn these probabilities using real sortition panel data and publicly available survey data on the general population.
