We propose a new algorithm for instance segmentation in computer vision. Instead of employing a search-based strategy, our algorithm directly utilizes a fully convolutional network (FCN) to predict instance labels. We introduce a variational relaxation of instance segmentation, treating it as an optimization problem for piecewise-constant segmentation. This allows us to train the FCN end-to-end. Our algorithm extends the Mumford-Shah variational segmentation algorithm to handle the permutation-invariant ground truth in instance segmentation. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MSCOCO 2017 datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our approach. The source code and trained models are available at the provided link.
