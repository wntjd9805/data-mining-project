The concept of an ideal observer is used to analyze visual systems and determine the optimal response for a given task. Bayesian ideal observers can provide optimal responses under uncertainty if they have the true distribution information. Previous studies have used signal to noise ratio or psychophysics experiments to set distributional parameters for simple targets on known background patterns in visual search tasks. However, these methods are not easily applicable to complex targets in natural scenes. In this study, we develop a model to estimate the parameters of target-present and target-absent distributions in a visual search task using natural images. Our model takes into account the uncertainty of target position and the reduced performance of the visual system in the periphery compared to the fovea. We use an automated prediction algorithm that combines logistic regression and deep neural networks. Eye tracking data from 12 observers detecting targets on natural image backgrounds are used to fine-tune the model and evaluate its performance. The model of target detectability is then used in a Bayesian ideal observer model of visual search and compared to human search performance.
