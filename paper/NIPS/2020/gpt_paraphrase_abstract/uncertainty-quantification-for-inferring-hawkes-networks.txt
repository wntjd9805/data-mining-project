We propose a statistical inference framework to effectively analyze complex datasets with uncertainty quantification. Our focus is on learning causal relationships between nodes in streaming networked event data using multivariate Hawkes processes. We introduce a non-asymptotic confidence set for the maximum likelihood estimate of the network multivariate Hawkes process, utilizing concentration inequalities of continuous-time martingales. This approach is compared to the previously-derived asymptotic Hawkes process confidence interval and is shown to be more robust, as demonstrated in a neuronal connectivity reconstruction application.
