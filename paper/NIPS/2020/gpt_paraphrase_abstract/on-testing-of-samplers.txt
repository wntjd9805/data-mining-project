The problem of sampling involves selecting items from a set based on their weights. Sampling is important in machine learning, but it is computationally complex and lacks rigorous theoretical analysis. A recent veriÔ¨Åer called Barbarik was developed for samplers that sample uniformly, but it cannot handle general weight functions. This paper presents Barbarik2, a new algorithm that can test whether a sampler generates samples close or far from a target distribution, regardless of the weight function. Barbarik2 requires fewer samples compared to other techniques and can handle any arbitrary weight function. The paper includes a prototype implementation of Barbarik2 and tests it on three state-of-the-art samplers.
