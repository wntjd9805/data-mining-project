A new discriminator for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is introduced, which enhances the authenticity and variety of generated samples by learning a structured embedding space using spherical circles. This novel discriminator focuses on populating realistic samples around the longest spherical circle, while pushing unrealistic samples towards the poles perpendicular to the circle. By discriminating samples based on their corresponding spherical circles, the proposed method naturally encourages diversity in the generated samples. Additionally, the method is extended to handle conditional generation by creating a separate hypersphere for each category and performing class-wise discrimination and update. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in both unconditional and conditional generation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks.
