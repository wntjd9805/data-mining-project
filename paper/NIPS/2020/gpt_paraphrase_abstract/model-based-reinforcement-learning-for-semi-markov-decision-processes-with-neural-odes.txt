We propose two innovative solutions for modeling continuous-time dynamics in a new framework for semi-Markov decision processes (SMDPs) using neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). These models accurately capture continuous-time dynamics and allow us to create effective policies with limited data. Additionally, we introduce a model-based approach to optimize time schedules, reducing interaction rates with the environment while still achieving near-optimal performance. This approach is not feasible with model-free methods. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in different continuous-time domains.
