We propose a new generative model for face images that allows for precise control over eye gaze and head orientation angles. Our model disentangles various appearance factors, including lighting and hue, to achieve this control. We introduce a novel architecture that learns to discover and encode these factors in a self-learned manner. Our method outperforms existing techniques in accurately modeling gaze and head orientation changes. We also demonstrate that our approach improves semi-supervised cross-dataset gaze estimation when training data is limited.
