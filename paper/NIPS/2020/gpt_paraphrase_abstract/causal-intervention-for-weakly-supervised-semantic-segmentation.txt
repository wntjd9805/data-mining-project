We introduce a causal inference framework for enhancing Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS). Our main objective is to improve the generation of pixel-level pseudo-masks using only image-level labels, which is a critical step in WSSS. We attribute the issue of ambiguous boundaries in pseudo-masks to the confounding context, where the recognition of instances such as "horse" and "person" is influenced not only by each individual instance but also by their co-occurrence context. This makes it difficult for models like CAM (Class Activation Map) to accurately distinguish between boundaries. Inspired by this observation, we propose a structural causal model that analyzes the causal relationships among images, contexts, and class labels. Based on this model, we introduce a new method called Context Adjustment (CONTA) to eliminate the confounding bias in image-level classification, resulting in improved pseudo-masks that can be used as ground-truth for subsequent segmentation models. Our experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate that CONTA significantly enhances various popular WSSS methods, pushing them to new state-of-the-art performance levels.
