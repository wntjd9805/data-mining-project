Advances in neuroscience data collection now allow for the simultaneous recording of large groups of neurons across various brain regions while subjects engage in complex cognitive tasks. However, interpreting this data is challenging due to the mixing of different task parameters at the individual neuron level. To address this issue, we introduce a novel technique called demixed shared component analysis (dSCA), inspired by a method used for a single brain area. dSCA breaks down population activity into a few components that capture the maximum amount of shared information across brain regions while also considering relevant task parameters. This approach produces interpretable components that reveal which variables are shared between brain regions and when this information is shared over time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of dSCA by reanalyzing two datasets from decision-making tasks in rodents and macaques. Our findings using dSCA provide new insights into the shared computation between different brain areas in these datasets, shedding light on various aspects of decision formation.
