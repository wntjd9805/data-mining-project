The closed form solutions for optimal transport (OT) problems are limited to specific cases, such as 1D or between Gaussians. However, these closed forms have been valuable for practitioners in developing tools based on OT geometry. On the other hand, numerical methods using entropic regularization have been widely used for solving OT problems, but lack elegant closed form solutions. In this paper, we bridge the gap between these two approaches by proving that the entropy-regularized optimal transport problem between two Gaussian measures does have a closed form solution. Unlike the unregularized case, where the solution is given by the Wasserstein-Bures distance, our closed form solution is differentiable everywhere, even for Gaussians with degenerate covariance matrices. We achieve this by solving the fixed-point equation used in Sinkhorn's algorithm, the standard method for computing entropic regularized OT. This approach also extends to the generalized unbalanced case, where Gaussian measures are scaled by positive constants. We show that the optimal transportation plans in both cases are (scaled) Gaussians and provide analytical formulas for their parameters. These formulas represent the first non-trivial closed forms for entropy-regularized optimal transport and provide a basis for analyzing entropic OT and Sinkhorn's algorithm.
