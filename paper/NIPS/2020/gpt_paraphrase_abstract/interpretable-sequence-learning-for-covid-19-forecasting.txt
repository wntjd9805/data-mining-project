We present a new method that combines machine learning with compartmental disease modeling to predict the progression of COVID-19. Our approach is designed to be transparent, explicitly illustrating how different compartments evolve and incorporating interpretable encoders to enhance performance by considering additional factors. This transparency is crucial to ensure that the predictions made by our model are trusted by epidemiologists and inspire confidence in decision-makers and healthcare organizations. Our model can be applied at various geographic levels, and we demonstrate its effectiveness at both state and county levels in the United States. Through comparative analysis, we show that our model outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy and provides meaningful explanations for the observed trends.
