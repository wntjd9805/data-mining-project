Traditional sequential decision-making paradigms aim to maximize the cumulative reward when interacting with an unknown environment. However, these paradigms do not effectively model practical applications such as safe control, which seeks to maximize the lowest reward. In this study, we propose a new planning algorithm for deterministic systems that addresses a wide range of objective functions commonly found in practical applications. By leveraging sketching algorithms, we demonstrate that efficient planning is feasible for objective functions that are symmetric under permutation of coordinates and meet certain technical conditions. Additionally, we prove that removing any of these conditions would render the problem intractable in the worst case, highlighting the importance of our proposed conditions.
