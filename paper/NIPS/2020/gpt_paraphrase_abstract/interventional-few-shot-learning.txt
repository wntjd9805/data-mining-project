We have identified a deficiency in current Few-Shot Learning (FSL) methods, specifically the limitation imposed by pre-trained knowledge. Through our causal assumption and Structural Causal Model (SCM), we introduce a new FSL approach called Interventional Few-Shot Learning (IFSL). We present three effective IFSL algorithms based on backdoor adjustment, a causal intervention technique for many-shot learning. It is important to note that IFSL complements existing FSL methods such as fine-tuning and meta-learning, improving their performance. We achieve state-of-the-art results in 1-/5-shot scenarios on various datasets including miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, and cross-domain CUB. The code for IFSL is available at https://github.com/yue-zhongqi/ifsl.
