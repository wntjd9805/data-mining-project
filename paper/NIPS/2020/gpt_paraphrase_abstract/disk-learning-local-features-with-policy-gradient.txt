The authors propose a new method called DISK (DIScrete Keypoints) to address the challenges of learning local feature frameworks in an end-to-end manner. They use principles from Reinforcement Learning to optimize for a high number of correct feature matches. Their probabilistic model allows for close alignment between training and inference, and can be trained reliably from scratch. The proposed method challenges traditional assumptions about good keypoints by extracting dense and discriminative features. Experimental results on three public benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.
