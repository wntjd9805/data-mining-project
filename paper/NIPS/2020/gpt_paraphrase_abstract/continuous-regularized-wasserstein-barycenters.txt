The abstract discusses the challenges in computing Wasserstein barycenters, which are a meaningful way to aggregate probability distributions based on optimal transport theory. Previous approaches have limited their supports to finite sets of points. To address this, the authors propose a stochastic algorithm that constructs a continuous approximation of the barycenter. They establish strong duality and use the primal-dual relationship to parametrize the barycenter implicitly. This allows the problem to be solved using stochastic gradient descent, resulting in an efficient online algorithm for approximating the barycenter of continuous distributions. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through comparisons with previous work on synthetic examples and real-world applications.
