Recent research has discovered enough prerequisites for finite mixture models to be distinguishable from grouped observations. These prerequisites allow for nonparametric mixture components that may heavily overlap, or even wholly overlap. This study presents an algorithm that reliably estimates any distinguishable mixture model from grouped observations. Our analysis relies on an oracle inequality for weighted kernel density estimators of the group distribution, along with a general finding that consistent estimation of the group distribution implies consistent estimation of mixture components. A practical implementation is provided for paired observations, and the approach proves to be superior to existing methods, particularly when there is significant overlap among mixture components.
