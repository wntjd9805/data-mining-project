Neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are commonly used to model temporal dynamics. However, a major drawback is that ODE solutions are solely determined by initial conditions and do not consider subsequent observations. In this study, we propose a solution to this issue by incorporating controlled differential equations. This new neural controlled differential equation model is applicable to partially observed, irregularly sampled multivariate time series data. Moreover, it can efficiently utilize memory with adjoint-based backpropagation across observations. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms other ODE or RNN based models on various datasets. Theoretical analysis proves universal approximation and shows that our model encompasses alternative ODE models.
