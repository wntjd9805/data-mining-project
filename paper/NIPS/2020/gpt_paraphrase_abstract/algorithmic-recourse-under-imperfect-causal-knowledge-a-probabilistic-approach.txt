Counterfactual explanations for algorithmic recourse have been criticized for their limitations and the need to consider causal relationships between features. However, the true underlying causal model is often unknown in practice. This study demonstrates the impossibility of guaranteeing recourse without access to the true structural equations. To overcome this limitation, two probabilistic approaches are proposed to select optimal actions that achieve recourse with high probability, even with limited causal knowledge. The first approach utilizes Bayesian model averaging to estimate the counterfactual distribution by accounting for uncertainty over structural equations with additive Gaussian noise. The second approach computes the average effect of recourse actions on individuals similar to the person seeking recourse, thereby introducing a novel subpopulation-based interventional concept of recourse without making assumptions on the structural equations. A gradient-based procedure is then derived to select the optimal recourse actions. Empirical results reveal that these proposed approaches provide more reliable recommendations under imperfect causal knowledge compared to non-probabilistic baselines.
