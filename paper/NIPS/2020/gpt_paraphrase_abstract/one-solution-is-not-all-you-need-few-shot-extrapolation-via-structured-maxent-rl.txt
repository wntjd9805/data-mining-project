Reinforcement learning algorithms are effective for complex tasks but struggle with minor variations in the task. One solution is to manually introduce variations during training, but this may not always be feasible or effective. This study proposes a different approach: training agents to learn diverse behaviors within a single environment. By identifying multiple solutions for the task, the agents can adapt to different situations by abandoning ineffective solutions and adopting effective ones. The authors theoretically define a set of robust environments resulting from this approach and demonstrate through experiments that it can successfully handle changes in both the environment and the task.
