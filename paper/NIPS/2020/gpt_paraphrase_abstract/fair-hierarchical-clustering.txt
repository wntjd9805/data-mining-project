As the use of machine learning continues to grow, researchers are realizing the importance of ensuring fairness in these systems. There has been recent interest in defining a concept of fairness that addresses the problem of over-representation in traditional clustering methods. This paper extends this concept to hierarchical clustering, which involves recursively dividing data to optimize a specific objective. We propose simple and efficient algorithms to find a fair hierarchical clustering for various objectives, with empirical evidence showing that our algorithms achieve fairness while maintaining a minimal loss in the objective.
