We propose a method for off-policy evaluation in high-stakes scenarios such as medical diagnosis or financial decision-making. Our method provides provably correct upper and lower bounds of the expected reward, rather than a single point estimate. We achieve this by searching for the maximum and minimum values of the expected reward among all consistent Lipschitz Q-functions. This involves solving a constrained optimization problem on a Lipschitz function space. Additionally, we introduce a simple and efficient Lipschitz value iteration method to tighten the interval bounds. Our method is demonstrated to be practical and efficient on various benchmarks.
