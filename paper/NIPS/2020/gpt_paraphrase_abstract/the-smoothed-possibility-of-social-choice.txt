We present a framework based on Spielman and Teng's smoothed complexity analysis to address paradoxes and impossibility theorems in social choice, particularly in the context of AI and ML applications. Regarding Condorcet's paradox, we demonstrate that the likelihood of the paradox diminishes either exponentially or remains constant as the number of agents increases. Concerning the ANR impossibility of finding voting rules that satisfy anonymity, neutrality, and resolvability simultaneously, we establish that the rate at which this impossibility disappears can be either polynomial or exponential. Additionally, we introduce a new tie-breaking mechanism that maintains anonymity and neutrality optimally for an even number of alternatives in real-world scenarios. Our findings highlight that while these paradoxes and impossibility theorems hold in worst-case scenarios, they may not significantly affect practical social choice scenarios.
