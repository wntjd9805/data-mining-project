We have achieved impressive image synthesis results by utilizing diffusion probabilistic models, which are latent variable models inspired by nonequilibrium thermodynamics. By training our models using a weighted variational bound based on a novel connection between diffusion probabilistic models and denoising score matching with Langevin dynamics, we have achieved optimal outcomes. Furthermore, our models naturally allow for a progressive lossy decompression scheme, which can be seen as an extension of autoregressive decoding. On the unconditional CIFAR10 dataset, we obtained an Inception score of 9.46 and a state-of-the-art FID score of 3.17. When applied to the 256x256 LSUN dataset, our samples exhibit similar quality to ProgressiveGAN. Our implementation can be accessed at https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion.
