This paper introduces a new approach for one-class learning using neural networks. Instead of using auto-encoders or GAN style adversarial training, the proposed method, called HRN, utilizes a novel regularization technique called holistic regularization (H-regularization). This regularization allows the system to consider the data as a whole, avoiding biases towards specific features. The method also incorporates a 2-norm instance-level data normalization. The effectiveness of HRN is demonstrated through experimental evaluation on benchmark image classification and anomaly detection datasets, where it outperforms existing deep/non-deep learning models. The proposed regularization and normalization methods are novel and have not been previously reported. The code for HRN can be found at [link].
