Differentially private algorithms ensure that the input of a single user does not significantly alter the output distribution. Increasing the number of data points provided by a user can enhance the algorithm's performance, but it also requires adding more noise to maintain differential privacy, which may hinder performance. A previous study introduced an algorithm that limits user contributions based on a threshold. To achieve a better balance between utility and privacy, we propose a method that smoothly restricts user contributions by assigning appropriate weights to data points. We apply this approach to estimate mean/quantiles, linear regression, and empirical risk minimization. Our algorithm is proven to outperform the sample limiting algorithm, and we validate our theoretical findings through experimental evaluations.
