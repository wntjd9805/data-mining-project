Recent research has shown that the accuracy of detecting forged images can be enhanced by using more diverse and challenging datasets. However, there is a shortage of datasets that contain a wide range of appearance variations, making it difficult for detection algorithms to perform well in such situations. To address this issue, this study introduces a new algorithm for swapping identities that produces images with significant differences in appearance. These differences primarily arise from variations in lighting and skin color commonly found in real-world scenarios. The complex task of accurately transferring these appearance differences while preserving identity traits is accomplished by formulating it as an optimal transport problem. The proposed Appearance Optimal Transport model (AOT) solves this problem by minimizing the Wasserstein distance in both the latent and pixel space, resulting in improved performance and reduced computation compared to traditional optimization methods. To further refine the optimal transport solution, a segmentation game is employed to minimize the Wasserstein distance in the pixel space. A discriminator is introduced to differentiate between fake and a mixture of real and fake image patches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches and the effectiveness of our generated data in improving the accuracy of detecting forged images.
