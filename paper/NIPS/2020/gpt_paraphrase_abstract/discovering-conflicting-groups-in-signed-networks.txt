This paper focuses on studying the detection of k conflicting groups in a signed network, where edges are labeled as positive or negative to indicate friendly or antagonistic interactions. The objective is to identify groups that are internally positively connected but negatively connected with the other k-1 groups. Unlike previous studies that aim for a complete partition of the network, this paper allows for a subset of neutral nodes. The problem is approached by formulating each conflicting group as a solution to the maximum discrete Rayleigh's quotient (MAX-DRQ) problem. Two spectral methods are proposed to find approximate solutions to the MAX-DRQ problem and are theoretically analyzed. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that the proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art approaches in terms of solution quality, speed, and accuracy in recovering ground-truth conflicting groups.
