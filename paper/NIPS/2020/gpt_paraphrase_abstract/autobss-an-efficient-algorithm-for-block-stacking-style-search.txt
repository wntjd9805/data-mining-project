Neural network architecture design typically focuses on convolutional operators and special network block structures, but little attention has been given to the configuration of stacking these blocks, known as Block Stacking Style (BSS). Recent studies have shown that BSS can significantly influence networks, so we have developed a new algorithm called AutoBSS to automatically search for the optimal BSS. AutoBSS is an innovative AutoML algorithm that uses Bayesian optimization to refine and cluster Block Stacking Style Coding (BSSC), allowing it to find the best BSS with unbiased evaluation in a few trials. Our experiments on ImageNet classification task using ResNet50/MobileNetV2/EfficientNet-B0 with the searched BSS have achieved significantly better results (79.29%/74.5%/77.79%) compared to the original baselines. Furthermore, we have demonstrated the strong generalizability of AutoBSS through experiments on model compression, object detection, and instance segmentation, confirming the undeniable impact of BSS on neural networks.
