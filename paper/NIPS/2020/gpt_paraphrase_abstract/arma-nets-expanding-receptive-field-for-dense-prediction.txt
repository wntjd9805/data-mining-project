Global information is crucial for dense prediction problems, which aim to assign labels to each pixel in images. Traditional convolutional layers in neural networks are limited in their ability to capture global information due to their fixed filter size. This study proposes replacing traditional convolutional layers with autoregressive moving-average (ARMA) layers, which have an adjustable receptive field controlled by learnable autoregressive coefficients. Compared to convolutional layers, ARMA layers allow for explicit interconnections between output neurons and learn their receptive field by adapting the autoregressive coefficients. The ARMA layer is adaptable to different tasks, with the ability to learn large coefficients for tasks requiring global information and small or near zero coefficients for tasks requiring only local information. The effective receptive field of networks with ARMA layers expands with larger autoregressive coefficients. The instability problem in learning and prediction within the ARMA layer is solved through a re-parameterization mechanism. Experimental results show that ARMA networks significantly improve performance on challenging dense prediction tasks such as video prediction and semantic segmentation. The code for ARMA networks is available on GitHub.
