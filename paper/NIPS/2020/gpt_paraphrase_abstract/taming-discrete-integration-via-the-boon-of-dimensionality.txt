Discrete integration is a core issue in computer science that involves calculating sums over large sets. Despite decades of research, there is still a need for scalable methods that provide accurate estimates for discrete integration. This study tackles this challenge by efficiently reducing discrete integration to model counting. Contrary to popular belief, increasing the dimensionality actually simplifies the problem by transforming it into model counting. Building on previous work, the proposed reduction called DeWeight overcomes the limitation of using only dyadic weights. To enhance DeWeight, an advanced approximate model counter is incorporated, and extensive empirical analysis is performed using benchmarks from neural network verification domains. DeWeight is the first technique known to provide provable guarantees for estimating this type of benchmarks.
