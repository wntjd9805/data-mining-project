This paper presents new findings regarding the score function gradient estimator of the importance weighted variational bound (IWAE). The authors demonstrate that by choosing the appropriate control variate, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the estimator can increase as the number of importance samples (K) grows, unlike the standard pathwise gradient estimator where the SNR decreases. Building on these theoretical results, the authors propose a novel control variate that extends on VIMCO. Empirically, this method achieves better variance reduction in training both continuous and discrete generative models, resulting in an increased SNR for IWAE without relying on the reparameterization trick. The new estimator is comparable to state-of-the-art reparameterization-free gradient estimators like RWS and TVO when training generative models.
