Reconstructing 3D objects from 2D images is a key task in computer vision. Accurate structured reconstruction using simple and meaningful representations is highly valuable in various applications. When reconstructing a shape using multiple simple representations, it is important to have easy access to its essential properties, such as volume and surface. This allows these representations to be treated as a single shape. Current primitive representations do not fulfill these requirements. To address this, we propose a new representation called neural star domain (NSD), which learns primitive shapes in a star domain. We demonstrate that NSD is a versatile approximator of the star domain and offers both implicit and explicit shape representations that are parsimonious and semantic. Our approach surpasses existing methods in image reconstruction tasks, offering improved semantic capability, sampling speed, and quality for high-resolution meshes.
