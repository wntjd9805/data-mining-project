Pairwise alignment of DNA sequencing data is a common and computationally intensive task in bioinformatics. Current approaches use hashing to identify shared short segments (k-mers) between pairs of reads, allowing for alignment score estimation. However, accurately estimating alignment scores for all pairs becomes increasingly costly as the number of reads grows. Additionally, in practice, the focus is on identifying pairs of reads with high alignment scores. This study introduces a new approach to pairwise alignment estimation, incorporating two key components. Firstly, the problem is framed within a general framework of rank-one crowdsourcing models, where the workers' responses correspond to k-mer hash collisions. These models can be accurately solved using a spectral decomposition of the response matrix. Secondly, a multi-armed bandit algorithm is employed to adaptively refine the spectral estimator specifically for read pairs that are more likely to have significant alignments. The resulting algorithm performs a spectral decomposition of the response matrix iteratively for selected subsets of read pairs.
