We investigate the challenge of online learning with primary and secondary losses. In scenarios such as a recruiter hiring job applicants, false positives and false negatives may have different weights for different parties involved. Our objective is to combine expert advice to minimize regret in terms of the primary loss, while also ensuring that the performance is not significantly worse than the worst expert in terms of the secondary loss. However, we demonstrate that this objective cannot be achieved without a bounded variance assumption on the secondary loss. On a positive note, we prove that by using a switching-limited algorithm, this objective can be accomplished if all experts meet the condition that the secondary loss remains below the linear threshold within any time interval. In cases where not all experts meet this condition, our algorithms can still achieve the objective with the assistance of external oracles that determine when to deactivate and reactivate experts.
