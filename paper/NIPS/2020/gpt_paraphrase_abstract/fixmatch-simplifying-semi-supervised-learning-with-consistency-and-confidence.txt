Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has made significant progress recently but requires complex methods. This paper introduces FixMatch, a simplified SSL algorithm. FixMatch generates pseudo-labels based on model predictions on weakly-augmented unlabeled images. Only high-confidence predictions are retained. The model is then trained to predict the pseudo-labels using strongly-augmented versions of the same images. Despite its simplicity, FixMatch achieves state-of-the-art performance on various SSL benchmarks. For example, it achieves 94.93% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 250 labels and 88.61% accuracy with just 4 labels per class. The study includes an extensive analysis of factors contributing to FixMatch's success. The code is available at https://github.com/google-research/fixmatch.
