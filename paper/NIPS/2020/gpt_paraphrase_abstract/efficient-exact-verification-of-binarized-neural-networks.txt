Researchers have developed verification techniques to ensure the reliability of neural networks. However, these techniques often face scalability challenges and do not provide complete correctness guarantees due to floating point errors. In this study, we propose the use of Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) as an alternative that offers comparable robustness and allows for more efficient verification. We introduce a new system called EEV, which consists of a novel SAT solver that handles cardinality constraints in BNN encodings and strategies to train solver-friendly robust BNNs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EEV by conducting the first exact verification of bounded adversarial robustness for convolutional BNNs on the MNIST and CI-FAR10 datasets. In comparison to verification of real-valued networks, EEV verifies BNNs significantly faster while maintaining comparable verifiable accuracy.
