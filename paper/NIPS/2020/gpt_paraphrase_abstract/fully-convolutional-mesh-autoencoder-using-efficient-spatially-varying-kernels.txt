This study focuses on the importance of learning latent representations of registered meshes for various 3D tasks. While neural mesh autoencoders have shown better precision compared to traditional methods, they struggle to capture detailed deformations and are limited to template-specific surface meshes. More general mesh types like tetrahedrons and non-manifold meshes pose a challenge for existing methods, which either lack reconstruction precision or require high memory usage. To address these limitations, the authors propose a non-template-specific fully convolutional mesh autoencoder that can handle arbitrary registered mesh data. Their approach utilizes novel convolution and (un)pooling operators with globally shared weights and locally varying coefficients. This enables efficient capture of spatially varying contents presented by irregular mesh connections. The proposed model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy. Additionally, the fully convolutional structure allows for fully localized latent codes, resulting in higher interpolation capability compared to traditional 3D mesh generation models.
