We propose an algorithm for learning general Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) with improved time complexity. RBMs are undirected graphical models with latent variables, represented by a bipartite graph. Current algorithms have time complexity of approximately O(n^2) for ferromagnetic RBMs and O(nd) for general RBMs. Our algorithm has a time complexity of approximately O(n^2s+1), where s is the maximum number of latent variables connected to the Markov Random Field (MRF) neighborhood of an observed variable. This improvement is particularly significant for RBMs with sparse latent variables (s < log2(d-1)). Additionally, our algorithm recovers a model with small prediction error and has a sample complexity independent of the minimum potential in the MRF of the observed variables. This is advantageous as current algorithms' sample complexity scales with the inverse of the minimum potential, which lacks control in terms of RBM's natural properties.
