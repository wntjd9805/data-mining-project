There is a lack of known defenses against adversarial attacks on object detectors. Adversarial training can improve the robustness of image classifiers, but it is costly to extend to object detection. This research is inspired by recent advancements in certified classification using randomized smoothing. The authors propose a reduction from object detection to a regression problem and introduce median smoothing to enable certified regression. This approach provides the first model-agnostic, training-free, and certified defense for object detection against bounded attacks.
