This study investigates the time complexities of unbalanced optimal transport problems from an algorithmic standpoint. It aims to determine the efficiency of solving these problems and identifies the ones that can or cannot be solved efficiently. Specifically, we demonstrate that the Kantorovich Rubinstein distance and optimal partial transport in the Euclidean metric cannot be computed in strongly subquadratic time, based on the strong exponential time hypothesis. However, we propose a novel algorithm that can precisely solve a more general unbalanced optimal transport problem in quasi-linear time on a tree metric. Remarkably, our algorithm can process a tree with a million nodes in less than one second. This analysis lays the groundwork for further theoretical exploration of unbalanced optimal transport algorithms and enables the application of unbalanced optimal transport to large-scale datasets.
