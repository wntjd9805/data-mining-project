When creating new molecules with specific properties, it is vital to consider not only what to make, but also how to make it. These instructions are represented by a synthesis directed acyclic graph (DAG), which outlines how simple building blocks can be combined through chemical reactions to form more complex molecules. However, many current deep generative models for molecules do not take into account the feasibility of synthesis. To address this, we propose a deep generative model that directly outputs molecule synthesis DAGs, aiming to better represent the real-world process. This approach incorporates sensible inductive biases, ensuring that our model explores the same chemical space accessible to chemists and also provides interpretability. We demonstrate that our method effectively models chemical space, generating a diverse range of molecules, and allows for unconstrained optimization of chemical properties while ensuring synthesizability.
