This paper presents a new efficient approximation algorithm for finding the most likely configuration (MAP) of size k for Determinantal Point Processes (DPP) in the online setting. In this setting, data points arrive in any order and the algorithm cannot remove selected elements from its local memory. The proposed ONLINE-DPP algorithm achieves a kO(k) multiplicative approximation guarantee with an additive error âŒ˜, while maintaining a memory footprint that is independent of the size of the data stream. It should be noted that the exponential dependence on k in the approximation factor is unavoidable even in the offline setting. However, this result enables the development of a streaming algorithm with an improved memory bound compared to existing methods.
