We investigate the fixed-support Wasserstein barycenter problem (FS-WBP), which involves calculating the barycenter of m probability measures on a finite metric space of size n. We find that the constraint matrix in the standard linear programming (LP) representation of the FS-WBP is not totally unimodular when m ≥ 3 and n ≥ 3. This resolves an open question regarding the relationship between the FS-WBP and the minimum-cost flow (MCF) problem, as it shows that the FS-WBP in its standard LP form is not an MCF problem when m ≥ 3 and n ≥ 3. We introduce a fast and deterministic variant of the iterative Bregman projection (IBP) algorithm called FASTIBP. FASTIBP has a complexity bound of O(mn^(7/3)ε^(-4/3)), where ε ∈ (0, 1) is the desired tolerance. This complexity bound is better than the best known bound of O(mn^(2)ε^(-2)) for the IBP algorithm in terms of ε, and the bound of O(mn^(5/2)ε^(-1)) for the accelerated alternating minimization algorithm or accelerated primal-dual adaptive gradient algorithm in terms of n. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using synthetic data and real images, which demonstrate the excellent performance of the FASTIBP algorithm in practical scenarios.
