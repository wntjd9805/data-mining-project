Emergentism and pragmatics are two distinct fields that examine linguistic communication from different perspectives. Emergentism focuses on the long-term development of language, while pragmatics focuses on short-term reasoning in communication. We propose computational models that combine these two approaches to enhance agent communication in referential games and in the game Starcraft II. Through empirical and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the significance of integrating mutual reasoning-based pragmatics with language emergentism. This integration leads to more natural, accurate, robust, concise, and nuanced utterances.
