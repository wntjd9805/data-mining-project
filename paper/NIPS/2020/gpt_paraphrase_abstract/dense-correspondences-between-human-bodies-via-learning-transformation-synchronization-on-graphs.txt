We propose a novel method for establishing dense correspondences between partial scans of human models and a complete template model. Our method involves computing local transformations between the scan and the template model to achieve this correspondence. We also introduce an optimization formulation that synchronizes these transformations among a graph of the input scan, ensuring smoothness of correspondences and recovering articulated deformations. Furthermore, we present a trainable network that can perform the iterative optimization procedure, breaking the limitations of the original formulation. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets. The pretrained model and code are publicly available at https://github.com/xiangruhuang/HumanCorresViaLearn2Sync.
