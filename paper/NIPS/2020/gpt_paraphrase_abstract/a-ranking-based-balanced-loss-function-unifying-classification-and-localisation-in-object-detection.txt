We propose a new loss function called average Localisation-Recall-Precision (aLRP) for object detection tasks. This loss function is unified, bounded, balanced, and ranking-based, making it suitable for both classification and localization tasks. Inspired by the Average Precision (AP) Loss for classification, aLRP extends the Localisation-Recall-Precision (LRP) performance metric. There are several advantages to using aLRP: (i) it is the first ranking-based loss function for both classification and localization tasks, (ii) it naturally enforces high-quality localization for high-precision classification, (iii) it ensures a balanced distribution of positives and negatives, and (iv) it has only one hyperparameter compared to the multiple hyperparameters in existing state-of-the-art detectors. When evaluated on the COCO dataset, aLRP Loss outperforms the previous ranking-based loss function (AP Loss) by up to 5 AP points, achieving a 48.9AP without test time augmentation. Additionally, aLRP Loss outperforms all one-stage detectors. The code for aLRP Loss is available at: https://github.com/kemaloksuz/aLRPLoss.
