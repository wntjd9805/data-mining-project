Bayesian persuasion involves a sender designing a signaling scheme to influence a receiver's behavior. However, the current model by Kamenica and Gentzkow has limitations, including the assumption that the sender knows the receiver's utility function. We propose an online learning framework where the sender faces an unknown receiver with different types. We seek no-regret algorithms that provide a signaling scheme close to the best possible. We first show that achieving no-α-regret for any α < 1 requires a significant running time per round. Then, we present algorithms for full and partial feedback models with regret bounds that are sublinear in the number of rounds and polynomial in the instance size.
