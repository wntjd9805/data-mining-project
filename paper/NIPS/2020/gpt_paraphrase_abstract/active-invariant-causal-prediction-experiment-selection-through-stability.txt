Causal learning faces challenges in fully identifying causal models using only observational data. Interventions from different experimental environments can enhance identifiability, but the effectiveness depends on the nature and target of the interventions. As experiments are often costly, it is important to select the right interventions to minimize the number required. This study introduces a new active learning framework called A-ICP, based on Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP). By characterizing the effect of interventions on stable sets in general structural causal models, the study proposes intervention selection policies for A-ICP that quickly reveal the direct causes of a response variable in the causal graph while maintaining error control. The performance of these policies is empirically analyzed in both population and finite-regime experiments.
