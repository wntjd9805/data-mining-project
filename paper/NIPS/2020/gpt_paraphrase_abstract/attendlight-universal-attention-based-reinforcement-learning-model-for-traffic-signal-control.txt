We introduce AttendLight, a comprehensive Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm for traffic signal control. Unlike previous methods, AttendLight overcomes the limitation of requiring training for each new intersection with a different structure or traffic flow. Instead, it trains a single, universal model that can handle intersections with varying numbers of roads, lanes, phases, and traffic flow. Our approach utilizes a deep RL model with two attention models. The first attention model handles different road-lane combinations, while the second attention model enables decision-making for intersections with any number of phases. As a result, our model can work with any intersection configuration as long as a similar configuration is included in the training set. We conducted experiments using synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, covering intersections with three or four approaching roads, one-directional or bi-directional roads with one to three lanes, different numbers of phases, and various traffic flows. We considered two training and deployment scenarios: single-environment training and deployment, and multi-environment training and deployment. In both scenarios, AttendLight outperformed classical and other RL-based approaches across all cases.
