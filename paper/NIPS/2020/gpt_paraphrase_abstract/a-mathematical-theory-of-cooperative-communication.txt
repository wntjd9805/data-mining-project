Cooperative communication is crucial in understanding human cognition, language, development, culture, and human-robot interaction. Existing models of cooperative communication are algorithmic and fail to explain why cooperation leads to successful belief transmission and how differences in beliefs can limit this process. By connecting with the theory of optimal transport, we establish a mathematical framework for cooperative communication. Our framework encompasses previous models, provides statistical interpretations of belief transfer plans, and offers proofs of both robustness and instability. Through computational simulations, we validate and expand upon our theoretical findings, demonstrating their alignment with human behavior. These results confirm that cooperative communication effectively facilitates belief transmission, which is essential in explaining human learning achievements and enhancing interactions between humans and machines.
