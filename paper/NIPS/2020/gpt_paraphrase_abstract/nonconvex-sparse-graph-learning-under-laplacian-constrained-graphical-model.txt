This paper examines the problem of learning a sparse graph from the Laplacian constrained Gaussian graphical model. The objective is to estimate the precision matrix under Laplacian structural constraints using penalized maximum likelihood estimation. Previous studies have used the 1-norm to promote sparsity, but empirical evidence shows that it is not effective in this case. Theoretical analysis reveals that a large regularization parameter results in a complete graph. To address this issue, a nonconvex penalized maximum likelihood estimation method is proposed, and the statistical error is determined. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. An open source R package is available for implementation.
