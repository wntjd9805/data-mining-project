We propose a new method for estimating discrete distributions with potentially infinite support using the total variation metric. Unlike previous approaches, we do not make any assumptions about the sampling distribution. This means that distribution-free risk bounds are not possible, and the best we can achieve is a data-dependent bound based on the empirical data. We have derived such bounds and have shown that they are the best possible in a well-defined sense. Our key finding is that the half-norm of the empirical distribution provides accurate upper and lower estimates of the empirical risk. Additionally, this quantity decreases at an optimal rate based on the true distribution. We have also discovered a minimax result that demonstrates the optimality of our approach. We provide further structural results, including a calculation of the exact Rademacher complexity and a novel connection between total variation risk and missing mass.
