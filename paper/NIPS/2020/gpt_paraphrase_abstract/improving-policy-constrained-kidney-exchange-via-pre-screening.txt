Barter exchanges involve participants exchanging goods without using money. These exchanges are often facilitated by a central clearinghouse with the aim of maximizing the quality or quantity of swaps. Kidney exchange is an example of a real-world barter market where patients in need of a transplant swap donors to find a better match. The complexity of modern kidney exchanges, which include 2- and 3-way swaps, makes the clearing problem difficult. Failed transplants can have a cascading effect in the exchange, leading to a high failure rate. Although optimization-based approaches exist to prevent these failures, legal and policy constraints prevent their implementation in most exchanges. Instead, we propose a two-stage decision problem where exchanges can query the preferences of donors and recipients before making a matching. Selecting these matches is a challenging combinatorial problem that is non-monotonic, non-submodular, and NP-hard. We introduce a greedy heuristic and a Monte Carlo tree search as solutions, which outperform previous methods based on experiments using synthetic and real kidney exchange data.
