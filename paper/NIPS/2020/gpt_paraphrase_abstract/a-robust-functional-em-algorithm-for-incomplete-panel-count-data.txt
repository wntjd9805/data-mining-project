To better understand and predict health behaviors, researchers rely on panel count data, which involves aggregated counts of recurring events observed at specific time intervals. This data is often collected through self-reports, such as surveys on mobile devices, but missing reports are a common issue that hinders statistical analysis. In this study, we propose a functionalEM algorithm that can estimate the mean function of the counting process, even under the assumption that missing reports occur completely at random (MCAR). This algorithm is versatile and can handle incomplete counts, as well as tolerate misspecification of the Poisson process assumption. Theoretical analysis of this algorithm shows that it provides reliable results in finite samples, even in a non-parametric setting. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm through numerical experiments and an analysis of smoking cessation data. Additionally, we discuss potential extensions of this algorithm to account for deviations from the MCAR assumption and the impact of covariates.
