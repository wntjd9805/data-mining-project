We aim to automate the process of designing effective Priority Dispatching Rules (PDRs) for solving real-world Job-shop scheduling problems (JSSPs). Currently, creating PDRs requires extensive specialized knowledge and often yields limited results. To address this, we propose a method to automatically learn PDRs using an end-to-end deep reinforcement learning agent. Our approach utilizes a disjunctive graph representation of JSSP and employs a Graph Neural Network to embed the encountered states during solving. The resulting policy network is capable of generalizing to large-scale instances. Our experiments demonstrate that the agent can learn high-quality PDRs from scratch using basic raw features and outperforms existing PDRs. Additionally, the learned policies perform well on larger instances that were not seen during training.
