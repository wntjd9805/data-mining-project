Recent studies have shed light on adversarial examples, but their applicability is limited due to the disparity between the simplicity of the models analyzed and real-world complexities. This research aims to bridge this gap by examining a model that involves learning a representation while providing a precise generalization bound and a robustness certificate. The focus is on a hypothesis class derived from a sparsity-promoting encoder and a linear classifier, revealing the relationship between the expressiveness and stability of the supervised representation map and a concept of margin in the feature space. The study establishes bounds on the robust risk of hypotheses parameterized by dictionaries that achieve a minimal encoder gap on training data. Additionally, a robustness certificate for end-to-end classification is provided. The effectiveness of the analysis is demonstrated through the computation of certified accuracy on actual data and a comparison with other methods for certified robustness.
