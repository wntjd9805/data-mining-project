Research has been conducted on designing interventions to efficiently learn the structure of causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This research focuses on causally sufficient settings where there are no hidden confounders, selection bias, or feedback, and the essential graph of the observational equivalence class is provided as input with noiseless interventions. Previous studies have mainly focused on lower bounds for the number of interventions needed to orient a DAG, considering worst-case or average-case scenarios. However, these lower bounds only show that the largest clique in the essential graph can hinder the learning process. In this study, we establish a universal lower bound for single-node interventions, demonstrating that the largest clique always presents a fundamental obstacle to structure learning. We achieve this by decomposing the DAG into independently orientable components using directed clique trees and prove that the minimum number of single-node interventions required to orient any DAG in an equivalence class is at least half the sum of the sizes of the largest cliques in each chain component of the essential graph. Additionally, we propose a two-phase intervention design algorithm that, under certain conditions on the chordal skeleton, matches the optimal number of interventions up to a multiplicative logarithmic factor in the number of maximal cliques. Through synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm can handle significantly larger graphs compared to existing approaches and achieves better worst-case performance.
