We have developed a method that can generate causal explanations for black-box classifiers by using a learned low-dimensional representation of the data. These explanations are considered causal because changing certain factors in the representation will result in a change in the classifier's output. To accomplish this, we have designed a learning framework that incorporates a generative model and measures of causal influence based on information theory. Our objective is to ensure that the generative model accurately represents the data distribution and that the latent factors have a significant impact on the classifier's output. This method is compatible with any classifier that provides class probabilities and gradients, and does not require labeled attributes or knowledge of causal structure. We have conducted controlled tests to provide intuitive understanding of our objective, and have also demonstrated the practical usefulness of our method in image recognition tasks.
