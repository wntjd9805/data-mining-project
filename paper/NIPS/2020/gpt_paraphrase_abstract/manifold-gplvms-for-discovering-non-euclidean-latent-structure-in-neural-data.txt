In neuroscience, it is challenging to uncover the neural representations of important variables like head direction or spatial location. These variables are often not directly accessible to researchers. This study proposes a new model that can identify these latent variables and determine how each neuron contributes to their representation. Unlike previous models, which assume Euclidean latent spaces, this model recognizes that latent states often belong to symmetric manifolds. The proposed model, called manifold Gaussian process latent variable model (mGPLVM), incorporates a shared latent variable on a specific manifold and non-parametric tuning curves that determine neuron contributions. By comparing models with different topologies, researchers can distinguish between candidate manifolds, and variational inference allows for uncertainty quantification. The model's validity is demonstrated on synthetic datasets, as well as recordings from the ellipsoid body of Drosophila melanogaster and the mouse anterodorsal thalamic nucleus, both known to encode head direction. The mGPLVM successfully recovers the ring topology expected from neural populations representing a single angular variable.
