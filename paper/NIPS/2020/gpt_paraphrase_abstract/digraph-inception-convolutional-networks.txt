Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have been successful in modeling graph-structured data. However, they face challenges when dealing with digraphs due to two reasons: 1) transforming digraphs into undirected graphs to ensure graph Laplacian symmetry is not ideal as it misleads message passing and disregards digraph characteristics, and 2) GCNs fail to capture multi-scale features due to fixed receptive fields in each layer. In this study, we extend spectral-based graph convolution to digraphs and propose Digraph Inception Convolutional Networks (DiGCN) that employ digraph convolution and kth-order proximity to learn larger receptive fields and multi-scale features in digraphs. Experimental results demonstrate that DiGCN outperforms GCNs in encoding structural information from digraphs and achieving better performance in other models. Additionally, DiGCN exhibits superiority over state-of-the-art methods in various benchmarks.
