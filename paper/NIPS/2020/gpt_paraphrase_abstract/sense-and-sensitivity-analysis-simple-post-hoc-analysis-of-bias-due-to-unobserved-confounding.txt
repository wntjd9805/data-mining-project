The abstract states that when there is an observed association without a known mechanism, a causal estimate is needed. However, causal estimates from observational data can be biased due to unobserved confounding. The purpose of this paper is to introduce Austen plots, a sensitivity analysis tool that helps assess potential bias caused by unobserved confounding. Austen plots quantify the strength of confounding by measuring how strongly it influences treatment assignment and outcome. These plots show the minimum values of treatment and outcome influence needed to induce a desired level of bias. Austen plots are a generalization of the sensitivity analysis approach by Imbens. They can be used with any modeling approach for the observed data. The tool is demonstrated by evaluating biases in various causal inference problems using different machine learning methods. The code, demo data, and a tutorial for Austen plots are available on github.com/anishazaveri/austenplots.
