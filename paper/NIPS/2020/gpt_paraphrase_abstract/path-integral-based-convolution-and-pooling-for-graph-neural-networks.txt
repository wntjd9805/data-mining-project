Graph neural networks (GNNs) enhance traditional neural networks for graph-structured data. Effective graph convolution and pooling, similar to CNNs, are crucial for success. Drawing inspiration from physics, we introduce a path integral based approach called path integral based graph neural networks (PAN) for graph classification and regression tasks. PAN utilizes a convolution operation that considers all paths connecting the message sender and receiver, with learnable weights based on path length, resembling a maximal entropy random walk. This extends the graph Laplacian to a novel transition matrix termed the maximal entropy transition (MET) matrix, derived from path integral formalism. Notably, the diagonal entries of the MET matrix are linked to subgraph centrality, enabling a natural and adaptive pooling mechanism. PAN is a flexible framework adaptable to various graph data with different sizes and structures. It can be seen as a generalization of most existing GNN architectures. Experimental results demonstrate PAN's superior performance on different graph classification/regression tasks, including a new benchmark dataset from statistical mechanics proposed to advance GNN applications in physical sciences.
