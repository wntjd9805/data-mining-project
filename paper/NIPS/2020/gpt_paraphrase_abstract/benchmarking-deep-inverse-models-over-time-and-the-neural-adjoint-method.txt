We examine the task of solving inverse problems by determining the hidden parameters of a natural system based on a set of measurements. New deep learning approaches have emerged, treating these models as efficient but random explorations of potential solutions. Instead of evaluating accuracy based on a single estimated solution, we propose evaluating it over time. We compare various state-of-the-art inverse modeling approaches on four benchmark tasks and introduce a simple solution using a deep neural network as an approximation for the forward model. By incorporating a novel loss term called the boundary loss, our approach, known as the neural adjoint (NA), achieves superior performance in all benchmark scenarios.
