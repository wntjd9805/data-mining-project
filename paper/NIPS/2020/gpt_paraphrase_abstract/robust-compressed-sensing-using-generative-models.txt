The aim of compressed sensing is to estimate a high-dimensional vector from a system of noisy linear equations. In this study, we introduce a generative model as a prior assumption, where the vector is represented by a deep generative model. Traditional recovery methods like empirical risk minimization are successful when the measurement matrix is sub-Gaussian. However, they fail when the measurement matrix and measurements have heavy-tailed distributions or outliers. To address this issue, we propose a Median-of-Means inspired algorithm that ensures recovery even in the presence of heavy-tailed data and outliers. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our algorithm has the same sample complexity guarantees as empirical risk minimization under sub-Gaussian assumptions. Our experimental results support our claims, showing the fragility of other algorithms under heavy-tailed and corrupted data, while our approach remains robust.
