Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) is a crucial tool in various scientific applications such as integral approximation, Bayesian inference, and simulation sampling. The rank-1 lattice is a significant component in the QMC field due to its simplicity and favorable properties for constructing point sets. However, the process of generating the rank-1 lattice's generating vector is typically time-consuming due to exhaustive computer searches. To tackle this problem, we propose a straightforward rank-1 lattice construction method based on group theory, which offers a closed-form solution. Our method reduces the number of distinct pairwise distance values, resulting in a more regular lattice. Theoretical analysis establishes both a lower and upper bound for the minimum pairwise distance of any non-degenerate rank-1 lattice. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that our approach can generate a nearly optimal rank-1 lattice when compared to the exhaustive search algorithm by Korobov, considering both the l1-norm and l2-norm minimum distance. Furthermore, experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of approximation performance for benchmark integration test problems and kernel approximation problems.
