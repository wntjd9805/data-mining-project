Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are widely used in modern 2D interfaces because they can be easily scaled to different resolutions. However, while deep learning models have been successful in handling rasterized images, the problem of learning and generating vector graphics representations has not been extensively explored. In this study, we introduce a new hierarchical generative network called DeepSVG for generating and interpolating complex SVG icons. Our architecture effectively separates the high-level shapes from the low-level commands that encode the shape itself. The network directly predicts a set of shapes without relying on autoregressive methods. To support our research, we have created a large-scale dataset and released an open-source library for manipulating SVGs. Our experiments show that the network can accurately reconstruct various vector graphics and can be used as an animation tool by performing interpolations and other operations in the latent space. The code for DeepSVG is available at https://github.com/alexandre01/deepsvg. See Figure 1 for an illustration of DeepSVG generating vector graphics and enabling animations between complex SVG icons.
