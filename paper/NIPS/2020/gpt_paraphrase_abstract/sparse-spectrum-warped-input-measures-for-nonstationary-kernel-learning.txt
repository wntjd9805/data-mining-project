We present a novel approach for learning nonstationary kernels using explicit, input-dependent, measure-valued warpings. While stationary kernels are commonly used, they struggle to adapt to functions that vary in smoothness with respect to the input. Our proposed algorithm warps inputs as conditional Gaussian measures, allowing us to capture non-stationary patterns in the data and provide intuitive inductive bias. This method is based on sparse spectrum Gaussian processes, which allows for closed-form solutions, and can be extended to capture more complex patterns. We extensively validate our method on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its remarkable efficiency in learning problems with both small and large data sizes.
