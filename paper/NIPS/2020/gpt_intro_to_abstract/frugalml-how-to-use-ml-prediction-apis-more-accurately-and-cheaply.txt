Machine learning as a service (MLaaS) is a rapidly growing industry, with the market size estimated at $1 billion in 2019 and expected to reach $8.4 billion by 2025. While MLaaS services offer benefits such as reduced development time, they also present challenges, such as varying prices and performance among different providers. This paper proposes FrugalML, a framework that learns the strengths and weaknesses of each API and optimizes the selection and combination of APIs within a budget constraint. Experimental results show that FrugalML can significantly reduce costs while maintaining or improving accuracy compared to individual APIs. The code and dataset used in the evaluation are also made available for future research in this area.
