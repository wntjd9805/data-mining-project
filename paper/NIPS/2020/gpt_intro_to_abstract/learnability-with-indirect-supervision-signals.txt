This paper addresses the problem of multiclass classification with indirect supervision signals. The use of direct and gold annotations for unlabeled instances is often expensive or inaccessible, leading to the reliance on dependent variables as supervision signals. The paper introduces the concept of transition class, a set containing candidate transitions, to describe general forms of prior information about the relation between the true labels and supervision signals. The notion of separation is defined to quantify the sufficiency of information for distinguishing different labels. The paper provides a theoretical framework that considers complexity, consistency, and identifiability aspects of learnability conditions for indirect supervision problems. The concepts of separation, total variation, and joint supervision are proposed and applied to derive new results in practical learning scenarios.
