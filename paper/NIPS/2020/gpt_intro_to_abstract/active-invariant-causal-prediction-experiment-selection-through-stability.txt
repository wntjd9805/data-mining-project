Causal models offer a powerful way to capture and predict the behavior of systems, allowing for interventions and distribution changes. However, the challenge lies in learning these models directly from data, as causal learning suffers from the limited information obtained from finite-sized samples and the inability to establish certain causal relationships. Identifying the true causal graph is also difficult, with identifiability only possible through interventions. Therefore, it is crucial to select the right interventions to minimize costs. In this paper, we review existing work in causal learning and present our contributions to addressing this problem.
