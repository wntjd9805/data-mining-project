Learning has become an integral part of modern information systems that are used for various purposes such as selecting job candidates, analyzing medical data, and controlling smart applications. However, there is a growing concern regarding the behavior of these systems, as they can exhibit biases, unsafe behaviors, and deadly accidents. Traditional approaches to learning, such as regularization, may not guarantee feasible solutions or meet the desired requirements. In this paper, we propose a constrained learning approach that explicitly incorporates requirements as constraints in the optimization problem. We demonstrate that constrained learning is as challenging as unconstrained learning from a theoretical perspective. Furthermore, we introduce an empirical saddle-point problem as a PAC constrained learner, which considers the richness of the parametrization and the difficulty of satisfying learning constraints. Finally, we present a practical constrained learning algorithm that addresses fairness and robustness issues.
