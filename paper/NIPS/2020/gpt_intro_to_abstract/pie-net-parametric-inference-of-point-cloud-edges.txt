Edge estimation in image and shape processing is a well-known problem in computer vision. While there are mathematical definitions for edges, existing edge estimators often lack robustness and struggle with soft edges, noise, and sparse data. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to feature edge estimation from point clouds using a deep neural network called PIE-NET. PIE-NET is trained to infer parameteric curves representing edge features, treating edge inference as a proposal and ranking problem. We employ a two-phase approach, where invalid proposals are suppressed based on learned confidence scores and curve fit. Our method outperforms traditional edge detection techniques and other learnable variants in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.
