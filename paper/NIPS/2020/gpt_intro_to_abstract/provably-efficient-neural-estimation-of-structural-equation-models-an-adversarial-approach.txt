This paper introduces the concept of generalized structural equation models (SEMs) and proposes a new min-max game formulation for estimating the structural parameters based on conditional moment restrictions. The authors parameterize both players in the game using neural networks (NNs) and derive a stochastic gradient descent algorithm for learning the parameters. They analyze convergence rates and provide consistency results for the algorithm. The authors also demonstrate the wide application of their model in econometric and causal inference literature through concrete examples, including instrumental variable regression, simultaneous equations models, and dynamic panel data models.
