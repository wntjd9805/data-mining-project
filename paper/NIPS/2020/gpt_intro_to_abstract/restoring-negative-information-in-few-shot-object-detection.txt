In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized computer vision, but most methods require large labeled datasets. Humans, on the other hand, can recognize objects with only a few examples. Few-shot learning aims to enable machines to do the same, but current research has mainly focused on image classification and recognition tasks. Few-shot learning for more complex tasks, such as object detection, is still limited. This study proposes a method to restore negative information in few-shot object detection by learning embeddings that capture both positive and negative representatives of objects. The authors introduce a new metric learning framework called NP-RepMet, which incorporates negative information in different modules to improve feature steering in the embedding space. They also propose an inference scheme that uses both negative and positive representatives, along with a clustering-based strategy for selecting hard and diverse negative examples. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of detection accuracy.
