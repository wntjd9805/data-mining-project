Recommendation systems (RSs) are integral in our modern lives, playing a crucial role in platforms like YouTube, Medium, and Spotify. These RSs go beyond simply suggesting content and form vibrant ecosystems with multiple stakeholders. It is essential for these systems to consider the well-being of content consumers, content providers, and the platform itself. Research on RSs has evolved from focusing solely on consumers' taste to exploring aspects like fairness, ethics, and long-term welfare. However, there is a limited understanding of content providers and their utility, despite their crucial role in producing a constant supply of content. The dynamics between content providers and consumers are delicate, and any dissatisfaction among content providers can have downstream effects on the available content and consumer satisfaction. In this paper, we propose a stylized model to investigate the strategic behavior of content providers in RSs and analyze the impact on both provider utility and consumer welfare. We demonstrate that a more centralized approach, in which the RS coordinates providers, can lead to faster convergence towards stable points. While our model is stylized, it offers valuable insights into real-world RSs, providing a better understanding of content provider incentives and the need for increased awareness in RSs.
