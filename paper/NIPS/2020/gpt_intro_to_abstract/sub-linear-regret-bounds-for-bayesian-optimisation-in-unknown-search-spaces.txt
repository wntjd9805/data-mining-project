Bayesian optimisation is widely used for global optimisation of expensive black-box functions, but existing approaches are limited by fixed search spaces and the need for prior knowledge. This can lead to suboptimal solutions, particularly in new problems. Previous work has addressed this issue but with weak global convergence analysis and without considering the convergence rate. Additionally, high-dimensional problems and unknown search spaces pose further challenges for Bayesian optimisation. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for unknown search spaces, achieving sub-linear convergence rates. We also provide a solution for high-dimensional search spaces by using a restricted search space of hypercubes. Both algorithms are extensively evaluated on various optimisation tasks, demonstrating better efficiency compared to existing methods. Source code is publicly available.
