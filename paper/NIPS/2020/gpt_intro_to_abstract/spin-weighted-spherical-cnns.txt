Learning representations from data is crucial for enabling various applications in computer science. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be effective in representation learning, particularly due to their translation equivariance property that allows them to exploit the natural structure of audio, image, or video inputs. Recent work has extended equivariance to other groups of transformations and designed equivariant CNNs on non-Euclidean domains. In this paper, we focus on rotation equivariant CNNs for learning feature representations on spherical data. We explore two prevailing designs and propose leveraging spin-weighted spherical functions (SWSFs) as a means to achieve the expressivity and representation capacity of SO(3) convolutions with the efficiency and scalability of spherical convolutions. We define convolutions and cross-correlations of SWSFs, build a CNN based on these operations, and demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on various tasks, including spherical image and vector field classification, 3D shape classification, and spherical image segmentation. Our code and datasets will be publicly available for further research.
