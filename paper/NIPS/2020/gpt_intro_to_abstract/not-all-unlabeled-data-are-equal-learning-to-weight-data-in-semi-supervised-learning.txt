Unlabeled data is valuable in reducing the cost of supervised learning, especially in fields where obtaining annotations is expensive. Various semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have been developed to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data, but they often assign an identical weight to all unlabeled data points. In this paper, we propose a method that assigns individual weights to each unlabeled example, considering that not all unlabeled data are equal. We automatically adjust these per-example weights using the influence function, which estimates the importance of each unlabeled example based on the validation set performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on linearly separable data and discuss the computational challenges of adjusting per-example weights. We present an efficient algorithm for computing per-example gradients and a computationally efficient approximation for the influence functions of deep nets. Our method shows compelling results on various SSL tasks, including CIFAR-10, SVHN, and IMDb.
