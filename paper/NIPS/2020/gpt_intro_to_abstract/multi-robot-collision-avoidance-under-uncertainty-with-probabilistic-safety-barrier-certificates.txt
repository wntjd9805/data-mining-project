Safe control is a crucial aspect of large-scale multi-robot systems, particularly in the context of building an automatic collision avoidance system (ACAS) for aerial robots. This system must be computationally efficient, capable of real-time execution, and robust to factors like uncertainty and non-determinism. In this paper, we address the problem of reactive collision avoidance for crowded multi-robot teams operating in a realistic environment, considering both measurement and motion uncertainty. We propose a novel approach called probabilistic safety barrier certificates (PrSBC) that enforces chance-constrained collision avoidance with deterministic constraints over an existing controller. Our method provides permissive and tight bounds for controllers, inherits forward invariance from control barrier functions, and can be applied in a centralized or decentralized setting. We demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach through experiments on aerial robot collision avoidance.
