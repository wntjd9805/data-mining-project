Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are flexible probabilistic models often used for automated decision making in real-life scenarios. However, applying VAEs to datasets with variables of different types can lead to unsatisfying results and challenging optimization problems. In this paper, we propose Variational Auto-encoder for heterogeneous mixed type data (VAEM) to overcome these limitations. VAEM uses a two-stage approach, where one-dimensional VAEs are trained to capture marginal distribution properties and provide a more homogeneous latent representation across dimensions, followed by another VAE to capture dependencies among these latent representations. Our contributions include the introduction of VAEM and demonstrating its superior data generation quality compared to other VAE baselines, as well as its ability to handle missing data, perform conditional data generation, and enable sequential active information acquisition.
