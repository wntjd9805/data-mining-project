Modern high-throughput molecular profiling technologies have generated large amounts of high-dimensional data for various bio-molecules, such as genes, transcripts, proteins, and metabolites. However, understanding the relationships between these different data types and their connection to phenotypic characteristics remains challenging. Integrating and analyzing multi-omics data requires effective and affordable learning methods. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) has been commonly used for this purpose, but it lacks a probabilistic interpretation and cannot handle non-linearity. In this paper, we propose a novel Bayesian relation learning framework, BayReL, which incorporates graph dependency structures, handles non-linear transformations, and infers interactions across different features. We introduce the methodology of BayReL, including embedding nodes into a latent space, constructing a relational multi-partite graph, and inferring view-specific latent variables. We also describe the likelihood function and the learning process using variational inference.
