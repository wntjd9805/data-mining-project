Data clustering is a fundamental aspect of unsupervised machine learning, involving the grouping of data into clusters based on similarity. Traditional clustering algorithms have limitations in scaling to large datasets, leading to the exploration of parallel, distributed, and streaming methods. However, the traditional data stream model fails to consider the arrival time of data points, which can be crucial in practical scenarios. This paper focuses on addressing this limitation by studying clustering in the sliding window model, where a small sketch of the input data is maintained and utilized to approximate the solution on the most recent elements of the stream. The goal is to develop space and time-efficient algorithms that achieve a constant factor approximation, while using less space and improving processing efficiency for each new element.
