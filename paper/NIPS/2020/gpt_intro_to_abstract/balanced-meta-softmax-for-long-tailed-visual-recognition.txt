Most real-world data exhibits a long-tailed nature, with a few high-frequency classes dominating the observations and a large number of low-frequency classes being under-represented. This poses challenges for vision tasks such as visual recognition and instance segmentation. Existing methods for addressing long-tailed data distribution often suffer from issues such as under-representing head classes or gradient problems during optimization. In this paper, we propose Balanced Meta-Softmax (BALMS), which includes a Balanced Softmax function that explicitly models the label distribution shift and a Meta Sampler for effective re-sampling. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that BALMS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly on datasets with extremely high imbalance factors. Our contributions include a theoretical analysis of the limitations of the Softmax function, the introduction of the Balanced Softmax function, and the presentation of the Meta Sampler strategy.
