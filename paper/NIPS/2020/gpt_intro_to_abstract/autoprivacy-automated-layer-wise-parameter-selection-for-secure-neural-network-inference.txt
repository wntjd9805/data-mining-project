Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) is a new paradigm that utilizes cloud infrastructures to offer machine learning inference services to clients. However, the use of cloud servers in MLaaS poses privacy risks, as they can access clients' sensitive data. Previous research has introduced Hybrid Privacy-Preserving Neural Networks (HPPNNs) that combine Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Garbled Circuit (GC) to achieve low latency and high accuracy. Nevertheless, HPPNNs still suffer from long inference latency. This paper proposes AutoPrivacy, an automated layer-wise HE parameter selection technique, to improve the speed and accuracy of HPPNN inferences.
