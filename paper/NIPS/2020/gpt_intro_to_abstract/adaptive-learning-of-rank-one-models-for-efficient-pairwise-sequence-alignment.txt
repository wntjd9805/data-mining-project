Pairwise sequence alignment is a computationally intensive task in bioinformatics, especially in the context of long-read sequencing technologies that produce noisy reads. To address this, a two-step approach is commonly used, where alignment estimation is first performed to identify pairs with a large alignment, followed by applying alignment algorithms only to the selected pairs. The MHAP algorithm, which estimates overlap size between pairs of DNA sequencing reads, has been proposed as an efficient approach. In this paper, the authors propose a rank-one model framework and an adaptive spectral estimation algorithm based on multi-armed bandits to efficiently identify the top-k entries of the leading left singular vector of the observation matrix. The proposed algorithm is validated through simulations and experiments on real DNA sequence data, showing significant reductions in the required budget.
