Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are widely used in various tasks such as image generation, semi-supervised learning, and image editing. However, GANs often produce samples with artifacts or low recognition. In this paper, we propose a method called Discriminator Driven Latent Sampling (DDLS), which leverages the information from both the generator and the discriminator to generate high-quality samples from GANs. We show that sampling from the latent space of GANs is more efficient than sampling from the pixel space. Our method is applicable to different GAN formulations and produces better quality samples compared to the generator alone.
