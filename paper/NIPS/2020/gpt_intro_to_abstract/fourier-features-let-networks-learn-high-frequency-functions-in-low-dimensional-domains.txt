This paper introduces the concept of using coordinate-based multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) as a continuous function representation for objects, scene geometry, and appearance in computer vision and graphics. The authors leverage recent progress in modeling deep networks using kernel regression with a neural tangent kernel (NTK) to analyze the limitations of standard MLPs in representing high-frequency functions. They propose a Fourier feature mapping that transforms the NTK into a shift-invariant kernel, allowing coordinate-based MLPs to learn higher frequencies and improve performance in various low-dimensional tasks. The paper contributes theoretical insights and experimental evidence to support the effectiveness of the Fourier feature mapping in overcoming spectral bias and enhancing the capabilities of coordinate-based MLPs.
