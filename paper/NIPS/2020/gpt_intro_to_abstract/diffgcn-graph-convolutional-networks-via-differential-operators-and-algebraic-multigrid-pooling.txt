The emergence of deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has significantly impacted the fields of computer vision and graphics. Previous works have used standard CNNs for 3D tasks on unordered data, such as point clouds, and there has also been a growing interest in Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for processing three-dimensional inputs. In this work, we aim to bridge the gap between ordered and unordered deep learning architectures by proposing a new approach that defines convolution operators on graphs based on discretization of differential operators on unstructured grids. We also introduce unstructured pooling and unpooling operators using multigrid methods to enhance the performance of GCNs. We present experimental results on point cloud classification and segmentation tasks to validate our model.
