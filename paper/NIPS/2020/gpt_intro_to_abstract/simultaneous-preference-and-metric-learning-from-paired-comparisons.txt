Personalized recommendation and ranking algorithms have become increasingly important in recent years, influencing a wide range of decision-making processes. While there are various approaches to developing personalized recommendation systems, a common approach involves the use of the ideal point model, which represents a user's preferences as a combination of features. Learning the latent preferences of a user presents a challenge, and paired comparison queries have been found to be more user-friendly. In this paper, we propose a novel method to simultaneously learn the ideal point and a Mahalanobis metric, which allows for more flexible and powerful models of preference. We develop a convex optimization program that estimates the metric and the ideal point, effectively learning the user's rankings. We also explore an alternating scheme that refines the estimates iteratively. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
