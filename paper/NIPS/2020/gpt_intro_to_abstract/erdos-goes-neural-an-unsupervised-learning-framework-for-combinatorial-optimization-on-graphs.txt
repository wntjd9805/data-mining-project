Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems are difficult and common in scientific and engineering fields. Neural networks have been proposed as a potential solution to these problems, particularly with the emergence of deep learning. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown success in addressing CO problems involving graphs. However, CO problems still present challenges to neural networks, and current successful models often rely on supervision or reinforcement learning approaches, which have their own limitations. In this paper, we present an alternative approach using unsupervised learning, where we aim to model the problem with a differentiable loss function. Our framework is inspired by ErdÀùos' probabilistic method and involves training a GNN to produce a distribution over subsets of nodes in an input graph. We then use a randomized algorithm technique to decode a valid solution from the learned distribution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in two NP-hard graph-theoretic problems, achieving competitive results compared to neural baselines, discrete algorithms, and mathematical programming solvers.
