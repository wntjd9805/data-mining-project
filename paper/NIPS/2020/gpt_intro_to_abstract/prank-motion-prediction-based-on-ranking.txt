This paper proposes an approach called PRANK (motion Prediction based on RANKing) to solve the problem of predicting the motion of agents surrounding a self-driving vehicle. The proposed method ranks a fixed dictionary of pre-prepared trajectories based on their scores and factors the model in a way that allows for efficient preprocessing of the trajectory bank offline. The distribution of future trajectories is represented as a probability distribution, satisfying requirements such as low latency computation, efficient access to expected and most likely future positions, and quantification of future uncertainty and multimodality. This method differs from generative approaches and leverages the success of metric learning methods coupled with approximate nearest neighbor search. The proposed approach is suitable for use in a production self-driving pipeline and shows promising results.
