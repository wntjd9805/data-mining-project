This paper addresses the limitations of the mean-field approximation used in variational inference for Bayesian neural networks (BNNs). The assumption that the posterior distribution factorizes over weights has been deemed as a severe limitation. As a result, researchers have extensively explored methods that explicitly model correlations between weights in BNNs. This paper aims to provide insights and advancements in the field of VI methods for BNNs.
