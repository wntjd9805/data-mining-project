Deep neural networks have driven significant progress in various research domains. This paper introduces a novel convolutional unit called fast Fourier convolution (FFC), designed to address two key requirements: the need for large receptive fields in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for context-sensitive tasks, and the integration of cross-scale fusion for enhanced feature abstraction. FFC utilizes the spectral transform theory, specifically Fourier transform, to efficiently implement non-local receptive fields and fuse multi-scale information. Unlike existing non-local operators, FFC can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream CNNs without any additional computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance in image recognition, video action recognition, and human keypoint detection tasks, surpassing previous models. FFC has the potential to revolutionize neural network design by expanding the scope beyond uniform, local receptive fields.
