Capsule networks (CapsNets) have been developed based on assumptions about viewpoint equivariance, high-dimensional coincidences as feature detectors, and the representation of object parts as a single object. However, CapsNets suffer from inefficiency and issues with underfitting or overfitting. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic capsule network that replaces local iterative routing with variational inference for part-object connections. This approach improves speed and allows the model to leverage the uncertainty in assembling objects to enhance performance on pose-aware tasks.
