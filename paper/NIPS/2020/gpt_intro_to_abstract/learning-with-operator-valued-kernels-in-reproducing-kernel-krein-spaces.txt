This paper introduces the problem of learning a function-valued function between an input space and an output space of functions. The authors explore the use of functional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) as a machine learning method for solving functional regression. They discuss the challenges in constructing non-negative or positive definite operator-valued kernels and propose the development of a function-valued reproducing kernel Krein space (RKKS) for generalized operator-valued kernels. The authors outline their major contributions, including the introduction of generalized operator-valued kernels and function-valued RKKS, the formulation of a regularized empirical loss stabilization learning problem, the derivation of a representer theorem for function-valued RKKS, and the development of the Operator MINimum RESidual method (OpMINRES) algorithm. They also provide results on the generalization properties of the proposed learning setup and demonstrate its competitiveness through empirical evaluations on real data.
