This paper investigates the impact of using predictions for online control in a linear dynamical system. The controller incurs a quadratic cost at each time step, and previous research has focused on optimal controllers under different performance criteria. However, the incorporation of predictions in online convergence has been largely unexplored. This study addresses this gap by considering situations where accurate predictions are available. Practical algorithms, such as Model Predictive Control, leverage predictions, but there is limited research on online guarantees for control with predictions in the presence of disturbances. The paper aims to answer fundamental questions about cost-optimal and regret-minimizing policies with a given number of predictions and their corresponding performance. The main contributions include the derivation of optimal policies and upper bounds for cost and regret in both stochastic and adversarial scenarios. The study also compares the performance of Model Predictive Control with cost-optimal and regret-minimizing policies, highlighting the efficiency and simplicity of predictions in reducing algorithmic complexity. The research provides valuable insights into continuous control and algorithmic principles in the presence of predictions.
