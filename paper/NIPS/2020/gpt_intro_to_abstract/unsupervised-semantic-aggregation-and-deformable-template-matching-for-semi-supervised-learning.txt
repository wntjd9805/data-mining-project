Deep learning has seen significant progress in recent years, fueled by abundant labeled data in various domains. Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning have emerged as important branches, with the latter showing promising results in image classification tasks. However, unsupervised learning remains challenging, often requiring clustering operations and producing inaccurate results. In this paper, we propose a new SSL framework that combines unsupervised learning with supervised information to address these limitations. Our framework leverages self-supervised learning to maximize mutual information and aligns semantic labels with real categories using a few annotated samples. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic pattern pool and deformable template matching for pseudo label generation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, outperforming existing methods in standard classification benchmarks.
