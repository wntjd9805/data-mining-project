The job-shop scheduling problem (JSSP) is a challenging optimization problem in computer science and operations research. Due to its complexity, finding exact solutions for JSSP is often impractical, and heuristic methods like priority dispatching rules (PDRs) are commonly used. However, designing effective PDRs can be time-consuming and costly. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based method to automatically learn strong and robust PDRs for JSSP. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and use a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to encode the scheduling information. Our experiments show that the PDRs trained by our method outperform existing manually designed ones and generalize well to larger instances.
