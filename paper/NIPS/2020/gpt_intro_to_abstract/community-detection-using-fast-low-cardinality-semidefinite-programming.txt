Community detection, the identification of densely connected clusters in networks, is a significant topic in network science. Modularity maximization, a popular approach to community detection, aims to optimize the modularity of cluster assignments. However, this optimization problem is NP-hard, leading to the development of heuristic methods like the Louvain and Leiden algorithms. In this paper, we propose the Locale algorithm, which improves upon existing methods by optimizing a semidefinite relaxation of modularity. We provide a scalable solver for this relaxation by exploiting the low-cardinality property of the solution space. Our experiments demonstrate that Locale is less prone to local optima and outperforms Louvain and Leiden methods. Furthermore, our low-cardinality formulation introduces a new approach to scaling up semidefinite programming for sparse solutions. Source code for our implementation is available.
