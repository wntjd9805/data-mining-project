This paper explores the problem of numerical extrapolation in arithmetic tasks and introduces a new class of Neural Arithmetic Units (NAUs) called Neural Power Units (NPUs) to address this issue. The authors demonstrate that including NPUs in standard neural networks can significantly improve their extrapolation capabilities and reduce the number of parameters needed for a given task. Additionally, they highlight the transparency and explainability of NPUs compared to conventional neural networks. The paper presents experiments and results showcasing the effectiveness of NPUs in various arithmetic operations and equation discovery for dynamical systems.
