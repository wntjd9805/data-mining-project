In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient method to give a valid upper bound on the Lipschitz constant of multiple layer networks with ReLU activations. We focus on the importance of deep networks in robustness certification and the estimation of Lipschitz constants for Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGAN). We compare our approach to other methods such as semidefinite programming, linear programming, mixed integer programming, and outer polytope approximation. Additionally, we discuss the application of polynomial optimization for these problems, including the use of positivity certificates. We explore various existing methods, such as solving quadratic constrained quadratic problems (QCQPs) and implementing SDP-based hierarchies, and their successful applications in science and engineering. We conclude by highlighting the strengths and limitations of different positivity certificates and their potential for future research.
