Undirected graphical models, such as Markov Random Fields (MRFs), are widely used in computer vision and computational biology due to their ability to represent variable associations. This paper focuses on three fundamental problems in MRFs: maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference, estimating the probability distribution, and learning the model parameters. However, finding the true mode of the distribution and computing the partition function, which ensures distribution sums up to 1, are challenging tasks. Existing approximation methods have limitations, especially in the low-temperature setting. This paper proposes a novel spectral algorithm and a semidefinite program (SDP) relaxation approach with a linear number of constraints for accurate and efficient inference in MRFs. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, the proposed methods can scale to large real-world MRFs used in image segmentation tasks.
