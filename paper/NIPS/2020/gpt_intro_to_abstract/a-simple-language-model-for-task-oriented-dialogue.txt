Conversational AI has become an increasingly popular topic in computer science, with a focus on open-domain dialogue systems and task-oriented dialogue systems. Traditional task-oriented dialogue systems consist of separate modules for natural language understanding, dialogue management, and natural language generation, leading to potential error propagation. In this paper, we propose a simple, causal language modeling approach called SimpleTOD, which unifies all sub-tasks of task-oriented dialogue by optimizing for them in an end-to-end manner. We demonstrate that SimpleTOD achieves state-of-the-art performance in dialogue state tracking, action decisions, and response generation. This work provides insights into the connection between language understanding and task-oriented dialogue systems, and offers a robust dialogue state tracker.
