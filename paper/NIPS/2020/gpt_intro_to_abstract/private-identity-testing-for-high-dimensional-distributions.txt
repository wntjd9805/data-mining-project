The paper discusses the importance of hypothesis testing in statistical inference and its application in various fields. It highlights the need for privacy-preserving hypothesis testing when dealing with sensitive data. The paper introduces the concept of differential privacy and its relevance in ensuring privacy while analyzing data. It then presents the main focus of the paper, which is to propose differentially private algorithms for hypothesis testing of high-dimensional distributions with improved sample complexity. The paper outlines three fundamental problems in which private hypothesis testing algorithms are provided. Finally, the paper discusses the challenges in solving high-dimensional testing problems privately and presents two methods for reducing the sensitivity of test statistics without altering their average-case behavior. The methods include a novel private filtering method and the combination of Lipschitz extensions with recursive preconditioning.
