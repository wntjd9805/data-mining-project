This paper focuses on nonparametric density estimation in the presence of outliers. Outliers in observed data can be difficult to detect or account for due to their unpredictable behavior. The paper investigates minimax optimal convergence rates for estimating the target distribution under the Huber-contamination model. It considers a wide range of smoothness conditions and provides results under a family of losses called integral probability metrics (IPMs). Additionally, the paper discusses the application of these results to the robustness properties of generative adversarial networks (GANs). The authors also study the effect of additional assumptions on the outlier distribution and propose a data-dependent density estimator. The paper concludes with an outline of the organization and notation used.
