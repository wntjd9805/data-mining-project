Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great success in solving complex problems, such as games and robotics. However, it has yet to make a breakthrough in combinatorial optimization. This paper introduces a new approach to RL for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem, a challenging combinatorial problem in operations research. The approach incorporates the complexity of the problem into both the learning model and the decision formulation. The paper presents a policy iteration algorithm using a small neural network to estimate the value function and a mixed-integer program to formulate the action selection problem. The proposed approach achieves promising results compared to existing RL algorithms for vehicle routing problems.
