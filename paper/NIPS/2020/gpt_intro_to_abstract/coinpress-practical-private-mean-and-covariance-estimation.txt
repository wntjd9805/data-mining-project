The paper introduces the problem of estimating the mean and covariance of a distribution based on i.i.d. samples, while protecting individual privacy. The authors discuss differential privacy as a widely accepted solution for ensuring privacy in statistics and machine learning tasks. However, differential privacy becomes challenging to achieve for small datasets or when considering subpopulations within larger datasets. The paper presents new estimators for mean and covariance of multivariate sub-Gaussian data, which are validated theoretically and empirically. The authors highlight the need for a priori knowledge of mean and covariance and demonstrate the practicality of their estimators even with weak prior knowledge. The estimators are shown to have error comparable to non-private estimators at sample sizes of 1,000. The paper also discusses the iterative approach used in the estimators and provides a problem formulation for accuracy and privacy guarantees.
