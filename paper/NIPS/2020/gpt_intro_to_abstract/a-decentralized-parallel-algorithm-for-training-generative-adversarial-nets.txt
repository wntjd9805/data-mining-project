In this paper, we propose a decentralized parallel algorithm called Decentralized Parallel Optimistic Stochastic Gradient (DPOSG) for solving a class of non-convex non-concave min-max problems, specifically focusing on the challenges posed by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). We design a simultaneous update scheme combined with multiple rounds of decentralized communication, which allows us to achieve non-asymptotic convergence to an ‚úè-first-order stationary point. Additionally, our algorithm is communication-efficient, with a logarithmic communication complexity on the busiest node. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, showing speedup compared to a single machine baseline on various benchmark datasets.
