Topological data analysis (TDA) is a rapidly evolving field in computer science and statistics that utilizes algebraic topology to analyze geometric structures in data. TDA has shown success in various applications, such as graph analysis, computational biology, finance, and computer graphics. The standard setup for TDA involves a data set with points and a distance function, along with a continuous function that filters the data and encodes its topology changes. The persistence diagram, which characterizes the changing topology of sublevel sets, is a fundamental summary of TDA. However, the space of persistence diagrams poses challenges for statistical analysis. To address this issue, multiparameter persistence, which involves filtering data with multiple parameters, has been introduced. Although working with multiparameter persistence is more difficult, we propose the Multiparameter Persistence Image as a refined numerical invariant that integrates information across slices. We demonstrate its stability in the presence of slice perturbations, provide efficient computation methods, and compare its performance to existing summaries through classification experiments.
