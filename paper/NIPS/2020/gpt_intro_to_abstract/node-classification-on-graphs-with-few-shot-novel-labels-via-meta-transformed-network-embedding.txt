This paper addresses the task of node classification in graphs, specifically focusing on the classification of few-shot novel labels. The authors propose a Meta Transformed Network Embedding framework called MetaTNE, which leverages meta-learning to capture shared patterns in the graph structure and known labels. They design a transformation function to map node representations and apply meta-learning to facilitate few-shot classification. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MetaTNE compared to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed framework has practical applications in various domains, such as social network analysis and protein function prediction.
