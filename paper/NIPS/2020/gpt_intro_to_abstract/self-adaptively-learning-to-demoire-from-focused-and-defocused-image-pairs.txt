Image demoiréing is the task of removing moiré patterns from images, which can be caused by interference between the color filter array (CFA) of a camera and high-frequency repetitive signals. Existing deep learning models for demoiréing rely on large amounts of annotated data and are limited in their ability to handle complex moiré patterns, particularly in natural images. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptive learning method that utilizes a moiré-free blur image as an additional input to improve demoiréing performance. We also create a new dataset with focused moiré and defocused moiré-free images, including both screen moiré and high-frequency texture moiré images. Experimental results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods and can be easily applied to any digital camera or smartphone without explicit training.
