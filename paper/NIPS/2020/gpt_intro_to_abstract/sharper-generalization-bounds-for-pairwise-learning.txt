In modern machine learning, many problems involve the performance of a model depending on pairs of training instances, such as ranking problems and metric learning. These pairwise learning problems, in contrast to pointwise learning problems like classification and regression, have not been extensively studied in the context of generalization analysis. This paper aims to address this gap by employing the methodology of algorithmic stability to analyze the generalization of pairwise learning. The authors show improved generalization bounds for this setting and establish a connection between generalization and stability. Additionally, they provide probabilistic generalization bounds for stochastic gradient descent in pairwise learning. The paper also considers applications of the general theory to ranking and metric learning, demonstrating significantly improved dependence on the number of training examples compared to existing stability analyses. The paper concludes with a review of related work, background information, main results, applications, and a conclusion.
