Cooperative communication plays a vital role in transmitting information and accumulating knowledge across various fields such as language, cognitive development, cultural anthropology, and robotics. While theories and models have been proposed to explain these abilities, there is a lack of mathematical theories that allow for the analysis of basic properties of cooperative communication between agents. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by providing mathematical and computational analysis of cooperative communication. We interpret cooperative communication as a problem of optimal transport, derive relationships to rate distortion theory, and analyze properties such as statistical interpretations, robustness to violations of common ground, and instability under greedy data selection. By recasting communication as belief transport, we can gain a better understanding of the nature and limitations of cooperative communication.
