This paper introduces the concept of the Finite Continuum-Armed Bandit (F-CAB) problem, which involves an agent selecting from a set of arms based on covariate information and receiving rewards associated with those arms. The agent has a limited budget and can only select each arm once. The aim is to maximize the sum of the rewards received. The F-CAB problem is related to the classical continuum-armed bandit problem, with the main difference being the ability to choose any action corresponding to any covariate in the F-CAB model. The paper explores this problem and its applications in various real-life situations.
