The history of human societies involves the evolution of cooperation among self-interested individuals, requiring interventions such as laws and regulations. In economics, externalities and the absence of regulations can lead to market failures. Game theory is commonly used to analyze systems with self-interested agents and determine desired outcomes. This paper proposes a unified framework for learning and interventions in games, using optimization methods and variational inequality (VI) representations. The contributions include an optimization model solvable by gradient descent, a Newton's method for forward propagation over VI layers, and two methods for backward propagation. Real-world examples are provided to illustrate the framework's potential applications.
