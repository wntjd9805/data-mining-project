Collaborative filtering (CF) is a key technique used in personalized recommender systems, focusing on learning user preferences from observed user-item interactions. With the prevalence of implicit user feedback, such as purchases on e-commerce sites and watches on online video platforms, the collection of data has become easier compared to explicit feedback. Negative sampling is commonly used in implicit CF to optimize the CF model by selecting a few instances from the unobserved interactions and treating them as negative labels. However, there are concerns about the efficiency and effectiveness of negative sampling. This paper proposes a simplified and robust negative sampling approach called SRNS, which captures the dynamic distribution of negative instances with a memory-based model and measures the quality of negative samples using a high-variance-based criterion. The proposed approach demonstrates robustness and superiority over existing baselines in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.
