The objective of this work is to detect hands in images and recognize their physical contact state. This problem is challenging due to the need to consider relationships between the hand and other objects in the scene, as well as the lack of depth information. In this paper, we propose a Contact-Estimation neural network module that can be integrated into an object detection framework to recognize the contact states of hands. We implement our method based on Mask-RCNN and introduce cross-feature affinity-based attention and spatial attention modules to improve accuracy. Additionally, we contribute a large-scale dataset for development and evaluation.
