Graphs are widely used to model complex systems such as the internet, social networks, and transportation networks. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in node embedding techniques that map the nodes of a graph to low-dimensional Euclidean space, allowing for the analysis and understanding of the graph's structure. This paper explores the limitations of existing node embedding methods and presents new results that demonstrate the ability of low-dimensional embeddings to represent triangle-rich graphs. The authors also propose a low-rank factorization algorithm that produces exact low-dimensional embeddings for bounded degree graphs. Experimental results on real-world networks support the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in preserving local structure.
