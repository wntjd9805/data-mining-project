This paper introduces a new method for constructing invertible transformations in deep generative models. The method involves taking the exponential of any linear transformation, which is always invertible and allows for straightforward computation of the inverse and Jacobian determinant. By extending prior work, the exponential can be computed implicitly, enabling the use of linear operations such as convolutional layers. The authors propose a new transformation, called the convolution exponential, and a new residual transformation called Convolutional Sylvester Flow. The code for the method is provided in the provided link.
