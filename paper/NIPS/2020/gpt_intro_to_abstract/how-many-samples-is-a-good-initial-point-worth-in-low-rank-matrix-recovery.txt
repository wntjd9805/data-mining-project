Non-convex optimization poses challenges due to the presence of bad or spurious critical points and local minima. Previous works have shown that increasing the amount of diverse and high-quality training data can mitigate these effects. This paper aims to provide a unified understanding of global and local guarantees by quantifying the relationship between the sample complexity and the initial point's quality. Focusing on the matrix sensing problem, the authors derive a lower-bound on the number of required samples to prevent spurious local minima. The lower-bound reveals that points closer to the ground truth require fewer samples for recovery, thus highlighting the importance of optimizing the initial point.
