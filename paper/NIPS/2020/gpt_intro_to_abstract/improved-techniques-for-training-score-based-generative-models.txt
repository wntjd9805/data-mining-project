Score-based generative models have shown success in producing realistic image samples but are limited to low resolution images. This is due to the challenges in determining appropriate noise scales for learning the score function and the inefficiency of the Langevin dynamics sampling method. To address these issues, we propose techniques to scale score-based generative models to high resolution images. These include analytically computing effective noise scales, using a single neural network to estimate scores for multiple noise scales, optimizing the sampling procedure based on noise scales, and incorporating exponential moving average of model parameters. Our approach significantly improves sample quality and enables the generation of sharp and diverse images at resolutions ranging from 64 × 64 to 256 × 256, which was previously not possible.
