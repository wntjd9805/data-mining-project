Gathering collections of images on a topic of interest has become easier with the help of tools that can aggregate data from various sources. However, identifying visual trends within these image collections remains challenging and often requires manual organization or ad hoc algorithms. In this paper, our goal is to design a clustering method that can be applied to image collections, providing a visual representation for each cluster and showing its relation to the associated images. We discuss two approaches for obtaining clusters invariant to transformations such as viewpoint or lighting. The first approach involves extracting invariant features and performing clustering in feature space, while the second approach uses explicit transformation models to align images before comparing them. We focus on the second approach and propose a deep transformation-invariant (DTI) framework that can perform transformation-invariant clustering at scale using complex transformations. Our framework jointly learns deep alignment and clustering parameters, enabling us to use transformations like color, thin plate spline, and morphological without specific regularization. Our DTI clustering approach is computationally efficient and easy to interpret, and we demonstrate its effectiveness on standard image clustering benchmarks. Additionally, we show that our approach can discover meaningful modes in real photograph collections, bridging the gap between theoretical clustering approaches and practical tools for exploring image collections. We provide an evaluation of our approach, including comparisons to state-of-the-art methods and visual results. The code, data, models, and additional visual results are available on our project webpage.
