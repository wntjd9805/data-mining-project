Learning individual-level causal effects is a crucial task in various domains, including healthcare and education. While randomized controlled trials are the gold standard for estimating causal effects, they are often impractical or unethical. Observational data, although more readily available and cost-effective, poses challenges due to unmeasured confounding and differences between treated and control populations. To address these issues, deep learning approaches to causal inference have shown promise. However, current methods lack the ability to recognize and account for unfamiliar data points, leading to uninformed recommendations. In this paper, we propose a new approach that combines covariate shift and lack of overlap into a unified framework and introduce negative sampling to model uncertainty on out-of-distribution inputs. We extend this methodology to state-of-the-art neural models and demonstrate its superiority over existing methods on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we introduce a new semi-synthetic benchmark dataset to explore non-overlap in high-dimensional settings.
