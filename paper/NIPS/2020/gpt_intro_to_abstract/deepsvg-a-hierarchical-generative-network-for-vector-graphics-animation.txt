Despite the growing popularity of rasterized image generation and content creation, little attention has been given to the generation of vector graphics. However, vector images, such as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), have become a standard in digital graphics and web-animations due to their scalability advantages. This paper introduces a generative model for vector graphics, called DeepSVG, which enables artists to generate and manipulate vector graphics efficiently. The model utilizes a hierarchical transformer-based architecture that disentangles high-level shapes from low-level commands. The paper presents comprehensive experiments demonstrating successful interpolation and manipulation of complex icons in vector-graphics format, along with the introduction of a large-scale dataset of SVG icons to facilitate further research in this area. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first work exploring generative models for complex vector graphics and showcasing successful interpolation and manipulation results.
