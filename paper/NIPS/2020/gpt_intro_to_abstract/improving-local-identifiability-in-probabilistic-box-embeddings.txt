Geometric embedding models have been gaining attention in computer science for their ability to represent hierarchies, transitive relations, and partial order structures. These models associate domain elements, such as queries, images, sentences, concepts, or graph nodes, with objects that have a geometry suitable for expressing relationships in the domain. Different geometric representations, such as Gaussian densities, convex cones, and axis-aligned hyperrectangles, have been explored. However, training these models can be challenging due to a lack of local identifiability in the parameter space. In this paper, we propose a random process model called Gumbel-box processes, which addresses the issue of sparse gradients and provides improved performance compared to previous approaches in various synthetic and real-world tasks.
