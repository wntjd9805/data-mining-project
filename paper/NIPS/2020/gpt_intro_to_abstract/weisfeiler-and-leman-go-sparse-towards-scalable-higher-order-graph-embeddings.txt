Graph-structured data is prevalent in various domains, including chemoinformatics, bioinformatics, image analysis, and social network analysis. To develop effective machine learning models for graph data, it is necessary to leverage the rich information present in the graph structure, as well as the features of nodes and edges. In recent years, approaches based on graph kernels and graph neural networks (GNNs) have advanced the state-of-the-art in supervised node and graph learning. However, these approaches have limitations in capturing important patterns, handling general structures, and considering the sparsity of the graph. This paper proposes a local version of the k-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm (k-WL) and a corresponding higher-order graph neural network architecture, which address these limitations and offer improved performance in distinguishing non-isomorphic graphs and preventing overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of these algorithms in graph classification and molecular regression tasks.
