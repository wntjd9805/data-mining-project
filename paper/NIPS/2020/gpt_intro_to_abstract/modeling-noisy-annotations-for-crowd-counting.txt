Crowd counting is a crucial research area that focuses on monitoring crowd behaviors for public safety. Existing crowd counting algorithms typically employ deep networks to predict density maps from crowd images, treating the problem as a regression task with the L2 norm or Bayesian loss as the loss function. However, these approaches have limitations in handling annotation noise and ignoring pixel correlations. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel loss function that explicitly models annotation noise as random variables and approximates the joint probability density using a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Additionally, a low-rank method is introduced to approximate the covariance matrix, reducing computational complexity. The proposed loss function consists of a pixel weighted L2-norm term and a correlation term, making it robust to annotation noise and allowing high-density regions to seek consistent locations. The contributions of this paper include explicitly modeling annotation noise, deriving a multivariate Gaussian approximation, and introducing a low-rank covariance approximation to enhance computational efficiency.
