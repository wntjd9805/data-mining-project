The self-attention mechanism has shown its effectiveness in various fields and tasks, but it faces challenges with memory complexity and the lack of optimal attention structures. This paper introduces Sparse Adaptive Connection (SAC), which replaces the fully-connected structure in self-attention with a sparse graph-like structure that is task-adaptive. SAC utilizes an Edge Predictor to dynamically predict edges between nodes and uses reinforcement learning models to optimize task-specific performances. The proposed model is evaluated on four tasks and achieves strong performances without incurring heavy memory costs.
