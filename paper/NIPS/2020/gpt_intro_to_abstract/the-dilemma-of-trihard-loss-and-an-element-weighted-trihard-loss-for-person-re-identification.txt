This paper introduces the concept of person re-identification (ReID) as a branch of computer vision. It explores various approaches to extract global and local features of samples using classification networks. Additionally, it discusses the use of metrics and loss functions for metric learning in ReID. The paper specifically focuses on the TriHard loss and identifies a dilemma that hampers clustering within classes. To address this, the authors propose three methods: Half TriHard loss, TriHard loss with feature normalization, and Half TriHard loss with average negative samples. Furthermore, they propose an element-weighted TriHard loss to eliminate the dilemma. The proposed losses are evaluated on Market 1501 and MSMT17 datasets, showing significant improvements compared to TriHard loss.
