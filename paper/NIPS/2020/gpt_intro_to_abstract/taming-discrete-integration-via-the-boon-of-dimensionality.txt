This paper addresses the problem of discrete integration, also known as weighted counting, where the goal is to compute the weight of a set of items. The set is often represented implicitly, such as through satisfying a set of constraints, allowing for the representation of exponentially large sets with polynomial constraints. Discrete integration has applications in various fields, including partition function computations, probabilistic inference, network reliability estimation, and the verification of neural networks. Previous work has shown that properties of neural networks can be reduced to discrete integration, motivating the exploration of approximation techniques. This paper introduces a technique that can handle rational weights and eliminates the need for weight adjustments, offering theoretical guarantees for estimation. An implementation of the technique, called DeWeight, is evaluated on neural network verification benchmarks and provides accurate estimates with theoretical guarantees. This work expands the capabilities of neural network verification efforts and addresses the limitations of existing discrete integration tools.
