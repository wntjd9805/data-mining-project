The challenges of robustness and privacy in machine learning have led to the development of online and differentially private learning algorithms. Existing worst-case analysis has shown limitations in achieving robustness and privacy in classification tasks. In this paper, we propose a new model that incorporates smoothed adversaries to better guide the design of online and differentially private learning algorithms. We introduce frameworks for online and differentially private learning where inputs are perturbed by nature, and we aim to design algorithms with good expected regret and error bounds. Our positive results demonstrate the potential for achieving robust and private learning in realistic settings. We extend our models to accommodate smoothed adversaries and show that our bounds gracefully scale with the dimension of the space. Our work contributes novel techniques for analyzing time-correlated non-independent stochastic processes and provides improved error bounds for differentially private learning.
