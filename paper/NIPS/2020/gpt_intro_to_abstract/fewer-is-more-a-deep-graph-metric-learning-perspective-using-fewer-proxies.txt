Deep metric learning (DML) has been extensively studied in recent years for its applications in various fields, including zero-shot classification, image retrieval, person re-identification, and face recognition. The core idea of DML is to learn an embedding space where similar samples are close to each other and dissimilar samples are far apart. However, existing metric losses suffer from sampling issues and result in redundancy, leading to inefficiencies in training. In this paper, we propose ProxyGML, a novel Proxy-based deep Graph Metric Learning approach, which uses fewer proxies to achieve better performance. ProxyGML represents each class with multiple trainable proxies to capture intra-class variations and constructs a directed similarity graph to model global relationships. By decomposing the graph into k-nearest neighbor subgraphs and applying label propagation, ProxyGML captures both global and local similarity relationships among raw data samples. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of ProxyGML over state-of-the-art methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.
