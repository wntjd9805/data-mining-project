Modeling dependencies between random variables is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistics. The use of copulas, a class of cumulative density functions that describe the dependencies between variables without restrictions on their marginals, has been extensively studied in the field. Archimedean Copulas, which are commonly used due to their simplicity and ability to model extreme distributions, require the selection of the parametric form of the generator function and face limitations in expressiveness. In this paper, we propose ACNet, a novel network architecture that leverages deep neural networks to model the generator of an Archimedean copula. ACNet allows for the learning of network parameters using backpropagation and gradient descent, enabling the approximation of all copulas with completely monotone generators. We demonstrate the theoretical properties and practical effectiveness of ACNet, showcasing its ability to learn standard copulas, improve qualitative descriptions of observed data, and handle uncertain measurements.
