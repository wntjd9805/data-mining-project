Understanding the structure of 3D objects by decomposing them into simpler shapes, known as primitives, is important in computer vision. Previous approaches have used constructive solid geometry and learning-based methods to represent primitives. However, existing methods have limitations in terms of expressing complex shapes, learning semantic part arrangements, and efficiently representing collective shapes. In this paper, we propose a novel primitive representation called neural star domain (NSD), which learns shapes in a star domain using neural networks. NSD allows for the representation of concavity and can be transformed between implicit and explicit forms. We demonstrate the expressive power and efficiency of NSD compared to previous approaches and show its effectiveness in improving mesh reconstruction accuracy and speed.
