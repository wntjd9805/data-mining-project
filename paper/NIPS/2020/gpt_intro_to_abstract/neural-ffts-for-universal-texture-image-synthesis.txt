Texture synthesis is a challenging task in computer science that involves expanding a small texture example to a larger size while preserving its structural content. Previous methods for texture synthesis relied on pre-trained CNNs, which were slow and lacked the ability to generalize to unseen textures. In this paper, we propose a new approach that formulates texture synthesis as local FFT upsampling in the feature space. By using CNNs in conjunction with FFT upsampling, we are able to achieve high generalization performance and fast synthesis speed. Our framework is evaluated on various datasets and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The contributions of this paper include the formulation of texture synthesis as FFT upsampling, the design of a novel framework for dealing with the challenges of FFT images, and extensive evaluations that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
