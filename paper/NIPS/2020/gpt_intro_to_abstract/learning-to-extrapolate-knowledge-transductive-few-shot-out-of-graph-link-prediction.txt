Graphs are widely used to represent structured data, and recent advancements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have enabled the utilization of graph-structured data in various domains. Specifically, relation-aware GNNs have been developed to handle multi-relational graphs with labeled and directed edges, extending the application of GNNs to real-world domains such as natural language understanding, protein structure modeling, drug-drug interaction prediction, and retrosynthesis planning. Knowledge Graphs (KGs), which represent knowledge bases, have received significant attention in this context. However, KGs are known to be highly incomplete, and automatically completing them through link prediction is a practical and important problem. Previous works have addressed this problem by learning embeddings of entities and relations and have achieved significant success. Nevertheless, link prediction for KGs in real-world scenarios remains challenging due to the dynamic nature of KGs and their long-tail distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel meta-learning framework called Graph Extrapolation Networks (GENs) to tackle the few-shot out-of-graph link prediction problem for emerging entities in KGs. Our experiments on various datasets demonstrate that GENs outperform existing baselines, even when the baselines are retrained with the unseen entities.
