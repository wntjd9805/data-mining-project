This paper introduces ExNODE, an exchangeable module for discriminative and generative set modeling. Current approaches that process sets as sequences with random permutations are inadequate in capturing the intradependencies between set elements. To overcome this limitation, ExNODE utilizes a permutation equivariant architecture and a differential equation parameterization to ensure invertibility. The paper also extends ExNODE to temporal set modeling, proposing a VAE-based framework for capturing the evolution of sets over time. The contributions of this work include the proposal of ExNODE, achievement of state-of-the-art performance in point cloud classification and likelihood estimation, and the development of a novel model for temporal sets.
