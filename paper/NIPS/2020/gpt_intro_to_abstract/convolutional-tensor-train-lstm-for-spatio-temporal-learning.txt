This paper introduces a higher-order Convolutional LSTM model for complex spatio-temporal data, addressing the limitations of current deep learning systems in tasks such as prediction from complex spatio-temporal data. The proposed model incorporates a long history of states while preserving their spatial structure, achieved through a novel convolutional tensor-train decomposition. This factorization reduces parameters and introduces an information bottleneck for better representation learning. Empirical results demonstrate the model's superior performance in early activity recognition and video prediction tasks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Overall, this work contributes a computationally tractable solution for capturing long-range temporal correlations in video understanding problems.
