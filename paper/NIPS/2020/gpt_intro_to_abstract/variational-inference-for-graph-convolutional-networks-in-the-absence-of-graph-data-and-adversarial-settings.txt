Graphs are widely used to represent elements and their relationships in various applications of machine learning. Researchers have extended the properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to handle graph-structured data. This paper focuses on graph convolutional networks (GCNs), which are a first-order approximation of spectral graph convolutional networks. GCNs have gained popularity due to their practical performance and simple propagation rule. However, one of the main assumptions of GCNs is that the given graph is reliable and helpful for the classification task, which is not always true in practical applications. This paper proposes a framework that extends GCN's capabilities to handle cases where there is no input graph or where the graph is noisy or unreliable. The framework formulates a joint probabilistic model and uses stochastic variational inference to estimate the graph structure. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in various scenarios, including the absence of graph data and the presence of adversarial perturbations.
