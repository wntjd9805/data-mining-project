This paper introduces AutoSync, an end-to-end pipeline designed to automate the selection of the optimal synchronization strategy for deep learning models trained on distributed systems. By identifying factors that affect synchronization and constructing a large strategy space, AutoSync leverages domain knowledge and a domain adaptive simulator to efficiently search for the best strategy without running actual distributed executions. The paper evaluates AutoSync on various models and clusters, demonstrating its ability to outperform hand-optimized systems by reducing training time by 1.2x-1.6x. Additionally, the paper provides a dataset of (model, resource, strategy) tuples and their corresponding runtimes for further research.
