In this paper, we introduce the Wasserstein Discriminant Analysis (WDA), a supervised linear dimensionality reduction technique that incorporates both local and global information. We discuss the challenges associated with the optimization objective and the dependence of the inter-class and intra-class covariance matrices on an implicit transport matrix. To address these challenges, we propose a reformulation of WDA as a ratio trace problem with a closed-form solution. We also present an algorithm, WDA-eig, based on the self-consistent field (SCF) iteration for solving the ratio trace problem. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of classification accuracy. Additionally, we extend WDA-eig to unsupervised clustering and show promising performance compared to existing subspace clustering techniques. The contributions of this paper include the ratio trace formulation of the WDA problem, the SCF-based algorithm for solving the problem, and the application of WDA to clustering.
