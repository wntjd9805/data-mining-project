This paper introduces a neural network called TVspecNET that can reproduce the spectral TV decomposition of images while significantly reducing the computation time. The authors propose approximating the non-linear spectral decomposition using deep learning, achieving a substantial speedup compared to traditional model-driven approaches. The network is shown to learn intrinsic properties of the decomposition and generalize well to images not present in the training set. A comprehensive study demonstrates the optimality of the architecture, and the authors claim to be the first to propose a deep learning approach for approximating the non-linear spectral decomposition of images.
