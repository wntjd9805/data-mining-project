Submodular function maximization is a widely studied problem in computer science with numerous applications. In this paper, we focus on the problem of submodular maximization subject to a matroid constraint (SMM) and propose two approximation algorithms, TwinGreedy and TwinGreedyFast, with improved deterministic ratios and efficient running times. We introduce a novel "simultaneous greedy-search" framework that allows us to construct two candidate solution sets simultaneously, resulting in a more efficient algorithm. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on social network monitoring and multi-product viral marketing applications and demonstrate its superiority over existing algorithms in terms of both speed and solution quality.
