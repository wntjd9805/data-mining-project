This paper addresses the challenge of estimating policy performance on an entire system without using standard randomized controlled trials. Instead, the practice of switchback experimental design is used, but it suffers from temporal interference and is not sample efficient. The paper presents an optimal experimental design within a benchmark theoretical model for settings with temporal interference and provides a characterization of consistent and asymptotically efficient policies using maximum likelihood estimation. The main result is the characterization of efficient policies that minimize variance, achieved through a convex optimization problem. Finally, the paper constructs an efficient and consistent adaptive online experimental design using the maximum likelihood estimation approach.
