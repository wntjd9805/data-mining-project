Graphs are widely used to represent complex relationships in various domains, and analyzing graph data is an important topic in machine learning. Semi-supervised node classification, which predicts labels of unlabeled nodes using graph structure and available labels, has received significant attention. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown impressive performance in this task. However, existing GNN models lack flexibility to handle imperfect data and noise in graph structure. In this paper, we propose a novel Graph Stochastic Neural Network (GSNN) that models the uncertainty of GNN classification functions. GSNN learns a family of classification functions instead of a deterministic function, allowing it to handle sparse labeled data and unreliable graph structure. We introduce a learnable neural network to model the distribution of the stochastic function and use amortized variational inference to approximate the posterior distribution. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of GSNN compared to state-of-the-art baselines.
