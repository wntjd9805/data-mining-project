Ensemble learning is a widely used technique in machine learning for improving algorithm performance. However, limited research has been conducted on how to perform valid inference on ensemble predictions. In this paper, we propose a method for constructing a predictive confidence interval for ensemble predictions, integrating ensemble learning with the jackknife+ approach. This method ensures that the interval-valued prediction covers the new response value with a high probability, without making any assumptions beyond independent and identically distributed samples. Our contributions include the development of the jackknife+-after-bootstrap method, theoretical proof of coverage guarantees, and verification of empirical coverage.
