This paper introduces a novel deep learning architecture called UCLID-Net for single-view reconstruction. Unlike existing approaches, UCLID-Net preserves the Euclidean structure of the 3D space objects and learns global shape regularities as well as local reasoning. The architecture uses camera projection matrices to link camera- and object-centric coordinate frames, enabling reasoning about geometry and learning object priors in a common 3D coordinate system. UCLID-Net comprises a 2D image encoder and a 3D shape decoder, featuring symmetrical downsampling and upsampling parts with multi-scale skip connections. The bottleneck of the network is made of 3D feature grids, and back-projection layers are used to lift 2D feature maps to preserve feature localization. Experimental results demonstrate that UCLID-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both synthetic and real-world image reconstructions. The architecture also extends naturally to multi-view reconstruction.
