The increasing number of IoT devices based on always-on microcontrollers has created an opportunity for tiny machine learning (TinyML). However, microcontrollers have limited resources, particularly in terms of memory and storage, making deep learning deployment difficult. Existing efficient network designs and neural architecture search methods focus on devices with abundant memory and storage, such as GPUs and smartphones. In this paper, we propose MCUNet, a system-model co-design framework, to enable ImageNet-scale deep learning on microcontrollers. We optimize the deep learning model design and the inference library to reduce memory usage and handle the tight resource constraints. Experimental results show that MCUNet achieves record-breaking performance on microcontrollers, suggesting the arrival of tiny machine learning on IoT devices.
