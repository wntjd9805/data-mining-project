Sampling from distributions on Riemannian manifolds is a fundamental task with various applications in machine learning. The use of Langevin algorithms, such as the Riemannian Langevin algorithm (RLA), has gained significant interest due to its simplistic structure and good empirical behavior. Recently, there has been a growing interest in sampling from distributions on manifolds, leading to applications in matrix factorization, principal component analysis, and solving stochastic differential equations. In this paper, we propose a Geodesic Langevin Algorithm (GLA) as a generalization of the RLA to sample from distributions on manifolds. GLA leverages the geometric information of the manifold while keeping the algorithm's structure simple. We provide a non-asymptotic convergence guarantee for GLA and discuss the application of the algorithm in sampling from distributions on manifolds with log-Sobolev inequality.
