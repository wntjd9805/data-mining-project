Optimal transport (OT) theory has gained attention in the data science community due to its applications in comparing probability distributions and positive measures. To make OT scalable and avoid the curse of dimensionality, regularization is necessary. Two approaches have emerged: regularization of the measures themselves or regularization of the original OT problem. The first approach involves summarizing complex measures using univariate or multivariate Gaussian measures. The second approach focuses on regularizing the OT problem to simplify computations and improve sample complexity. This paper explores the intersection of these two approaches by introducing closed-form formulas for regularized optimal transport of Gaussian measures, both in balanced and unbalanced cases. The closed-form expressions provided can facilitate the evaluation of new methodologies and serve as a robust replacement for the Bures-Wasserstein metric.
