Constituency parsing is a fundamental task in natural language processing, aiming to recover the syntactic structures of sentences. Existing parsers, based on deep neural networks, use a shift-reduce transition system to build parse trees. However, this approach differs from how humans perform parsing, which is known to be strongly incremental. In this paper, we propose a novel attach-juxtapose transition system that aligns with incremental human processing. This system represents the partial sentence as a single connected tree, allowing for easier learning and access to model architectures for graph data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experimental evaluation on standard benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our contributions include the introduction of the attach-juxtapose system, theoretical results on its capabilities, and the development of a parser based on this system.
