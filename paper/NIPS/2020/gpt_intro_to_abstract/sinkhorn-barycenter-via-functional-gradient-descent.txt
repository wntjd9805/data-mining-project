The barycenter problem, which involves computing a nonlinear interpolation between a set of probability measures, is a fundamental task in various disciplines. This problem has important applications in distribution clustering, Bayesian inference, texture mixing, and graphics. Previous methods for solving the barycenter problem have focused on optimizing directly in the space of probability measures, but they suffer from limitations such as bias and computational inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a new approach that views the barycenter as the push-forward measure of an initial measure under an unknown mapping. By recasting the problem as an unconstrained functional optimization over the space of mappings, we develop a novel gradient descent method called Sinkhorn Descent (SD) that efficiently solves the Sinkhorn barycenter problem. We also prove convergence guarantees and demonstrate the effectiveness of SD compared to prior methods.
