Compressive sensing is a problem in which an unknown vector needs to be reconstructed based on partial linear measurements. This paper focuses on the application of compressed sensing to deep generative models and explores the limitations and fragility of existing algorithms in the presence of heavy-tailed noise or corruptions. The authors propose a new algorithm that is robust to these challenges and demonstrate its theoretical recovery guarantees and empirical performance. The algorithm, based on a Median-of-Means (MOM) loss, achieves successful recovery even with a constant fraction of outliers and a weak moment assumption. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared to traditional approaches like ERM.
