This paper introduces Dual-Resolution Correspondence Networks (DualRC-Net), a novel neural network architecture for establishing dense correspondences in a coarse-to-fine manner for high-resolution images. By generating dual-resolution feature maps and using a full 4D correlation tensor to select local regions in the high-resolution feature maps, the proposed method reduces memory footprint and computation cost while improving matching results and localization accuracy. Experimental evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed method. The code for DualRC-Net is available at a provided URL.
