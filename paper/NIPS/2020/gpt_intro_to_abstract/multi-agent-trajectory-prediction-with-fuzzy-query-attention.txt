In this paper, we address the challenge of predicting trajectories of agents in multi-agent settings using fuzzy (continuous-valued) decision making capabilities. We propose a novel Fuzzy Query Attention (FQA) mechanism that models pairwise attention to determine when two agents are interacting and makes continuous-valued decisions. The FQA also learns how the inï¬‚uencing agent affects the agent under focus based on these decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FQA in various domains, showing significant performance gains over existing predictive models. Our experiments highlight the predictive power of fuzzy decisions and the potential of incorporating human knowledge for improved prediction performance.
