Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to small input perturbations that can lead to misclassification, posing a challenge for their deployment in safety critical applications. In this paper, we propose a general framework for improving the certified safety region of DNN models by utilizing the estimated local properties of the classifier. We demonstrate the asymptotic optimality of smoothed classifiers obtained using Gaussian as the smoothing measure and provide formulas for calculating certified radii under different threat models. Furthermore, we design efficient estimators to estimate relevant first-order information about the classifier. Empirical results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art certified accuracy for multiple threat models, including improvements in the (cid:96)1 norm and subspace (cid:96)2 norm.
