Machine learning techniques have revolutionized many commercial applications and are increasingly being adopted in scientific and engineering problems. However, in certain applications, the challenge lies in determining the appropriate input samples for collecting responses before building a model. This task, known as the task-agnostic sample design problem, is particularly relevant in fields where curated datasets are not readily available and data acquisition involves time-consuming simulations or expensive experiments. Existing approaches rely on heuristics and lack a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between sampling properties and the generalization error of machine learning models. This paper proposes a framework for studying the generalization error of sample designs using tools from statistical mechanics. The framework considers various sample distributions, including space-filling designs, and establishes a theoretical basis for constructing optimal sampling methods. The findings are supported by regression experiments on synthetic functions and a scientific simulator for inertial confinement fusion.
