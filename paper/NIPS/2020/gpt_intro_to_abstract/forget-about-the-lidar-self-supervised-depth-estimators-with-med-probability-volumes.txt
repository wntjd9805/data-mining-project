In this paper, we address the problem of Single Image Depth Estimation (SIDE) using self-supervised methods. While previous self-supervised methods have shown promising results, they often fail to accurately estimate depth due to occluded regions in the training data. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Mirrored Exponential Disparity (MED) probability volume method that achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. We also introduce a multi-view occlusion mask generation module and a two-stage training strategy to improve the accuracy of depth estimation. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with faster inference and significantly fewer model parameters. By focusing on loss functions and training strategies rather than complex architectures, we emphasize the importance of exploiting geometrical dependencies in the data for effective self-supervision.
