Estimating the effects of continuous interventions is crucial for decision-making in various domains, such as medicine, education, public policy, and advertising. Existing methods in causal inference mainly focus on discrete interventions, but many real-world scenarios involve continuous parameter values associated with interventions. This paper introduces SCIGAN, a modified GAN framework, to learn the distribution of unobserved counterfactual outcomes for continuous interventions. The authors provide theoretical justification for using GANs in this context and propose novel network architectures. Semi-synthetic experiments demonstrate that SCIGAN outperforms existing benchmarks.
