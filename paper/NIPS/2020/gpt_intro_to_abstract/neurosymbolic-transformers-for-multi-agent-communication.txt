Multi-agent planning in distributed robotics systems presents challenges in coordinating communication among agents. Existing approaches either allow agents to communicate with all other agents, which can lead to poor generalization and ignore physical constraints, or manually impose communication structures based on distance. In this paper, we propose using programmatic policies to represent communication structures, allowing for efficient optimization of communication graph degrees. We introduce a neurosymbolic transformer algorithm that combines a transformer policy with a programmatic communication policy, achieving high task performance while significantly reducing communication. Experimental results on multi-agent planning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
