This paper introduces the problem of estimating the number of unseen symbols that appear at least Âµ times in a sample from an unknown distribution. The authors study the estimation of this quantity using a sufficient statistic and propose a new estimator. They compare their estimator to existing ones and provide theoretical bounds on its performance. The results show that their estimator is optimal within certain parameter ranges and has a lower worst-case normalized mean-square error compared to other estimators. The proposed estimator has applications in various domains such as biology, linguistics, and business.
