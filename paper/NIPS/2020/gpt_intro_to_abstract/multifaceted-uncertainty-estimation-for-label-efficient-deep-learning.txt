Deep learning models have shown remarkable performance in various domains, but they heavily rely on large amounts of labeled data, which is often expensive and difficult to obtain in knowledge-rich fields like medicine and biology. Active learning has emerged as a successful approach to training models with limited labeled data by selecting the most informative samples. However, applying active learning to deep learning models poses challenges due to the high dimensionality and complex nature of the data. Existing active learning models suffer from model overfitting and may provide misleading information for data sampling. Moreover, complex data often contains missing or out-of-distribution samples, requiring effective exploration and discovery. This paper proposes an active deep learning (ADL) model that addresses these challenges through a decomposition of uncertainty into belief vacuity and belief dissonance, accurate uncertainty prediction, and integration of different uncertainties for data sampling. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ADL model.
