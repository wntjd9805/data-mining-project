Dealing with paradoxes and impossibility theorems in social choice theory is a significant challenge. This paper introduces a framework that leverages smoothed complexity analysis from computer science to analyze the likelihood of these impossibilities in modern applications of social choice. The framework models agents' preferences as noisy perceptions of the ground truth, and analyzes the worst average-case scenario. The paper presents dichotomy theorems on the smoothed likelihood of Condorcet's paradox and the ANR impossibility, showing that these impossibilities either vanish at an exponential rate or do not vanish at all. The paper also introduces a novel tie-breaking mechanism called most popular singleton ranking (MPSR) and proves its optimality under natural assumptions. The proof techniques involve modeling events as linear constraints and developing a technical tool for analyzing the smoothed likelihood.
