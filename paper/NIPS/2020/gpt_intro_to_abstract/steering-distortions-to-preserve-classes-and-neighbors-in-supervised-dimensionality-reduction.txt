This paper introduces ClassNeRV, a supervised dimensionality reduction (DR) technique that aims to accomplish exploratory analysis while considering class information. The authors propose a solution that prioritizes class preservation while minimizing distortions in the neighborhood structure. Unlike previous supervised methods that emphasize class separation at the expense of neighbor structure, ClassNeRV utilizes a stress function derived from the unsupervised NeRV framework to optimize the embedding. The paper also introduces two new class-aware quality indicators to measure the effectiveness of the proposed technique.
