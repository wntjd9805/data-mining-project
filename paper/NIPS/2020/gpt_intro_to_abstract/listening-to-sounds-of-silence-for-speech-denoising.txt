Noise contamination in audio signals is a common problem that affects various applications, such as speech communication and human-robot interaction. Classic approaches to speech denoising have limitations in handling nonstationary noise, and neural network-based methods have shown promise but lack the utilization of natural speech structures. In this paper, we propose a deep network that incorporates silent intervals, periods of pure noise, to enhance speech denoising. We introduce a network structure comprising three components: silent interval detection, noise estimation, and signal cleanup. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in various scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art denoising methods and showcasing the significance of silent intervals in improving speech denoising.
