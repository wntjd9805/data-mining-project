Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) has gained attention as a way to reduce manual labeling effort in learning detectors. However, WSOD still faces challenges in achieving satisfactory performance due to the lack of instance-level annotations. This paper proposes a unified WSOD framework called UWSOD, which does not require external modules or additional supervision. The framework includes an anchor-based self-supervised object proposal generator, a step-wise bounding-box fine-tuning method, and a multi-rate resampling pyramid for handling scale variation. Experimental results show that UWSOD achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets, even without external modules or additional supervision. Additionally, UWSOD exhibits a capacity similar to that of fully supervised object detection approaches.
