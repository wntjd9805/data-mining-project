The problem of capturing and reconstructing real-world environments in computer vision is essential for virtual reality and augmented reality applications. While progress has been made in reconstructing static scenes, tracking and reconstructing dynamic objects remains challenging. This paper focuses on non-rigid reconstruction of dynamic objects using a single RGB-D camera, eliminating the need for specialized multi-camera setups. The authors propose a neural non-rigid tracking approach that combines classical deformation-graph-based pipelines with learned components. Their end-to-end approach enables self-supervised outlier rejection and improves non-rigid tracking performance. The proposed method achieves faster correspondence prediction and improved reconstruction performance compared to existing approaches.
