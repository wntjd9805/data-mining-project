This paper addresses the problem of minimizing an unconstrained smooth strongly convex objective function. Instead of directly solving the original objective function, the authors propose methods that are designed to solve a shifted objective. They show that the shifted problem and the original problem share the same optimal solution. The authors leverage a cleaner version of the interpolation condition and propose several methods that achieve faster worst-case convergence rates than existing methods. They also consider various types of oracles and provide experimental results to validate their approach.
