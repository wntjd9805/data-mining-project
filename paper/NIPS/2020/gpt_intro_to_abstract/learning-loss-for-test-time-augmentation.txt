This paper introduces a novel test-time augmentation algorithm called instance-aware test-time augmentation. The algorithm aims to select optimal transformations for each test input dynamically, improving image classification performance. A separate network is developed to predict the loss of transformed images, which reflects both correctness and certainty of the classification result. The proposed method is compared with previous approaches on benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving more robust performances on deformed datasets. The proposed method is considered the first instance-aware test-time augmentation method.
