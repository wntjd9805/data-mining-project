This paper introduces a novel approach to estimate the mean function of the counting process in behavioral medicine, specifically in the context of smoking cessation. The authors address the issue of missing data in Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) studies and propose a self-contained and systematic treatment using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. They extend existing non-parametric mean function estimation methods to handle missing data and provide theoretical guarantees for the convergence of their algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated on two datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in recovering the mean function even when the Poisson process assumption is violated. Overall, this work contributes to the understanding and analysis of temporal patterns of smoking behavior to inform interventions for smoking cessation.
