Counterpoint, a concept in Western music theory, and Chinese folk melodies have distinct characteristics and compositions. While some Chinese composers have experimented with incorporating counterpoint into Chinese music, systematic theories and broader influences on the integration of counterpoint with Chinese folk melodies are lacking. In this paper, we propose a system called FolkDuet that generates countermelodies for Chinese folk melodies in real-time, blending the Western counterpoint concept with the Chinese folk style. We utilize reinforcement learning to learn counterpoint patterns from Bach chorales while maintaining the melodic style of Chinese folk melodies. Our approach differs from previous methods by generating countermelodies in the Chinese folk style and using an iteratively updated rewarder for knowledge transfer and style fusion. Objective experiments and subjective listening tests demonstrate that FolkDuet generates countermelodies that closely resemble the Chinese folk melodies and maintain the Chinese folk style. This work contributes by fusing Western counterpoint interaction with the Chinese folk melody style in countermelody generation, learning to generate countermelodies in real-time for Chinese folk melodies, and transferring counterpoint interaction from Bach chorales to the Chinese folk countermelody task.
