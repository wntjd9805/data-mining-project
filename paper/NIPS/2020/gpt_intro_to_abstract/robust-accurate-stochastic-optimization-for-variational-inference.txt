Bayesian inference is a popular approach in machine learning due to its flexibility and theoretical foundation. However, approximating the posterior distribution using Bayesian methods often requires computational efficiency. Variational inference (VI) has emerged as a commonly used approach for large-scale approximate inference. This paper explores the use of variational methods for statistical inference, where the accuracy of the approximate posterior compared to the true posterior is important. The paper addresses the shortcomings of current stochastic optimization schemes for VI by viewing the optimization algorithm as a Markov chain and proposes a framework that combines various diagnostic methods to improve the accuracy of variational parameter estimates and provide robust optimization. The proposed framework is empirically validated on various models and datasets.
