Introduction:3D object recognition based on point cloud data has made significant progress with the help of deep learning techniques. However, handling geometric transformations, particularly rotation, remains a challenge. Existing algorithms often rely on the assumption of upright object poses, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel rotation-invariant 3D object recognition framework based on graph convolutional neural networks (GCNs). The framework utilizes local reference frames (LRFs) to design descriptors and employs GCNs on stochastically generated graphs to capture local-to-global shape information. The proposed approach avoids the computation of low-level geometric features and achieves robustness to perturbations and outliers. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on various benchmarks of 3D object classification and segmentation.
