This paper introduces a differentially private generative adversarial network (DP-GAN) for privacy-preserving data publishing. Traditional sanitization methods in sensitive domains restrict the expressiveness of released data and fail to generalize to new tasks. Instead, the proposed DP-GAN leverages the success of generative adversarial networks to generate synthetic data that is faithful to the original input distribution. By manipulating gradient information during training and incorporating a Wasserstein objective, the DP-GAN improves gradient updates and sample quality. The approach is applicable to both centralized and decentralized datasets, providing user-level privacy guarantees in the latter case. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in preserving privacy while improving sample quality.
