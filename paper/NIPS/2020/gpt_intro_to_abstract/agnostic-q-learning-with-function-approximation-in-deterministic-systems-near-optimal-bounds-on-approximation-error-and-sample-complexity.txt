Q-learning is a widely used approach in reinforcement learning, but its theoretical understanding is mostly limited to the tabular setting. Recent research has focused on Q-learning with linear function approximation, but these approaches only work when the optimal Q-function is exactly linear. In practice, the optimal Q-function is often only linear up to small approximation errors. This paper addresses the agnostic setting, where the optimal Q-function can only be approximated by a function class with an approximation error Î´. The authors propose a provably efficient Q-learning algorithm for this setting, with results that help address an open problem posed in previous work. The main contribution is a theorem that shows the algorithm can find the optimal policy using a polynomial number of trajectories, under certain assumptions on the optimality gap and the Eluder dimension of the function class. The paper also discusses the challenges and compares the results with related work.
