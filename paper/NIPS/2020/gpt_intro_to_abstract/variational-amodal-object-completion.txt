This paper introduces a variational generative framework called Amodal-VAE for amodal instance completion in computer vision. Amodal instance completion refers to the ability to accurately reconstruct occluded objects in a visual scene. The proposed framework leverages instance masks of visible parts of objects to learn how to reconstruct the complete objects from partial masks. The framework incorporates probabilistic modeling to handle the ambiguity in mask completion and can generate multiple plausible completions. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through experiments and a user study, showing significant improvements over existing state-of-the-art methods and preference over human-annotated amodal masks.
