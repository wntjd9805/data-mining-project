Recent advances in neural recording techniques have allowed for simultaneous recording of thousands of neurons, providing insights into population data that are not possible when studying single neuron activity. However, analyzing population data remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of responses and the mixing of encoded variables observed in neural data. Traditional methods of averaging across neurons discard this heterogeneity, but newer dimensionality reduction methods, such as demixed principal component analysis (dPCA), have been developed to isolate key features of population response structure. In addition to the number of neurons recorded, there has also been a revolution in the number of brain areas being recorded, offering opportunities to investigate interactions between populations of neurons in distinct areas. While previous dimensionality reduction methods have provided important insights into cross-regional information sharing, they have limitations in identifying when and what task parameters are shared across regions. To address this, we propose a method called demixed shared component analysis (dSCA) that identifies shared components across two brain areas specific to a task parameter of interest in a time-resolved manner. Our approach aims to demix neural activity in a single area, while maximizing the shared information between the two areas with a time lag. We demonstrate the effectiveness of dSCA using simulation analysis and reanalyze previously published decision-making datasets, showing that it captures shared components related to specific task parameters.
