Submodularity is a fundamental concept in combinatorial optimization, with various applications in machine learning and signal processing. Continuous submodular functions have recently gained attention, particularly in the maximization problem with a linear constraint. In this paper, we propose two algorithms, COORDINATE-ASCENT+ and COORDINATE-ASCENT++, that achieve constant factor approximation guarantees for the maximization of a monotone continuous submodular function subject to a linear constraint. These algorithms have efficient computational complexities and do not assume the diminishing returns condition for the continuous submodular function.
