In this paper, we address the problem of image restoration in the presence of signal-dependent or -independent noises. We propose a novel method called CLEARER (multi-sCaLe nEural ARchitecture sEarch for image Restoration) that aims to automate the integration and design of multi-resolution neural architectures. Our method consists of three task-flexible modules: parallel module, transition module, and fusion module, which are specifically designed to facilitate image restoration. We employ a data-driven strategy to determine when to fuse low- and high-resolution features using a novel loss function. Our method also allows for control of the balance between performance and model size, making it suitable for resource-constrained scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.
