Autoregressive models have been widely used for generating realistic images, high-quality speech, and complex decisions in games. However, these models often rely on simple probability density functions, limiting their expressiveness. Energy-based models (EBMs) offer a more flexible approach by representing density in terms of an energy function. While EBMs require new training strategies, score matching (SM) has been proposed as an alternative to maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for training EBMs. SM circumvents the intractable partition function but requires computing the trace of the Hessian matrix, which is expensive for high-dimensional data. To address this challenge, we introduce Composite Score Matching (CSM), a new divergence that decomposes high-dimensional distribution matching into simpler univariate sub-problems. CSM training is particularly efficient when the model is represented directly in terms of univariate conditional scores. Leveraging existing autoregressive models, we design architectures that enable parallel evaluation of all dimensions for efficient training. Our method achieves accurate score estimation and outperforms other training methods in various tasks such as density estimation, data generation, image denoising, and anomaly detection.
