This paper introduces the concept of Goodhart's law in the context of machine learning systems and their ability to generalize. The paper focuses on the use of out-of-distribution (OOD) testing as a method for evaluating generalization and highlights the flaws in existing methods for evaluating visual question answering (VQA) models using the VQA-CP dataset. The paper discusses how reliance on the known construction procedure and the lack of an official validation set leads to gaming of the metrics and defeats the purpose of an OOD evaluation. The authors present simple baselines that outperform state-of-the-art methods on VQA-CP and provide guidelines for future benchmark designs.
