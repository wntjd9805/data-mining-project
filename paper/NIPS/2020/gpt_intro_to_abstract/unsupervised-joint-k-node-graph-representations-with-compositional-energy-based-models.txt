This paper introduces MHM-GNN, a model for joint (k > 2)-node representations in dyadic graphs. Existing unsupervised learning techniques using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited to node and edge representations due to their reliance on edge-based losses. However, many downstream tasks require reasoning about k nodes, such as drone swarms and product recommendation systems. Previous GNN extensions that provide joint k-node representations require supervised graph-wide losses, which is not scalable. MHM-GNN addresses this scalability issue by leveraging hypergraph Markov network models and implementing an energy-based model over GNN representations of motifs. The paper also introduces a stochastic optimization method that learns MHM-GNN using a finite-sample unbiased estimator of the graph energy. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MHM-GNN over existing approaches. The code for MHM-GNN is publicly available.
