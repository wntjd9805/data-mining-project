This paper addresses the problem of object detection in 3D point clouds and the limitations of existing methods in capturing global context. The authors propose a contextual encoding layer for 3D point clouds, utilizing a small dictionary of code words to model the global semantic context and reweight feature maps. To overcome data sparsity, a Group Contextual Encoding (GCE) method is introduced, dividing the channel into groups for effective learning. The proposed method outperforms existing approaches on benchmark datasets for 3D point cloud tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalizability.
