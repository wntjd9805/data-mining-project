In this paper, we propose a new task called Hierarchical Granularity Transfer Learning (HGTL) that aims to recognize subordinate-level categories without sub-level image annotations. We introduce the Bi-granularity Semantic Preserving Network (BigSPN) as a solution, which constructs two specific visual encoders for basic- and sub-domain categories. The core motivation of BigSPN is to leverage the semantic relationship between the two category domains for visual knowledge transfer. We evaluate the proposed framework on three benchmark datasets and show that it is a robust solution for HGTL.
