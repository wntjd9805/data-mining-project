This paper introduces a new method to transform discrete optimizers into differentiable operations in order to expand the set of operations that can be incorporated in differentiable models. The authors propose using stochastic perturbations, where the inputs of a discrete solver are perturbed with random noise and the perturbed solutions are considered. The method is easy to analyze theoretically and simple to implement. The authors demonstrate that the formal expectations of these perturbed solutions are always differentiable, with successive derivatives being expectations of simple expressions.
