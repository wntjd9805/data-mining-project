Various experimental design problems in science and engineering require simultaneous optimization of conflicting objectives, often with black-box functions that are expensive to evaluate. This has led to an interest in data-driven algorithms to efficiently guide the experimental design process. Bayesian optimization (BO) has proven to be powerful in optimizing these expensive black-box functions by using a surrogate model and an acquisition function. However, evaluating experiments in parallel and considering diversity in both design and performance space during batch selection for multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) has not been extensively explored. In this paper, we propose a novel MOBO approach called DGEMO (Diversity-Guided Efficient Multi-objective Optimization) that incorporates batch selection strategy based on diversity in both design and performance space. Our algorithm is evaluated on synthetic test functions and real-world benchmark problems, and it consistently outperforms relevant existing works in the field.
