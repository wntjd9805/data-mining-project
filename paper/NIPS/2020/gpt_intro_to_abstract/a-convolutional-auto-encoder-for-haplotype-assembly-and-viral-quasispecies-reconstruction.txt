Genetic mutations in living organisms and viruses can result in diverse and complex genomic communities, with implications on health and disease. High-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled the study of these communities, but accurate composition inference is computationally challenging. Additionally, reconstructing haplotypes and viral quasispecies presents further difficulties due to sequencing errors and unknown population sizes. In this paper, we propose CAECseq, a convolutional auto-encoder with a clustering layer, for solving haplotype assembly and viral quasispecies reconstruction problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CAECseq through extensive experiments on simulated, semi-experimental, and experimental data.
