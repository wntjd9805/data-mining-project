This paper addresses the issue of model misspecification in Bayesian statistics and its impact on the performance of Bayesian model averaging. It introduces a novel theoretical analysis that demonstrates suboptimal generalization performance of Bayesian model averaging when the model family is misspecified. Based on this analysis, the paper proposes new second-order PAC-Bayes bounds and derives a new family of Bayesian-like algorithms that offer improved generalization properties. These algorithms can be interpreted as generalized variational methods or ensemble methods. The paper also presents experiments with Bayesian neural networks to illustrate the findings. Previous works in PAC-Bayesian theory, Bayesian inference, and direct loss minimization are discussed, highlighting their limitations in studying the generalization risk of Bayesian model averaging under model misspecification. Robust Bayesian methods are also mentioned, but their focus is primarily on handling deviations from assumptions rather than studying generalization performance.
