Recent technological advancements have resulted in the generation of high-dimensional datasets in various scientific fields. These datasets are modeled using probabilistic graphical models, and the goal is to recover the underlying network structure. While full network recovery is sometimes necessary, there is a growing interest in identifying changes in network structure due to external stimuli. Previous approaches involve estimating the network at each stage and comparing the differences, but this method is limited by the variability of observations and the lack of sufficient data. In this paper, we propose to derive information-theoretic limits for two structural inference problems in degree-bounded Ising models: goodness-of-fit testing (GOF) and error-of-fit (EOF) estimation. Our main question is to understand when the sample complexity of these problems is significantly smaller than that of directly recovering the underlying graph structure. Surprisingly, our results show that up to a certain number of changes, the sample complexities of GOF and EOF are similar to that of structure learning (SL). This finding challenges previous works that claimed the possibility of recovering sparse changes with significantly lower sample complexity. We also demonstrate the same effect in the detection of edge deletions in forest-structured Ising models and to some extent in high-temperature ferromagnets. These results contribute to the understanding of edge edits in natural classes of Ising models and highlight the need for further research in developing algorithms with reduced sample complexity.
