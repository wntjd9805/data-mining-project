This paper introduces the concept of representing various types of network data as graphs composed of nodes and edges. It highlights the importance of modeling uncertainty in graph analytics and proposes the use of probabilistic generative models. The limitations of existing relational topic models (RTMs) and variational graph autoencoders (VGAEs) are identified, and a hierarchical RTM called graph Poisson factor analysis (GPFA) is proposed. Additionally, two different non-Gaussian VGAEs with multiple stochastic layers are developed. These models are shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various graph analytic tasks while providing a potential solution for exploring multi-layer network relationships.
