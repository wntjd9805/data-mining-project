Time-series forecasting is crucial in many real-world scenarios, allowing for accurate estimation of future events or metrics. Deep learning models, such as LSTM, GRU, GLU, and TCN, have shown promise in temporal modeling, while DFT has been effective in time-series analysis. However, current models struggle to effectively model both intra-series temporal patterns and inter-series correlations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called StemGNN, which combines the benefits of GFT, DFT, and deep neural networks to model multivariate time-series data entirely in the spectral domain. StemGNN incorporates GFT to transform multivariate inputs into spectral time-series representations, and DFT to transfer each univariate time-series into the frequency domain. A latent correlation layer is also introduced to learn inter-series correlations automatically. Experimental results demonstrate that StemGNN outperforms state-of-the-art models on multiple benchmarks of multivariate time-series forecasting, achieving an average improvement of 8.1% on MAE and 13.3% on RMSE.
