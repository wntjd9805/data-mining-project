Covariance estimation is a fundamental task in high-dimensional statistics, and this paper focuses on the problem of estimating covariance in the presence of adversarial data. The goal is to minimize the total variation distance between the true covariance and the estimated covariance. In the non-robust setting, where there are no corruptions, the empirical covariance matrix can be computed efficiently and achieves an optimal statistical rate. However, in the robust setting, achieving optimal error rates requires exponential time algorithms. This paper presents a polynomial-time algorithm for robust covariance estimation that matches the runtime of the non-robust algorithm, resolving a long-standing question in the field. The algorithm is based on a robust mean estimation technique and utilizes techniques from quantum entropy scoring to improve runtime and accuracy.
