This paper addresses the challenge of explaining the behavior of machine learning algorithms and AI, particularly in the context of reinforcement learning. While previous research has focused on explaining the behavior of supervised machine learning, it is unclear how to provide explanations for reinforcement learning. The paper introduces a method that allows for the interpretation of an agent's intention based on its behavioral policy. By recovering the sum of past events that contributed to the agent's current behavior, the method provides insights into the agent's intended outcome. The authors present a novel approach that differs from existing techniques and mathematically guarantees consistency with the agent's Q-values. The proposed method has implications for understanding agent behavior, model debugging, and diagnostics for reinforcement learning systems.
