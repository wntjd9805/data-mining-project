This paper addresses the problem of estimating the 3D rotation of an object from 2D images in computer vision. While deep learning techniques have shown improvements in 3D orientation estimation, precise estimation remains challenging due to the nonlinear nature of the space of all 3D rotations. Various deep learning approaches have been proposed, including using different rotation representations and constructing a mapping function. However, quantifying the uncertainty of 3D rotation estimation is also crucial, and current methods rely on complex solutions. In this paper, the authors propose a deep learning approach that uses the matrix Fisher probability density function, which offers an unconstrained parameterization, convex loss function, and the ability to estimate uncertainty. The method is evaluated on multiple problem domains and outperforms previous methods. The contributions of this paper include the method for estimating a probability distribution using the matrix Fisher distribution with neural networks, the associated convex loss, and the demonstration of superiority over state-of-the-art methods.
