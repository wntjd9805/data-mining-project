This paper introduces a novel Cross-view Consistent Network (CVCNet) for 3D object detection using range view (RV) and Bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations. The authors propose a pair of Hough-Transform-like cross-view transformers to enforce consistency between the two views and improve performance. They also present a new Voxel representation, Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) Voxels, which allows extraction of features in both RV and BEV. Experimental results on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that CVCNet outperforms existing approaches in terms of average precision, with significant improvements in detecting pedestrians, motorcyclists, and cyclists.
