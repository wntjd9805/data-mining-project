Data augmentation is a popular approach in training vision models, but its manual design limits its scalability. Recently, learning data augmentation strategies from data has emerged as a new paradigm to automate the design process and potentially address weaknesses of traditional methods. This paper aims to make AutoAugment and related methods more practical by focusing on the search space and reducing the complexity of the search process. The experiments show that it is possible to optimize all operations jointly with a single distortion magnitude, simplifying the search space and eliminating the need for a separate search phase and proxy tasks. The proposed method, called RandAugment, achieves higher accuracy on various benchmarks and outperforms or closely matches AutoAugment.
