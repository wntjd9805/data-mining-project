High dimensional multivariate datasets are common in various fields, such as biology, neuroscience, and medicine. The identification of important variables for predicting observed phenomena is a fundamental question in these disciplines. However, due to limited data and noisy observations, determining informative variables is challenging and typically involves some error rate. To address this, scientists aim to find informative variables while controlling a specific tolerance on the error rate, such as the false discovery rate (FDR). Traditional methods for FDR control rely on assumptions about the relationship between the covariates of interest and the response. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Model-X knockoffs, which controls the FDR by constructing synthetic variables, called knockoffs, that mimic the original covariates but have no relationship with the response given the original covariates. These knockoff variables can be used to test the conditional independence of each covariate by comparing their associations with the response to those of the original covariates. Building good generative models of the covariates is crucial for this approach, as the focus is on modeling the covariates themselves. The knockoffs must satisfy two properties: independence of the response given the real covariates and equal distribution with the real data when any subset of variables is swapped between knockoffs and real data. We discuss the challenges in satisfying these properties and the importance of building conditional generative models.
