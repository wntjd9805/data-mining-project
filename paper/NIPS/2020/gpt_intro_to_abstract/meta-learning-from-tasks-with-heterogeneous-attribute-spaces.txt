This paper introduces a few-shot learning method for tasks with heterogeneous attribute spaces. The existing few-shot learning methods assume that all training and target tasks share the same attribute space, but this limitation prevents learning with a wide variety of tasks. The proposed method trains a model on tasks with various attribute spaces, allowing it to solve unseen tasks with different attribute spaces given only a few labeled instances. The paper presents a problem formulation, a neural network-based model, and empirically demonstrates its performance on tasks with heterogeneous attribute spaces. The proposed method has potential applications in situations where data from multiple related tasks with different attributes are available.
