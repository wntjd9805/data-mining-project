Homomorphic Encryption (HE)-enabled neural networks (NNs) have been developed for secure Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS). In this system, a client encrypts their data and uploads it to a server in the cloud, where computations are performed on the encrypted data and the encrypted output is returned to the client. However, HE only supports linear layers of a neural network, leading to slower inference times. Interactive HE-enabled NNs (HENNs) involve the client in the computation of activation layers, while non-interactive HENNs approximate activations to perform secure inferences without client involvement. Both interactive and non-interactive HENNs have slow inference times, with rotations consuming the majority of the latency. Recent interactive HENNs use frequency-domain convolutions to eliminate expensive HE rotations, but using this technique in non-interactive HENNs increases inference latency due to noise accumulation. In this paper, a new approach called Falcon is proposed for fast non-interactive privacy-preserving inference. Falcon includes a novel HE DFT algorithm, fast HE-enable convolution technique, fully-connected technique on spectral domain, and considerations for HE noise growth and parameter selection. Experimental results show that Falcon reduces inference latency by 45.45% to 85.34% compared to prior HENNs on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets.
