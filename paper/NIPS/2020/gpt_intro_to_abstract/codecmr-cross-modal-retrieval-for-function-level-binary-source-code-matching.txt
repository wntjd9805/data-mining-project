Binary source code matching is a crucial task in computer security, with applications ranging from code clone detection to reverse engineering. Previous methods have focused on extracting code literals and using traditional matching algorithms, but these approaches have limitations in accuracy and required expert experience. In this paper, we propose a function-level approach to binary source code matching and introduce an overall framework based on cross-modal retrieval. We design encoders for source code and binary code using deep pyramid convolutional neural networks and graph neural networks, respectively. We also develop methods for extracting code literals and a norm weighted sampling technique to improve training efficiency and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model compared to other approaches on two datasets.
