Issues with learning from incomplete data arise in various domains such as computational biology, clinical studies, survey research, finance, and economics. Previous approaches to handling missing data include feature imputation and label prediction. However, these methods have limitations such as making strong assumptions about the data distribution, lacking flexibility for mixed data types, and requiring retraining with new data samples. In this paper, we propose the GRAPE framework, which formulates the problem using a bipartite graph representation. GRAPE utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to solve both feature imputation and label prediction tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that GRAPE outperforms existing algorithms in terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and can generalize to unseen observations without retraining. Overall, our approach benefits from creating connections between different features and leveraging the graph structure to propagate and borrow information, leading to improved performance.
