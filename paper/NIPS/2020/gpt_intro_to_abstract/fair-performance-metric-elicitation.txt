This paper addresses the challenge of selecting an appropriate fairness metric in automated decision-making systems. The authors propose extending the Metric Elicitation (ME) framework to elicit fair performance metrics using pairwise preference feedback. The framework aims to balance predictive performance and fairness violations, and the authors develop a novel query efficient procedure to recover the metric with linear query complexity. The proposed approach is robust to noise and can be applied to both classier preferences and rates. The paper presents contributions in terms of methodology and practical applicability.
