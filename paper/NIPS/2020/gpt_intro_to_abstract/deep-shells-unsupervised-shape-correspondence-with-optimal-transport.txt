Computing shape correspondence is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics, but it remains challenging due to the complexity of 3D surfaces. Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features and make restrictive assumptions about the input objects. To overcome these limitations, there is a growing interest in applying machine learning techniques to geometric data. However, extending deep learning to non-Euclidean data is still an open challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines a learnable local feature extractor with the axiomatic approach of functional maps. We derive a deep version of the state-of-the-art axiomatic method, smooth shells, and integrate it into an end-to-end trainable deep network. Our method outperforms previous approaches in terms of both axiomatic and machine learning methods, and it does not require expensive pre or postprocessing.
