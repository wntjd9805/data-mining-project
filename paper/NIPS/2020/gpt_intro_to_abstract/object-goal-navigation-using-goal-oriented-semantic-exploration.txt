In this paper, we address the problem of designing a computational model for efficient navigation in unseen environments by building an episodic memory and using semantic priors. We explore the limitations of end-to-end learning-based methods and propose an improved approach called 'Goal-Oriented Semantic Exploration' (SemExp). SemExp extends the Active Neural SLAM system to incorporate explicit semantic maps and learn semantic priors using a semantically-aware long-term policy. We make two key improvements over the previous method, including the addition of explicit semantic categories in top-down metric maps and the training of a goal-oriented semantic exploration policy. Our experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that SemExp outperforms prior methods and achieves competitive performance on a mobile robot platform.
