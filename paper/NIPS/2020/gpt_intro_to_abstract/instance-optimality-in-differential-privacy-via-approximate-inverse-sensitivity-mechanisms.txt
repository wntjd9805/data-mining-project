We study the estimation of a function of interest under differential privacy, where privacy protections can decrease utility. To improve the utility of private algorithms, it is important to design mechanisms that adapt to the hardness of the underlying data. In this paper, we explore instance-optimality in private statistical estimation and develop extensions and approximations to the inverse sensitivity mechanism. We establish instance-optimality results for vector-valued functions and propose two approaches for instance-specific lower bounds. We also provide efficient implementations for a broad class of functions and demonstrate the advantages of our mechanisms in various applications.
