Bayesian phylogenetic inference is a powerful statistical tool used in molecular evolutionary analysis. This method allows for quantifying the uncertainty of the evolutionary process by calculating posterior probabilities of phylogenetic trees. However, the commonly used random-walk MCMC method has limitations in terms of exploration efficiency and accuracy of posterior estimates. Variational inference (VI) is an alternative method that seeks the best approximation to the true posterior from a family of tractable distributions. In recent years, there have been efforts to apply VI to phylogenetic inference, including variational Bayesian phylogenetic inference (VBPI). VBPI utilizes subsplit Bayesian networks and amortization techniques to improve computational efficiency. However, the current branch length distribution used in VBPI may not accurately represent the true posterior distributions. To address this issue, this paper proposes VBPI-NF (Normalizing Flows), which incorporates normalizing flows for more expressive branch length approximations. Experimental results demonstrate the significant improvement of VBPI-NF over traditional VBPI.
