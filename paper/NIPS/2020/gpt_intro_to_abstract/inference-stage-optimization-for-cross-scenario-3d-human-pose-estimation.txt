3D human pose estimation is an important task in computer vision, with applications in human-robot interaction, action recognition, and human tracking. While current methods have achieved success in controlled environments, they struggle to generalize to new scenarios with variations in poses, viewpoints, and appearances. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme called Inference Stage Optimization (ISO) that focuses on adapting the model at the inference stage rather than improving model training. We leverage self-supervised learning techniques to extract valuable information from unlabeled data in the target scenario and use it to correct training bias and improve generalization performance. Our experiments demonstrate that ISO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on cross-scenario 3D pose estimation tasks and we provide insights into its effectiveness through systematic analysis. The contributions of this work include the development of ISO, exploration of suitable SSL techniques for 3D pose estimation, the development of an online ISO framework, and insights for future research in improving generalization in human pose estimation.
