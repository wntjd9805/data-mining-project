This paper focuses on the contextual learning version of Myersonian pricing, which involves pricing a variety of differentiated products based on their features in order to optimize revenue. The goal is to design a policy that suggests a price for each product with the aim of maximizing revenue. The paper presents the first provable approximation algorithm for the empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem in Myersonian regression, without assuming any specific data conditions. Additionally, the paper establishes the hardness of approximation for the ERM problem and discusses the stability and generalization properties of the problem. The main result of the paper is a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) using dimensionality reduction, and the paper also shows that the Myersonian regression problem is NP-hard.
