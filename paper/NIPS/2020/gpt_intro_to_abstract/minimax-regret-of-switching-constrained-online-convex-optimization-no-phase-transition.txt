Online learning is a versatile framework for studying dynamic optimization problems, with applications in various domains. The fundamental problem involves a repeated game between a player and an adversary, where the goal is to minimize the penalties received by the player. This paper focuses on the continuous analog of prediction from experts, known as online convex optimization, and considers the setting of switching-constrained online learning, where the player's actions are restricted to a limited number of switches. The goal is to establish the minimax regret in this setting and present an algorithm that achieves the optimal rate. The paper assumes a compact and convex action set for the player and a family of differentiable convex functions from which the adversary selects the loss function. The regret is defined as the accumulated loss minus the loss of the best single action, with an additional term accounting for the switch limit. The switching-constrained minimax regret is denoted as R(T, K), representing the optimal regret for a given number of rounds (T) and switch limit (K).
