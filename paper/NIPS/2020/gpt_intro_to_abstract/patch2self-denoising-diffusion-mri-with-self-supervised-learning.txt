Diffusion Weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DWI) is a powerful technique used to measure tissue microstructure in the brain. However, the accuracy of white matter pathway reconstruction is limited by the presence of substantial noise in DWI acquisitions. Denoising is therefore an essential step for improving the reliability of anatomical inference. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised denoising method called Patch2Self, which learns locally linear relationships between different volumes within DWI data. By incorporating key features of prior successful methods and eliminating the need for a noise model, Patch2Self achieves superior denoising performance compared to other unsupervised techniques, as demonstrated through thorough comparisons on real and simulated data.
