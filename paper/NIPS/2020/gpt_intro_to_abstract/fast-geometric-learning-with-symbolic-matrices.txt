Fast numerical methods are crucial for machine learning research, with most frameworks relying on efficient C++ backends to leverage the computing power of GPUs. However, there is a clear performance gap between Python and C++ in geometric computations, such as point cloud convolutions and nearest neighbor search. To address this, we present KeOps, an extension for popular programming languages that combines the speed of handcrafted CUDA kernels with the simplicity of a high-level language. Our toolbox optimizes map-reduce operations on generalized point clouds, supports distance-like matrices, and offers fully differentiable computations with minimal memory usage. The runtimes of our library are competitive with existing CUDA libraries and significantly faster in many use cases. Our library integrates seamlessly into existing codebases and provides a substantial performance boost across various methods, including optimal transport solvers and geometric operators in hyperbolic spaces. We believe that our library will have a significant impact on machine learning research.
