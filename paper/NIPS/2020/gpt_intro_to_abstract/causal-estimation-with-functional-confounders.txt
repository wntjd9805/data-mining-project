Determining the effect of interventions on outcomes using observational data is crucial in various fields such as medicine, economic policy, and genomics. Confounders, which are unobserved variables that affect both the intervention and the outcome, pose a challenge in estimating causal effects. This paper focuses on the specific problem of estimating causal effects when the confounders are a function of the pre-outcome variables that also define the interventions. The authors propose the concept of estimation with functional confounders (EFC), where the confounder is obtained using a function. They address the violation of positivity caused by functional confounders by investigating functional interventions and developing a sufficient condition called functional positivity (F-POSITIVITY). Additionally, they introduce the concept of causal redundancy (C-REDUNDANCY) for estimating the effect of the full intervention. The authors provide an algorithm called Level-set Orthogonal Descent Estimation (LODE) for causal estimation assuming C-REDUNDANCY. Overall, this paper proposes methods to estimate causal effects in settings where confounders are a function of pre-outcome variables, contributing to the field of observational causal inference.
