Multiclass classification is essential for various machine learning applications that require distinguishing between thousands of classes. This includes natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and recommendation systems. Despite their widespread use, there is still a lack of understanding regarding the statistical properties and behavior of classification algorithms. This paper aims to explore multiclass classification algorithms in high-dimensional regimes and addresses questions such as test accuracy, algorithm selection, and accuracy on rare classes. The paper provides a precise asymptotic study of linear multiclass classification and examines different data models and training algorithms. It also discusses efficient methods for evaluating test accuracy and presents numerical simulations to validate the theoretical findings. The paper's contributions include characterizing test accuracy for different algorithms, data distributions, and dimensions, and examining algorithm behavior in the presence of rare classes.
