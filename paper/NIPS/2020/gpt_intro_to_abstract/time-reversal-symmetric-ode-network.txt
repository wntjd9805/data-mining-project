Recent advances in artificial intelligence have enabled researchers to predict the behavior of physical systems using machine learning techniques. Among these techniques, neural networks have proven to be particularly effective in modeling complex physical phenomena. However, neural networks struggle to learn and model the underlying physical properties from observed data alone, often overfitting to short-term training data and failing to accurately predict long-term behaviors. To address this issue, researchers have incorporated physics-based inductive biases into neural network architectures, but these methods are often limited to specific domains where the governing physics is known. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Time-Reversal Symmetry ODE Network (TRS-ODEN) that utilizes the time-reversal symmetry of classical dynamics as a regularizer in training neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TRS-ODENs in predicting the behavior of various physical systems, including nonlinear and reversible systems. Our results show that TRS-ODENs achieve better predictive performance compared to baseline methods, even for time-irreversible systems.
