This paper introduces a framework for jointly modeling intervention functions in order to transfer knowledge across different experimental setups and integrate observational and interventional data. The proposed model, called DAG-GP, combines causal inference with multi-task learning using Gaussian processes. The authors provide theoretical results on developing a causal multi-task model based on the topology of the causal model's directed acyclic graph (DAG). They also demonstrate the effectiveness of DAG-GP in various experimental settings, showing improved fitting performance and enabling optimal decision making through proper uncertainty quantification.
