In this paper, we address the problem of face forgery detection in the presence of large appearance differences. We propose a new identity swapping algorithm, called Appearance Optimal Transport (AOT), that aims to bridge the appearance gaps between source and target faces. By formulating the appearance mapping as an optimal transport problem, we are able to capture color differences and preserve the structure of the source image. We introduce a Neural Optimal Transport Plan Estimation (NOTPE) method to solve the optimal transport problem in the latent space, which enables more continuous synthesis and reduces computation. Additionally, we use a segmentation game to minimize the Wasserstein distance in the pixel space, resulting in more realistic synthesized images. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of AOT over existing identity swapping methods and show that our generated data can improve face forgery detection.
