This paper focuses on the problem of Online Convex Optimization (OCO) with memory, where an online learner chooses actions and suffers convex losses based on current and previous actions. The incorporation of memory into OCO has gained attention for its theoretical implications and practical applications. While previous work has proposed algorithms with sublinear static regret, the search for general-purpose constant-competitive algorithms for OCO with memory remains open. This paper presents a novel setting called OCO with structured memory, introduces a new algorithm that achieves a constant competitive ratio, and establishes connections between online optimization and control. The proposed algorithm has a constant and dimension-free competitive ratio and is the first algorithm to achieve such a ratio for memory longer than one step. Additionally, the paper provides a reduction from a class of online control problems to OCO with structured memory, demonstrating the existence of a constant-competitive policy for this class. The paper also highlights the difference between the best linear policy and the true optimal policy and shows that the proposed algorithms can outperform the best linear controller.
