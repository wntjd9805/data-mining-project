This paper introduces Audeo, a full pipeline for generating audio from silent piano performance videos. The pipeline consists of three stages: capturing visual information and predicting pressed keys, refining the predictions with musical attributes, and synthesizing the Pseudo-Midi representation into an audio signal. The main contributions of this work are transcribing music from non-lab recorded videos, proposing an interpretable pipeline, and demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of Audeo in generating accurate musical performances. The output audio generated by Audeo is consistently identified by popular music identification software as the expected musical piece.
