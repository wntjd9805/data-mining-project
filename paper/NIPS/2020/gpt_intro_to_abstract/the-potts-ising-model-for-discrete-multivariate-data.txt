Modeling multivariate discrete data is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning, particularly in high dimensions. Dependencies among variables, such as correlation and conditional independence, play a crucial role in this task. Graphical models, like the Potts model, are versatile tools for modeling multivariate distributions. However, the full Potts model becomes challenging to fit and interpret in high-dimensional settings. In this paper, we introduce a variation of the Potts model, called the Potts-Ising model (POIS), which addresses these issues. POIS allows for general categorical marginals and captures multivariate dependence using a single matrix. We apply our model to toxicity data from cancer clinical trials, which are high-dimensional with rich dependencies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of POIS through extensive simulations and comparisons with existing approaches.
