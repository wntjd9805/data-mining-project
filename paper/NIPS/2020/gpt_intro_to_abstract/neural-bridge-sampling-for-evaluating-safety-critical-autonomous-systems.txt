Data-driven and learning-based approaches have shown promise in enabling robots and autonomous systems to interact intelligently with unstructured environments. However, evaluating the performance of these systems is challenging, especially in safety-critical settings, where the lack of tractable methods to certify system quality hinders their success. This paper aims to address this limitation by proposing an efficient evaluation method for complex systems operating in unstructured environments without safety guarantees. The method leverages a simulator to test system performance and estimates the probability of adverse events using a distribution of simulation parameters. The paper introduces neural bridge sampling, a technique that combines exploration, exploitation, and optimization to solve the estimation problem effectively. The proposed method is empirically evaluated and compared to existing techniques in various applications, demonstrating its superiority.
