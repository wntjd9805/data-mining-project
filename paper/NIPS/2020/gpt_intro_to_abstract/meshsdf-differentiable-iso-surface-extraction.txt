Geometric Deep Learning has recently advanced with continuous Deep Implicit Fields, which enable detailed modeling of surfaces without relying on 3D grids or fixed topology. However, some applications require explicit surface representations. Converting implicit surface parameterization to explicit representations typically relies on non-differentiable algorithms, limiting their use with continuous Deep Implicit Fields. To address this limitation, we propose MeshSDF, a technique that uses continuous signed distance functions to produce explicit surface representations while preserving differentiability. We showcase the versatility of MeshSDF in single-view reconstructions and shape optimization for Computational Fluid Dynamics, demonstrating its superiority over existing algorithms. Our core contribution is a method for differentiating through iso-surface extraction, allowing for an end-to-end differentiable surface mesh parameterization with topology changes.
