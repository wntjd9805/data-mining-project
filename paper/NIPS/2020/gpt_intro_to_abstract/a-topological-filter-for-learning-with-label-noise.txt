Corrupted labels are a common issue in real-world data and can greatly impact the performance of deep neural networks. This problem is particularly relevant in applications where label noise can arise from human annotators or automatic label extraction tools. Current methods aim to combat label noise by segregating clean data from noisy data, but the challenge lies in selecting clean data accurately and efficiently. This paper proposes a novel topological perspective to address this problem. The authors observe that within an ideal feature representation, clean data cluster together while corrupted data are isolated. Based on this observation, they propose a method called TopoFilter that leverages the spatial topological pattern to filter label noise. The method collects clean data by selecting the largest connected component of each class and discarding isolated data. One strength of the proposed method is that it is theoretically guaranteed to be correct, ensuring both the purity and abundance of the collected data. The authors also introduce an algorithm that learns the representation and selects clean data concurrently. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to existing approaches. Overall, this paper presents a theoretically-grounded algorithm that utilizes a topological view of data representation to address label noise in deep neural networks.
