Bayesian persuasion, a problem in which an informed sender tries to influence the behavior of a self-interested receiver through the strategic provision of information, has been widely studied in various domains such as auctions, online advertising, voting, traffic routing, recommendation systems, security, and product marketing. However, the current model assumes that the sender knows the receiver's utility function, which is a severe limitation. In this paper, we address this limitation by framing the Bayesian persuasion problem in an online learning framework and studying a repeated persuasion problem where the receiver's type is adversarially chosen. Our goal is to design an online algorithm that recommends a signaling scheme, guaranteeing an expected utility close to the best-in-hindsight scheme. We consider two models of feedback - full information and partial information - and provide results on the possibility of designing regret-minimizing algorithms with polynomial running time and regret bounds that are polynomial in the problem size and sublinear in the number of rounds.
