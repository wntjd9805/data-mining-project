Online problems involve making decisions without knowledge of the future. Traditional approaches use algorithm design to provide bounds on the ratio between the algorithm's solution and the optimal solution. However, these approaches are often overly cautious and yield poor guarantees. To address this, recent work has suggested incorporating predictions from machine learning algorithms into online algorithm design. This paper focuses on the problem of minimizing energy consumption for a server that receives requests in an online fashion, with the ability to dynamically change processing speed. The goal is to develop algorithms that outperform traditional online algorithms when predictions are accurate, while still being robust in the case of misleading predictions. The paper presents a formal prediction model, a lower bound, and a modular algorithm that incorporates any ML predictor as a black-box. Theoretical and experimental analyses support the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
