Single image super resolution (SISR) is a challenging problem in computer vision, with applications in various fields such as video enhancement, medical imaging, and security. Previous deep neural network (DNN) methods have achieved impressive results by assuming a pre-defined blur kernel, but real-world applications often involve more complex blur kernels, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm called deep alternating network (DAN) to tackle the problem of blind SR. DAN consists of two convolutional neural modules, Restorer and Estimator, which work iteratively to estimate the blur kernel and restore the high-resolution image. By training Restorer with the estimated kernel, it becomes more tolerant to estimation errors and can produce better results. Our end-to-end trainable DAN outperforms previous two-step solutions, achieving superior performance in terms of visual quality and speed.
