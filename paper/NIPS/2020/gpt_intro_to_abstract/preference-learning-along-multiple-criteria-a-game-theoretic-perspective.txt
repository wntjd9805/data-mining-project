This paper introduces a new framework for preference learning when pairwise comparisons are available along multiple criteria. The traditional linearity assumption is violated in cases where the comparison problem is multi-criteria in nature. To address this, the paper proposes decomposing the overall comparison task into simpler criteria and obtaining preferences along each criterion separately. The paper formulates the problem of finding the "best" randomized policy and introduces the notion of a Blackwell winner, which generalizes the concept of a von Neumann winner. Statistical and computational guarantees for learning the Blackwell winner from data are provided, and a user study with an autonomous driving environment is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
