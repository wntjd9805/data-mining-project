This paper introduces the concept of Assisted Learning, which aims to address the tradeoff between learning efficiency and data privacy in the context of big data. The authors explore two scenarios where organizations can collaborate in the learning process while protecting their privacy. They propose protocols that allow a service provider to assist others in improving their predictive performance without the need for central coordination. The paper demonstrates the applicability of the proposed framework in various learning tasks and shows promising results. The rest of the paper discusses the recent developments in related areas, presents a real-world application, provides theoretical analysis, and presents experimental studies.
