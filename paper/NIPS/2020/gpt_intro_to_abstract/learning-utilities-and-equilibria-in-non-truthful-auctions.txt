Mechanism design is a field that focuses on creating systems in which multiple agents make strategic decisions based on their private preferences. This paper investigates the problem of utility prediction in mechanism design, specifically in the context of auctions. The authors aim to determine how many samples from the type distributions are needed to accurately estimate the interim utilities of agents for any profile of bidding strategies. The study focuses on the First Price Auction (FPA) and the All Pay auction and shows that a small number of samples can be sufficient to learn interim utilities for all monotone bidding strategies. The results provide insights into the sample complexity of utility estimation and have implications for various applications such as online ad auctions and auctions with search costs.
