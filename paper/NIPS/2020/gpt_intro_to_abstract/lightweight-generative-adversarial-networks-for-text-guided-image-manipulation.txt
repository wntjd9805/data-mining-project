The paper introduces a user-friendly method for automatically editing images using natural language descriptions. The goal is to semantically modify parts of an image based on desired visual attributes provided in the text, while preserving text-irrelevant contents. The paper addresses the limitations of previous studies and proposes a lightweight architecture with a word-level discriminator to provide detailed training feedback. The proposed method is evaluated on different datasets and shows superior performance in terms of image quality and efficiency. The code for the method is available on GitHub.
