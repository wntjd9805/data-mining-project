Deep neural networks have achieved significant success in computer vision applications, but their performance heavily relies on labeled datasets, which can be costly to create. Semi-supervised learning methods have emerged as a solution to leverage unlabeled data and reduce the need for labeled samples. In this paper, we propose FixMatch, a simplified yet highly accurate approach that combines consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling. We demonstrate that FixMatch outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SSL benchmarks, achieving 94.93% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 250 labeled examples. Furthermore, we explore the scarce-labels regime and achieve 88.61% accuracy with only 4 labels per class. Our extensive ablation study reveals the key factors contributing to FixMatch's success, and its simplicity allows for a more thorough exploration of hyperparameters and experimental choices.
