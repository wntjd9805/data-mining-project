Metric learning is a popular approach in machine learning that aims to learn a distance measurement to improve classification and similarity search. However, the robustness of metric learning algorithms against adversarial input perturbations has not been widely studied. In this paper, we propose a robust metric learning algorithm that maximizes the minimal adversarial perturbation on each sample. We develop an efficient formulation to lower bound the minimal adversarial perturbation and enable gradient computation. Our algorithm shows improved robustness on both certified and empirical errors in real-world datasets.
