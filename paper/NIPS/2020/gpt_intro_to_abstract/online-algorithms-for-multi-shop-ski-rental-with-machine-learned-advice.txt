Uncertainty and decision-making problems are prevalent in real-world applications, such as choosing to rent or buy a house or deciding which file to execute next in a distributed computing system. Two approaches have been widely studied to address uncertainty: online algorithms and machine learning. Online algorithms are designed without prior knowledge and are evaluated based on their competitive ratio, while machine learning is used to make future predictions. This paper focuses on incorporating machine learning predictions into online algorithms for the multi-shop ski rental problem. The goal is to develop algorithms that are consistent and robust, meaning they perform well with accurate predictions and do not degrade significantly with inaccurate predictions. The paper introduces a novel analytical framework to bridge these two methodologies and presents online algorithms for the multi-shop ski rental problem with consistency and robustness properties. The algorithms are evaluated using both a single machine learning algorithm and multiple machine learning algorithms, and their performance is compared to algorithms without machine learning predictions. The paper provides insights into the benefits of using machine learning predictions and includes detailed proofs in the supplemental material.
