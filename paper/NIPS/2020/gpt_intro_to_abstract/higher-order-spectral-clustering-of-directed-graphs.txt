Clustering is a fundamental problem in algorithms with applications in various research fields. Graph clustering, which involves representing data as a graph, is commonly used to analyze datasets. Most studies on undirected graph clustering have focused on partitioning based on edge densities. However, these algorithms often fail to uncover higher-order structural information in directed graphs. This work aims to study clustering algorithms for directed graphs, where the cluster structure is defined by both edge densities and directions. The authors propose a flow ratio-based approach and demonstrate its effectiveness through experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets. The analysis of the proposed approach combines elements from the Cheeger inequality, spectral clustering for undirected graphs, and recent work on graph sparsification. The authors believe that their analysis of the new Hermitian Laplacian matrix could inspire future research in studying higher-order structures of clusters using spectral methods.
