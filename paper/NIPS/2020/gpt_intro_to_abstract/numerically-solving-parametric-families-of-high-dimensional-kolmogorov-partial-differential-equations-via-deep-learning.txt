Linear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) of the form 2 Trace (cid:0)σγ[σγ]∗∇2 (cid:1) + (cid:104)µγ, ∇xuγ(cid:105), ∂uγ ∂t = 1 xuγ uγ(x, 0) = ϕγ(x), (1) are referred to as Kolmogorov PDEs, see [23] for a thorough study of their mathematical properties. Kolmogorov PDEs frequently appear in applications in various scientific disciplines and are of high interest for applied scientists. However, they cannot be solved explicitly, and standard numerical solution algorithms suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning algorithm capable of numerically approximating the solutions of a family of γ-parametrized Kolmogorov PDEs. Our algorithm does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and we theoretically investigate the associated approximation and generalization errors.
