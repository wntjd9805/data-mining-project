Hyperbolic spaces have gained attention for their ability to represent hierarchical data in a compact manner compared to Euclidean spaces. While research has focused on efficient hyperbolic embeddings for large-scale datasets, the benefits of hyperbolic spaces for downstream tasks, like classification, remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose algorithms to learn large-margin classifiers in hyperbolic space and demonstrate their superiority over classifiers learned in Euclidean space. We introduce a hyperbolic perceptron algorithm and show its convergence for separable data, establish the effectiveness of injecting adversarial examples for efficient classifier learning, and analyze the trade-off between embedding dimensions and distortion for hierarchical data. These contributions highlight the potential advantages of leveraging the intrinsic geometry of hyperbolic space for performance improvements in classification tasks.
