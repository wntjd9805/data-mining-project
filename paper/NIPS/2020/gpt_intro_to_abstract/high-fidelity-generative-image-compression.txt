The paper introduces the problem of lossy image compression and the challenges faced by various algorithms in preserving visual quality as the compression factor increases. The authors discuss the weaknesses of existing distortion metrics and propose the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to improve perceptual quality. They present their approach, HiFiC, which achieves high-quality reconstructions close to the input and outperforms previous methods in a user study. The authors also evaluate their approach using multiple perceptual metrics and analyze the performance of their architecture and components.
