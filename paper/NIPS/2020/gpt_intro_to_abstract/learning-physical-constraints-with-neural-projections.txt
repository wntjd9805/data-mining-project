This paper introduces a new approach to characterizing classical physical systems using neural predictors to learn and enforce underlying physical constraints. The paper proposes a neural projection operator that maps the system's current states to a low-dimensional constraint manifold satisfying the defined constraints. The projection operator is trained using positional states of the system observed over a certain range of time frames. The authors argue that learning constraints has computational merits, as constraints relate to human's physical perception and can be encoded intuitively in neural networks. Additionally, constraints describe system-level relations without requiring connectivity priors, which is important for complicated interactions with an uncertain number of primitives. The time-independent nature of constraints makes them easy to reason with position information only, reducing the data requirements for training. Enforcing constraints in a numerical simulator is numerically stable and allows for reliable long-term predictions.
