There has been a growing interest in using Hawkes processes networks to model discrete events data in various fields. Existing works focus on point estimators for recovering the network structure, but they lack uncertainty quantification. This paper tackles the issue by studying uncertainty quantification for maximum likelihood estimates of multivariate Hawkes processes over networks. The goal is to accurately recover the underlying structure between nodes and provide upper and lower confidence intervals for the influence coefficients. The authors propose a non-asymptotic approach using continuous-time martingales to establish a confidence polyhedral set, which is more accurate than classic asymptotic confidence intervals. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through comparisons with synthetic neural activity data. The main contributions of the paper are the non-asymptotic confidence set for the maximum likelihood estimate and its efficiency in solving confidence intervals as a linear program.
