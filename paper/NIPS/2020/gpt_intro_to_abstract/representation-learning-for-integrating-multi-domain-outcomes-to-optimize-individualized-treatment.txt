This paper presents an integrated framework for representing patients' latent mental states based on observed psychological measurements in order to optimize individualized treatment policy for mental disorders. The limitations of using a simple summary score are discussed, and the benefits of leveraging measurement models to capture underlying constructs are highlighted. The proposed model incorporates pre- and post-treatment measurements and uses a multi-layer neural network to model the treatment effect mechanism. Optimal treatment policy can be inferred for future patients based on their pre-treatment measurements, utilizing data from randomized controlled trials. The potential for learning treatment rules from observational data is also discussed.
