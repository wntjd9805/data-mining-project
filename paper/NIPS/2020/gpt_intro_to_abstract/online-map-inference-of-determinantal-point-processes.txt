Probabilistic modeling and complex inference techniques have become essential in machine learning, requiring fast sampling and computationally efficient inference. Determinantal point processes (DPPs) have emerged as elegant probabilistic models that provide efficient sampling, marginalization, and conditioning. DPPs have found various applications in machine learning, particularly in data summarization, multi-label classification, and recommender systems. This paper focuses on the online model, which processes data points as they arrive and maintains a consistent and stable solution. The goal is to develop algorithms with independent space and time complexity per vector, achieving competitive approximation ratios with the best known streaming algorithms. The paper proposes an online variant of local search and an algorithm called ONLINE-DPP, both achieving favorable results in experiments. The algorithms also control the amount of solution changes throughout the stream.
