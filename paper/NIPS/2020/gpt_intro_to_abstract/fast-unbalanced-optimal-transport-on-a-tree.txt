The optimal transport (OT) distance is widely used in various fields, such as image processing, natural language processing, biology, and generative models. However, a major limitation of OT is its inability to handle measures with different total mass. This paper presents a unified framework called the generalized Kantorovich Rubinstein (GKR) distance to address this issue. The GKR distance allows for the comparison of measures with different masses and is resistant to noise. The paper also introduces a efficient algorithm to compute the GKR distance in tree metrics, which solves many existing unbalanced OT problems efficiently. The contributions of this paper include the proposal of the GKR distance framework, a hardness result for existing unbalanced OT problems, and an efficient algorithm for the GKR distance in tree metrics.
