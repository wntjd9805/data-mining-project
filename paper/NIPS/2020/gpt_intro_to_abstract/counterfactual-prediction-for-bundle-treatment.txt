Accurately predicting the counterfactual outcome of different treatments is crucial in various domains such as healthcare and marketing. Among the different treatment forms, bundle treatment, represented as a high-dimensional binary vector, is widely used in real-world scenarios like recommendation systems. However, a challenge in predicting outcomes is the confounding bias, where the treatment assignment is correlated with factors that can affect outcomes. This bias can lead to a discrepancy in the distribution of observational data and randomly assigned treatments. To address this, previous studies have focused on single treatment settings, but not bundle treatment. In this paper, we propose the variational sample re-weighting (VSR) algorithm, which utilizes the latent structure of bundle treatments to remove confounding bias. We employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn the latent representations of treatments and use deep neural networks for density ratio estimation to decorrelate the confounders and latent representations. By re-weighting the samples based on these density ratios, we reduce the confounding bias and achieve more accurate counterfactual outcome estimation. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed VSR algorithm.
