Clustering is a fundamental problem in data science, particularly in the early stages of knowledge discovery. This paper focuses on a binary clustering problem where the data is derived from a mixture distribution consisting of two elliptical distributions. The goal is to estimate the true labels of the data samples and create a classifier with out-of-sample extension for predicting labels of future samples. The paper introduces a method called "Clustering via Uncoupled Regression" (CURE) that uses optimization techniques to minimize the discrepancy between predictions and true labels. The authors propose a loss function and analyze the geometric properties of the empirical loss function. An efficient algorithm is developed to achieve near-optimal statistical precision. The paper also discusses the potential applications and benefits of the proposed method.
