In this paper, we address the problem of inherent uncertainties in real-world problems and the lack of consideration for different causes of uncertainties, leading to high risks. We introduce the concept of multidimensional uncertainty types and propose an uncertainty-aware framework for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that leverages both deep learning and belief and evidence theory domains. Our framework provides estimation of various uncertainty types, such as dissonance and vacuity, and incorporates a Graph-based Kernel Dirichlet distribution Estimation (GKDE) method to reduce errors in uncertainty quantification. We also provide theoretical analysis on the relationships between different types of uncertainties and demonstrate the performance of our framework through comprehensive experiments on real graph datasets. Results show that dissonance-based detection performs well in misclassification detection and vacuity-based detection excels in out-of-distribution detection.
