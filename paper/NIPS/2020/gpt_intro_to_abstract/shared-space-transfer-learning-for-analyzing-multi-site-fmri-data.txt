The task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a widely used tool in neuroscience to study brain activity during cognitive tasks. Machine learning approaches, such as classification techniques, have been employed to analyze fMRI datasets due to their high dimensionality and noise. However, limited sample size and differences in brain connectomes between subjects pose challenges in training accurate classification models. To address these issues, this paper proposes Shared Space Transfer Learning (SSTL), a novel approach that learns a shared feature space from multi-site fMRI datasets. SSTL utilizes a hierarchical two-step procedure to extract common features and map them to a site-independent shared space, improving the accuracy and robustness of classification models. A scalable optimization algorithm is employed to handle high-dimensional datasets. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of SSTL, and future directions for research are discussed.
