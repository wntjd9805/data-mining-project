The framework of neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) has sparked renewed interest in continuous deep learning, but these models have faced criticism for being slow in both training and inference. Attempts to address these limitations have either given up on the Neural ODE formulation or introduced additional memory requirements. In this paper, we propose the concept of Neural ODE hypersolvers, which are auxiliary neural networks trained to solve the initial value problem of continuous-depth models. We demonstrate that hypersolvers improve computational efficiency and can achieve fast and accurate solutions during inference. We also show significant speedups on image classification tasks and the ability to solve continuous normalizing flow sampling with little degradation in sample quality. The proposed framework is compatible with continual learning and adversarial learning techniques.
