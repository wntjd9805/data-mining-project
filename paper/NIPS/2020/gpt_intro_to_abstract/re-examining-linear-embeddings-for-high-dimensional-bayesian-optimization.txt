Bayesian optimization (BO) is a technique for optimizing black-box functions and has been successfully applied in various applications. One active research topic is extending BO to higher-dimensional spaces, often achieved by considering a high-dimensional BO (HDBO) task as a low-dimensional embedding problem. In this paper, we focus on linear embeddings and re-examine the use of random linear projections for HDBO. We identify limitations of existing approaches and propose improvements to enhance the properties of linear embeddings for BO. We introduce a new linear-embedding HDBO method, ALEBO, and demonstrate its superior performance compared to other techniques in empirical evaluations. The paper provides insights into the factors influencing the performance of linear embedding methods in BO. The code to reproduce the results is available online.
