This paper introduces Graph-Q-SAT, a machine learning-based branching heuristic for Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solvers. SAT is a widely applicable problem in various domains, but solving it is computationally challenging. Most existing solvers use heuristics crafted with domain expertise. However, this paper explores the use of machine learning to improve the existing branching heuristic without relying on domain knowledge. Graph-Q-SAT utilizes a graph representation of SAT problems and employs a Graph Neural Network as a function approximator. The experimental results demonstrate that Graph-Q-SAT outperforms the commonly used CDCL branching heuristic, reducing the number of iterations required to solve SAT problems. The method exhibits generalization capabilities and transfer properties across different problem types and sizes. While more work is needed to apply Graph-Q-SAT in industrial-scale settings, it shows promise for practical applications and achieves improvements even with limited training data.
