This paper introduces a method for identifying new control directions for existing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) without manual supervision or expensive optimization. The method involves applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) in latent space for StyleGAN and feature space for BigGAN to find important directions in the GAN latent spaces. The paper also presents a modification to BigGAN that allows for StyleGAN-like layer-wise style mixing and control. These mechanisms provide powerful controls over various image attributes and offer insights into how the GAN operates. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the method with various GAN models and highlights the importance of interpreting and extending the capabilities of existing GANs.
