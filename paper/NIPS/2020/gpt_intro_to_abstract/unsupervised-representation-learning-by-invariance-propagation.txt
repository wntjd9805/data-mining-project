Deep convolutional neural networks have made significant progress in various computer vision tasks, but their success relies heavily on large-scale annotated datasets, which are difficult to acquire. Unsupervised learning methods have been proposed as an alternative, but they often depend on domain-specific knowledge and have limited generality. In this paper, we introduce Invariance Propagation (InvP), a novel method that incorporates relationships between different instances to learn representations with category-level invariance. InvP uses a k-nearest neighbors graph to propagate local invariance and discover positive samples exhibiting intra-class variations. We also demonstrate a hard sampling strategy to improve the robustness of the learned representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in various downstream tasks such as classification, transfer learning, and object detection.
