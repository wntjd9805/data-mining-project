Understanding the causal relationships between policy choices and social systems is crucial for analyzing their impact. Social scientists rely on field experiments or quasi-experimental variation in observational data to measure these relationships. The estimation approach known as generalized method of moments (GMM) is commonly used but faces limitations due to the assumptions it relies on. This paper explores the application of adaptive non-parametric learners, such as reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, neural networks, and random forests, to GMM estimation problems. The authors propose a new formulation of the problem as an adversarial learning problem, akin to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), where the learner aims to find a model that satisfies all moment conditions, while the adversary tries to identify moments that are violated. They demonstrate that an estimator based on a regularized empirical analogue achieves a projected MSE rate that scales with the critical radius of the function classes considered. The paper presents applications to various hypothesis spaces, including RKHS, sparse linear functions, neural networks, and random forests, and provides optimization algorithms with performance guarantees. Simulation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of different estimators in different scenarios.
