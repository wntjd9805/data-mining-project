This paper introduces Auto-Panoptic, a novel approach for automatically tailoring a robust and high-performing network architecture for panoptic segmentation. Unlike previous work that focuses on specific parts of the network, Auto-Panoptic extends the Network Architecture Search (NAS) paradigm to search for all key components, including the backbone, segmentation branches, and feature fusion module, in a unified pipeline. The proposed approach learns customized intra-modular structures and establishes correlations between foreground objects and background stuff to fully leverage complementary information. Additionally, a path-priority search policy is introduced to reduce searching overhead. The effectiveness of Auto-Panoptic is demonstrated through state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks.
