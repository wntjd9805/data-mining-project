Unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) is a widely explored approach in leveraging source-domain data to make predictions in a new, target domain. This paper focuses on the scenario with multiple source domains, where both the feature vector and label are given. The goal is to find a classifier for the target domain based on the available features. Two common scenarios, covariate shift and conditional shift, are discussed, where the distribution of features or the conditional distribution changes across domains. The paper proposes using augmented Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to factorize the joint distribution and encode the changes in the distribution across domains. Bayesian inference on this graphical model can be used to predict the target-domain labels. The approach provides a framework for addressing the DA problem in an automated, end-to-end manner.
