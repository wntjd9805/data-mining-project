This paper discusses the problem of maintaining accurate predictive models as data arrives over time in the context of continual learning and streaming. The authors propose a replay memory-based approach using coreset construction, which involves maintaining small, weighted subsets of past data. They formulate the coreset selection as a cardinality-constrained bilevel optimization problem and solve it using greedy forward selection via matching pursuit. The method is shown to be effective for replay memory-based continual learning and streaming with neural networks. The paper includes an extensive empirical study and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
