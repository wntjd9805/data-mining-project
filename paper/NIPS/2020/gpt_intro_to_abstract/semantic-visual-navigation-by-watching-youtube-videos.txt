This paper introduces a novel approach to learning semantic cues for navigation by leveraging YouTube videos of indoor spaces. Unlike traditional learning from demonstration methods, the videos do not come with action labels or known goals and intents. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose a formulation called Value Learning from Videos (VLV), which uses pseudo action labels obtained from an inverse model and employs Q-learning to learn from pseudo-labeled video sequences. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by achieving superior performance compared to reinforcement learning and imitation learning methods. Overall, this work provides a more direct and efficient way of learning semantic cues for navigation in novel environments.
