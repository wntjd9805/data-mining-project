This paper introduces a framework called AttendLight for learning a general traffic control policy that can be deployed in any intersection. The goal is to address the limitations of current methods that require redesigning and retraining for each individual intersection. The AttendLight framework utilizes attentional mechanisms to create a "universal" model that can be used for any intersection configuration. The paper demonstrates that AttendLight outperforms conventional controls and other RL-based methods.
