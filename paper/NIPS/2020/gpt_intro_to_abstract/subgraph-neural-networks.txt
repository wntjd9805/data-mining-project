Deep learning on graphs and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular for learning compact representations of interconnected data. However, prevailing methods focus on learning representations for nodes, edges, or entire graphs, and there is limited research on subgraph prediction. Subgraphs present unique challenges due to their varying sizes, higher-order connectivity patterns, localization, and dependencies. In this paper, we introduce SUBGNN2, a novel GNN for subgraph prediction that addresses these challenges. SUBGNN2 propagates messages at the subgraph level using property-aware channels and is capable of operating on new subgraphs in unseen portions of the graph. Experimental results demonstrate that SUBGNN2 outperforms baselines significantly on synthetic and real-world datasets, showcasing its potential for subgraph prediction in various domains. We also provide synthetic and real-world datasets to evaluate subgraph topology.
