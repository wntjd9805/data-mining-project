Accurate prediction of 3D geometries for flexible molecules is a challenging problem in computational chemistry with significant implications for drug design, biopolymer research, and QSAR analysis. The exponential growth in possible conformers as molecule size increases makes brute force approaches infeasible. This paper focuses on the problem of conformer generation and introduces TorsionNet, a conformer search technique based on reinforcement learning. The authors argue that posing conformer search as a reinforcement learning problem has advantages over other formulations and employ curriculum learning to gradually increase the difficulty of the task. TorsionNet outperforms chemoinformatic methods in small and medium-sized alkanes and demonstrates significantly improved performance in large lignin polymers compared to computationally intensive methods like Self-Guided MD. The authors also show that TorsionNet has learned to detect important conformational regions.
