This paper addresses the problem of finding a saddle-point solution to a min-max problem with a general objective function in the context of stochastic algorithms. The focus is on two classes of problems: strongly-convex strongly-concave (SCSC) and weakly-convex strongly-concave (WCSC). Despite the extensive study of stochastic algorithms for convex-concave min-max problems, research for SCSC problems lags behind. This paper introduces the Epoch-GDA algorithm, a primal-dual variant of Epoch-GD, and proves its convergence rate of O(1/T) for the duality gap in SCSC problems. The paper also shows that the algorithm can be adapted for WCSC problems, providing a nearly optimal complexity for solving these problems without assuming smoothness of the objective function. The results are compared with existing works in Table 1.
