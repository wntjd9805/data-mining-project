In this paper, we address the problem of stationary kernel functions in kernel-based learners and propose a method for nonstationary kernel learning using sparse spectral kernel representations. We highlight the limitations of restrictive stationary assumptions and the need for nonstationary nuances in various real-world applications. We introduce a formulation for a locally affine stochastic transform to model the nonstationary patterns, and we utilize sparse spectrum Gaussian processes to represent the measure-valued warpings. Our contributions include a new method for learning nonstationary Gaussian process models through input warping, the introduction of the sparse spectrum warped input measures (SSWIM) approach, a self-supervised training scheme for representing the warping function, and an extension to multiple levels of warping through moment propagation.
