This paper introduces GROVER (Graph Representation frOm self-superVised mEssage passing tRansformer), a novel molecular representation framework that improves the pre-training model for molecular graphs. By incorporating self-supervised tasks at the node/edge and graph levels, GROVER learns rich structural and semantic information from unlabelled molecular data. GROVER integrates Message Passing Networks with a Transformer-style architecture to encode complex information efficiently. Pre-training GROVER with 100 million parameters on 10 million unlabelled molecules yields superior results on downstream molecular property prediction tasks compared to existing methods, achieving significant relative improvements.
