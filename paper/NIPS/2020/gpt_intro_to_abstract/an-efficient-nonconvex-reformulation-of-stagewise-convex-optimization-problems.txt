This paper focuses on efficient algorithms for a specific class of stage-wise optimization problems. These problems involve minimizing a function subject to a set of constraints, and they have a wide range of applications in various fields including optimal control, Markov decision processes, isotonic regression, and neural network verification. The paper assumes certain properties of the functions involved and the set of feasible solutions. One specific application, neural network verification, is briefly described, highlighting the need for faster methods to solve the associated convex relaxations. Existing methods for solving these relaxations can be time-consuming, hence the importance of developing more efficient algorithms.
