Ensuring fairness in algorithmic decision making models is a crucial task in machine learning. Previous research has focused on designing fair classification algorithms for single decision models. However, in real-world systems, multiple decision models may exist, each potentially introducing or inheriting discrimination. To address this challenge, we propose a simultaneous learning approach that leverages Pearl's structural causal model (SCM) and treats each decision model as a soft intervention. By quantifying fairness as causal effects and formulating fair classification as a constrained optimization problem, we aim to build fair models for all decision making tasks. We introduce surrogate functions to smooth the loss function and constraints, resulting in non-linear combinations. We analyze the excess risk of our loss function and demonstrate that upper bounds exist, regardless of the number of decision models involved.
