The problem of selecting diverse items from a larger collection is an important task in computer science, with applications in summarization and recommendation systems. Determinantal point processes (DPPs) have emerged as a popular approach for modeling diversity in subset selection. This paper introduces a new algorithm, ↵-DPP, which addresses the limitations of existing DPP sampling methods. By utilizing uniform sub-sampling and an efficient reduction from random-size DPPs to fixed-size k-DPPs, the proposed algorithm achieves faster sampling times while still maintaining exactness. Theoretical guarantees and runtime comparisons are provided, demonstrating the effectiveness of the ↵-DPP algorithm.
