DBSCAN is a popular density-based clustering algorithm that has been widely used in machine learning and data mining applications. It is non-parametric and allows clusters to be of arbitrary shape and size. However, it has a worst-case quadratic runtime, which makes it inefficient for large datasets. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, SNG-DBSCAN, that subsamples the edges of the neighborhood graph to extract the desired clustering. We show that our algorithm can achieve competitive performance while consuming significantly fewer resources compared to existing implementations. Our method is effective on both large and small datasets and provides a significant improvement in runtime.
