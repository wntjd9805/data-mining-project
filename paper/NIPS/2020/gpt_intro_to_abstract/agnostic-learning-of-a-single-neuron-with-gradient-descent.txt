This paper investigates the learning of the best possible single neuron that captures the relationship between input and output in a non-convex and non-smooth setting. The authors propose an empirical risk minimization approach using gradient descent and analyze its performance in the agnostic PAC learning setting. They show that the algorithm can find weights with small population risk under certain assumptions on the activation function and the marginal distribution. The main contributions include population risk guarantees for different activation functions and noise conditions, with sample and runtime complexities that are independent of the input dimension. The analysis in this simple setup provides insights into the behavior of more complex neural network models.
