Generic object detection focuses on localizing objects and recognizing their categories using bounding boxes. However, bounding boxes are limited in their ability to represent the irregular boundaries of objects. Instance segmentation, which localizes objects using masks at the pixel level, offers a more precise approach. Existing methods for instance segmentation mostly rely on bounding box segmentation, neglecting pure instance segmentation. This paper aims to address the limitations of the recently proposed SOLO framework by improving mask representation and learning efficiency, increasing resolution for finer mask predictions, and introducing an efficient mask NMS algorithm. The proposed SOLOv2 outperforms other methods in terms of accuracy and speed, making instance segmentation a viable alternative to bounding box detection.
