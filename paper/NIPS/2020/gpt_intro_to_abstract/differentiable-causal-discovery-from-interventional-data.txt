The inference of causal relationships is a fundamental problem in science, and the ability to discover such relationships from data is crucial for taking actions that induce controlled changes in systems. In this paper, we address the problem of data-driven causal discovery and propose an algorithm called Differentiable Causal Discovery with Interventions (DCDI) that can automatically discover causal relationships from data. We aim to learn a causal graphical model (CGM) by leveraging interventional data, which is the outcome of experiments that can alter the system. By using a constrained continuous-optimization framework and expressive density estimators, DCDI can accurately identify the causal relationships in different settings, including imperfect and unknown-target interventions. We provide theoretical guarantees and compare DCDI to state-of-the-art methods in various conditions.
