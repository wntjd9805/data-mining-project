The Gaussian linear dynamical system (GLS) is a well-studied model with various applications in control, navigation, and time-series forecasting. However, practical systems often require more complex non-linear models. Approximate inference methods, such as deterministic and stochastic approaches, have been developed to handle non-linear dynamical systems. Switching Gaussian linear systems (SGLS) provide a solution to the accumulated errors in long-term forecasts but have limitations in modeling flexibility. This paper proposes auxiliary variable recurrent switching Gaussian linear systems (ARSGLS) to address these limitations by incorporating a conditionally linear state-to-switch dependence and a neural network for modeling non-linear emissions. The proposed model achieves improved performance for univariate and multivariate forecasting.
