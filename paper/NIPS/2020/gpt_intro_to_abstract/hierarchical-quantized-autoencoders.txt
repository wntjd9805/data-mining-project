The internet age relies on lossy compression algorithms that transmit information at low bitrates. Traditionally, these algorithms are analyzed through the rate-distortion trade-off, which focuses on minimizing distortions. However, in modern lossy compression, high perceptual quality of reconstructions is often more desirable. In this paper, we investigate the performance of the rate-perception trade-off, particularly in the low-rate regime. We propose a new scheme called the Hierarchical Quantized Autoencoder (HQA) that leverages probabilistic forms of VQ-VAE's commitment and codebook losses to optimize the perception-rate tradeoff. Our experiments show that HQA can produce reconstructions of high perceptual quality at very low rates using simple feedforward decoders, eliminating the need for autoregressive decoders.
