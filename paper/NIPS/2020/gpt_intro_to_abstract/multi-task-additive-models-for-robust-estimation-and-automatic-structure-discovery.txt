This paper proposes a new class of Multi-task Additive Models (MAM) that integrate additive hypothesis space, mode-induced metric, and structure-based regularizer into a bilevel learning framework. The proposed MAM aims to achieve robust estimation and data-driven variable structure discovery in the presence of complex non-Gaussian noises. The paper presents the model formulation, an optimization algorithm, and empirical evaluations on simulated and real data to demonstrate the effectiveness of MAM in handling non-Gaussian noise and automatically identifying variable structure. The contributions of this paper include the formulation of MAM as a coherent integration of multiple concepts, the proposed optimization algorithm, and empirical evidence of the effectiveness of MAM.
