Modern convolutional networks (CNNs) have shown improved performance with high-resolution images, but the computational cost and memory footprint associated with these images can be prohibitive. In this paper, we propose a two-stage framework called Glance and Focus Network (GFNet) to address this issue. GFNet dynamically identifies class-discriminative regions within an image and selectively allocates computation to these regions, reducing spatial redundancy without sacrificing accuracy. The framework consists of a glance step, which quickly processes the full image, and a focus stage, which iteratively localizes and processes the discriminative regions. Our method achieves significant improvements in computational efficiency without compromising accuracy, allowing for more resource-efficient image classification tasks.
