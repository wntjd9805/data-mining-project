In this paper, we introduce the Community Hawkes Independent Pairs (CHIP) model, which is a novel approach for modeling timestamped relational event data in dynamic networks. We compare our model to existing continuous-time network models and show that the CHIP model provides better fits to real datasets and can scale to larger networks. We also propose consistent and computationally efficient estimators for the model parameters. Additionally, we demonstrate through asymptotic analysis that our model achieves accurate estimation, making it practical for large networks with tens of thousands of nodes.
