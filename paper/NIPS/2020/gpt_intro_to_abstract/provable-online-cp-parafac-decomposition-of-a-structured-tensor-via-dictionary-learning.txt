This paper introduces the problem of online factorization of structured tensors using the Canonical Polyadic (CP) /PARAFAC decomposition method. The existing methods for tensor factorization suffer from issues such as non-convexity, implicit model selection, and computational expense. The authors propose a fast and scalable algorithm called TensorNOODL that can recover the true CP factors of structured tensors at a linear rate. It overcomes the non-convexity bottleneck and is suitable for large-scale distributed implementations. The algorithm leverages the incoherence assumption on the factors and distributional assumptions to ensure rank-revealing properties and recovery guarantees. The numerical simulations demonstrate its superior performance and applicability to real-world tasks.
