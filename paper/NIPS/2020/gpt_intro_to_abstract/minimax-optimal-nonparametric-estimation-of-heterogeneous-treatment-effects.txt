Causal inference seeks to establish a causal relationship between a treatment and its corresponding effects. With the advent of personalized medicine and the availability of vast amounts of data, the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) has become both meaningful and feasible. While there are practical approaches for estimating HTE, several important theoretical questions remain unanswered. This paper focuses on the Neyman-Rubin potential outcome model and considers the estimation of HTE under various assumptions. The authors aim to characterize the minimax risks of nonparametric HTE estimation under fixed and random designs, taking into account factors such as covariate geometry and parameters of interest. The paper presents the tight minimax rates for these quantities and provides insights into the practical implications of the results.
