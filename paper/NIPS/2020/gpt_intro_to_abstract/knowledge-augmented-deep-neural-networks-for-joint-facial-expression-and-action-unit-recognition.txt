This paper introduces a deep learning framework for performing joint Facial Action Units (AU) detection and Facial Expression Recognition (FER) by leveraging generic knowledge. The authors propose using a Bayesian Network (BN) to capture the relationships among AUs and expressions and formulate BN learning as a constraint optimization problem. The BN is then integrated into a deep learning framework to weakly supervise the learning of an AU detector. The FER and AU detection modules are jointly trained iteratively to improve their learning performance. The results show that the proposed model achieves better performance than pure data-driven models and can generalize well to different datasets without any AU annotations.
