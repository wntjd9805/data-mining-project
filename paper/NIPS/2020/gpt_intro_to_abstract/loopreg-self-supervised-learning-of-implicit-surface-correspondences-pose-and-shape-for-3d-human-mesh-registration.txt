This paper introduces LoopReg, a novel approach for model-based registration of 3D scans of articulated humans. The goal is to fit a parametric model to the scans in order to complete, edit, and control geometry. Traditional approaches optimize an objective function over scan-to-model correspondences and the parameters of a statistical human model. However, these approaches are susceptible to local minima when there is high variation in pose, shape, and clothing. To overcome this, LoopReg proposes the use of predictors to initialize the latent parameters or correspondences. The paper addresses the limitations of current approaches, such as the need for labeled scans and the non-differentiable steps involved in initialization. LoopReg offers an end-to-end differentiable objective for training the correspondence predictor, allowing self-supervised learning with unlabeled scans. The design of LoopReg includes technical innovations such as a continuous representation for canonical points and an implicit definition of the human surface. The paper demonstrates that LoopReg improves registration accuracy with the addition of more unlabeled data.
