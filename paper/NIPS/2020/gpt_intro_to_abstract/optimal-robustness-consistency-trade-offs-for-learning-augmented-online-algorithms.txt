The paper introduces the concept of using machine learning models to make predictions and optimize algorithmic decisions under uncertainty. While machine learning models have shown impressive predictive ability, there is a concern about their lack of provable worst-case performance guarantees. The paper explores the intersection of machine learning and online algorithms, focusing on the trade-off between prediction accuracy and worst-case performance. Previous works have designed algorithms that perform well when predictions are accurate and have worst-case guarantees, but the extent of this trade-off has not been thoroughly studied. The paper presents optimal results for ski-rental and non-clairvoyant job scheduling problems using machine-learned predictions, providing tight lower bounds on the robustness-consistency trade-off. The results highlight the intrinsic trade-off between good performance under perfect prediction and overall robustness, revealing the challenges in designing learning-augmented online algorithms.
