The development of deep-learning tools for three-dimensional triangular meshes has gained significant attention in computer graphics, vision, and machine learning communities. Meshes, which are more adaptable and compact in representing non-uniform surfaces compared to other 3D geometry representations, provide connectivity information and are compatible with common rendering and processing algorithms. However, the randomness in mesh discretization poses a challenge in shape understanding and object representation. This paper proposes a method called PD-MeshNet that combines graph neural networks and mesh-specific insights to address these limitations. PD-MeshNet incorporates dynamic feature aggregation and task-driven mesh-specific pooling operations, enabling the learning of complex features and abstraction of low-level mesh elements. The proposed method is evaluated in mesh classification and segmentation tasks and demonstrates comparable or superior results to state-of-the-art approaches. The code for PD-MeshNet is publicly available.
