Zero-shot learning is a challenging task that involves recognizing unseen classes without any training samples. This is often encountered in fine-grained recognition problems where certain classes have limited or no training samples. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot learning method that utilizes the compositional structures of classes, allowing us to recognize a large number of classes based on basic attributes such as color, shape, or material. We address the issue of lack of training samples by reusing attributes of seen classes to construct features of unseen classes for training. The existing methods for zero-shot learning either suffer from low diversity or non-discriminative features, making them ineffective for unseen classes. Our method overcomes these limitations by extracting attribute-based features from seen classes and learning to combine them effectively to construct features of unseen classes. We provide several advantages over existing approaches, including the ability to control the composition process, the inclusion of fine-grained details in the features, and the elimination of the need for additional generative models.
