Recurrent neural networks (RNN) are commonly used for sequential data modeling, but they have limitations when applied to irregularly sampled or partially observed data. In this paper, we propose a more elegant approach by incorporating continuous-time modeling using neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs). We introduce the concept of neural controlled differential equations (Neural CDE) as an extension of the Neural ODE model, capable of processing incoming data and trained with memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation. Our empirical studies on various datasets demonstrate that the Neural CDE model achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other ODE or RNN based models. We also provide theoretical results showing the model's universality and its superiority over similar ODE models. The implementation code is available on GitHub.
