Signed networks, which consist of graphs with positive and negative edges, have been extensively studied due to their ability to represent friendly and antagonistic social relationships. However, analyzing these networks poses challenges as traditional algorithms for unsigned networks are not directly applicable. This has led to significant interest in analysis tasks such as network embeddings, clustering, and link prediction in signed networks. In this paper, we focus on the problem of detecting k conflicting groups in signed networks, where each group is internally positively connected and negatively connected to the other groups. This problem is challenging due to the complexity of identifying conflicting groups, which are not simply dense subgraphs, and the presence of neutral nodes in real-world networks. We propose a novel approach, spectral conflicting group detection (SCG), that extends existing formulations and leverages the spectral properties of the Laplacian matrix to optimize the problem. We present two algorithms with approximation guarantees and demonstrate their superior performance compared to existing methods through extensive experiments on synthetic and real datasets. We also discuss the selection of the number of groups in practical scenarios.
