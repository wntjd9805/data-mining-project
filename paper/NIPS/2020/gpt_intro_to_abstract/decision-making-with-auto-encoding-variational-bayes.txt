The auto-encoding variational Bayes (AEVB) algorithm is a popular approach in machine learning for model selection. Variational autoencoders (VAEs), a type of AEVB, have shown impressive performance in tasks like representation learning and image generation. However, using VAEs for decision-making applications is challenging due to the difficulty of computing the relevant functionals of the posterior distribution. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a three-step procedure that combines different inference methods to make decisions with VAEs. The proposed approach is evaluated through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving decision-making performance compared to existing methods.
