This paper introduces the problem of supervision collapse in general-purpose vision systems and explores the use of self-supervision to overcome this issue. The authors propose a novel architecture called CrossTransformers that extends Transformers for few-shot fine-grained classification, focusing on local part-based comparisons and spatial alignment. The contributions of this paper include improving the robustness of local features with a modified version of the SimCLR algorithm, introducing the CrossTransformer network architecture, and achieving state-of-the-art results on various datasets within the Meta-Dataset.
