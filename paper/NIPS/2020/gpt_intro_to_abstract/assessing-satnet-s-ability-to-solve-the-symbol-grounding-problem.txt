Machine learning systems, particularly neural network models, have shown great success in various tasks, surpassing human performance in areas like object recognition, speech recognition, and playing complex games. However, deep learning models have their limitations, such as requiring large amounts of labeled data for training and being susceptible to input perturbations and brittleness in generalization. Critics argue that deep learning systems are essentially advanced pattern matching algorithms and lack the generality of human intelligence. Human intelligence, on the other hand, is characterized by two modes of cognition: System 1, which is fast and effortless, and System 2, which involves deliberate thinking and logical reasoning. To achieve human-level artificial intelligence (AI), it is necessary to combine the pattern recognition of System 1 and the logical reasoning of System 2 in an end-to-end learning manner. This paper examines the capabilities, limitations, and practical solutions for SATNet, a system that integrates logical reasoning within deep learning, with a focus on its performance in solving visual Sudoku puzzles and the symbol grounding problem. The findings highlight the complexities and challenges of achieving end-to-end learning in AI systems and provide practical recommendations for training SATNet layers in deep networks.
