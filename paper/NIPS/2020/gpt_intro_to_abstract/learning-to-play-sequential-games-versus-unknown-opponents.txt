Several real-world problems involve sequential interactions between two parties, which can be modeled as two-player games. In these games, the first player seeks to find the optimal strategy while the second player responds to it. However, complete knowledge of the game is often unavailable, making it more challenging to find a good strategy for the first player. The response function of the second player is typically unknown and can only be inferred through repeated play and observation. This paper explores a repeated sequential game against an unknown opponent with multiple types and proposes a novel algorithm for the learner when facing an adversarially chosen sequence of types. The algorithm learns the opponent's response function online and gradually improves the learner's strategy throughout the game, with no-regret guarantees ensuring convergence to the optimal performance.
