Deep learning techniques have made significant progress in various computer vision tasks. However, overfitting remains a common issue in deep learning algorithms. Data augmentation, which involves applying image transformations to training samples, is a widely used regularization technique. While effective, choosing appropriate augmentation strategies is time-consuming and requires expertise. To address this issue, automatic augmentation techniques have been developed to search for performant strategies. However, these techniques can be computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose an efficient and reliable evaluation process using a proxy task with an Augmentation-wise Weight Sharing (AWS) strategy. Compared to existing methods, our approach produces more reliable evaluations with competitive computational resources. The augmentation policies found by our approach achieve outstanding performance on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, surpassing the state-of-the-art.
