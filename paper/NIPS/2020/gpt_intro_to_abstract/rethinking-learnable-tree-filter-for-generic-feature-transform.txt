In this paper, we introduce the Learnable Tree Filter V2 Module (LTF-V2 module) for more generic feature transform in computer vision tasks. We address the limitations of the previous LTF-V1 module, which had a geometric constraint and non-differentiable construction process. The LTF-V2 module incorporates a learnable unary term and a learnable spanning tree algorithm, allowing for more flexible and effective long-range interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the LTF-V2 module through extensive experiments in object detection, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation, achieving competitive performance with lower resource consumption.
