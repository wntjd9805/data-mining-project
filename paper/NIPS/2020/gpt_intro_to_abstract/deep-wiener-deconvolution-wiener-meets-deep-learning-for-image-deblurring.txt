Image deblurring is a classical image restoration problem that has attracted widespread attention. Traditional methods separate this problem into two phases: blur kernel estimation and image restoration. Convolutional neural networks have shown promising results in image deblurring but existing models for image denoising are not optimized for deblurring. This paper proposes a domain-specific network that integrates a classical deconvolution technique into deep neural networks for non-blind image deblurring. The network incorporates a feature-based Wiener deconvolution and a multi-scale feature refinement module. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling various levels of noise.
