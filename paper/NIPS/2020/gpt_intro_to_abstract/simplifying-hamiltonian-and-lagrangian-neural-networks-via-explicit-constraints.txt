This paper introduces a novel approach to learning Hamiltonians and Lagrangians of physical systems by separating the dual purposes played by generalized coordinates into independent entities: a state represented entirely in Cartesian coordinates and a set of constraints that are explicitly enforced via Lagrange multipliers. The authors demonstrate that embedding problems in Cartesian coordinates simplifies the learning process, resulting in more accurate modeling with significantly less data. They also propose Constrained Hamiltonian Neural Networks (CHNNs) and Constrained Lagrangian Neural Networks (CLNNs) for learning the Hamiltonians and Lagrangians in Cartesian coordinates. The effectiveness of their approach is demonstrated on various complex physical systems, showing significant improvements in accuracy compared to existing models. The code for their experiments is available on GitHub.
