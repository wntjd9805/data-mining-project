Multilabel classification (MLC) problems involve predicting a subset of classes for a given data instance. These problems are encountered in various domains such as recommendation systems, bioinformatics, computer vision, natural language processing, and music. In large-scale MLC problems, the number of labels can be large but the label vectors are typically sparse. The challenges associated with these problems include determining the number of classifiers to train and the latency of predicting the label vector for new instances. This paper addresses these challenges.
