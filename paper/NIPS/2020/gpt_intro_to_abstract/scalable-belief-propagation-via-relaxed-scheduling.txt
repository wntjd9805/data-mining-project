Hardware parallelism has played a crucial role in advancing machine learning by reducing processing time for large datasets. Efforts have been made to develop efficient parallel algorithms for machine learning, particularly for inference on graphical models. Belief propagation is a popular heuristic for graphical model inference, but parallelization of belief propagation remains a challenge. This paper explores the challenges of parallelizing belief propagation and proposes a framework for efficient parallelization using relaxed schedulers. The authors present theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation demonstrating the scalability and performance of their approach. The full version of the paper is available at the provided link.
