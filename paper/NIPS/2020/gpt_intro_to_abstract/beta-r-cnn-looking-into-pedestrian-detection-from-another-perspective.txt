Pedestrian detection is a critical research topic in computer vision with applications in autonomous vehicles, video surveillance, and robotics. While deep convolutional neural networks have made significant progress in pedestrian detection, accurately distinguishing pedestrians in occluded and crowded scenes remains challenging. This paper proposes a novel representation for pedestrians based on a 2D beta distribution, called Beta Representation. By assigning different values to alpha and beta parameters, the shape of the beta distribution can be controlled, making it suitable for representing pedestrians with unpredictable visible patterns. The paper also introduces a new metric, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and a beta-distribution-based non-maximum suppression strategy, named BetaNMS, to improve the performance in distinguishing highly-overlapped instances. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.
