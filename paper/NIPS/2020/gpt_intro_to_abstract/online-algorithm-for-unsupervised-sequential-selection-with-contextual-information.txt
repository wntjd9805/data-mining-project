In this paper, we address the issue of sequential testing protocols becoming inaccurate over time in industrial systems. These systems often utilize a cascade of tests, where new input is first probed by an inexpensive test and then a more expensive one. However, changes in the environment or test calibrations can lead to higher costs. While offline methods exist for training cascades, they require new annotated data collection, which may not be possible in certain scenarios. Therefore, we propose an unsupervised sequential selection method called contextual unsupervised sequential selection (USS) to address this dilemma. We introduce the contextual USS problem, where inputs arrive sequentially and a continuous-valued context is observed. The learner must choose the arm (test/classifier) that leads to the smallest total loss, given the costs of each arm and the mean loss associated with the arm. We also propose a parameterized Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to model the context-conditional disagreement probability between any two arms and validate the model empirically. Our algorithm, based on the principle of optimism, navigates the exploration-exploitation tradeoffs and leads to sub-linear cumulative regret. We validate our approach on synthetic and real datasets.
