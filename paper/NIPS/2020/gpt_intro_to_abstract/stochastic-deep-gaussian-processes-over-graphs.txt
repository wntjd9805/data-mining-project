Gaussian processes (GPs) have gained popularity in the field of machine learning due to their ability to model uncertainties and incorporate expert knowledge through flexible kernel design. However, standard GPs face challenges in scaling to large datasets and have limited expressiveness for complex problems. Recent advancements in deep GPs have overcome these limitations by using sparse approximation techniques. In this paper, we propose Stochastic Deep Gaussian Processes over Graphs (DGPG) as a non-parametric method for modeling relationships on graph-structured domains. We demonstrate the superiority of DGPG in terms of convergence and performance on synthetic and realistic datasets, showing its ability to model uncertainties and learn important features.
