Predictive models based on linear dynamical systems (LDS) have been widely used in various applications in fields such as AI, healthcare, and computer vision. The Kalman filter is commonly used for prediction in LDS when system parameters are known. However, parameter estimation can be challenging and may require solving non-convex optimization problems. In this paper, we focus on constructing LDS predictors without identifying the parameters. We analyze the forecast memory of the Kalman filter and propose a new algorithm, Spectral LDS Improper Predictor (SLIP), that approximates the Kalman filter coefficients using a linear combination of fixed known filters. We show that our algorithm achieves logarithmic regret uniformly for system stability conditions ρ(G) ≤ 1 and ρ(A) ≤ 1, and outperforms existing LDS prediction algorithms in simulations.
