Deep learning has seen significant success in various artificial intelligence tasks, making deep models valuable and potentially vulnerable to intellectual property (IP) infringement. Previous works have focused on adding watermarks to network weights or predictions to protect the IP of deep models. However, these methods are susceptible to ambiguity attacks. In this paper, we propose a passport-aware normalization formulation that adds an extra passport-aware branch during training to protect the IP of deep models without changing the network structure. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through experiments on image and 3D point recognition models, showcasing its robustness against removal attacks and ambiguity attacks. This passport-based method provides IP protection with minimal model performance degradation, making it a valuable approach in deep model IP protection.
