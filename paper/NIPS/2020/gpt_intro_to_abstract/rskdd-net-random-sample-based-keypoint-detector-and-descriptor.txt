In this paper, we address the problem of 3D point cloud registration and introduce our network named Random Sample-based Keypoint Detector and Descriptor Network (RSKDD-Net). We highlight the limitations of existing handcrafted 3D keypoint detectors and descriptors and the lack of ground truth datasets for learning-based methods. We propose a novel random dilation strategy and an attention mechanism to efficiently generate keypoints and descriptors for large-scale point clouds. We also introduce a matching loss for weakly supervised training of the descriptor. Our extensive experiments show that RSKDD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly reduced computation time. Overall, our contributions include the development of a deep learning-based method for joint keypoint detection and descriptor generation, the introduction of the random dilation strategy and attention mechanism to improve performance, and the proposal of an effective matching loss for weakly supervised training.
