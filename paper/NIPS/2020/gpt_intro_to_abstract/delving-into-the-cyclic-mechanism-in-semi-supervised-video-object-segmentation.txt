Video object segmentation (VOS) is gaining attention for its applications in video editing and analysis. Semi-supervised video object segmentation, where a mask is provided in the first frame and the algorithm needs to accurately segment the objects in subsequent frames, is a practical and widely researched scenario. Sequential processing of videos, using information from previous frames, is a natural solution to this problem. However, prediction errors in intermediate frames can mislead the segmentation process. In this paper, we propose a cyclical training and inference approach to mitigate error propagation and improve segmentation accuracy. We incorporate cycle consistency into the training process, design a gradient correction module for online inference, and develop a visualization method to analyze the impact of cyclic training. Our approach achieves competitive results on benchmark datasets and offers improved computation efficiency.
