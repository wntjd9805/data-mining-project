This paper explores the combination of verification and regression methodologies for object localization in neural networks. While verification aligns each feature with the target object, regression is more efficient and can predict continuous target variables. Previous methods combined verification and regression for coarse localization and subsequent refinement, but recent purely regression-based methods have shown competitive performance. The authors examine whether incorporating verification into regression-based methods can enhance performance and propose a fusion approach using auxiliary side-branches. The resulting RepPoints v2 detector achieves improved localization and classification ability, and the approach can be applied to other object detection frameworks.
