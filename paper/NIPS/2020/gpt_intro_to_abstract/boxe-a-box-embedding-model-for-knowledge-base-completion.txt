Knowledge bases (KBs) are widely used in modern information systems to represent, store, and process information. However, KBs are often incomplete, making their use challenging. Knowledge base completion (KBC) is a research focus that aims to automatically infer missing facts in a KB. Existing KBC models have limitations, such as the inability to capture logical rules and handle higher-arity relations. In this paper, we propose BoxE, a spatio-translational box embedding model, that addresses these limitations by representing relations as explicit regions in the embedding space. BoxE achieves state-of-the-art performance on KBC tasks, is fully expressive, and supports the injection of logical rules. We provide comprehensive analyses and evaluations of BoxE's inductive capacity and improvements in KBC performance.
