Sketches and drawings have been fundamental to human civilization for centuries, but teaching machines to generate accurate and contextually appropriate sketches remains a challenge. Previous work has focused on recognizing and generating handwritten text or modeling entire drawings. However, the DiDi dataset, which includes complex structures like diagrams and flow-charts, has proven difficult for existing methods due to the many possible combinations of strokes. In this paper, we propose a novel generative model called CoSE, which factors in both local stroke appearance and global drawing structure. By treating each stroke as an ordered sequence and the entire drawing as an unordered collection of strokes, our model efficiently predicts future strokes. We present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of our model on complex diagrams, flow-charts, sketches, and handwritten text datasets. Additionally, we provide a proof-of-concept interactive demo showcasing the model's predictive capabilities. Our model outperforms existing models and offers insights into the formation of predictions.
