This paper addresses the need for machine learning models to provide explanations for their decisions. The authors propose a learning-based framework that constructs causal explanations by representing and moving within the data distribution. They introduce a generative model that disentangles data aspects and determines their causal influence on the classifier output. The authors emphasize the importance of constructing explanations that respect the data distribution and provide both global and local explanations. The contributions of this work include a new conceptual framework for generating explanations using causal modeling, a generative model, and an evaluation of the method applied to image recognition models.
