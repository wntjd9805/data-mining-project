This paper focuses on the study of two-layer neural networks with a specific non-linearity function. The authors investigate the problem of approximating a target function on a finite data set, also known as the memorization problem. They compare different types of network constructions and their memorization capabilities in terms of the number of neurons and the total weight of the network. The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of a new construction called the harmonic network, which achieves near-optimal memorization size and total weight. The paper also provides a lower bound on the necessary total weight for approximate memorization and discusses the limitations of certain network constructions.
