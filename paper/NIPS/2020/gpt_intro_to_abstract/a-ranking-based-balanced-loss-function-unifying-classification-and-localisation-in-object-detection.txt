Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision that requires optimizing classification and localization objectives. However, the conventional approach of balancing these objectives with a hyperparameter has several drawbacks, including the lack of correlation between tasks and the need for careful tuning. In this paper, we propose a unified loss function called average Localisation Recall Precision (aLRP) Loss to address these issues. We extend the concept of Average Precision (AP) Loss and formulate aLRP Loss as the average of LRP values over positive examples on the Recall-Precision curve. We demonstrate that aLRP Loss effectively balances the two objectives and outperforms existing methods in terms of detection performance. Our method has the advantage of requiring only one hyperparameter and simplifies the training process for object detection.
