Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples and there has been a recent interest in methods to ensure network robustness. This paper focuses on certifiable defense guarantees in the presence of perturbations and introduces certification methods for geometric transformations based on smoothing. Three methods are presented: BASESPT, DISTSPT, and INDIVSPT, each offering different guarantees. The paper's core contributions include a generalization of randomized smoothing, a method for providing distributional and individual guarantees, and an efficient technique for calculating the inverse of an image. The evaluation of these methods on image datasets demonstrates their effectiveness in achieving provable distributional robust accuracy.
