This paper introduces the desparsiﬁed multi-task Lasso (d-MTLasso) for solving the bioelectromagnetic inverse problem in magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) source imaging. The authors propose the d-MTLasso as an extension of the desparsiﬁed Lasso, adapted to the multi-task setting. They also introduce the ensemble of clustered desparsiﬁed multi-task Lasso (ecd-MTLasso), which offers statistical guarantees and allows for a trade-off between spatial speciﬁcity and sensitivity. The authors validate their claims through extensive simulations and empirical results on various MEG datasets, demonstrating the high recovery performance of ecd-MTLasso and its practical beneﬁt of providing a statistically principled way to threshold MEG/EEG source maps.
