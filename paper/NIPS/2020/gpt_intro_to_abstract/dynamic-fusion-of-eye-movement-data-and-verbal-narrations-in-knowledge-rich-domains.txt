In this paper, we propose a phase-aware dynamic Bayesian nonparametric model that fuses human domain expertise and statistical modeling to tackle complex visual-based tasks. We integrate an infinite hidden Markov model with a nested Dirichlet process mixture to capture the spatiotemporal characteristics of eye movements and use the hierarchical Dirichlet process model to fuse verbal narrations. The proposed model reveals the relationship between eye movements and verbal narrations, creates knowledge-centered representations of data, and contributes to the understanding of experts' decision-making process. We also develop a new Split-Merge-Switch sampler for efficient exploration of the posterior state space. Experimental evaluations on diagnostic error prediction and disease morphology categorization demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model and discovered patterns.
