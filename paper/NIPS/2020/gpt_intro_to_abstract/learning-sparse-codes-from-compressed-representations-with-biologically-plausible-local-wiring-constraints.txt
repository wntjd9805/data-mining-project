The paper introduces the concept of unsupervised learning of task-independent representations in sensory systems, specifically through sparse coding. However, existing models of sensory cortices neglect the limited fiber projections between cortical regions. To address this, the paper proposes a theoretical neuroscience model that incorporates randomized projections consistent with local wiring constraints in neuroanatomy. The study demonstrates that unsupervised learning of sparse representations is possible even with significant local wiring constraints, with results that align with measured macaque V1 receptive fields. This application of compressed sensing theory to neural coding models highlights the potential of biologically plausible randomized encodings in capturing complex natural image statistics.
