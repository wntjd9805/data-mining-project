Recently, dense detectors have led the trend of object detection, with a focus on bounding box representation and localization quality estimation. However, existing practices suffer from inconsistent usage of these factors between training and inference, as well as inflexible representation of bounding boxes. To address these problems, we propose a joint representation of classification and localization quality, combining them into a single variable that can be trained and utilized consistently. We also introduce a new representation for bounding boxes, capturing the arbitrary distribution of box locations. To optimize the improved representations, we extend Focal Loss to support continuous IoU labels and propose Generalized Focal Loss (GFL). GFL bridges the gap between training and test, models flexible distributions, and consistently enhances the performance of one-stage detectors. Our experiments demonstrate superior results on COCO test-dev, achieving an AP of 45.0% with ResNet-101 backbone, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches.
