This paper explores the connections between learning and control fields and the complementary benefits they can offer each other. While control theory provides models and structures for efficient algorithms, learning allows for obtaining these models from data. The paper aims to develop a unified framework that integrates learning and control to solve a wide range of tasks, including challenging problems in the field.
