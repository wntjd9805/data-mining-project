Despite the success of deep neural networks, improving their generalization ability remains a challenge. Data augmentation (DA) is a method aimed at enhancing generalization by presenting the predictor with a more comprehensive set of data points during training. This can be achieved through expert-defined transformations or through deep learning techniques. In this paper, we propose an iterative hierarchical data augmentation (IHDA) algorithm for deep networks, which performs augmentation in the feature space. Unlike existing methods, IHDA generates new samples by learning a generative model over the feature space. The algorithm iteratively performs DA in the feature space and uses the augmented data to fine-tune the model's parameters. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that IHDA consistently improves the generalization performance of deep networks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art DA algorithms.
