This paper introduces LA-MCTS, a meta-level algorithm that recursively learns space partition in a hierarchical manner for black-box optimization tasks. LA-MCTS uses unsupervised K-means algorithm to partition the region into good and bad sub-regions based on function values and learns a classifier to classify samples into the appropriate sub-region. It employs UCB to balance exploration and exploitation and uses Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to dynamically exploit and explore promising regions. LA-MCTS extends LaNAS in terms of learning a non-linear decision boundary, using existing solvers for finding promising data points, and achieving strong performance in generic black-box optimization. Experimental results demonstrate that LA-MCTS outperforms state-of-the-art solvers in various benchmarks. The implementation of LA-MCTS is available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/LaMCTS.
