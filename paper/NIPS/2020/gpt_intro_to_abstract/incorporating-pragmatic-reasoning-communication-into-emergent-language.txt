In this paper, we explore the concept of language as a social coordination system and the potential for using referential games to model language learning. While previous work has focused on long-term language evolution, we propose integrated models that consider both long-term habits and short-term equilibrium finding. Our models draw on psychological game theory and incorporate opponent-aware pragmatic reasoning to improve communication accuracy. We conduct experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of different pragmatic models in referential game settings and a StarCraft II simulation.
