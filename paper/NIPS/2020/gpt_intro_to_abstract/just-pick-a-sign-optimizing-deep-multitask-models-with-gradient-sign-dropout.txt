Deep neural networks have greatly advanced the field of high-dimensional nonlinear problems by relying on gradients for optimization. However, previous research has overlooked the important detail that most gradient signals are sums of smaller signals, often corresponding to multiple losses. This paper introduces Gradient Sign Dropout (GradDrop), a method that addresses this issue by selecting gradient signs based on their distribution and masking out conflicting gradients. The motivation behind GradDrop is to find joint minima for all losses by introducing stochasticity and improving model robustness. The contributions of this paper include the presentation of GradDrop as a modular layer, theoretical analysis and simulations showing its superiority over naive gradient descent algorithms, and demonstrations of its effectiveness in multitask learning, transfer learning, and complex single-task models.
