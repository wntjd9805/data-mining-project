The Exponential Mechanism is commonly used in differential privacy and plays a crucial role in various differentially private mechanisms. Implementing these mechanisms often involves sampling from a distribution given by exp(−f), which becomes challenging when the domain is large or infinite. This sampling problem is not new and has been tackled using heuristic MCMC samplers. However, these samplers may not guarantee differential privacy. In this paper, we address the problem of sampling from a log-concave distribution and establish rapid mixing in Rényi divergence for discrete Langevin dynamics. We use a novel approach that borrows tools from differential privacy and upper bound the Rényi divergence between the output of the discrete algorithm and the target distribution. This allows us to design more efficient differentially private algorithms for sampling. Our results apply to log-smooth and strongly log-concave distributions and can be extended to underdamped Langevin dynamics. We also show how our methods can be applied to implement mechanisms in previous work.
