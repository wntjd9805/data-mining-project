The introduction of this paper discusses the contextual bandit setting and its relevance in various real-world applications, such as recommendation systems. It highlights the limitations of linear representations in solving more complex problems and the use of offline nonlinear feature extraction techniques, which can ignore uncertainties introduced by the feature extraction component. The paper also discusses recent advances in posterior approximation for deep networks and count-based approaches for exploration. The authors propose a new online contextual bandit algorithm that combines scalable non-linear action-value estimation with a notion of hash-based pseudocounts. They introduce a Gated Linear Network (GLN) with half-space gating for action-value estimation and exploit the connection between half-space gating and SimHash variant of locality-sensitivity hashing for exploration. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their method through empirical experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets.
