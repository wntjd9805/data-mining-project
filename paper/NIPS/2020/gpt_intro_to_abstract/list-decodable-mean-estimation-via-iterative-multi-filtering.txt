1.1 Introduction: This paper focuses on the development of an answer format that exclusively produces introduction sections. By leveraging computational techniques and natural language processing (NLP), the proposed approach aims to simplify the generation of introduction paragraphs, facilitating the writing process for researchers and students. The output of this answer format has the potential to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of academic writing, while saving valuable time and effort. In this paper, we present the design, implementation, and evaluation of the answer format, showcasing its effectiveness and applicability across various domains of computer science research.
