Generating novel drug molecules with multiple desirable properties is a challenging task in drug discovery. Traditional methods rely on rational design, but automated machine learning techniques are becoming popular. However, designing drug candidates for novel targets and accounting for off-target selectivity remain difficult. In this paper, we propose Controlled Generation of Molecules (CogMol), an alternative method that considers target speciﬁcity and selectivity. CogMol includes a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn a latent space of molecules, a protein-molecule binding afﬁnity regressor, and an efﬁcient sampling scheme. CogMol also incorporates in silico screening protocols for toxicity prediction, synthetic feasibility, and blind docking simulations. We apply CogMol to generate candidate molecules for SARS-CoV-2 and a cancer target, resulting in generated molecules with high predicted target afﬁnity and selectivity, favorable binding to target structures, synthetic practicality, and low predicted toxicity. This framework offers a faster and less costly approach to in silico drug design.
