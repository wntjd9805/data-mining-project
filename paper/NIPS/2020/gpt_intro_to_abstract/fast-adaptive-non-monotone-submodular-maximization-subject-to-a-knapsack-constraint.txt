Constrained submodular maximization is a fundamental problem in discrete optimization, capturing the concept of diminishing returns in various real-world scenarios. Extensive research has been conducted in this area, particularly focusing on handling large datasets in modern applications. This paper introduces a new algorithm, SAMPLEGREEDY, that addresses the challenges of non-monotone submodular maximization under a knapsack constraint. The algorithm incorporates randomization, resulting in improved theoretical guarantees and practical performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAMPLEGREEDY in video recommendation and inï¬‚uence-and-exploit marketing applications. Additionally, the paper introduces ADAPTIVEGREEDY, an adaptation of the algorithm for the adaptive submodular maximization framework. Both algorithms provide significant advancements in handling stochastic objectives and scaling to large instances.
