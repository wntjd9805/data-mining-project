Single image super-resolution (SISR) aims to recover high-resolution (HR) details from low-resolution (LR) observations, which is an ill-posed problem due to multiple HR solutions for a given LR input. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been proposed to learn mappings between LR and HR images by capturing useful priors. However, these methods often struggle to recover detailed textures, especially with large up-scaling factors. In addition to external training data, internal image-specific information has also been studied, such as capturing correlations among non-local self-similar patches. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a cross-scale internal graph neural network (IGNN) that leverages the cross-scale patch recurrence property. The IGNN constructs a graph structure based on the similarity-weighted connection between patches at different scales and performs patch aggregation to effectively explore cross-scale recurrence. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IGNN outperforms state-of-the-art SR methods, highlighting the utility of cross-scale graph convolution for image super-resolution.
