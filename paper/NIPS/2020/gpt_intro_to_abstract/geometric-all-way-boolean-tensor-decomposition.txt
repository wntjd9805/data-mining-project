In this study, we propose an efficient Boolean tensor decomposition (BTD) algorithm called GETF (Geometric Expansion for all-order Tensor Factorization). BTD factorizes a binary tensor into the Boolean sum of multiple rank 1 tensors. Our algorithm is the first to efficiently handle all-order Boolean tensor decomposition with an O(n) complexity, where n represents the total number of entries in a tensor. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the high accuracy and improved efficiency of GETF compared to existing methods. Additionally, GETF has the potential to be used in large-scale or high order data applications.
