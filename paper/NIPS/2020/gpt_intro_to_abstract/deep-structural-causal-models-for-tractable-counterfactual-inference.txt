This paper introduces the integration of causal inference methods into deep learning (DL) research. The authors highlight the importance of causality in answering causal questions and addressing limitations of DL methods, such as spurious correlations and vulnerability to changes in input distribution. They propose a unified framework for structural causal models using modular deep mechanisms and efficient approaches for counterfactual inference. The paper includes case studies demonstrating the practical utility of their framework in answering counterfactual questions. The authors also compare their work to recent progress in deep causal learning and apply deep structural causal models to a synthetic experiment and modeling brain MRI scans.
