Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various applications but suffer from limited robustness. Researchers have developed techniques to verify the robustness of DNNs, but scalability remains a challenge. Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) offer an alternative with faster inference speed and exact verifiability. However, BNN verification has faced scalability issues. In this paper, we present EEV, a system for efficient and exact verification of BNNs. We introduce a novel SAT solver and training strategies that enhance robustness and verification efficiency. Our experimental results demonstrate that EEV achieves orders of magnitude faster verification with comparable accuracy compared to real-valued networks. We contribute several new techniques to improve the performance and complexity of BNN verification.
