In this paper, we address the challenge of assembling IKEA furniture without relying on traditional guidance such as instruction manuals or videos. We propose a dynamic graph learning framework that predicts the pose of each part in the assembly process. Our method utilizes a graph neural network to refine part pose estimations iteratively, allowing for a coarse-to-fine assembly approach. We evaluate our approach on the PartNet dataset, as real-world data for 3D part assembly is scarce. We compare our method to three strong baselines and demonstrate its superior performance. We also observe that central parts in the assembly learn faster than peripheral parts, suggesting the effectiveness of our dynamic graph learning framework.
