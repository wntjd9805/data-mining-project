In this paper, we explore the extraction of behaviorally-relevant features in the brain's sensory processing stages. Early stages, like the retina, are modeled by unsupervised learning algorithms, while subsequent processing in cortical circuits is guided by instructive signals from other cortical areas. We discuss the success of unsupervised models in bridging the features of biological neural networks with computational tasks and experimental observations. We then propose a model for cortical processing that uses feedforward sensory input and instructive signals to modulate projections. We adopt the normative approach and propose two Reduced-Rank Regression objectives for learning the projections. Additionally, we outline the criteria for a viable brain function model, including real-time processing and local synaptic learning rules. Finally, we present our contributions, which include novel algorithms, implementation in biologically plausible neural networks, and numerical demonstrations of competitive performance.
