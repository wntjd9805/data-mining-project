This work focuses on solving generic inverse problems, where the task is to find an inverse model that can accurately estimate the unobserved signal of interest given measurable data. While previous approaches have utilized deep learning techniques to approximate the inverse model, this study introduces the Neural Adjoint (NA) method, which involves training a neural network to approximate the forward model and utilizing the partial derivative of the network to navigate towards locally optimal solutions. The NA method is found to outperform other models in terms of accuracy, albeit with increased computation time. The paper presents a comprehensive benchmark comparison of five modern inverse models on multiple tasks, highlighting the importance of the number of samples considered in the search process. Additionally, a new benchmark task for meta-material design is introduced, along with a strategy for creating simplified simulators to facilitate replication of the study. The code for all inverse models and simulation software is made available for easy reproduction of the experiments.
