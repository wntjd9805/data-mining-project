Analyzing functional neuroimaging studies presents a challenge due to the large amount of data and limited statistical power. This paper introduces Neural Topographic Factor Analysis (NTFA), a generative model that addresses this challenge by representing variations among participants and stimuli. NTFA offers advantages over other dimensionality reduction methods by factorizing the generative contributions of participants and stimuli and providing uncertainty measures. The model is evaluated on synthetic and real datasets, showing its ability to recover underlying cluster structure and capture differences in neural response patterns. Additionally, NTFA outperforms other methods in predictive performance on held-out data. This work contributes to both machine learning and cognitive neuroscience fields by providing a novel approach for whole-brain analysis and characterizing individual variation.
