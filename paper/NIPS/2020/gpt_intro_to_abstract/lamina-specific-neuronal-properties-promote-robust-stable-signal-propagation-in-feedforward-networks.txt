Understanding how different cell types contribute to signal processing in neural circuits is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Advances in observing and manipulating neurons based on their genetic signatures have led to an increase in experimental investigations on this topic, particularly focusing on feedforward circuits. In many neural systems, feedforward circuits consist of layers with distinct properties, such as size, morphology, and expression of membrane/intracellular mechanisms. This paper addresses the role of intrinsic properties and their laminar specificity in signal transmission through feedforward neural networks. The authors introduce a computational model that includes lamina-specific intrinsic properties in neurons and demonstrate how these properties contribute to robust and stable signal and information transmission. The model is applied to a Drosophila antennal lobe network and extended to a deep feedforward network, showing improved information transmission compared to models without laminar specificity. The findings highlight the importance of considering neuronal heterogeneity in theoretical and computational studies.
