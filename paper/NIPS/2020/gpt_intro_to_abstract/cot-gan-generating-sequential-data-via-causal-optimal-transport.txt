This paper addresses the challenge of training implicit generative models (IGMs) on dynamical data, which is a complex and unsupervised learning problem. Previous approaches have separated the model or loss into static and dynamic components, but this paper introduces a new adversarial objective that incorporates optimal transport (OT) theory and causality constraints. The proposed framework, Causal Optimal Transport GAN (COT-GAN), outperforms existing methods in synthesizing realistic dynamical data across various datasets.
