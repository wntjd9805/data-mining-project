Time series forecasting is widely used in business and industrial decision-making, but classical approaches like ARIMA or exponential smoothing are ineffective for predicting complex time series data. To address this, deep neural networks have been applied, but they often optimize a single objective and suffer from error accumulation. In this paper, we propose Adversarial Sparse Transformer (AST) for multiple time series forecasting, which combines a modified Transformer and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). AST utilizes a discriminator to regularize the Transformer at the sequence level, alleviating error accumulation and improving performance. Our contributions include the effective AST model and the Generative Adversarial Encoder-Decoder framework, which enhances robustness and generalization. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
