Shape completion plays a significant role in applications such as 3D data scanning, acquisition, and robot navigation. It aims to fill in missing information and complete the geometries of objects based on partial observations, such as point clouds captured under various conditions. Unlike image completion, which has been well addressed using CNN-based approaches, point clouds present challenges due to their inherent irregularity and sparseness. Deep learning methods have been used to tackle shape completion using different representations such as points, voxels, and implicit fields. However, voxel and implicit field methods have limitations in preserving surface information and generating accurate results for complex structures. In this paper, we propose a new completion manner called SK-PCN that leverages the meso-skeleton representation to preserve shape structure, and bridges partial scans to complete surfaces. We design the SK-PCN network to aggregate multi-resolution shape details and select contributive features from the global surface space for shape completion. We also introduce a local refinement module to fine-tune the results using the original scan. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
