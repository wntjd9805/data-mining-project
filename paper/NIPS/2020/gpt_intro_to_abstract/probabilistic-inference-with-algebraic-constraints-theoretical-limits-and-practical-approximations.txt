In this paper, we address the challenge of performing probabilistic inference in constrained and hybrid scenarios, such as those encountered by autonomous agents in real-world settings. Existing probabilistic models, such as variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks, are limited in their ability to handle complex algebraic constraints and make simplistic assumptions. We propose a framework called Weighted Model Integration (WMI), which supports general hybrid probabilistic reasoning over algebraic constraints. We contribute to the WMI framework by deepening the theoretical understanding of its complexity and delivering an efficient and accurate approximate WMI solver. We also introduce ReCoIn, a practical algorithmic solution that extends the relax-compensate-and-recover framework for approximate inference. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCoIn is a promising alternative in terms of scalability and accuracy. The paper is organized as follows: we provide necessary background in Section 2, present theoretical results in Section 3, introduce ReCoIn in Section 4, discuss related work in Section 5, and evaluate ReCoIn in Section 6.
