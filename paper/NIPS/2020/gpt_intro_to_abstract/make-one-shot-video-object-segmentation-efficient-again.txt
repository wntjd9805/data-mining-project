This paper introduces a variant of video object segmentation (VOS) that is semi-supervised at test time. The authors address the shortcomings of existing fine-tuning methods for VOS by proposing a more efficient approach called e-OSVOS. The key design choices of e-OSVOS include learning the model initialization, optimizing neuron-level learning rates, and optimizing the model with object detection. These improvements result in state-of-the-art segmentation performance on multiple benchmarks with lower test runtimes. The authors hope that these results will inspire further research in semi-supervised VOS using fine-tuning methods.
