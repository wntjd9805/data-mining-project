Undirected graphical models, also known as Markov random fields, have been widely used in various domains to discover and visualize dependencies among variables in multivariate data. While recent research has shown that it is possible to learn such models even with a limited number of samples, these studies assume clean data without any corruptions. However, modern datasets are often collected in decentralized and distributed manners, leading to the presence of outliers and adversarial manipulations. The �-contamination model has been proposed as a framework to study datasets with arbitrary corruptions. In this model, the goal is to recover functionals of the true distribution from samples drawn from a mixture of the true distribution and an arbitrary distribution. Previous work has focused on estimators in the �-contamination model, but there are no known results for learning general graphical models robustly.
