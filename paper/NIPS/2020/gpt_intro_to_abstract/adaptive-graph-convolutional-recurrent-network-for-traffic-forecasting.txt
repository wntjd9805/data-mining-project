The rapid urbanization in cities has presented challenges for transportation systems, leading to increased research in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). Trafﬁc forecasting, a crucial aspect of ITS, aims to predict the future status of urban trafﬁc systems. Traditional methods are limited in capturing complex spatial-temporal patterns, leading researchers to explore deep-learning-based methods. However, current methods fail to accurately capture fine-grained data-source specific patterns and rely on pre-defined inter-connection graphs. In this paper, we propose two mechanisms, Node Adaptive Parameter Learning (NAPL) and Data Adaptive Graph Generation (DAGG), to address these limitations. These mechanisms are combined with recurrent networks to create the Adaptive Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network (AGCRN). Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of AGCRN compared to state-of-the-art methods.
