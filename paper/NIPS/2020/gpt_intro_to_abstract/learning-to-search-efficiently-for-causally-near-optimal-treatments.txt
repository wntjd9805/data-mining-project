Finding an effective treatment for patients often involves a trial-and-error process that can span several years, leading to patient suffering and delayed relief. In this paper, we formalize the search for effective treatments as a policy optimization problem in an unknown decision process. Our goal is to minimize the number of trials needed to find a near-optimal action with high probability. We assume stationary outcomes for actions and utilize historical observations to improve search efficiency for new patients. We focus on learning search policies that are causally effective, addressing potential confounding and providing transparent constraints on near-optimality. We present dynamic programming and greedy approximation algorithms, and demonstrate their effectiveness in experiments, including an application in antibiotic resistance tests.
