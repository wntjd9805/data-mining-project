Predictive processing is a fundamental principle in neural computations, and the brain uses predictive forward models in the motor domain. Regression, the ability to predict a dependent variable given input variables, is a task that the brain solves while considering uncertainty. This paper proposes the implementation of (sparse) Gaussian process regression ((S)GPR) in the brain and shows how the equations for the Gaussian process can be mapped onto a specific neural network. The paper also presents biologically plausible synaptic learning rules for the network. The tuning curves of neurons in the first layer correspond to the Gaussian process kernel, and output neurons encode the predictive mean and variance of the function being encoded. The paper suggests that the network can be optimized using REINFORCE gradient estimates to avoid biologically implausible error back-propagation.
