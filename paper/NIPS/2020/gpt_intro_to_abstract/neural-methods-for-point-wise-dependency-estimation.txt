This paper introduces neural methods for point-wise dependency (PD) estimation, building on recent work that uses neural networks with gradient descent to estimate mutual information (MI). While previous approaches for estimating PD have been limited to kernel-based methods, this work leverages rich and flexible neural networks to address scalability to high-dimensional and complex-structured data. The authors propose two data-driven approaches—Probabilistic Classifier and Density-Ratio Fitting—for PD estimation, and empirically analyze their advantages in three applications: MI estimation, contrastive self-supervised representation learning, and cross-modal retrieval. The results demonstrate the low variance and bias of the proposed approach compared to prior MI neural estimators and the consistent improvement in representation learning. The experiments and code are publicly available.
