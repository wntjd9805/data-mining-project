Deep neural networks have achieved significant success in computer vision tasks, but they often suffer from overfitting due to being over-parameterized. Regularization and data augmentation techniques have been used to address this issue in image classification. However, these methods are difficult to apply to downstream tasks like object detection and segmentation. This paper introduces Gradient Augmentation (GradAug), a regularization method that generates meaningful disturbances to the gradients of the network itself. Unlike traditional data augmentation, GradAug regularizes the representations learned by a set of sub-networks, leading to a well-generalized and diversified full network representation. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of GradAug in improving accuracy on ImageNet and COCO object detection and segmentation tasks, as well as its robustness to image corruptions and adversarial attacks, and effectiveness in low data settings.
