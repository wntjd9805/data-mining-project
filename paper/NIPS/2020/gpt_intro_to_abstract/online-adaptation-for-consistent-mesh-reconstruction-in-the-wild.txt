This paper addresses the challenging problem of 3D reconstruction of non-rigid objects, particularly animals, from images and videos captured in naturalistic environments. The lack of 3D annotations makes this task difficult, and existing approaches mostly focus on rigid objects or human bodies in constrained environments. The authors propose an image-based network that is trained on a set of images and then adapted online to video inputs through self-supervised objectives. They utilize UV texture space to ensure temporal consistency and introduce an as-rigid-as-possible (ARAP) constraint to allow for non-symmetric poses. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of their approach for reconstructing dynamic non-rigid objects captured in the wild.
