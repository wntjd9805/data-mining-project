This paper explores the use of implicit deep networks, such as Neural ODEs and deep equilibrium models, in pattern recognition tasks, specifically in domains characterized by rich multiscale structure like computer vision. The authors introduce a new class of implicit networks called multiscale deep equilibrium models (MDEQ), which solve for equilibria of multiple resolution streams simultaneously. Unlike explicit deep networks, MDEQ maintains different feature scales side by side in a single "shallow" model. The paper highlights the advantages of MDEQ, including its low memory footprint and the ability to handle multiple losses and tasks. Extensive experiments on large-scale image classification and semantic segmentation datasets demonstrate that MDEQs achieve comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art explicit models while consuming less memory. This represents a significant application of implicit deep learning in real-world domains.
