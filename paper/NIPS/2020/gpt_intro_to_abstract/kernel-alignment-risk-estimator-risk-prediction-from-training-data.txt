Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) is a popular statistical method in machine learning for learning a function from a training set. It is a non-parametric extension of linear regression to infinite-dimensional feature spaces. Despite being widely used, the rigorous analysis of the generalization of kernel methods remains a challenging area of research. This paper introduces the Signal Capture Threshold (SCT) for KRR, which determines the ridge parameter, training set size, kernel, and observation distribution. The paper also explores the relationship between the SCT and the expectation and variance of the KRR predictor, as well as the tradeoff between capturing signal and reducing variance. Additionally, the paper introduces the Kernel Alignment Risk Estimator (KARE) as a measure of risk approximation, which is independent of the data distribution. Experimental results show that the KARE predicts the risk on real-world datasets effectively. The proofs and analysis in the paper build on previous work on generalized Wishart matrices and utilize complex Stieltjes transform and fixed-point arguments.
