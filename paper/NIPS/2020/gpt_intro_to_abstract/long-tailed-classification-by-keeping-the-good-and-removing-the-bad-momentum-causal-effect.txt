In this paper, we address the challenge of long-tailed classification in computer vision and propose a causal framework to explain previous methods and improve performance. We identify momentum in SGD optimizer as a confounder that affects both sample features and classification logits. By removing the momentum effect, we can retain the beneficial inter-relationships between classes while eliminating spurious correlations. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on image classification benchmarks and achieves significant improvements in object detection and instance segmentation.
