Constrained optimization plays a crucial role in various machine learning applications, such as churn reduction and statistical fairness constraints. While most constrained ML problems involve only a small number of constraints, there are cases where an extensive number of constraints are required, such as in intersectional statistical fairness problems. This paper introduces a Lagrangian-model approach, where the Lagrange multipliers are modeled using a set of features. The paper presents theoretical results, suboptimality and infeasibility guarantees, a generalization result for per-query ranking fairness, and an extensive experimental evaluation of highly-constrained settings.
