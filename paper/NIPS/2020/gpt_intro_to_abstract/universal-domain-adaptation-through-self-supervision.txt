This paper addresses the problem of universal domain adaptation (DA) in deep neural networks. Existing DA methods are designed to handle specific category shifts, such as closed-set, open-set, or partial shifts. However, in many real-world scenarios, the target domain may exhibit a mix of these shifts, making it difficult to predict in advance. Additionally, these methods heavily rely on source supervision, making it challenging to obtain discriminative features in the target domain. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Domain Adaptive Neighborhood Clustering via Entropy optimization (DANCE), which utilizes self-supervision and cluster structures in the target domain. DANCE achieves state-of-the-art performance in various category shift settings and can learn discriminative features for "unknown" target samples without any supervision.
