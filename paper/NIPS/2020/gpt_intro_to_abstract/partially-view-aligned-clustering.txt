Data clustering has become a prominent topic in recent years, particularly in the context of multi-view data analysis. Most existing multi-view clustering approaches rely on the assumption of complete and aligned data, which can be limiting in practice. This paper focuses on the problem of partially view-aligned data, where only a portion of the data is aligned across different views. To address this problem, the authors propose a novel neural network that aligns the partially aligned data and learns a common representation. The proposed solution is the first deep learning approach for effectively clustering partially view-aligned data. The contributions of this work include introducing the partially view-aligned problem in multi-view clustering and providing a deep learning solution for addressing it.
