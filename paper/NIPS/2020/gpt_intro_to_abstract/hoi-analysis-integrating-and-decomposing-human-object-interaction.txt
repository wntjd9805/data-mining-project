Human-Object Interaction (HOI) plays a crucial role in human activities, involving the interaction between a human, a verb, and an object. Detecting HOI requires machines to locate and classify these elements. In this paper, we explore two questions regarding the inner structure of HOI and the relationship between two human-object pairs with the same HOI. We study Gestalt psychology and brain mechanisms to understand the composition and encoding of HOI. We propose an Integration-Decomposition Network (IDN) that uses complex nonlinear transformations to integrate and decompose isolated human and object instances. By embedding verbs in transformation function space, IDN effectively models the interaction/verb and achieves state-of-the-art performance in HOI detection. Our contributions include the introduction of HOI Analysis, the development of IDN, and the advancement in HOI detection.
