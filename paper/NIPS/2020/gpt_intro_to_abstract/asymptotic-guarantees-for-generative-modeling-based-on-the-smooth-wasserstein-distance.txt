This paper introduces the concept of Minimum Distance Estimation (MDE) in the context of generative modeling. MDE aims to minimize the statistical distance between an empirical data distribution and a parametric model. The authors propose the use of the smooth 1-Wasserstein distance as the statistical distance measure, as it has desirable properties for generative modeling and is not affected by the curse of dimensionality. The paper presents theoretical analysis, including measurability and consistency proofs, and derives a high-dimensional generalization bound. Empirical results validate the proposed approach. The main technical tool used is a novel high-dimensional limit distribution result for the scaled empirical smooth 1-Wasserstein distance, which may be of independent interest.
