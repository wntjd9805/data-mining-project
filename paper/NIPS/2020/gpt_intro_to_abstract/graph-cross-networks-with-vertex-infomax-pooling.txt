In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the study of graph neural networks (GNNs) for analyzing non-Euclidean graph data like social networks, bioinformatic networks, and human activities. GNNs have shown success in tasks such as vertex classification and graph classification by extracting features from both the graph structure and vertex information. However, most GNN-based methods lack the ability to capture comprehensive graph features due to fixed scale learning. To address this limitation, multiscale feature learning on graphs has been proposed, drawing inspiration from multiresolution analysis of images. This paper presents a novel graph neural network architecture called Graph Cross Network (GXN) that utilizes multiscale feature learning. The architecture incorporates a novel graph pooling operation called Vertex Infomax Pooling (VIPool) to preserve informative vertices and a pyramid structure with intermediate feature-crossing layers to enhance information flow across scales. Experimental results demonstrate that GXN outperforms existing methods in both graph classification and vertex classification tasks, with VIPool consistently improving upon previous graph pooling methods.
