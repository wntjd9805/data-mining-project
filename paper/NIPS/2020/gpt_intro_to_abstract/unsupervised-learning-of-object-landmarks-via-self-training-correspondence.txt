Object parts, also known as keypoints or landmarks, provide important information about the shape and spatial configuration of objects in 3D space. Previous research has mainly focused on supervised learning of landmark detectors for specific object categories, such as faces or human bodies, where annotated images are available. However, annotating landmarks for all objects is impractical. This paper aims to address the problem of learning landmark detectors in an unsupervised manner. The authors propose a self-training approach, where generic keypoints are used to train a landmark detector that improves itself over time. Additionally, they propose an optimization scheme that utilizes correspondence recovery via clustering to achieve landmark correspondence across different images. The proposed approach demonstrates flexibility in capturing changes in 3D viewpoint and is evaluated on various challenging datasets without utilizing temporal information.
