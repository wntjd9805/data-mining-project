Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has gained popularity in recent years for achieving intelligent agents that can solve complex tasks. However, DRL presents computational challenges, especially for peak performance on modern architectures. This paper focuses on the inference path of DRL and addresses performance bottlenecks related to CPU-based environment emulation. The authors introduce CuLE, a CUDA enabled Atari 2600 emulator that renders frames directly in GPU memory, allowing for high GPU utilization and parallel processing of thousands of environments. Experimental results demonstrate that CuLE achieves higher Frame Per Second (FPS) compared to traditional CPU-based approaches and is comparable to large distributed systems. The paper also presents a batching strategy for large environment sets that enables efficient scaling on multiple GPUs. Overall, this work identifies computational bottlenecks in DRL implementations, proposes an effective solution with CuLE, and provides insights for developing efficient DRL systems.
