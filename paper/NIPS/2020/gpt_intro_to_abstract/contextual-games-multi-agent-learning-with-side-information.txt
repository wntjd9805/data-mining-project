Several real-world problems in various fields, including economics, engineering, and computer science, involve interactions between self-interested agents with interconnected goals. These interactions can be represented as repeated games and have recently garnered attention due to their relationship with learning. This paper focuses on the characterization of game-theoretic equilibria and efficiency, as well as the development of fast learning algorithms that converge to equilibria and efficient outcomes. However, most existing research assumes that players always face the exact same game, which is often unrealistic in practical scenarios. In response to this limitation, the concept of contextual games is introduced in this paper. Contextual games encompass a broader range of repeated games where players have access to different contextual information at each round. By allowing players to observe the current context before making decisions, contextual games enable better performance and the convergence to more robust equilibria and efficiency than standard repeated games.
