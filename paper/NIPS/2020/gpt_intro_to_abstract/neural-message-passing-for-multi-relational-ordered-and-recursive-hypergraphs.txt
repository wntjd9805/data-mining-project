This paper introduces the Generalised-MPNN (G-MPNN), a unified framework for multi-relational ordered hypergraphs. The authors address the challenge of variable-sized hyperedges and propose a novel extension of MPNN, called MPNN-R, for recursively structured datasets. They also explore the problem of inductive vertex embedding in multi-relational ordered hypergraphs and demonstrate the strong inductive capability of G-MPNN on real-world datasets. The contributions of this work provide valuable insights for adapting MPNN to complex relationships in text and knowledge datasets.
