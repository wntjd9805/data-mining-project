In this paper, we address the problem of hidden stratiÔ¨Åcation in classification tasks, where models underperform on important subclasses that are unlabeled. We propose a method called GEORGE to measure and improve worst-case subclass performance when subclass labels are unavailable. GEORGE consists of two steps: estimating subclass labels using unsupervised clustering in the model's feature space, and training a robust classifier to optimize worst-case performance over the estimated subclasses. We validate the effectiveness of GEORGE on four image classification tasks and show that it significantly reduces average worst-case subclass error rates.
