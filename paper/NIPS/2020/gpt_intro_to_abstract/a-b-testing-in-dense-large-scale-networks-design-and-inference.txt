Measuring the effect of treatment variants is a fundamental problem in various fields of study. A/B testing, commonly used in the internet industry, relies on the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) that assumes treatment effects are independent of other experiment units. However, in network settings like social media platforms, SUTVA is violated due to interference. This paper focuses on a marketplace setting, where the treatment class is defined by modifications of the probability of showing commodities to consumers. In such marketplace problems, SUTVA is violated due to interference from the network. To address this, the paper proposes a novel technique named OASIS that provides a randomized testing framework for large-scale marketplace problems. The technique relies on the existence of an intervening variable that captures the effect of treatment allocation on an experimental unit's network. The paper presents empirical results and compares the proposed technique against a baseline method, showing its effectiveness for large-scale dense graphs. The technique can be applied in any marketplace problem where treatment can be expressed using an edge weight abstraction, satisfying certain key assumptions. The paper concludes with a discussion and a literature review.
