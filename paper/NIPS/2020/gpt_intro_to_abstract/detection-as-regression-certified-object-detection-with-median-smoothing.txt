This paper introduces a certifiable defense against adversarial attacks on object detectors. While previous work has focused on defending image classifiers, which assign a single label to an entire image, there is a lack of defenses for object detectors, which are crucial for realistic vision systems. This is likely due to the complexity of the detection pipeline and the cost of training detectors. To overcome these challenges, the authors treat the detection pipeline as a black box and propose a regression-based approach that achieves certifiable robustness using Gaussian smoothing. The proposed method is implemented and tested on popular object detectors, achieving the first non-trivial certified average precision on a large-scale image dataset.
