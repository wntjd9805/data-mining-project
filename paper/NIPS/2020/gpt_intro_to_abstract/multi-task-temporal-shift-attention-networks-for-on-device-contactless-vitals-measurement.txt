The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to a significant increase in the use of telehealth platforms for medical appointments. However, providing the same level of care on a video call as during an in-person visit is challenging, particularly for assessing physiological states and symptoms. This paper proposes a novel multi-task temporal shift convolutional attention network (MTTS-CAN) to address the challenges of privacy, portability, and precision in contactless cardiopulmonary measurement. The proposed network leverages temporal shift modules, an attention module, and a multi-task mechanism to achieve high accuracy and inference speed. The paper presents the evaluation of the system on large public datasets, providing an implementation of core tensor operations and demonstrating on-device real-time modeling capabilities.
