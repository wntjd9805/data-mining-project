This paper introduces a method for addressing the sample diversity issue in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by learning a structured hypersphere embedding space for the discriminator. The discriminator is trained to populate realistic samples around a great circle while pushing unrealistic samples toward the poles. This encourages more diversity in representation learning and effectively represents multiple modes of real data distribution. The proposed method is extended for conditional settings with class labels, achieving state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks.
