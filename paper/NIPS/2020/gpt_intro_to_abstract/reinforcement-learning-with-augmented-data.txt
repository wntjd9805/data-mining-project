In this paper, we address the challenges of poor data-efficiency and generalization capabilities in reinforcement learning (RL) by incorporating data augmentation techniques inspired by the success of supervised learning in computer vision. We introduce RAD: Reinforcement Learning with Augmented Data, a technique that uses multiple views or augmentations of the same input to improve data efficiency and generalization in RL pipelines. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark environments and demonstrate that RAD outperforms prior state-of-the-art baselines in terms of data efficiency, asymptotic performance, and test-time generalization. We also introduce two new data augmentations specifically designed for image-based and proprioceptive input, which contribute to the state-of-the-art results achieved by RAD.
