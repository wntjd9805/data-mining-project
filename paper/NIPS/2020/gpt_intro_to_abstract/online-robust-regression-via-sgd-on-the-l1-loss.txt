Robust learning is a critical field that aims to develop efficient algorithms to recover an underlying model from possibly corrupted data. Dealing with corrupted measurements has become increasingly important in various fields such as computer vision, economics, astronomy, biology, and safety-critical systems. The robust regression problem, which involves recovering a signal from noisy linear measurements, has received significant attention. While previous algorithms have been proposed, they are not suitable for online or large-scale problems. This paper addresses the question of designing an efficient online algorithm for the robust regression problem. The authors propose an online oblivious response corruption model and demonstrate that their algorithm can handle outliers in an online manner and achieve optimal convergence rates. The algorithm has practical applications in detecting irrelevant measurements, system attacks, and online regression with heavy-tailed noise. The paper provides a thorough analysis of the algorithm and experimental validation of its performance.
