This paper introduces a method for generating correct answers to Raven Progressive Matrix (RPM) type intelligence tests. The proposed architecture combines reconstruction, recognition, and generation pathways to generate the missing ninth image in the grid. Variational loss terms and perceptual loss are used to ensure randomness and evaluate the suitability of the generated image. The results show that the generated answers are convincing and capture most of the rules, with the recognition network performing almost as effectively as state-of-the-art methods.
