In this paper, we address the challenge of understanding complex systems, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), by introducing a quantitative analysis method called error consistency. We argue that in order to determine whether two systems implement similar strategies, it is not enough to measure accuracy alone, but also to examine whether the systems make errors on the same inputs. We propose that error consistency can shed light on the internal mechanisms of both CNNs and biological vision, and may serve as a valuable technique in the ongoing debate about the relationship between performance and algorithm in deep learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science. Inspired by the concept of "molecular psychophysics," we advocate for a shift towards analyzing errors for individual stimuli rather than relying solely on aggregated responses or accuracy.
