Deep neural networks have achieved significant results in various real-world tasks, but their successes rely on hard-coded prior knowledge. The Hamiltonian neural network (HNN) implements the Hamiltonian structure on a neural network, but most previous studies use numerical integrators for learning and computing dynamics. Surprisingly, higher-order numerical integrators with adaptive time-stepping often perform worse than lower-order but qualitatively superior integrators. In this study, we propose a deep energy-based discrete-time physical model that combines neural networks and discrete-time energy-based modeling. Our framework is applicable to various energy-based physical models and equips the laws of physics in discrete time. We provide an easy-to-use automatic discrete differentiation algorithm for implementing the proposed framework.
