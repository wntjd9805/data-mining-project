Automated decision making systems can exhibit bias and discrimination against disadvantaged groups, leading to the imposition of fairness constraints on the decisions. However, the long-term consequences of these constraints have not been thoroughly studied. Recent research has shown that static fairness criteria can result in negative long-term effects. This paper aims to understand the evolution of group well-being and the impact of fairness constraints on different groups in a discrete-time sequential decision process. The dynamics of group qualification rates are analyzed, and the long-term impact of static fairness constraints is evaluated. The study explores the equilibrium state of the system and examines alternative interventions to promote equality. The proposed framework is validated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its applicability across domains and potential for informing policy-making.
