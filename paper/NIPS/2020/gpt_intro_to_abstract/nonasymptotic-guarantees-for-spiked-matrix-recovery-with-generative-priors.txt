This paper investigates the problem of estimating a spike vector y* âˆˆ Rn from data Y consisting of a rank-1 matrix perturbed with random noise. The paper focuses on two random models for Y: the Spiked Wishart Model and the Spiked Wigner Model. These models have been extensively studied in recent years and are connected to various statistical inverse problems. The paper proposes the use of a generative neural network as prior information on the spike vector y*. The network is trained on a dataset of spikes, and the unknown spike y* lies on the range of the network. The paper analyzes the low-rank matrix models under the generative network prior and presents contributions in terms of analyzing the optimization geometry of the problem and proposing a gradient-based algorithm for spike recovery. The results suggest that generative networks can serve as effective priors for statistical inverse problems and can lead to optimal polynomial-time algorithms without computational-to-statistical gaps. The paper concludes by discussing future directions and the potential applications of generative priors in signal recovery problems.
