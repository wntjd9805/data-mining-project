Disentangling aims to factorize an entity, like a feature vector, into interpretable components to understand the behavior of learning models. Recent efforts have focused on disentangling in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) but there are few attempts in graph convolutional network (GCN) models. In this paper, we propose a novel GCN called FactorGCN that conducts graph-level disentangling by decomposing a simple graph into factor graphs representing latent relations among nodes. These factor graphs undergo GCNs and their features are merged to produce block-wise interpretable features. FactorGCN enables multi-relation disentangling and introduces a quantitative evaluation metric based on graph edit-distance. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that FactorGCN outperforms other methods in disentanglement and downstream tasks, making it a potential general GCN framework.
