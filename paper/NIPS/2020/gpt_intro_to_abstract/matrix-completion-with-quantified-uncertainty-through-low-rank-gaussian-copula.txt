Missing data imputation is a critical step in data analysis, especially in recommender systems. Low rank matrix completion (LRMC) has been widely used for imputation. However, assessing the uncertainty of the imputed entries is essential for reliable decision making. While multiple imputation is a classical tool for quantifying uncertainty, it is computationally expensive for large datasets. The probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) model provides an alternative approach, but the Gaussian assumption is unrealistic for most real datasets. This paper proposes a low rank Gaussian copula model for imputation with quantified uncertainty, combining the advantages of PPCA and Gaussian copula. The proposed method is efficient, scalable, and accurate across various data types. The uncertainty of the estimates is quantified, providing well-calibrated confidence intervals and predicting imputation error.
