This paper introduces a principled framework called Heuristic Domain Adaptation (HDA) for enhancing the generalizability of models in visual domain adaptation scenarios. The paper proposes using domain-invariant representations as an information bottleneck to separate domain-specific information that is harmful for domain adaptation. The paper also introduces the Heuristic Domain Adaptation Network (HDAN), which leverages domain-specific representations as heuristics to obtain domain-invariant representations. Experimental results demonstrate that HDAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on three domain adaptation tasks. The contributions of this paper include the proposal of HDA, the development of three heuristic constraints, and the design of HDAN.
