This paper explores the use of symmetries in modeling complex domains, particularly in the context of discovering novel molecules for organic solar cells. Unlike simple transformations like rotation, complex domains do not have known or assumed symmetry transformations. The goal is to learn the class of symmetry transformations that result in a specific property of the system. The proposed model, Symmetry-Transformation Information Bottleneck (STIB), learns a continuous data representation and the corresponding continuous symmetry transformation from data samples. The central element of STIB is minimizing the information about a target property by employing adversarial learning. The paper also introduces a new loss function based on Gaussian mutual information to address the issues of one-to-one transformations in the continuous domain. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in learning both predefined and arbitrary symmetry transformations.
