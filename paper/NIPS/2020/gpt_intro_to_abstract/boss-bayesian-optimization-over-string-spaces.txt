In this paper, we address the problem of optimization in chemistry, biology, and machine learning tasks that involve spaces of strings. Existing optimization techniques are not suitable for these tasks due to the high cost of evaluating inputs. We propose a Bayesian Optimization (BO) architecture that operates directly on raw strings using convolution kernels. We use a Gaussian Process with a string kernel as the surrogate model and demonstrate that it outperforms existing approaches. Additionally, we introduce genetic algorithms for efficient exploration of string spaces and show that our framework performs well across diverse applications and constraints.
