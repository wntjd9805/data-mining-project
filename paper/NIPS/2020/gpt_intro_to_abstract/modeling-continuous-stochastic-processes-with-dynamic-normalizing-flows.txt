Expressive models for sequential data, such as time series, are crucial for various domains, including computer vision and finance. Traditional models based on structured decompositions have limitations in terms of resolution, structural assumptions, generation, and inference. However, recent advancements in deep generative architectures, particularly the concept of reversibility, have overcome these limitations. In this paper, we propose a reversible generative model for continuous and irregular time series called the continuous-time flow process (CTFP). By transforming a dynamic base process into an observable one using normalizing flows, CTFP enables the generation of continuous-time observable processes, interpolation, and extrapolation at arbitrary timestamps. Our experiments demonstrate that CTFP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and flexibility.
