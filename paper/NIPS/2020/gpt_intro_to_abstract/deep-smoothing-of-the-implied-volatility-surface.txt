This paper addresses the problem of accurately interpolating and extrapolating the implied volatility surface (IVS) in the financial market. Standard models for the IVS often fail to reproduce market prices and value other instruments without quotes. In this study, the authors propose a new solution by merging ideas from machine learning and mathematical finance. They use a neural network to correct the IVS produced by standard models, offering a trade-off between flexibility and computational complexity. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through numerical experiments and real market data. This work contributes to bridging the gap between traditional finance challenges and recent developments in deep learning, providing a reliable and computationally efficient option pricing framework.
