This paper addresses the impact of learning and machine learning methods on individuals who interact with automated decision systems. The authors highlight various issues, such as algorithmic discrimination and bias in online platforms. They propose a theoretical framework for sequential resource allocation to workers and aim to achieve a meaningful trade-off between reward maximization and equality of opportunity. The paper introduces a general class of utility functions and presents approximate optimal offline policies and an online learning algorithm for utility maximization. The authors also discuss the ethical implications of task allocation and propose two extreme approaches: reward-maximizing task allocation and proportional task allocation. The contributions of the paper include incorporating random completion time dynamics and fairness in allocation, characterizing optimal offline policies, and developing an online learning algorithm for utility maximization.
