Real-world scenes captured by conventional cameras often lose object contours and details due to their limited dynamic range. Various methods have been proposed to increase dynamic range, but they have limitations in achieving high fidelity and recovering details. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called UnModNet, which leverages a modulo camera to theoretically achieve unbounded dynamic range. By unwrapping the captured modulo image using a customized Markov random field (MRF) algorithm, we can restore the high dynamic range content. However, previous MRF-based unwrapping algorithms suffer from fundamental issues such as modulus-intensity ambiguity, strong local contrast, and color misalignment. To address these issues, UnModNet reformulates the unwrapping problem as a series of binary labeling problems and leverages a learning-based framework to estimate the binary rollover mask of the input modulo image. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in generating high-quality HDR images.
