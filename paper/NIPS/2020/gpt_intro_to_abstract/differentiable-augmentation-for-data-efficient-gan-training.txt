The introduction discusses the advancements in deep learning algorithms enabled by big data, specifically focusing on state-of-the-art generative adversarial networks (GANs) that can generate high-quality natural images. However, the success of GANs comes with high computation and data requirements, making it challenging to train models with limited datasets. Data augmentation has been a common strategy to address overfitting in image classification, but its application to GANs is different and can lead to distribution shift and artifacts. To overcome this challenge, the paper introduces a method called DiffAugment that applies differentiable augmentation to both real and fake images during training, resulting in improved performance across various GAN architectures and datasets. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of DiffAugment in improving image generation quality and reducing the need for large training datasets.
