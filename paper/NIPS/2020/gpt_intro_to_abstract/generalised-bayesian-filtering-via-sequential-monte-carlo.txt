Estimating hidden states in dynamical systems is a fundamental problem in various fields of science and engineering. This problem can be formulated as an inference problem of a general state-space hidden Markov model (HMM) that consists of a hidden process and an observation process. In this paper, we focus on the general state-space HMMs with nonlinear, non-Gaussian transitions and likelihoods. We introduce particle filtering schemes as a solution to this problem, which utilize a weighted collection of Monte Carlo samples to approximate the filtering distribution. However, it is crucial to consider model misspecification, where the assumed model does not accurately capture the true data-generating mechanism. To address this, we propose a robust filtering approach based on Generalized Bayesian Inference (GBI), which views Bayesian inference as a loss minimization procedure. We adapt the GBI approach to the Bayesian filtering setting and develop sequential Monte Carlo methods for inference. Our approach significantly improves filtering performance in settings with contaminated data, while maintaining a general and principled approach to inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through empirical results, comparing it with other robust schemes and applying it to real-world data.
