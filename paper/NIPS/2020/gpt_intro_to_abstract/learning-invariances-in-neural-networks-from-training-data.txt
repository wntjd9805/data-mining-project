This paper introduces Augerino, a simple and practical approach for automatically discovering invariances and equivariances in neural networks from training data alone. Augerino can learn a wide range of symmetries, including translations, rotations, scalings, and shears, and can also discover partial symmetries. It can be combined with existing architectures, loss functions, and optimization algorithms with minimal overhead. Augerino performs well on various tasks such as regression, classification, and segmentation for both image and molecular data. To the authors' knowledge, Augerino is the first approach that can learn symmetries in neural networks without requiring a validation set or special loss function. The accompanying code is available at the provided GitHub repository.
