In recent years, research has focused on understanding the performance of machine learning algorithms in adaptive or adversarial environments. Machine learning algorithms have been found to be vulnerable to malicious manipulation of input data in various application domains. In this paper, we study the problem of designing efficient data structures for distance estimation in an adaptive setting, where the sequence of queries made to the data structure can be chosen by an adversary. We propose a new randomized data structure for approximate distance estimation that achieves a memory consumption of O((n+d)d/"2) and a query time of O(""/"(n+d)), while maintaining error guarantees in the face of adaptive queries. Our solution is particularly optimized for the case of Euclidean space (p=2), where it achieves optimal query time and nearly optimal space complexity. The pre-processing time of our data structure can also be improved through the use of fast algorithms.
