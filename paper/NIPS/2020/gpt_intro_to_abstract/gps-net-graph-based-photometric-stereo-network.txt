This paper introduces GPS-Net, an end-to-end Graph-based Photometric Stereo Network that combines the advantages of per-pixel and all-pixel methods to explore both inter-image and intra-image variation. The Unstructured Feature Extraction Layer (UFE-Layer) is designed to connect an arbitrary number of inter-image observations of each pixel into a graph structure, while the Structure-aware Graph Convolution (SGC) filters in the UFE-Layer deal with the topologically inconsistent graphs and extract a fixed-size feature map. The Normal Regression Network (NR-Net) efficiently uses intra-image spatial information to regress a high-resolution and high-accuracy normal map. Experimental results show that GPS-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods, provides stable performance across lighting distributions, and maintains rich surface normal details for each pixel.
