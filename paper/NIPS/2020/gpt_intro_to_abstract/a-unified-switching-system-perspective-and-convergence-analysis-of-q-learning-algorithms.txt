This paper introduces a framework that analyzes Q-learning and its variants using switched linear system (SLS) models. The study of SLSs has gained significant attention in recent years, and their stability behaviors have been well established. The main contributions of this paper include characterizing the associated ODE models of Q-learning algorithms as affine switching systems, constructing comparison systems for stability analysis, proving the asymptotic convergence of Q-learning algorithms, analyzing averaging Q-learning, and deriving a new condition for the convergence of Q-learning with linear function approximation.
