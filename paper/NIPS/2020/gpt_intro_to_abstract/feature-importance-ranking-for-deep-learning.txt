Feature importance ranking (FIR) is a task in machine learning that measures the contributions of individual input features to the performance of a supervised learning model. FIR is used for understanding decision-making and identifying key factors in specific domains such as medicine. Feature selection is often employed to address the challenge of high-dimensional data and improve the generalization of a learning system. FIR is closely associated with feature selection, and has been an active research area in deep learning. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-net neural architecture to address the populationwise FIR issue in deep learning. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art FIR and supervised feature selection methods, as demonstrated through thorough evaluation on synthetic, benchmark, and real datasets.
