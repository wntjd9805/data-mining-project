Partial label (PL) learning is a popular approach in various applications, where each training example is associated with multiple candidate labels. In this paper, a new approach called PARM is proposed for semi-supervised partial label learning, which leverages unlabeled data to improve the generalization performance of the predictive model. PARM estimates the labeling confidence of unlabeled data and maximizes the confidence-rated margin to preserve the manifold structure between PL training examples and unlabeled data. Comparative studies demonstrate that PARM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in utilizing unlabeled data for partial label learning. Additionally, a review of related work, technical details, and experimental results are presented in this paper.
