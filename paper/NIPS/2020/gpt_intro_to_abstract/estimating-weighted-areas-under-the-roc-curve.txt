The use of the area under the ROC curve (AUC) to evaluate score functions has a long history in medical screening and bioinformatics. While several algorithms have been developed to learn score functions that maximize the AUC, there are cases where different regions of the false positive range may need to be weighted differently. This has led to the interest in the partial area under the ROC curve (pAUC), which measures the area between two specified false positive rates using a step function weight. Estimation and generalization of the AUC and pAUC present challenges, particularly for more general weight functions. This paper presents contributions that address these challenges by considering Lipschitz continuous weight functions. Theorems are provided to show estimation rates and performance guarantees for algorithms maximizing the pAUC. The paper also introduces a method to control estimation errors for statistical functionals, using conditions based on metrics such as total-variation, Wasserstein, and Kolmogorov. These findings contribute to the understanding and application of weighted AUC in machine learning.
