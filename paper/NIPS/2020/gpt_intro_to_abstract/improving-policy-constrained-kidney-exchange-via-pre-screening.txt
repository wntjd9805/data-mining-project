In this paper, we address the problem of multi-stage decision-making when solving a challenging stochastic problem with uncertain parameters. We focus on the context of kidney exchange, where patients in need of a transplant swap living donors to find suitable matches. Traditional kidney exchange programs follow strict policy guidelines dictated by matching algorithms, which are difficult to modify. We highlight the issue of transplant failures and propose the idea of pre-screening potential transplants to mitigate such failures. However, selecting which transplants to screen is a complex task due to the large number of potential transplants and limited resources. Thus, we investigate methods for selecting a limited number of transplants to pre-screen in order to improve the matching algorithm's outcome. We approach this problem as a multistage stochastic optimization problem and consider both offline and online settings.
