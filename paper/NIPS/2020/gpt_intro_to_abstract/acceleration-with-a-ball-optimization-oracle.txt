In this paper, we investigate the problem of unconstrained minimization of a smooth convex objective function using a ball optimization oracle. We analyze the query complexity of this oracle and propose an accelerated scheme that improves upon the existing (cid:101)O(R/r) complexity, showing that the optimal query complexity scales as (R/r)2/3. We also provide a matching lower bound for the problem and discuss the implementation and applications of the ball optimization oracle, particularly in regression tasks. Our results have implications for the complexity and runtime guarantees of these tasks.
