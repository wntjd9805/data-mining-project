Discovering new molecules with specific properties is crucial in fields such as drug discovery and material design. However, the vastness of the molecular space makes this task challenging. In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown promise in solving the de novo molecular design problem. Yet, traditional frameworks based on genetic algorithms (GAs) have demonstrated competitive performance, suggesting the importance of domain knowledge in this area. In this paper, we propose genetic expert-guided learning (GEGL), a framework that combines the strengths of DNNs and GAs. We formulate an expert policy using genetic operators and train the DNN to imitate the high-rewarding molecules generated by the expert policy. Our approach outperforms existing methods in four experiments and achieves remarkable scores in de novo molecular design tasks.
