This paper addresses scheduling problems in which a planner must act on a subset of binary-state processes each round, with uncertainty in the state transitions. The goal is to maximize the number of processes in a "good" state over T rounds. This problem arises in various domains, including healthcare. The authors propose a solution framework called Restless Multi-Arm Bandits (RMABs) and introduce a subclass called Collapsing Bandits, which allows for efficient computation of the Whittle index. Theoretical conditions for indexability and optimal policies are derived, and an efficient solution is developed that outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.
