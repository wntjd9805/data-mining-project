Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used medical imaging technique, but long acquisition times limit its efficiency and image quality. Accelerated MRI, which aims to reduce imaging times by acquiring less data, has been an active area of research. Compressed sensing and deep learning methods have been employed to improve image quality in accelerated MRI. However, the subsampling masks used in these methods are typically determined beforehand. In this paper, we propose a move towards learned acquisition strategies for MRI, where the subsampling masks are adaptive and can vary for different images. We explore the use of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to learn optimal subsampling masks, and compare greedy and non-greedy models. We demonstrate through experiments that direct policy gradient methods can be effective in learning experimental design for MRI, and provide insights into the limitations of non-greedy models. Our findings contribute to the understanding and future research directions in MRI experimental design.
