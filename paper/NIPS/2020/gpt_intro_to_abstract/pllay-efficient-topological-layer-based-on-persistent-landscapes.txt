This paper explores an alternative method to improve the learnability of deep learning models by incorporating a novel topological layer that captures important geometric features of the data structure. The use of topology in data analysis has been limited due to the difficulty of combining it with statistics and machine learning. However, recent studies have shown successes in utilizing topological methods. The proposed topological layer offers several benefits, including the extraction of robust global features, easy optimization for specific tasks, and applicability to complex data structures without preprocessing.
