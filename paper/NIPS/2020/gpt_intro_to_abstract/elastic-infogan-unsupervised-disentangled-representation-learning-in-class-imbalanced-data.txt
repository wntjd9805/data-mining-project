Generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), have shown promise in generating realistic samples for complex data like images. However, existing models like InfoGAN assume a fixed uniform categorical distribution for discrete latent factors, which is not suitable for imbalanced data. In this paper, we propose Elastic-InfoGAN, which introduces two improvements to InfoGAN. First, we treat class probabilities as learnable parameters, allowing for the discovery of disentangled categorical representations from imbalanced data. Second, we use self-supervised contrastive representation learning techniques to focus on object identity and minimize the influence of low-level factors. Our results demonstrate the superior ability of Elastic-InfoGAN to disentangle object identity compared to baselines, highlighting the importance of the latent variable distribution in representation learning for imbalanced data.
