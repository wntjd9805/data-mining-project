This paper introduces the Generalized Min-Sum Set Cover (GMSSC) problem in the context of online learning algorithms. The goal is to compute a permutation of items that minimizes the total access cost for a given sequence of user requests and their covering requirements. The paper presents a novel approach based on dimensionality reduction and Online Projected Gradient Descent to solve the relaxed version of GMSSC. It also includes deterministic and randomized rounding schemes to obtain polynomial-time online learning algorithms with regret bounds for both GMSSC and the special case of Min-Sum Set Cover (MSSC). The results show that the proposed algorithms achieve regret bounds within a constant factor of the optimal solution, providing computationally efficient solutions to the GMSSC problem.
