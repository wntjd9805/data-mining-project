This paper explores the ability of humans to infer goals from partial and sub-optimal plans, and seeks to endow machines with the same capacity. Previous work in inferring goals of agents has often made simplified assumptions about optimality or sub-optimality. The authors propose a new modeling and inference architecture that addresses these limitations by modeling agents as planners who are boundedly rational in their planning process. They present a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian inference of plans and goals, and evaluate their approach against a baseline on various planning domains, achieving high accuracy with less computational cost.
