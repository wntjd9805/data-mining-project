Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely used for various tasks in computer science, such as node classification and link prediction. Pre-training with auxiliary tasks has been successful in natural language processing and computer vision but has not been extensively explored for graph-structured data. This is due to the challenges posed by the differing graph structures and the transductive nature of many GNNs. In this paper, we propose a framework for training GNNs on heterogeneous graphs using automatically selected auxiliary tasks. We present a self-supervised learning method based on meta-path prediction and develop a Hint Network to enhance the learner network's performance. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the representational power of GNNs on heterogeneous graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to leverage meta-paths as auxiliary tasks specifically designed for heterogeneous graph structures.
