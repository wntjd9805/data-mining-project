Convolutional generative adversarial networks have been successful in generating high-resolution images from unstructured image collections, but they struggle to accurately disentangle generative factors such as 3D shape and viewpoint. This is in contrast to human abilities to reason about 3D structure and imagine objects from different viewpoints. Recent works have focused on 3D-aware image synthesis, aiming to generate photo-realistic images with control over camera pose. Existing approaches use voxel-based or feature-based 3D representations, but suffer from limitations such as low resolution or entangled representations. In this paper, we propose GRAF, a generative model for high-resolution 3D-aware image synthesis based on conditional radiance fields. Our approach allows for shape and appearance modifications and achieves superior visual fidelity and 3D consistency compared to state-of-the-art methods.
