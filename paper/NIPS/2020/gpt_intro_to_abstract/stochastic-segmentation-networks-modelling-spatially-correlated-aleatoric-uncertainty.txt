Semantic image segmentation is a challenging problem in computer vision, where the goal is to accurately label each pixel in an image with the corresponding object class. Existing approaches often focus on dense pixel-wise classification but ignore the underlying spatial structure. This can lead to single deterministic predictions that do not capture the inherent uncertainty and multiple plausible solutions in image segmentation. In this paper, we introduce stochastic segmentation networks (SSNs), a lightweight and flexible alternative that efficiently models the joint distribution over labels given the image. SSNs capture correlations between pixels by representing the logit map as a low-rank multivariate normal distribution, enabling the generation of multiple samples from a single forward pass. Our method achieves higher predictive performance, can be used with any existing architecture, and is applicable to high-dimensional problems such as 3D imaging.
