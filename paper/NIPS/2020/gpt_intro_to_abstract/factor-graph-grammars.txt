Graphs have been widely used to represent probability models in various domains. However, in certain applications such as speech and language processing, a fixed graph may not be sufficient due to the presence of repeated or alternative substructures. Existing formalisms have addressed these issues to some extent, but often suffer from limitations in terms of tractable exact inference. In this paper, we explore the use of hyperedge replacement graph grammars (HRGs) as a formalism for defining sets of graphs. We introduce factor graph grammars (FGGs), which are expressive enough to handle both repeated and alternative substructures, while also allowing for exact and tractable inference. We present three main contributions, including the definition and generalization of FGGs, the introduction of a conjunction operation for modularization, and the development of inference techniques for FGGs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through various examples, showcasing both exact and approximate inference capabilities.
