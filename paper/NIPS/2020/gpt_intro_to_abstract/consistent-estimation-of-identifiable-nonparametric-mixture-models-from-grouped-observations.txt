Finite mixture models are commonly used in statistics and machine learning to describe subpopulations within a larger population. However, without additional assumptions, these models are not identifiable from independent and identically distributed (iid) data. This paper introduces a novel variant of the kernel density estimator that can yield statistically consistent estimates of any identifiable nonparametric mixture model from grouped observations. The paper establishes an oracle inequality for weighted kernel density estimators and provides a general result showing that consistent estimation of the distribution on groups implies consistent estimates of the underlying components. The proposed method is applicable to various domains, including nuclear source detection and topic modeling of Twitter data, where paired observations occur naturally. The paper also offers an efficient algorithm for the case of pairs and demonstrates its effectiveness on several datasets.
