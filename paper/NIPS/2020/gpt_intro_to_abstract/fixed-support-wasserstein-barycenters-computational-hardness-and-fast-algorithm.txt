The Wasserstein barycenter problem (WBP) has been widely studied in various fields such as economics, physics, statistics, image analysis, and machine learning. It is a challenging problem that involves minimizing the sum of Wasserstein distances between multiple probability measures. Fast algorithms and complexity bounds for solving the WBP have been a focus of research. In this paper, we revisit the fixed-support Wasserstein barycenter problem (FS-WBP) and present two main contributions. Firstly, we prove that the FS-WBP is not a minimum-cost flow problem in general, highlighting the need for problem reformulation. Secondly, we propose a fast deterministic variant of the iterative Bregman projection (IBP) algorithm called FASTIBP, which improves upon existing complexity bounds. Experimental results demonstrate the favorable performance of our algorithm.
