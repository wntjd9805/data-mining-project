Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is commonly used to study human cognitive processes, generating complex and time-varying data sets. However, the measurements are inherently noisy and there is a high degree of variability between healthy brains. Traditional approaches to fMRI data analysis often ignore these factors, leading to inaccurate representations of brain activity. In this paper, we propose a novel non-parametric framework that transforms fMRI data into time-varying topological representations. We demonstrate that these representations capture age-related differences and provide insights into cognitive processes. Furthermore, we show that our topological features outperform other representations in an age prediction task.
