In this paper, we address the problem of correcting for distribution shift in predictive healthcare models. We consider a scenario where a company has collected data from multiple regions and wants to deploy their model in a new region with limited data. We propose a method that trains models on different mixture distributions of the available datasets and selects the model that performs the best on a small validation dataset from the new region. We highlight the challenge of dealing with shifts in observed and unobserved variables and demonstrate that traditional techniques may fail in this context. To overcome this, we introduce a search-based algorithm that explores the mixture search space efficiently. Our contributions include the development of search-based methods for covariate shift, the introduction of the Mix&Match algorithm that utilizes tree search and SGD, and a new concentration bound for SGD that provides tighter guarantees in settings with large or uncontrollable domain diameter.
