Weighted random sampling is a widely used tool in machine learning and data analysis. It provides an efficient way to estimate statistics and aggregates from data sets. In this paper, we focus on data sets with key-value pairs and their aggregated form. We propose the use of composable sketches, which are data structures that support processing new elements and merging sketches. These sketches allow for parallel, distributed, or streaming computation. We aim to design small-sized sketches for efficient storage and communication. We also study "p" sampling, which involves weighted sampling of keys based on their frequency raised to a power "p". We show that these samples provide accurate estimates for various tasks. Sampling is crucial in stochastic optimization and can be used for training data selection and communication of gradient updates. We consider weighted sampling in the without-replacement (WOR) setting, which offers broader representation and more accurate estimates, particularly for skewed distributions. The benefits of WOR sampling are illustrated through experimental results.
