Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved impressive performance in computer vision tasks but exhibit differences from human visual processing. This paper focuses on the phenomenon of texture bias in CNNs, where they rely on superficial textural features for classification rather than shape information, as humans do. Understanding texture bias is essential for addressing vulnerabilities to adversarial examples and improving models' ability to generalize. Furthermore, texture bias challenges the current understanding of human and machine vision, as CNNs diverge from the shape bias observed in primate visual processing. The paper investigates the factors contributing to texture bias, including data augmentation, training procedure, model architecture, and task, and proposes approaches to reduce texture bias and improve classification accuracy based on shape information. The findings also shed light on the representation and utilization of shape information within CNNs.
