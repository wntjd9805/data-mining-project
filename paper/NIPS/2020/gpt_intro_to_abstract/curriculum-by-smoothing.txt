Deep Learning models have greatly advanced computer vision in recent years, particularly through the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, there is still a question of how to design a curriculum that enhances CNNs' ability to learn better representations from data. In this paper, we propose a curriculum that enhances CNN training by smoothing feature maps using low-pass or anti-aliasing filters and progressively adding high-frequency information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through image classification experiments and by evaluating the trained models on various vision tasks. Additionally, we show improvements in representation learning using VAEs and Zero-shot Domain Adaptation, highlighting the generality and robustness of our solution.
