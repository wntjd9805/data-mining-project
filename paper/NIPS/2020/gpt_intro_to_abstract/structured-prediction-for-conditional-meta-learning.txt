In this paper, we propose Task-adaptive Structured Meta-Learning (TASML), a general framework for conditional meta-learning based on structured prediction. Our framework interprets the inner algorithm as the structured output to be predicted, conditioned on target tasks. We derive a principled estimator that minimizes task-specific meta-learning objectives and weighs known training tasks based on their similarities with the target task. TASML is model-agnostic and can adapt existing meta-learning methods for conditional meta-learning. We evaluate TASML on few-shot classification benchmarks and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods. Our contributions include a new perspective on conditional meta-learning, TASML framework, an efficient algorithm, and thorough evaluation results.
