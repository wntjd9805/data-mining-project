Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for object re-identification (re-ID) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to measure affinities in an unlabeled target domain. Existing UDA methods follow a two-stage training scheme, consisting of supervised pre-training on the source domain and unsupervised fine-tuning on the target domain. However, these methods have limitations in not considering source-domain images during fine-tuning and discarding outliers in the target domain. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid memory-based framework that utilizes all available data for joint feature learning. We also introduce a self-paced contrastive learning strategy that gradually improves feature discriminativeness and incorporates more reliable target-domain clusters. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple object re-ID tasks and significantly improves performance on both the source and target domains.
