In this paper, we address the problem of timeseries anomaly detection in complex cyber-physical systems. The ability to identify anomalies in real-time data is crucial for avoiding potential risks and financial losses. We focus on the unsupervised learning setting and propose a Temporal Hierarchical One-Class (THOC) network. This network utilizes a dilated recurrent neural network with skip connections to extract multi-scale temporal features from the timeseries. We also introduce a multiscale support vector data description objective to train the model end-to-end. Experimental results on various real-world timeseries datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model compared to state-of-the-art methods.
