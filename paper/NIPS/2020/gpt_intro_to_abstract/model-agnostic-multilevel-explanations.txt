In this paper, we propose a novel model agnostic multilevel explanation (MAME) method that generates multiple explanations for black-box models. The method takes an unlabeled dataset and a post-hoc local explainability technique as input and produces explanations at different levels of cohesion between examples. We ensure fidelity by constraining the predictions of the explanation model to be close to those of the black-box. We illustrate the multilevel explanations generated by MAME using a real industrial pump failure dataset, showing distinct information provided at each level. Our method can also incorporate side information and non-linear additive models for customization. We provide mathematical proofs, demonstrate high fidelity and perform human studies to validate the effectiveness of our technique.
