Discrete probability measures play a crucial role in various inference tasks, such as empirical measures. In scenarios with massive amounts of data, constructing a condensed summary of the original measure becomes necessary. Traditionally, this has been accomplished by randomly sampling n points from the N available, but Tchakaloff's theorem suggests an alternative approach. Tchakaloff's theorem describes the existence of a discrete probability measure ˆµ that satisfies certain conditions, such as having a support subset contained within the original measure and a size no larger than n + 1. Additionally, the expected value of n real-valued functions applied to the original measure and the new measure are equal. In this paper, we propose a randomized algorithm that efficiently computes ˆµ in scenarios where n is much smaller than N.
