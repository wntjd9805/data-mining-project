This paper introduces the problem of estimating a canonical orientation in robotic and computer vision systems for processing 3D data and images. The authors discuss the two main approaches used to achieve rotation invariance - rotation-invariant operators and canonical orientation estimation. They emphasize the need for equivariance with respect to 3D rotations in estimating a canonical orientation and highlight the limitations of current handcrafted proposals. To address this, the authors propose leveraging Spherical CNNs to build Compass, a self-supervised methodology that learns to orient 3D shapes. They describe the robust end-to-end training pipeline used to overcome issues such as discretization artifacts and noisy data, and demonstrate the effectiveness of Compass in achieving state-of-the-art results in local surface patch estimation and global shape classification.
