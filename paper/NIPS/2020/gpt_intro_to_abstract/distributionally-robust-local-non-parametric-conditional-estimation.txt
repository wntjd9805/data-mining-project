We consider the problem of estimating conditional statistics of a response variable given a predictor or covariate. Specifically, we focus on estimating the conditional mean, also known as the regression function, under finite variance assumptions. However, finding the optimal solution for the regression function is challenging due to it being an infinite-dimensional optimization problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a family of optimization problems that are parametrized by the covariate value of interest. We also introduce a distributionally robust optimization formulation to handle the unknown probability measure. Our contributions include a novel paradigm for non-parametric local conditional estimation based on distributionally robust optimization, efficient solutions for various applicable settings, and a systematic robustification of the k-nearest neighbor estimator. We support our approach with empirical evidence using both synthetic and real datasets.
