Network architecture search (NAS) has become a popular approach for automating network architecture design in various applications such as image recognition and language modeling. NAS involves searching for a directed graph and its edges from a large search space, eliminating the need for manual design by experts. However, existing NAS methods, such as DARTS, often result in architectures dominated by skip connections, leading to unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we investigate this issue and provide theoretical insights into why skip connections dominate other types of operations in DARTS. Inspired by our theory, we propose a novel alternative called PR-DARTS, which addresses the unfair competition between skip connections and other operations. PR-DARTS achieves state-of-the-art classification performance by leveraging group-structured sparse gates and path-depth-wise regularization to search for performance-oriented networks.
