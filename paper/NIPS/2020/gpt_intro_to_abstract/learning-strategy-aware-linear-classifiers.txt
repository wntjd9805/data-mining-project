As Machine Learning algorithms become more prevalent in decision-making processes, it is important to consider the strategic behavior of agents that interact with these algorithms. This paper focuses on the problem of learning an unknown linear classifier in the presence of strategic agents who can manipulate their feature vectors to game the classifier. The authors model this interaction as a repeated Stackelberg game and propose GRINDER, an adaptive discretization algorithm, to address the challenges posed by strategic behavior. The paper also provides theoretical analysis and simulations to support the effectiveness of GRINDER. The contributions of this paper include studying a general model of learning interaction in strategic classification settings, proving the incompatibility of regret notions, and presenting techniques to overcome challenges in continuous action spaces.
