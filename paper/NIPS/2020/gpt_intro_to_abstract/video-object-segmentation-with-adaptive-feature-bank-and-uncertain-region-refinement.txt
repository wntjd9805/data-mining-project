Video object segmentation (VOS) is a crucial task in various video processing applications, such as video editing and video inpainting. This paper focuses on the semi-supervised setting of VOS, where the first frame is annotated to identify the objects of interest, and the objective is to segment the object mask in subsequent frames. Deep learning methods have been widely used for this task, but the segmentation performance is heavily influenced by two main steps: distinguishing object regions from the background and accurately segmenting the object boundary. This paper categorizes recent works into implicit learning and explicit learning approaches. Implicit approaches use fully convolutional networks to learn object features implicitly through network weights, while explicit approaches explicitly learn object appearance and formulate segmentation as pixel-wise classification. Matching-based methods, a type of explicit approach, have achieved state-of-the-art results in VOS benchmarks. One key challenge in matching-based VOS is effectively utilizing information from previous frames without exceeding memory limits. Many methods only utilize the first and latest frames or uniformly sample key frames, which can lead to missed sampling or out-of-memory crashes in longer videos. To address this problem, the proposed adaptive feature bank (AFB) organizes target object features by absorbing new features through weighted averaging and discarding obsolete features based on the least frequently used (LFU) index. This approach enables the model to memorize characteristics of multiple objects and segment them simultaneously in long videos with low memory consumption. Additionally, accurately segmenting the object boundary is crucial to VOS performance. The paper introduces an uncertain-region refinement (URR) scheme, which includes a classification confidence loss to estimate the ambiguity of segmentation results and a local fine-grained segmentation to refine ambiguous regions. The main contributions of the paper are: the proposal of an adaptive and efficient feature bank for video object segmentation, the introduction of a confidence loss and local fine-grained segmentation module to improve segmentation quality, and the demonstration of the effectiveness of the method in segmenting long videos commonly encountered in practical applications.
