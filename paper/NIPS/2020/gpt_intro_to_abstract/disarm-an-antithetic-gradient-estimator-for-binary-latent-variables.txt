In this computer science paper, the authors address the challenge of estimating the gradient of an expectation with respect to the parameters of a distribution. They discuss the limitations of current estimators, such as the reparameterization trick for continuous random variables and the high variance of score-function estimators for models with discrete random variables. The authors propose a new estimator called DisARM, which integrates over augmenting variables to reduce variance and improve performance. They also compare DisARM with other existing estimators and demonstrate its effectiveness in different scenarios.
