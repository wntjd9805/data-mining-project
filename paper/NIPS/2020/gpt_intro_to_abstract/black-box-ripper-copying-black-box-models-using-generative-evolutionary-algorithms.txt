AI has gained significant attention in recent years, with companies integrating neural models into their products. However, these companies need to protect their intellectual property, leading them to treat the neural models as black boxes. Despite efforts to keep the internals of these models confidential, recent research has shown that aspects of black-box models can be stolen. This paper proposes a novel generative evolutionary framework to effectively steal the functionality of black-box models, without access to the model's training data, architecture, or hyperparameters. The framework consists of a black-box teacher network, a student network, a generator, and an evolutionary strategy. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through experiments on benchmark datasets, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods while preserving the black-box nature of the teacher. The contribution of this paper includes proposing the generative evolutionary algorithm and showing its superiority over existing methods.
