The remarkable success of Deep Learning algorithms has led to a surge in their adoption in a multitude of applications, making it important to understand their failure modes and develop reliable risk mitigation strategies. One major threat to systems deploying Deep Networks is their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, which has sparked interest in developing methods to improve their robustness. This paper introduces Guided Adversarial Margin Attack (GAMA), a state-of-the-art attack that achieves high performance across multiple defenses and datasets. The authors also propose Guided Adversarial Training (GAT), a defense strategy that achieves state-of-the-art results in single-step adversarial defenses. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches in improving the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks, with significant improvements observed in single-step training. The code and pre-trained models for GAMA and GAT are provided.
