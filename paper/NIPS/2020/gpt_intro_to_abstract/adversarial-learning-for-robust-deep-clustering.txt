Clustering is an important tool in unsupervised learning and has been widely used in various applications. However, traditional clustering algorithms may struggle with high-dimensional data, leading to degraded performances. In recent years, deep clustering algorithms have emerged as a promising approach, as they have the ability to model input sample distributions effectively and capture nonlinear properties. Deep autoencoder networks and Deep Embedding Clustering have been proposed as deep clustering methods that leverage the power of deep learning. However, these methods are vulnerable to adversarial samples, which can lead to significantly different clustering results. In this paper, we propose an adversarial learning algorithm to enhance the robustness of deep clustering networks by introducing an adversarial sample for the embedding space. We also develop a powerful adversarial attack algorithm and a defense algorithm to explore and mitigate the impact of unstable samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed adversarial learning algorithm improves the robustness and overall performance of existing clustering frameworks.
