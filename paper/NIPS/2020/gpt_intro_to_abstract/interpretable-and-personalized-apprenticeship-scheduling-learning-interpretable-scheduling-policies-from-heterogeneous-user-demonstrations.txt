Coordinating resources in time and space is a challenging and costly problem in various industries, such as manufacturing and healthcare. The optimization problem of scheduling workers to complete tasks with temporal constraints is known to be NP-hard and often computationally intractable for real-world problems. Currently, human domain experts rely on their own heuristics and strategies to solve these problems, leading to heterogeneity in resource coordination. This paper aims to develop apprenticeship learning techniques to capture these heterogeneous rules-of-thumb and scale beyond the expertise of a single individual. Traditional approaches assuming demonstrator homogeneity are not suitable for handling this heterogeneity. The paper introduces a novel apprenticeship learning framework, called Personalized Neural Trees, which overcomes the limitations of prior work by utilizing a sparsity-based neural network architecture and variational inference. Empirical validation demonstrates the superiority of this approach over baselines in terms of performance and interpretability. The paper also presents a methodology for converting personalized neural trees into interpretable decision-making representations and conducts a user study to show the advantages of the interpretable trees over black box neural networks.
