Prediction in the social world often has performative effects, as predictions can influence actions that impact the outcome. This concept of performativity extends to various domains, such as financial markets and online advertising. In this paper, the authors introduce and formalize performative prediction, which involves the choice of a model affecting the data-generating distribution. The stability of the model in this setting is crucial, as it prevents repeated model updates that may no longer be accurate on observed data. The authors explore the challenge of achieving stability in an online stochastic setting where data arrives one-by-one over time. They propose two variants of the stochastic gradient method, called greedy deploy and lazy deploy, and demonstrate convergence guarantees for both methods. The results show that the choice between the two methods depends on factors such as the cost of model deployment and the strength of performativity. The authors also provide empirical evidence supporting their theoretical findings.
