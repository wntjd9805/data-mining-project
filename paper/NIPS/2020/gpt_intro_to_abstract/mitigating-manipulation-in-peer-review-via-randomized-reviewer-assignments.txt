This paper addresses challenges in peer review relating to the integrity of the review process in academic conferences. Three specific challenges are identified: untruthful favorable reviews, torpedo reviewing, and reviewer de-anonymization. The paper proposes a framework that uses randomized paper assignments to address these challenges. Computationally efficient, randomized assignment algorithms are designed to optimize the assignment of reviewers to papers while addressing the aforementioned issues. The algorithms are tested on datasets from past conferences and their effectiveness is demonstrated. The paper also discusses related literature on paper assignment algorithms and strategic behavior in peer review. Randomized assignments have been used in other domains but have not been studied in relation to malicious reviewers or reviewer de-anonymization in peer review.
