The paper introduces the problem of searching for sequence mutations based on both high semantic change and grammatical validity, which is referred to as constrained semantic change search (CSCS). The authors propose a novel approach using learned language models to solve the CSCS problem and demonstrate its effectiveness in both natural language and biological applications, specifically in predicting viral escape. The paper presents empirical results showing that the proposed model achieves higher prediction accuracy compared to baseline methods and highlights the potential of using computational models to predict viral escape, enabling the design of vaccines or therapies before it occurs. The paper also provides a detailed explanation of the problem formulation and the algorithms used, including the language modeling architecture and the rank-based acquisition strategy.
