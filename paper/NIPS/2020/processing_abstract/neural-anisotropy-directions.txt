In this work, we analyze the role of the network architecture in shaping the inductive bias of deep classiﬁers. To that end, we start by focusing on a very simple problem, i.e., classifying a class of linearly separable distributions, and show that, depending on the direction of the discriminative feature of the distribution, many state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have a surprisingly hard time solving this simple task. We then deﬁne as neural anisotropy directions (NADs) the vectors that encapsulate the directional inductive bias of an architecture. These vectors, which are speciﬁc for each architecture and hence act as a signature, encode the preference of a network to separate the input data based on some particular features. We provide an efﬁcient method to identify NADs for severalCNN architectures and thus reveal their directional inductive biases. Furthermore, we show that, for the CIFAR-10 dataset, NADs characterize the features used byCNNs to discriminate between different classes.
