As machine learning has become more prevalent, researchers have begun to recog-nize the necessity of ensuring machine learning systems are fair. Recently, there has been an interest in deﬁning a notion of fairness that mitigates over-representation in traditional clustering.In this paper we extend this notion to hierarchical clustering, where the goal is to recursively partition the data to optimize a speciﬁc objective. For various natural objectives, we obtain simple, efﬁcient algorithms to ﬁnd a provably good fair hierarchical clustering. Empirically, we show that our algorithms can ﬁnd a fair hierarchical clustering, with only a negligible loss in the objective.
