Pruning has become a very powerful and effective technique to compress and accelerate modern neural networks. Existing pruning methods can be grouped into two categories: ﬁlter pruning (FP) and weight pruning (WP). FP wins at hardware compatibility but loses at the compression ratio compared with WP. To converge the strength of both methods, we propose to prune the ﬁlter in the ﬁlter. Speciﬁcally, we treat a ﬁlter F ∈ RC×K×K as K × K stripes, i.e., 1 × 1 ﬁlters ∈ RC, then by pruning the stripes instead of the whole ﬁlter, we can achieve ﬁner granularity than traditional FP while being hardware friendly. We term our method as SWP (Stripe-Wise Pruning). SWP is implemented by introducing a novel learnable matrix called Filter Skeleton, whose values reﬂect the shape of each ﬁlter. As some recent work has shown that the pruned architecture is more crucial than the inherited important weights, we argue that the architecture of a single ﬁlter, i.e., the shape, also matters. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SWP is more effective compared to the previous FP-based methods and achieves the state-of-art pruning ratio on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets without obvious accuracy drop.
