Modeling complex spatial and temporal correlations in the correlated time series data is indispensable for understanding the trafﬁc dynamics and predicting the future status of an evolving trafﬁc system. Recent works focus on designing com-plicated graph neural network architectures to capture shared patterns with the help of pre-deﬁned graphs. In this paper, we argue that learning node-speciﬁc patterns is essential for trafﬁc forecasting while the pre-deﬁned graph is avoidable. To this end, we propose two adaptive modules for enhancing Graph ConvolutionalNetwork (GCN) with new capabilities: 1) a Node Adaptive Parameter Learning (NAPL) module to capture node-speciﬁc patterns; 2) a Data Adaptive Graph Gen-eration (DAGG) module to infer the inter-dependencies among different trafﬁc series automatically. We further propose an Adaptive Graph Convolutional Recur-rent Network (AGCRN) to capture ﬁne-grained spatial and temporal correlations in trafﬁc series automatically based on the two modules and recurrent networks.Our experiments 1 on two real-world trafﬁc datasets show AGCRN outperforms state-of-the-art by a signiﬁcant margin without pre-deﬁned graphs about spatial connections.
