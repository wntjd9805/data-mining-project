Randomized smoothing is a recently proposed defense against adversarial attacks that has achieved state-of-the-art provable robustness against (cid:96)2 perturbations. A number of publications have extended the guarantees to other metrics, such as (cid:96)1 or (cid:96)∞, by using different smoothing measures. Although the current framework has been shown to yield near-optimal (cid:96)p radii, the total safety region certiﬁed by the current framework can be arbitrarily small compared to the optimal.In this work, we propose a framework to improve the certiﬁed safety region for these smoothed classiﬁers without changing the underlying smoothing scheme.The theoretical contributions are as follows: 1) We generalize the certiﬁcation for randomized smoothing by reformulating certiﬁed radius calculation as a nested optimization problem over a class of functions. 2) We provide a method to calcu-late the certiﬁed safety region using zeroth-order and ﬁrst-order information forGaussian-smoothed classiﬁers. We also provide a framework that generalizes the calculation for certiﬁcation using higher-order information. 3) We design efﬁcient, high-conﬁdence estimators for the relevant statistics of the ﬁrst-order information.Combining the theoretical contribution 2) and 3) allows us to certify safety region that are signiﬁcantly larger than the ones provided by the current methods. OnCIFAR10 and Imagenet datasets, the new regions certiﬁed by our approach achieve signiﬁcant improvements on general (cid:96)1 certiﬁed radii and on the (cid:96)2 certiﬁed radii for color-space attacks ((cid:96)2 perturbation restricted to only one color/channel) while also achieving smaller improvements on the general (cid:96)2 certiﬁed radii.As discussed in the future works section, our framework can also provide a way to circumvent the current impossibility results on achieving higher magnitudes of certiﬁed radii without requiring the use of data-dependent smoothing techniques.
