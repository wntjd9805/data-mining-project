Normalizing ﬂows have shown great promise for modelling ﬂexible probability distributions in a computationally tractable way. However, whilst data is often naturally described on Riemannian manifolds such as spheres, tori, and hyperbolic spaces, most normalizing ﬂows implicitly assume a ﬂat geometry, making them either misspeciﬁed or ill-suited in these situations. To overcome this problem, we introduce Riemannian continuous normalizing ﬂows, a model which admits the parametrization of ﬂexible probability measures on smooth manifolds by deﬁningﬂows as the solution to ordinary diﬀerential equations. We show that this approach can lead to substantial improvements on both synthetic and real-world data when compared to standard ﬂows or previously introduced projected ﬂows.
