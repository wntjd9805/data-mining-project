We study the problem of semi-supervised learning on graphs, for which graph neural networks (GNNs) have been extensively explored. However, most existingGNNs inherently suffer from the limitations of over-smoothing [6, 23, 24, 30], non-robustness [48, 45], and weak-generalization when labeled nodes are scarce.In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework—GRAPH RANDOMNEURAL NETWORKS (GRAND)—to address these issues. In GRAND, we ﬁrst design a random propagation strategy to perform graph data augmentation. Then we leverage consistency regularization to optimize the prediction consistency of unlabeled nodes across different data augmentations. Extensive experiments on graph benchmark datasets suggest that GRAND signiﬁcantly outperforms state-of-the-art GNN baselines on semi-supervised node classiﬁcation. Finally, we show that GRAND mitigates the issues of over-smoothing and non-robustness, exhibiting better generalization behavior than existing GNNs.
