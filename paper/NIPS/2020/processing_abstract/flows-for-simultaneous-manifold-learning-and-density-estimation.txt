-ﬂows), a new class of generative modelsWe introduce manifold-learning ﬂows (M that simultaneously learn the data manifold as well as a tractable probability density on that manifold. Combining aspects of normalizing ﬂows, GANs, autoencoders, and energy-based models, they have the potential to represent datasets with a manifold structure more faithfully and provide handles on dimensionality reduction, denoising, and out-of-distribution detection. We argue why such models should not be trained by maximum likelihood alone and present a new training algorithm that separates manifold and density updates. In a range of experiments we demonstrate how-ﬂows learn the data manifold and allow for better inference than standardﬂows in the ambient data space.M
