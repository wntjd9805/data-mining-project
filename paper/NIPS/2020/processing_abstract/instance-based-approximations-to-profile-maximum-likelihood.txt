In this paper we provide a new efﬁcient algorithm for approximately computing the proﬁle maximum likelihood (PML) distribution, a prominent quantity in symmetric property estimation. We provide an algorithm which matches the previous best known efﬁcient algorithms for computing approximate PML distributions and improves when the number of distinct observed frequencies in the given instance is small. We achieve this result by exploiting new sparsity structure in approximatePML distributions and providing a new matrix rounding algorithm, of independent interest. Leveraging this result, we obtain the ﬁrst provable computationally efﬁcient implementation of PseudoPML, a general framework for estimating a broad class of symmetric properties. Additionally, we obtain efﬁcient PML-based estimators for distributions with small proﬁle entropy, a natural instance-based complexity measure. Further, we provide a simpler and more practical PseudoPML implementation that matches the best-known theoretical guarantees of such an estimator and evaluate this method empirically.
