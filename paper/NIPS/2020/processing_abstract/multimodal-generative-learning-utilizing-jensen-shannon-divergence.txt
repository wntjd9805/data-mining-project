Learning from different data types is a long-standing goal in machine learning research, as multiple information sources co-occur when describing natural phe-nomena. However, existing generative models that approximate a multimodalELBO rely on difﬁcult or inefﬁcient training schemes to learn a joint distribution and the dependencies between modalities. In this work, we propose a novel, efﬁ-cient objective function that utilizes the Jensen-Shannon divergence for multiple distributions. It simultaneously approximates the unimodal and joint multimodal posteriors directly via a dynamic prior. In addition, we theoretically prove that the new multimodal JS-divergence (mmJSD) objective optimizes an ELBO. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantage of the proposed mmJSD model compared to previous work in unsupervised, generative learning tasks.
