Despite the vulnerability of object detectors to adversarial attacks, very few de-fenses are known to date. While adversarial training can improve the empirical robustness of image classiﬁers, a direct extension to object detection is very ex-pensive. This work is motivated by recent progress on certiﬁed classiﬁcation by randomized smoothing. We start by presenting a reduction from object detection to a regression problem. Then, to enable certiﬁed regression, where standard mean smoothing fails, we propose median smoothing, which is of independent interest.We obtain the ﬁrst model-agnostic, training-free, and certiﬁed defense for object detection against (cid:96)2-bounded attacks.
