This work addresses data-driven optimization problems, where the goal is to ﬁnd an input that maximizes an unknown score or reward function given access to a dataset of inputs with corresponding scores. When the inputs are high-dimensional and valid inputs consistute a small subset of this space (e.g., valid protein se-quences or valid natural images), such model-based optimization problems become exceptionally difﬁcult, since the optimizer must avoid out-of-distribution and in-valid inputs. We propose to address such problem with model inversion networks (MINs), which learn an inverse mapping from scores to inputs. MINs can scale to high-dimensional input spaces and leverage ofﬂine logged data for both con-textual and non-contextual optimization problems. MINs can also handle both purely ofﬂine data sources and active data collection. We evaluate MINs on high-dimensional model-based optimization problems over images, protein designs, and neural network controller parameters, and bandit optimization from logged data.
