While deep learning and deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems have demon-strated impressive results in domains such as image classiﬁcation, game playing, and robotic control, data efﬁciency remains a major challenge. Multi-task learning has emerged as a promising approach for sharing structure across multiple tasks to enable more efﬁcient learning. However, the multi-task setting presents a number of optimization challenges, making it difﬁcult to realize large efﬁciency gains com-pared to learning tasks independently. The reasons why multi-task learning is so challenging compared to single-task learning are not fully understood. In this work, we identify a set of three conditions of the multi-task optimization landscape that cause detrimental gradient interference, and develop a simple yet general approach for avoiding such interference between task gradients. We propose a form of gradi-ent surgery that projects a task’s gradient onto the normal plane of the gradient of any other task that has a conﬂicting gradient. On a series of challenging multi-task supervised and multi-task RL problems, this approach leads to substantial gains in efﬁciency and performance. Further, it is model-agnostic and can be combined with previously-proposed multi-task architectures for enhanced performance.
