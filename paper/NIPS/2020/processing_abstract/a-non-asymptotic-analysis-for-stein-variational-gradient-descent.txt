We study the Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm, which opti-mises a set of particles to approximate a target probability distribution π ∝ e−V on Rd. In the population limit, SVGD performs gradient descent in the space of probability distributions on the KL divergence with respect to π, where the gradient is smoothed through a kernel integral operator. In this paper, we provide a novel ﬁnite time analysis for the SVGD algorithm. We provide a descent lemma establishing that the algorithm decreases the objective at each iteration, and rates of convergence for the averaged Stein Fisher divergence (also referred to as KernelStein Discrepancy). We also provide a convergence result of the ﬁnite particle system corresponding to the practical implementation of SVGD to its population version.
