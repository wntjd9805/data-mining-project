Unlike in the traditional statistical modeling for which a user typically hand-specify a prior, Neural Processs (NPs) implicitly deﬁne a broad class of stochastic processes with neural networks. Given a data stream, NP learns a stochastic process that best describes the data. While this “data-driven” way of learning stochastic processes has proven to handle various types of data, NPs still rely on an assumption that uncertainty in stochastic processes is modeled by a single latent variable, which potentially limits the ﬂexibility. To this end, we propose the Bootstrapping NeuralProcess (BNP), a novel extension of the NP family using the bootstrap. The bootstrap is a classical data-driven technique for estimating uncertainty, which allows BNP to learn the stochasticity in NPs without assuming a particular form. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of BNP on various types of data and its robustness in the presence of model-data mismatch.
