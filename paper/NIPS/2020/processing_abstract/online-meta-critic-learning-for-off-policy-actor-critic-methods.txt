Off-Policy Actor-Critic (OffP-AC) methods have proven successful in a variety of continuous control tasks. Normally, the critic’s action-value function is updated using temporal-difference, and the critic in turn provides a loss for the actor that trains it to take actions with higher expected return. In this paper, we introduce aﬂexible meta-critic framework based on observing the learning process and meta-learning an additional loss for the actor that accelerates and improves actor-critic learning. Compared to existing meta-learning algorithms, meta-critic is rapidly learned online for a single task, rather than slowly over a family of tasks. Crucially, our meta-critic is designed for off-policy based learners, which currently provide state-of-the-art reinforcement learning sample efﬁciency. We demonstrate that online meta-critic learning beneﬁts to a variety of continuous control tasks when combined with contemporary OffP-AC methods DDPG, TD3 and SAC.
