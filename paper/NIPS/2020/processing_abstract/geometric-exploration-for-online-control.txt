We study the control of an unknown linear dynamical system under general convex costs. The objective is minimizing regret vs the class of strongly-stable linearIn this work, we ﬁrst consider the case of known cost functions, for policies. which we design the ﬁrst polynomial-time algorithm with n3T -regret, where n is the dimension of the state plus the dimension of control input. TheT -horizon dependence is optimal, and improves upon the previous best known bound of T 2/3. The main component of our algorithm is a novel geometric exploration strategy: we adaptively construct a sequence of barycentric spanners in an over-parameterized policy space. Second, we consider the case of bandit feedback, for which we give the ﬁrst polynomial-time algorithm with poly(n)T -regret, building on Stochastic Bandit Convex Optimization.√√√
