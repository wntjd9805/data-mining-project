Over-parametrization is an important technique in training neural networks. In both theory and practice, training a larger network allows the optimization algorithm to avoid bad local optimal solutions. In this paper we study a closely related tensor decomposition problem: given an l-th order tensor in (Rd)⊗l of rank r (where r (cid:28) d), can variants of gradient descent ﬁnd a rank m decomposition where m > r? We show that in a lazy training regime (similar to the NTK regime for neural networks) one needs at least m = Ω(dl−1), while a variant of gradient descent can ﬁnd an approximate tensor when m = O∗(r2.5l log d). Our results show that gradient descent on over-parametrized objective could go beyond the lazy training regime and utilize certain low-rank structure in the data.
