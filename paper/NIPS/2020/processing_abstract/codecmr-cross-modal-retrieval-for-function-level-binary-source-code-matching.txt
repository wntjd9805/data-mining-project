Binary source code matching, especially on function-level, has a critical role in the ﬁeld of computer security. Given binary code only, ﬁnding the corresponding source code improves the accuracy and efﬁciency in reverse engineering. Given source code only, related binary code retrieval contributes to known vulnerabilities conﬁrmation. However, due to the vast difference between source and binary code, few studies have investigated binary source code matching. Previously published studies focus on code literals extraction such as strings and integers, then utilize traditional matching algorithms such as the Hungarian algorithm for code matching. Nevertheless, these methods have limitations on function-level, because they ignore the potential semantic features of code and a lot of code lacks sufﬁcient code literals. Also, these methods indicate a need for expert experience for useful feature identiﬁcation and feature engineering, which is time-consuming. This paper proposes an end-to-end cross-modal retrieval network for binary source code matching, which achieves higher accuracy and requires less expert experience. We adopt Deep Pyramid Convolutional Neural Network (DPCNN) for source code feature extraction and Graph Neural Network (GNN) for binary code feature extraction. We also exploit neural network-based models to capture code literals, including strings and integers. Furthermore, we implement"norm weighted sampling" for negative sampling. We evaluate our model on two datasets, where it outperforms other methods signiﬁcantly.
