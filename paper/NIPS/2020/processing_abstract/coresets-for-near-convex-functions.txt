Coreset is usually a small weighted subset of n input points in Rd, that provably approximates their loss function for a given set of queries (models, classiﬁers, etc.). Coresets become increasingly common in machine learning since existing heuristics or inefﬁcient algorithms may be improved by running them possibly many times on the small coreset that can be maintained for streaming distributed data. Coresets can be obtained by sensitivity (importance) sampling, where its size is proportional to the total sum of sensitivities. Unfortunately, computing the sensitivity of each point is problem dependent and may be harder to compute than the original optimization problem at hand. We suggest a generic framework for computing sensitivities (and thus coresets) for wide family of loss functions which we call near-convex functions. This is by suggesting the f -SVD factorization that generalizes the SVD factorization of matrices to functions. Example applications include coresets that are either new or signiﬁcantly improves previous results, such as SVM, Logistic regression, M-estimators, and (cid:96)z-regression. Experimental results and open source are also provided.
