In this paper, we introduce a novel technique for constrained submodular maxi-mization, inspired by barrier functions in continuous optimization. This connec-tion not only improves the running time for constrained submodular maximization but also provides the state of the art guarantee. More precisely, for maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to the combination of a k-matchoid and (cid:96)-knapsack constraints (for (cid:96) k), we propose a potential function that can be ap-proximately minimized. Once we minimize the potential function up to an ε error, it is guaranteed that we have found a feasible set with a 2(k+1+ε)-approximation factor which can indeed be further improved to (k+1+ε) by an enumeration tech-nique. We extensively evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithm over several real-world applications, including a movie recommendation system, sum-marization tasks for YouTube videos, Twitter feeds and Yelp business locations, and a set cover problem.≤
