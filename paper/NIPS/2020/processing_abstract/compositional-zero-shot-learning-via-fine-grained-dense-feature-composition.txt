We develop a novel generative model for zero-shot learning to recognize ﬁne-grained unseen classes without training samples. Our observation is that generating holistic features of unseen classes fails to capture every attribute needed to dis-tinguish small differences among classes. We propose a feature composition framework that learns to extract attribute-based features from training samples and combines them to construct ﬁne-grained features for unseen classes. Feature composition allows us to not only selectively compose features of unseen classes from only relevant training samples, but also obtain diversity among composed features via changing samples used for composition. In addition, instead of build-ing a global feature of an unseen class, we use all attribute-based features to form a dense representation consisting of ﬁne-grained attribute details. To recognize unseen classes, we propose a novel training scheme that uses a discriminative model to construct features that are subsequently used to train itself. Therefore, we directly train the discriminative model on composed features without learning separate generative models. We conduct experiments on four popular datasets of DeepFashion, AWA2, CUB, and SUN, showing that our method signiﬁcantly improves the state of the art.
