We propose the ﬁrst general and practical framework to design certiﬁable algo-rithms for robust geometric perception in the presence of a large amount of outliers.We investigate the use of a truncated least squares (TLS) cost function, which is known to be robust to outliers, but leads to hard, nonconvex, and nonsmooth optimization problems. Our ﬁrst contribution is to show that –for a broad class of geometric perception problems– TLS estimation can be reformulated as an opti-mization over the ring of polynomials and Lasserre’s hierarchy of convex moment relaxations is empirically tight at the minimum relaxation order (i.e., certiﬁably ob-tains the global minimum of the nonconvex TLS problem). Our second contribution is to exploit the structural sparsity of the objective and constraint polynomials and leverage basis reduction to signiﬁcantly reduce the size of the semideﬁnite program (SDP) resulting from the moment relaxation, without compromising its tightness.Our third contribution is to develop scalable dual optimality certiﬁers from the lens of sums-of-squares (SOS) relaxation, that can compute the suboptimality gap and possibly certify global optimality of any candidate solution (e.g., returned by fast heuristics such as RANSAC or graduated non-convexity). Our dual certiﬁers leverage Douglas-Rachford Splitting to solve a convex feasibility SDP. Numerical experiments across different perception problems, including single rotation aver-aging, shape alignment, 3D point cloud and mesh registration, and high-integrity satellite pose estimation, demonstrate the tightness of our relaxations, the correct-ness of the certiﬁcation, and the scalability of the proposed dual certiﬁers to large problems, beyond the reach of current SDP solvers.1
