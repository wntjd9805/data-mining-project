Veriﬁcation and regression are two general methodologies for prediction in neural networks. Each has its own strengths: veriﬁcation can be easier to infer accurately, and regression is more efﬁcient and applicable to continuous target variables.Hence, it is often beneﬁcial to carefully combine them to take advantage of their beneﬁts. In this paper, we take this philosophy to improve state-of-the-art object detection, speciﬁcally by RepPoints. Though RepPoints provides high performance, we ﬁnd that its heavy reliance on regression for object localization leaves room for improvement. We introduce veriﬁcation tasks into the localization prediction of RepPoints, producing RepPoints v2, which provides consistent improvements of about 2.0 mAP over the original RepPoints on the COCO object detection benchmark using different backbones and training methods. RepPoints v2 also achieves 52.1 mAP on COCO test-dev by a single model. Moreover, we show that the proposed approach can more generally elevate other object detection frameworks as well as applications such as instance segmentation.
