Understanding the nature of representation in neural networks is a goal shared by neuroscience and machine learning. It is therefore exciting that both ﬁelds converge not only on shared questions but also on similar approaches. A pressing question in these areas is understanding how the structure of the representation used by neural networks affects both their generalization, and robustness to perturbations.In this work, we investigate the latter by juxtaposing experimental results regarding the covariance spectrum of neural representations in the mouse V1 (Stringer et al) with artiﬁcial neural networks. We use adversarial robustness to probe Stringer et al’s theory regarding the causal role of a 1/n covariance spectrum. We empiri-cally investigate the beneﬁts such a neural code confers in neural networks, and illuminate its role in multi-layer architectures. Our results show that imposing the experimentally observed structure on artiﬁcial neural networks makes them more robust to adversarial attacks. Moreover, our ﬁndings complement the existing theory relating wide neural networks to kernel methods, by showing the role of intermediate representations.
