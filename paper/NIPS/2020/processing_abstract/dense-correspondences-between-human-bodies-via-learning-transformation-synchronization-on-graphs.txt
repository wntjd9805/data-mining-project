We introduce an approach for establishing dense correspondences between par-tial scans of human models and a complete template model. Our approach’s key novelty lies in formulating dense correspondence computation as initializ-ing and synchronizing local transformations between the scan and the template model. We introduce an optimization formulation for synchronizing transforma-tions among a graph of the input scan, which automatically enforces smoothness of correspondences and recovers the underlying articulated deformations. We then show how to convert the iterative optimization procedure among a graph of the input scan into an end-to-end trainable network. The network design uti-lizes additional trainable parameters to break the barrier of the original optimiza-tion formulation’s exact and robust recovery conditions. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach considerably outperforms baseline approaches.
