Domain Adaptation (DA) enables transferring a learning machine from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target one. While remarkable advances have been made, most of the existing DA methods focus on improving the target accuracy at inference. How to estimate the predictive uncertainty of DA models is vital for decision-making in safety-critical scenarios but remains the boundary to explore. In this paper, we delve into the open problem of Calibration in DA, which is extremely challenging due to the coexistence of domain shift and the lack of target labels.We ﬁrst reveal the dilemma that DA models learn higher accuracy at the expense of well-calibrated probabilities. Driven by this ﬁnding, we propose TransferableCalibration (TransCal) to achieve more accurate calibration with lower bias and variance in a uniﬁed hyperparameter-free optimization framework. As a general post-hoc calibration method, TransCal can be easily applied to recalibrate existingDA methods. Its efﬁcacy has been justiﬁed both theoretically and empirically.
