Deep generative models have become increasingly effective at producing realistic images from randomly sampled seeds, but using such models for controllable manipulation of existing images remains challenging. We propose the SwappingAutoencoder, a deep model designed speciﬁcally for image manipulation, rather than random sampling. The key idea is to encode an image into two independent components and enforce that any swapped combination maps to a realistic image.In particular, we encourage the components to represent structure and texture, by enforcing one component to encode co-occurrent patch statistics across different parts of the image. As our method is trained with an encoder, ﬁnding the latent codes for a new input image becomes trivial, rather than cumbersome. As a result, our method enables us to manipulate real input images in various ways, including texture swapping, local and global editing, and latent code vector arithmetic. Experiments on multiple datasets show that our model produces better results and is substantially more efﬁcient compared to recent generative models.Figure 1: Our Swapping Autoencoder learns to disentangle texture from structure for image editing tasks. One such task is texture swapping, shown here. Please see our project webpage for a demo video of our editing method.
