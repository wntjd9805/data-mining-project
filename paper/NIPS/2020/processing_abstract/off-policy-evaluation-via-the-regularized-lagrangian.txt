The recently proposed distribution correction estimation (DICE) family of estima-tors has advanced the state of the art in off-policy evaluation from behavior-agnostic data. While these estimators all perform some form of stationary distribution cor-rection, they arise from different derivations and objective functions. In this paper, we unify these estimators as regularized Lagrangians of the same linear program.The uniﬁcation allows us to expand the space of DICE estimators to new alterna-tives that demonstrate improved performance. More importantly, by analyzing the expanded space of estimators both mathematically and empirically we ﬁnd that dual solutions offer greater ﬂexibility in navigating the tradeoff between optimization stability and estimation bias, and generally provide superior estimates in practice.
