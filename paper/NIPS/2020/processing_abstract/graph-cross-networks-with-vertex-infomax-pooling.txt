We propose a novel graph cross network (GXN) to achieve comprehensive fea-ture learning from multiple scales of a graph. Based on trainable hierarchical representations of a graph, GXN enables the interchange of intermediate features across scales to promote information ﬂow. Two key ingredients of GXN include a novel vertex infomax pooling (VIPool), which creates multiscale graphs in a trainable manner, and a novel feature-crossing layer, enabling feature interchange across scales. The proposed VIPool selects the most informative subset of vertices based on the neural estimation of mutual information between vertex features and neighborhood features. The intuition behind is that a vertex is informative when it can maximally reﬂect its neighboring information. The proposed feature-crossing layer fuses intermediate features between two scales for mutual enhancement by improving information ﬂow and enriching multiscale features at hidden layers. The cross shape of feature-crossing layer distinguishes GXN from many other multi-scale architectures. Experimental results show that the proposed GXN improves the classiﬁcation accuracy by 2.12% and 1.15% on average for graph classiﬁcation and vertex classiﬁcation, respectively. Based on the same network, the proposedVIPool consistently outperforms other graph-pooling methods.
