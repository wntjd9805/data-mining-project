Coresets are small data summaries that are sufﬁcient for model training. They can be maintained online, enabling efﬁcient handling of large data streams under resource constraints. However, existing constructions are limited to simple mod-els such as k-means and logistic regression. In this work, we propose a novel coreset construction via cardinality-constrained bilevel optimization. We show how our framework can efﬁciently generate coresets for deep neural networks, and demonstrate its empirical beneﬁts in continual learning and in streaming settings.
