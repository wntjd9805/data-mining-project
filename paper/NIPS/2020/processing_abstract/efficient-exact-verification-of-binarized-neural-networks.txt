Concerned with the reliability of neural networks, researchers have developed veri-ﬁcation techniques to prove their robustness. Most veriﬁers work with real-valued networks. Unfortunately, the exact (complete and sound) veriﬁers face scalability challenges and provide no correctness guarantees due to ﬂoating point errors. We argue that Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) provide comparable robustness and allow exact and signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient veriﬁcation. We present a new system, EEV, for efﬁcient and exact veriﬁcation of BNNs. EEV consists of two parts: (i) a novel SAT solver that speeds up BNN veriﬁcation by natively handling the reiﬁed cardinality constraints arising in BNN encodings; and (ii) strategies to train solver-friendly robust BNNs by inducing balanced layer-wise sparsity and low cardinality bounds, and adaptively cancelling the gradients. We demonstrate the ef-fectiveness of EEV by presenting the ﬁrst exact veriﬁcation results for (cid:96)∞-bounded adversarial robustness of nontrivial convolutional BNNs on the MNIST and CI-FAR10 datasets. Compared to exact veriﬁcation of real-valued networks of the same architectures on the same tasks, EEV veriﬁes BNNs hundreds to thousands of times faster, while delivering comparable veriﬁable accuracy in most cases.
