The vast majority of deep models use multiple gradient signals, typically corre-sponding to a sum of multiple loss terms, to update a shared set of trainable weights.However, these multiple updates can impede optimal training by pulling the model in conï¬‚icting directions. We present Gradient Sign Dropout (GradDrop), a proba-bilistic masking procedure which samples gradients at an activation layer based on their level of consistency. GradDrop is implemented as a simple deep layer that can be used in any deep net and synergizes with other gradient balancing approaches.We show that GradDrop outperforms the state-of-the-art multiloss methods within traditional multitask and transfer learning settings, and we discuss how GradDrop reveals links between optimal multiloss training and gradient stochasticity.
