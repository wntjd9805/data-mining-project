The Gumbel-Softmax is a continuous distribution over the simplex that is often used as a relaxation of discrete distributions. Because it can be readily interpreted and easily reparameterized, it enjoys widespread use. We propose a modular and more ﬂexible family of reparameterizable distributions where Gaussian noise is transformed into a one-hot approximation through an invertible function. This invertible function is composed of a modiﬁed softmax and can incorporate diverse transformations that serve different speciﬁc purposes. For example, the stick-breaking procedure allows us to extend the reparameterization trick to distributions with countably inﬁnite support, thus enabling the use of our distribution along nonparametric models, or normalizing ﬂows let us increase the ﬂexibility of the distribution. Our construction enjoys theoretical advantages over the Gumbel-Softmax, such as closed form KL, and signiﬁcantly outperforms it in a variety of experiments.
