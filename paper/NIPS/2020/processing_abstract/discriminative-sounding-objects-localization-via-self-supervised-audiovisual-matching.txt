Discriminatively localizing sounding objects in cocktail-party, i.e., mixed sound scenes, is commonplace for humans, but still challenging for machines. In this paper, we propose a two-stage learning framework to perform self-supervised class-aware sounding object localization. First, we propose to learn robust object representations by aggregating the candidate sound localization results in the single source scenes. Then, class-aware object localization maps are generated in the cocktail-party scenarios by referring the pre-learned object knowledge, and the sounding objects are accordingly selected by matching au-dio and visual object category distributions, where the audiovisual consistency is viewed as the self-supervised signal. Experimental results in both realis-tic and synthesized cocktail-party videos demonstrate that our model is supe-rior in Ô¨Åltering out silent objects and pointing out the location of sounding ob-jects of different classes.
