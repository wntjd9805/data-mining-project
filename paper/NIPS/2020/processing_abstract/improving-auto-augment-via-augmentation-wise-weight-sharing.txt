The recent progress on automatically searching augmentation policies has boosted the performance substantially for various tasks. A key component of automatic augmentation search is the evaluation process for a particular augmentation policy, which is utilized to return reward and usually runs thousands of times. A plain evaluation process, which includes full model training and validation, would be time-consuming. To achieve efﬁciency, many choose to sacriﬁce evaluation relia-bility for speed. In this paper, we dive into the dynamics of augmented training of the model. This inspires us to design a powerful and efﬁcient proxy task based on the Augmentation-Wise Weight Sharing (AWS) to form a fast yet accurate evaluation process in an elegant way. Comprehensive analysis veriﬁes the superi-ority of this approach in terms of effectiveness and efﬁciency. The augmentation policies found by our method achieve superior accuracies compared with existing auto-augmentation search methods. On CIFAR-10, we achieve a top-1 error rate of 1.24%, which is currently the best performing single model without extra training data. On ImageNet, we get a top-1 error rate of 20.36% for ResNet-50, which leads to 3.34% absolute error rate reduction over the baseline augmentation.
