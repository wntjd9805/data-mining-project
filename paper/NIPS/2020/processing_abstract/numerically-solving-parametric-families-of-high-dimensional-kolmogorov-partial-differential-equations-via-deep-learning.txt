We present a deep learning algorithm for the numerical solution of parametric fam-ilies of high-dimensional linear Kolmogorov partial differential equations (PDEs).Our method is based on reformulating the numerical approximation of a whole family of Kolmogorov PDEs as a single statistical learning problem using theFeynman-Kac formula. Successful numerical experiments are presented, which empirically conﬁrm the functionality and efﬁciency of our proposed algorithm in the case of heat equations and Black-Scholes option pricing models parametrized by afﬁne-linear coefﬁcient functions. We show that a single deep neural network trained on simulated data is capable of learning the solution functions of an entire family of PDEs on a full space-time region. Most notably, our numerical observa-tions and theoretical results also demonstrate that the proposed method does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality, distinguishing it from almost all standard numerical methods for PDEs.
