We consider the setting where players run the Hedge algorithm or its optimistic variant to play an n-action game repeatedly for T rounds.• For two-player games, we show that the regret of optimistic Hedge decays at rate O(1/T 5/6), improving the previous bound of O(1/T 3/4) by Syrgkanis,Agarwal, Luo and Schapire [27].• In contrast, we show that the convergence rate of vanilla Hedge is no betterT ), addressing an open question posed in Syrgkanis, Agarwal,√ than O(1/Luo and Schapire [27].For general m-player games, we show that the swap regret of each player decays atO(m1/2(n log n/T )3/4) when they combine optimistic Hedge with the classical external-to-internal reduction of Blum and Mansour [6]. Via standard connec-tions, our new (swap) regret bounds imply faster convergence to coarse correlated equilibria in two-player games and to correlated equilibria in multiplayer games.
