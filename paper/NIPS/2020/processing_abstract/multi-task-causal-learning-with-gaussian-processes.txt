This paper studies the problem of learning the correlation structure of a set of intervention functions deﬁned on the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of a causal model. This is useful when we are interested in jointly learning the causal effects of interventions on different subsets of variables in a DAG, which is common in ﬁeld such as healthcare or operations research. We propose the ﬁrst multi-task causalGaussian process (GP) model, which we call DAG-GP, that allows for information sharing across continuous interventions and across experiments on different vari-ables. DAG-GP accommodates different assumptions in terms of data availability and captures the correlation between functions lying in input spaces of different dimensionality via a well-deﬁned integral operator. We give theoretical results detailing when and how the DAG-GP model can be formulated depending on theDAG. We test both the quality of its predictions and its calibrated uncertainties.Compared to single-task models, DAG-GP achieves the best ﬁtting performance in a variety of real and synthetic settings. In addition, it helps to select optimal inter-ventions faster than competing approaches when used within sequential decision making frameworks, like active learning or Bayesian optimization.
