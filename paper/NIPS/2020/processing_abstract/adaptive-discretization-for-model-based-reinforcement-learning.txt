We introduce the technique of adaptive discretization to design an efﬁcient model-based episodic reinforcement learning algorithm in large (potentially continuous) state-action spaces. Our algorithm is based on optimistic one-step value iteration extended to maintain an adaptive discretization of the space. From a theoretical perspective we provide worst-case regret bounds for our algorithm which are competitive compared to the state-of-the-art model-based algorithms. Moreover, our bounds are obtained via a modular proof technique which can potentially extend to incorporate additional structure on the problem.From an implementation standpoint, our algorithm has much lower storage and computational requirements due to maintaining a more efﬁcient partition of the state and action spaces. We illustrate this via experiments on several canonical control problems, which shows that our algorithm empirically performs signiﬁcantly better than ﬁxed discretization in terms of both faster convergence and lower memory usage. Interestingly, we observe empirically that while ﬁxed discretization model-based algorithms vastly outperform their model-free counterparts, the two achieve comparable performance with adaptive discretization. 1
