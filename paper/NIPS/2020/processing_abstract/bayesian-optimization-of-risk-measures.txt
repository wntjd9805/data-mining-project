We consider Bayesian optimization of objective functions of the form ρ[F (x, W )], where F is a black-box expensive-to-evaluate function and ρ denotes either theVaR or CVaR risk measure, computed with respect to the randomness induced by the environmental random variable W . Such problems arise in decision making under uncertainty, such as in portfolio optimization and robust systems design. We propose a family of novel Bayesian optimization algorithms that exploit the struc-ture of the objective function to substantially improve sampling efﬁciency. Instead of modeling the objective function directly as is typical in Bayesian optimization, these algorithms model F as a Gaussian process, and use the implied posterior on the objective function to decide which points to evaluate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a variety of numerical experiments.
