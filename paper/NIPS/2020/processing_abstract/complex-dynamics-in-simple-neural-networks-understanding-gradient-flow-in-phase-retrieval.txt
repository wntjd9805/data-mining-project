Despite the widespread use of gradient-based algorithms for optimizing high-dimensional non-convex functions, understanding their ability of ﬁnding good minima instead of being trapped in spurious ones remains to a large extent an open problem. Here we focus on gradient ﬂow dynamics for phase retrieval from random measurements. When the ratio of the number of measurements over the input dimension is small the dynamics remains trapped in spurious minima with large basins of attraction. We ﬁnd analytically that above a critical ratio those critical points become unstable developing a negative direction toward the signal.By numerical experiments we show that in this regime the gradient ﬂow algorithm is not trapped; it drifts away from the spurious critical points along the unstable direction and succeeds in ﬁnding the global minimum. Using tools from statistical physics we characterize this phenomenon, which is related to a BBP-type transition in the Hessian of the spurious minima.
