In this paper, we study the problem of signal estimation from noisy non-linear measurements when the unknown n-dimensional signal is in the range of an L-Lipschitz continuous generative model with bounded k-dimensional inputs. We make the assumption of sub-Gaussian measurements, which is satisﬁed by a wide range of measurement models, such as linear, logistic, 1-bit, and other quantized models. In addition, we consider the impact of adversarial corruptions on these measurements. Our analysis is based on a generalized Lasso approach (Plan andVershynin, 2016). We ﬁrst provide a non-uniform recovery guarantee, which states that under i.i.d. Gaussian measurements, roughly O (cid:0) k (cid:15)2 log L(cid:1) samples sufﬁce for recovery with an (cid:96)2-error of (cid:15), and that this scheme is robust to adversarial noise.Then, we apply this result to neural network generative models, and discuss various extensions to other models and non-i.i.d. measurements. Moreover, we show that our result can be extended to the uniform recovery guarantee under the assumption of a so-called local embedding property, which is satisﬁed by the 1-bit and censoredTobit models.
