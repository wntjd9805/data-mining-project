This paper describes a simple technique to analyze Generative Adversarial Net-works (GANs) and create interpretable controls for image synthesis, such as change of viewpoint, aging, lighting, and time of day. We identify important latent direc-tions based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied either in latent space or feature space. Then, we show that a large number of interpretable controls can be deﬁned by layer-wise perturbation along the principal directions. Moreover, we show that BigGAN can be controlled with layer-wise inputs in a StyleGAN-like manner. We show results on different GANs trained on various datasets, and demon-strate good qualitative matches to edit directions found through earlier supervised approaches.
