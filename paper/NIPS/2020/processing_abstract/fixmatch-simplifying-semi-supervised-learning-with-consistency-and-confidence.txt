Semi-supervised learning (SSL) provides an effective means of leveraging unla-beled data to improve a model’s performance. This domain has seen fast progress recently, at the cost of requiring more complex methods. In this paper we proposeFixMatch, an algorithm that is a signiﬁcant simpliﬁcation of existing SSL methods.FixMatch ﬁrst generates pseudo-labels using the model’s predictions on weakly-augmented unlabeled images. For a given image, the pseudo-label is only retained if the model produces a high-conﬁdence prediction. The model is then trained to predict the pseudo-label when fed a strongly-augmented version of the same image. Despite its simplicity, we show that FixMatch achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of standard semi-supervised learning benchmarks, including 94.93% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with 250 labels and 88.61% accuracy with 40 – just 4 labels per class. We carry out an extensive ablation study to tease apart the experimental factors that are most important to FixMatch’s success. The code is available at https://github.com/google-research/fixmatch.
