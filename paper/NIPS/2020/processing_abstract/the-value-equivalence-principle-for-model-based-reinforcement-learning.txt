Learning models of the environment from data is often viewed as an essential com-ponent to building intelligent reinforcement learning (RL) agents. The common practice is to separate the learning of the model from its use, by constructing a model of the environment’s dynamics that correctly predicts the observed state transitions. In this paper we argue that the limited representational resources of model-based RL agents are better used to build models that are directly useful for value-based planning. As our main contribution, we introduce the principle of value equivalence: two models are value equivalent with respect to a set of functions and policies if they yield the same Bellman updates. We propose a for-mulation of the model learning problem based on the value equivalence principle and analyze how the set of feasible solutions is impacted by the choice of policies and functions. Speciﬁcally, we show that, as we augment the set of policies and functions considered, the class of value equivalent models shrinks, until eventu-ally collapsing to a single point corresponding to a model that perfectly describes the environment. In many problems, directly modelling state-to-state transitions may be both difﬁcult and unnecessary. By leveraging the value-equivalence prin-ciple one may ﬁnd simpler models without compromising performance, saving computation and memory. We illustrate the beneﬁts of value-equivalent model learning with experiments comparing it against more traditional counterparts like maximum likelihood estimation. More generally, we argue that the principle of value equivalence underlies a number of recent empirical successes in RL, such asValue Iteration Networks, the Predictron, Value Prediction Networks, TreeQN, andMuZero, and provides a ﬁrst theoretical underpinning of those results.
