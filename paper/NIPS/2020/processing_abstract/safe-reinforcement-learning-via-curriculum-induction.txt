In safety-critical applications, autonomous agents may need to learn in an envi-ronment where mistakes can be very costly. In such settings, the agent needs to behave safely not only after but also while learning. To achieve this, existing safe reinforcement learning methods make an agent rely on priors that let it avoid dangerous situations during exploration with high probability, but both the prob-abilistic guarantees and the smoothness assumptions inherent in the priors are not viable in many scenarios of interest such as autonomous driving. This paper presents an alternative approach inspired by human teaching, where an agent learns under the supervision of an automatic instructor that saves the agent from violating constraints during learning. In this new model, the instructor needs to know neither how to do well at the task the agent is learning, nor how the environment works.Instead, it has a library of reset controllers that it activates when the agent starts behaving dangerously, preventing it from doing damage. Crucially, the choices of which reset controller to apply in which situation affect the speed of agent learning.Based on observing agents’ progress, the teacher itself learns a policy for choosing the reset controllers, a curriculum, to optimize the agent’s ﬁnal policy reward.Our experiments use this framework in two challenging environments to induce curricula for safe and efﬁcient learning.
