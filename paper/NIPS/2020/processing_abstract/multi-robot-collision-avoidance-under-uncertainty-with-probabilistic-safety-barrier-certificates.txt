Safety in terms of collision avoidance for multi-robot systems is a difﬁcult challenge under uncertainty, non-determinism and lack of complete information. This paper aims to propose a collision avoidance method that accounts for both measurement uncertainty and motion uncertainty. In particular, we propose Probabilistic SafetyBarrier Certiﬁcates (PrSBC) using Control Barrier Functions to deﬁne the space of admissible control actions that are probabilistically safe with formally provable theoretical guarantee. By formulating the chance constrained safety set into deter-ministic control constraints with PrSBC, the method entails minimally modifying an existing controller to determine an alternative safe controller via quadratic pro-gramming constrained to PrSBC constraints. The key advantage of the approach is that no assumptions about the form of uncertainty are required other than ﬁnite support, also enabling worst-case guarantees. We demonstrate effectiveness of the approach through experiments on realistic simulation environments.
