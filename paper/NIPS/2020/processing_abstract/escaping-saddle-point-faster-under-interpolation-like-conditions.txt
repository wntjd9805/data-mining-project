In this paper, we show that under over-parametrization several standard stochastic optimization algorithms escape saddle-points and converge to local-minimizers much faster. One of the fundamental aspects of over-parametrized models is that they are capable of interpolating the training data. We show that, under interpolation-like assumptions satisﬁed by the stochastic gradients in an over-parametrization setting, the ﬁrst-order oracle complexity of Perturbed StochasticGradient Descent (PSGD) algorithm to reach an ✏-local-minimizer, matches the corresponding deterministic rate of ˜ (1/✏2). We next analyze Stochastic Cubic-ORegularized Newton (SCRN) algorithm under interpolation-like conditions, and show that the oracle complexity to reach an ✏-local-minimizer under interpolation-like conditions, is ˜ (1/✏2.5). While this obtained complexity is better than theO corresponding complexity of either PSGD, or SCRN without interpolation-like assumptions, it does not match the rate of ˜ (1/✏1.5) corresponding to deterministicOCubic-Regularized Newton method. It seems further Hessian-based interpolation-like assumptions are necessary to bridge this gap. We also discuss the corresponding improved complexities in the zeroth-order settings.
