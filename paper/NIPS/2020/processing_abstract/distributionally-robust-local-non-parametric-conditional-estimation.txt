Conditional estimation given speciﬁc covariate values (i.e., local conditional estima-tion or functional estimation) is ubiquitously useful with applications in engineer-ing, social and natural sciences. Existing data-driven non-parametric estimators mostly focus on structured homogeneous data (e.g., weakly independent and sta-tionary data), thus they are sensitive to adversarial noise and may perform poorly under a low sample size. To alleviate these issues, we propose a new distribution-ally robust estimator that generates non-parametric local estimates by minimizing the worst-case conditional expected loss over all adversarial distributions in aWasserstein ambiguity set. We show that despite being generally intractable, the local estimator can be efﬁciently found via convex optimization under broadly applicable settings, and it is robust to the corruption and heterogeneity of the data.Experiments with synthetic and MNIST datasets show the competitive performance of this new class of estimators.
