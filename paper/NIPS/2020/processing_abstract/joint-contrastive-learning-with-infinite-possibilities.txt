This paper explores useful modiﬁcations of the recent development in contrastive learning via novel probabilistic modeling. We derive a particular form of con-trastive loss named Joint Contrastive Learning (JCL). JCL implicitly involves the simultaneous learning of an inﬁnite number of query-key pairs, which poses tighter constraints when searching for invariant features. We derive an upper bound on this formulation that allows analytical solutions in an end-to-end training man-ner. While JCL is practically effective in numerous computer vision applications, we also theoretically unveil the certain mechanisms that govern the behavior ofJCL. We demonstrate that the proposed formulation harbors an innate agency that strongly favors similarity within each instance-speciﬁc class, and therefore remains advantageous when searching for discriminative features among distinct instances. We evaluate these proposals on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating considerable improvements over existing algorithms.
