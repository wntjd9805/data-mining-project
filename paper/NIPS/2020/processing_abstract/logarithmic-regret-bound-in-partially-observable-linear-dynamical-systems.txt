We study the problem of system identiﬁcation and adaptive control in partially ob-servable linear dynamical systems. Adaptive and closed-loop system identiﬁcation is a challenging problem due to correlations introduced in data collection. In this paper, we present the ﬁrst model estimation method with ﬁnite-time guarantees in both open and closed-loop system identiﬁcation. Deploying this estimation method, we propose adaptive control online learning (ADAPTON), an efﬁcient reinforcement learning algorithm that adaptively learns the system dynamics and continuously updates its controller through online learning steps. ADAPTON estimates the model dynamics by occasionally solving a linear regression problem through interac-tions with the environment. Using policy re-parameterization and the estimated model, ADAPTON constructs counterfactual loss functions to be used for updating the controller through online gradient descent. Over time, ADAPTON improves its model estimates and obtains more accurate gradient updates to improve the controller. We show that ADAPTON achieves a regret upper bound of polylog (T ), after T time steps of agent-environment interaction. To the best of our knowledge,ADAPTON is the ﬁrst algorithm that achieves polylog (T ) regret in adaptive control of unknown partially observable linear dynamical systems which includes linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control.
