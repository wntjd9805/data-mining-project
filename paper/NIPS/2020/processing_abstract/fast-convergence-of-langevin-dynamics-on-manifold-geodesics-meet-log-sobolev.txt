Sampling is a fundamental and arguably very important task with numerous appli-cations in Machine Learning. One approach to sample from a high dimensional distribution e−f for some function f is the Langevin Algorithm (LA). Recently, there has been a lot of progress in showing fast convergence of LA even in cases where f is non-convex, notably Vempala and Wibisono [2019], Moitra and Risteski[2020] in which the former paper focuses on functions f deﬁned in Rn and the latter paper focuses on functions with symmetries (like matrix completion type objectives) with manifold structure. Our work generalizes the results of Vempala and Wibisono [2019] where f is deﬁned on a manifold M rather than Rn. From technical point of view, we show that KL decreases in a geometric rate whenever the distribution e−f satisﬁes a log-Sobolev inequality on M .
