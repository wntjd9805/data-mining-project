We tackle the problem of establishing dense pixel-wise correspondences between a pair of images. In this work, we introduce Dual-Resolution CorrespondenceNetworks (DualRC-Net), to obtain pixel-wise correspondences in a coarse-to-ﬁne manner. DualRC-Net extracts both coarse- and ﬁne- resolution feature maps. The coarse maps are used to produce a full but coarse 4D correlation tensor, which is then reﬁned by a learnable neighbourhood consensus module. The ﬁne-resolution feature maps are used to obtain the ﬁnal dense correspondences guided by the re-ﬁned coarse 4D correlation tensor. The selected coarse-resolution matching scores allow the ﬁne-resolution features to focus only on a limited number of possible matches with high conﬁdence. In this way, DualRC-Net dramatically increases matching reliability and localisation accuracy, while avoiding to apply the expen-sive 4D convolution kernels on ﬁne-resolution feature maps. We comprehensively evaluate our method on large-scale public benchmarks including HPatches, InLoc, and Aachen Day-Night. It achieves the state-of-the-art results on all of them.
