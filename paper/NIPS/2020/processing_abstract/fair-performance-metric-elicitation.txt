What is a fair performance metric? We consider the choice of fairness metrics through the lens of metric elicitation – a principled framework for selecting perfor-mance metrics that best reﬂect implicit preferences. The use of metric elicitation enables a practitioner to tune the performance and fairness metrics to the task, context, and population at hand. Speciﬁcally, we propose a novel strategy to elicit group-fair performance metrics for multiclass classiﬁcation problems with multi-ple sensitive groups that also includes selecting the trade-off between predictive performance and fairness violation. The proposed elicitation strategy requires only relative preference feedback and is robust to both ﬁnite sample and feedback noise.
