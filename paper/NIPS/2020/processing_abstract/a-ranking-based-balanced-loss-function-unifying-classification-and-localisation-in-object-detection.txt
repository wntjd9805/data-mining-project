We propose average Localisation-Recall-Precision (aLRP), a uniﬁed, bounded, balanced and ranking-based loss function for both classiﬁcation and localisation tasks in object detection. aLRP extends the Localisation-Recall-Precision (LRP) performance metric (Oksuz et al., 2018) inspired from how Average Precision (AP)Loss extends precision to a ranking-based loss function for classiﬁcation (Chen et al., 2020). aLRP has the following distinct advantages: (i) aLRP is the ﬁrst ranking-based loss function for both classiﬁcation and localisation tasks. (ii) Thanks to using ranking for both tasks, aLRP naturally enforces high-quality localisation for high-precision classiﬁcation. (iii) aLRP provides provable balance between positives and negatives. (iv) Compared to on average ∼6 hyperparameters in the loss functions of state-of-the-art detectors, aLRP Loss has only one hyperparameter, which we did not tune in practice. On the COCO dataset, aLRP Loss improves its ranking-based predecessor, AP Loss, up to around 5 AP points, achieves 48.9AP without test time augmentation and outperforms all one-stage detectors.
