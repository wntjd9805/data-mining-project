We establish a theoretical link between adversarial training and operator norm regularization for deep neural networks. Speciﬁcally, we prove that `p-norm constrained projected gradient ascent based adversarial training with an `q-norm loss on the logits of clean and perturbed inputs is equivalent to data-dependent (p, q) operator norm regularization. This fundamental connection conﬁrms the long-standing argument that a network’s sensitivity to adversarial examples is tied to its spectral properties and hints at novel ways to robustify and defend against adversarial attacks. We provide extensive empirical evidence on state-of-the-art network architectures to support our theoretical results.
