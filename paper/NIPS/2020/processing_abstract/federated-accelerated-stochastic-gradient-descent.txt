We propose Federated Accelerated Stochastic Gradient Descent (FEDAC), a princi-pled acceleration of Federated Averaging (FEDAVG, also known as Local SGD) for distributed optimization. FEDAC is the ﬁrst provable acceleration of FEDAVG that improves convergence speed and communication efﬁciency on various types of convex functions. For example, for strongly convex and smooth functions, when using M workers, the previous state-of-the-art FEDAVG analysis can achieve a linear speedup in M if given ˜ (M ) rounds of synchronization, whereas FEDACO only requires ˜ 3 ) rounds. Moreover, we prove stronger guarantees for FEDAC (MO when the objectives are third-order smooth. Our technique is based on a potential-based perturbed iterate analysis, a novel stability analysis of generalized acceleratedSGD, and a strategic tradeoff between acceleration and stability. 1
