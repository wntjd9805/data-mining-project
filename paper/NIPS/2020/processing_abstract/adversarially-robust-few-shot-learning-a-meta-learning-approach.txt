Previous work on adversarially robust neural networks for image classiﬁcation requires large training sets and computationally expensive training procedures.On the other hand, few-shot learning methods are highly vulnerable to adversar-ial examples. The goal of our work is to produce networks which both perform well at few-shot classiﬁcation tasks and are simultaneously robust to adversarial examples. We develop an algorithm, called Adversarial Querying (AQ), for produc-ing adversarially robust meta-learners, and we thoroughly investigate the causes for adversarial vulnerability. Moreover, our method achieves far superior robust performance on few-shot image classiﬁcation tasks, such as Mini-ImageNet andCIFAR-FS, than robust transfer learning.
