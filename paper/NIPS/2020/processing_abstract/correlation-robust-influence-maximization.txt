We propose a distributionally robust model for the inﬂuence maximization problem.Unlike the classic independent cascade model [16], this model’s diffusion process is adversarially adapted to the choice of seed set. Hence, instead of optimizing under the assumption that all inﬂuence relationships in the network are independent, we seek a seed set whose expected inﬂuence under the worst correlation, i.e. the“worst-case, expected inﬂuence", is maximized. We show that this worst-case inﬂuence can be efﬁciently computed, and though the optimization is NP-hard, a (1 − 1/e) approximation guarantee holds. We also analyze the structure to the adversary’s choice of diffusion process, and contrast with established models.Beyond the key computational advantages, we also highlight the extent to which the independence assumption may cost optimality, and provide insights from numerical experiments comparing the adversarial and independent cascade model.
