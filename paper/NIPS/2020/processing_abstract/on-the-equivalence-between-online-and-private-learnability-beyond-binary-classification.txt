Alon et al. [4] and Bun et al. [10] recently showed that online learnability and private PAC learnability are equivalent in binary classiﬁcation. We investigate whether this equivalence extends to multi-class classiﬁcation and regression. First, we show that private learnability implies online learnability in both settings. Our extension involves studying a novel variant of the Littlestone dimension that de-pends on a tolerance parameter and on an appropriate generalization of the concept of threshold functions beyond binary classiﬁcation. Second, we show that while online learnability continues to imply private learnability in multi-class classiﬁ-cation, current proof techniques encounter signiﬁcant hurdles in the regression setting. While the equivalence for regression remains open, we provide non-trivial sufﬁcient conditions for an online learnable class to also be privately learnable.
