Value function approximation has demonstrated phenomenal empirical success in reinforcement learning (RL). Nevertheless, despite a handful of recent progress on developing theory for RL with linear function approximation, the understanding of general function approximation schemes largely remains missing. In this paper, we establish the ﬁrst provably efﬁcient RL algorithm with general value function approximation. We show that if the value functions admit an approximation withO(poly(dH)pT ) a function class, our algorithm achieves a regret bound ofF where d is a complexity measure of that depends on the eluder dimension [Russo and Van Roy, 2013] and log-covering numbers, H is the planning horizon, andT is the number interactions with the environment. Our theory generalizes the linear MDP assumption to general function classes. Moreover, our algorithm is model-free and provides a framework to justify the effectiveness of algorithms used in practice.F e
