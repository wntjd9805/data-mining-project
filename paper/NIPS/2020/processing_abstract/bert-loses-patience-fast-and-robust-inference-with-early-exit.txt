In this paper, we propose Patience-based Early Exit, a straightforward yet effective inference method that can be used as a plug-and-play technique to simultaneously improve the efﬁciency and robustness of a pretrained language model (PLM). To achieve this, our approach couples an internal-classiﬁer with each layer of a PLM and dynamically stops inference when the intermediate predictions of the internal classiﬁers remain unchanged for a pre-deﬁned number of steps. Our approach improves inference efﬁciency as it allows the model to make a prediction with fewer layers. Meanwhile, experimental results with an ALBERT model show that our method can improve the accuracy and robustness of the model by preventing it from overthinking and exploiting multiple classiﬁers for prediction, yielding a better accuracy-speed trade-off compared to existing early exit methods.2
