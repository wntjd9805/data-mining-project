Various differentially private algorithms instantiate the exponential mechanism, and require sampling from the distribution exp(−f ) for a suitable function f . When the domain of the distribution is high-dimensional, this sampling can be computa-tionally challenging. Using heuristic sampling schemes such as Gibbs sampling does not necessarily lead to provable privacy. When f is convex, techniques from log-concave sampling lead to polynomial-time algorithms, albeit with large poly-nomials. Langevin dynamics-based algorithms offer much faster alternatives under some distance measures such as statistical distance. In this work, we establish rapid convergence for these algorithms under distance measures more suitable for differential privacy. For smooth, strongly-convex f , we give the ﬁrst results proving convergence in Rényi divergence. This gives us fast differentially private algorithms for such f . Our techniques and simple and generic and apply also to underdamped Langevin dynamics.
