Graph convolution networks (GCNs) have become effective models for graph classiﬁcation. Similar to many deep networks, GCNs are vulnerable to adversar-ial attacks on graph topology and node attributes. Recently, a number of effective attack and defense algorithms have been designed, but no certiﬁcate of robustness has been developed for GCN-based graph classiﬁcation under topological pertur-bations with both local and global budgets. In this paper, we propose the ﬁrst certiﬁcate for this problem. Our method is based on Lagrange dualization and convex envelope, which result in tight approximation bounds that are efﬁciently computable by dynamic programming. When used in conjunction with robust training, it allows an increased number of graphs to be certiﬁed as robust.
