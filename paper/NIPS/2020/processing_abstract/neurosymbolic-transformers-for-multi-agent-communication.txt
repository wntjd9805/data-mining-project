We study the problem of inferring communication structures that can solve coop-erative multi-agent planning problems while minimizing the amount of commu-nication. We quantify the amount of communication as the maximum degree of the communication graph; this metric captures settings where agents have limited bandwidth. Minimizing communication is challenging due to the combinatorial na-ture of both the decision space and the objective; for instance, we cannot solve this problem by training neural networks using gradient descent. We propose a novel algorithm that synthesizes a control policy that combines a programmatic com-munication policy used to generate the communication graph with a transformer policy network used to choose actions. Our algorithm ﬁrst trains the transformer policy, which implicitly generates a “soft” communication graph; then, it synthe-sizes a programmatic communication policy that “hardens” this graph, forming a neurosymbolic transformer. Our experiments demonstrate how our approach can synthesize policies that generate low-degree communication graphs while maintaining near-optimal performance.
