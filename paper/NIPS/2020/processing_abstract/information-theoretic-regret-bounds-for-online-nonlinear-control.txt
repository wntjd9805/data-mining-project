This work studies the problem of sequential control in an unknown, nonlinear dy-namical system, where we model the underlying system dynamics as an unknown function in a known Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. This framework yields a general setting that permits discrete and continuous control inputs as well as non-smooth, non-differentiable dynamics. Our main result, the Lower Conﬁdence-based Continuous Control (LC3) algorithm, enjoys a near-optimal O(T ) regret bound against the optimal controller in episodic settings, where T is the number of episodes. The bound has no explicit dependence on dimension of the system dy-namics, which could be inﬁnite, but instead only depends on information theoretic quantities. We empirically show its application to a number of nonlinear control tasks and demonstrate the beneﬁt of exploration for learning model dynamics.√
