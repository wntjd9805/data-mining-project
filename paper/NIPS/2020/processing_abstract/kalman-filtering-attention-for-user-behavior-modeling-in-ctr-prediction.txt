Click-through rate (CTR) prediction is one of the fundamental tasks for e-commerce search engines. As search becomes more personalized, it is necessary to capture the user interest from rich behavior data. Existing user behavior modeling algorithms develop different attention mechanisms to emphasize query-relevant behaviors and suppress irrelevant ones. Despite being extensively studied, these attentions still suffer from two limitations. First, conventional attentions mostly limit the attentionﬁeld only to a single user’s behaviors, which is not suitable in e-commerce where users often hunt for new demands that are irrelevant to any historical behaviors.Second, these attentions are usually biased towards frequent behaviors, which is unreasonable since high frequency does not necessarily indicate great importance.To tackle the two limitations, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termedKalman Filtering Attention (KFAtt), that considers the weighted pooling in at-tention as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. By incorporating a priori,KFAtt resorts to global statistics when few user behaviors are relevant. Moreover, a frequency capping mechanism is incorporated to correct the bias towards frequent behaviors. Ofﬂine experiments on both benchmark and a 10 billion scale real production dataset, together with an Online A/B test, show that KFAtt outperforms all compared state-of-the-arts. KFAtt has been deployed in the ranking system ofJD.com, one of the largest B2C e-commerce websites in China, serving the main trafﬁc of hundreds of millions of active users.
