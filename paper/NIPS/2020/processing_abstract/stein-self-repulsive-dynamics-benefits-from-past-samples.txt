We propose a new Stein self-repulsive dynamics for obtaining diversiﬁed sam-ples from intractable un-normalized distributions. Our idea is to introduce Stein variational gradient as a repulsive force to push the samples of Langevin dynam-ics away from the past trajectories. This simple idea allows us to signiﬁcantly decrease the auto-correlation in Langevin dynamics and hence increase the ef-fective sample size. Importantly, as we establish in our theoretical analysis, the asymptotic stationary distribution remains correct even with the addition of the repulsive force, thanks to the special properties of the Stein variational gradient.We perform extensive empirical studies of our new algorithm, showing that our method yields much higher sample efﬁciency and better uncertainty estimation than vanilla Langevin dynamics.
