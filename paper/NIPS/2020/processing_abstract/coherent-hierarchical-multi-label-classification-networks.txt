Hierarchical multi-label classiﬁcation (HMC) is a challenging classiﬁcation task extending standard multi-label classiﬁcation problems by imposing a hierarchy con-straint on the classes. In this paper, we propose C-HMCNN(h), a novel approach for HMC problems, which, given a network h for the underlying multi-label classi-ﬁcation problem, exploits the hierarchy information in order to produce predictions coherent with the constraint and improve performance. We conduct an extensive experimental analysis showing the superior performance of C-HMCNN(h) when compared to state-of-the-art models.
