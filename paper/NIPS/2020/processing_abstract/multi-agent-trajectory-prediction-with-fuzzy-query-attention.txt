Trajectory prediction for scenes with multiple agents and entities is a challenging problem in numerous domains such as trafﬁc prediction, pedestrian tracking and path planning. We present a general architecture to address this challenge which models the crucial inductive biases of motion, namely, inertia, relative motion, intents and interactions. Speciﬁcally, we propose a relational model to ﬂexibly model interactions between agents in diverse environments. Since it is well-known that human decision making is fuzzy by nature, at the core of our model lies a novel attention mechanism which models interactions by making continuous-valued (fuzzy) decisions and learning the corresponding responses. Our architecture demonstrates signiﬁcant performance gains over existing state-of-the-art predictive models in diverse domains such as human crowd trajectories, US freeway trafﬁc,NBA sports data and physics datasets. We also present ablations and augmentations to understand the decision-making process and the source of gains in our model.
