This paper focuses on estimating probability distributions over the set of 3D ro-tations (SO(3)) using deep neural networks. Learning to regress models to the set of rotations is inherently difﬁcult due to differences in topology betweenRN and SO(3). We overcome this issue by using a neural network to out-put the parameters for a matrix Fisher distribution since these parameters are homeomorphic to R9. By using a negative log likelihood loss for this distri-bution we get a loss which is convex with respect to the network outputs. By optimizing this loss we improve state-of-the-art on several challenging applica-ble datasets, namely Pascal3D+, ModelNet10-SO(3).
