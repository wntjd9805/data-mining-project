Flow models have recently made great progress at modeling ordinal discrete data such as images and audio. Due to the continuous nature of ﬂow models, dequantization is typically applied when using them for such discrete data, resulting in lower bound estimates of the likelihood. In this paper, we introduce subsetﬂows, a class of ﬂows that can tractably transform ﬁnite volumes and thus allow exact computation of likelihoods for discrete data. Based on subset ﬂows, we identify ordinal discrete autoregressive models, including WaveNets, PixelCNNs and Transformers, as single-layer ﬂows. We use the ﬂow formulation to compare models trained and evaluated with either the exact likelihood or its dequantization lower bound. Finally, we study multilayer ﬂows composed of PixelCNNs and non-autoregressive coupling layers and demonstrate state-of-the-art results onCIFAR-10 for ﬂow models trained with dequantization.
