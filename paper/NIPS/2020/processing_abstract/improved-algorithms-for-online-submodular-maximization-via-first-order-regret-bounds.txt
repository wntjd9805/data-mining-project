We consider the problem of nonnegative submodular maximization in the online setting. At time step t, an algorithm selects a set St ∈ C ⊆ 2V where C is a feasible family of sets. An adversary then reveals a submodular function ft. The goal is to design an efﬁcient algorithm for minimizing the expected approximate regret.In this work, we give a general approach for improving regret bounds in online submodular maximization by exploiting “ﬁrst-order” regret bounds for online linear optimization.• For monotone submodular maximization subject to a matroid, we give an efﬁcient algorithm which achieves a (1 − c/e − ε)-regret of O((cid:112)kT ln(n/k)) where n is the size of the ground set, k is the rank of the matroid, ε > 0 is a constant, and c is the average curvature. Even without assuming any curvature (i.e., taking c = 1), this regret bound improves on previous results of Streeter et al. (2009) and Golovin et al. (2014).√• For nonmonotone, unconstrained submodular functions, we give an algorithm nT ), improving on the results of Roughgarden and Wang with 1/2-regret O( (2018). Our approach is based on Blackwell approachability; in particular, we give a novel ﬁrst-order regret bound for the Blackwell instances that arise in this setting.
