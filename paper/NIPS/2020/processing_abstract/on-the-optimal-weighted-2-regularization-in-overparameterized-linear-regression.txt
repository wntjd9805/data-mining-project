We estimate β(cid:63) via generalized (weighted) ridge regression:ˆβλ = (X (cid:62)X + λΣw)†X (cid:62)y, where Σw is the weighting matrix. Under a ran-dom design setting with general data covariance Σx and general prior on the true coefﬁcients Eβ(cid:63)β(cid:62)(cid:63) = Σβ, we provide an exact characterization of the prediction). Our risk E(y general setup leads to a number of interesting ﬁndings. We outline precise condi-tions that decide the sign of the optimal choice λopt of the ridge parameter λ, based on the alignment between Σx and Σβ; this rigorously justiﬁes the surprising em-pirical observation that λopt can be negative in the overparameterized regime. We also discuss the risk monotonicity of optimally tuned ridge regression, and con-ﬁrm the double descent phenomenon for principal component regression (PCR) under anisotropic X and β(cid:63). Finally, we determine the optimal Σw for both the ridgeless (λ 0) and optimally regularized (λ = λopt) case, and demonstrate the advantage of the weighted objective over standard ridge regression and PCR.
