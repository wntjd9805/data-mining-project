We propose a novel regularization-based continual learning method, dubbed asAdaptive Group Sparsity based Continual Learning (AGS-CL), using two group sparsity-based penalties. Our method selectively employs the two penalties when learning each neural network node based on its the importance, which is adaptively updated after learning each task. By utilizing the proximal gradient descent method, the exact sparsity and freezing of the model is guaranteed during the learning process, and thus, the learner explicitly controls the model capacity. Furthermore, as a critical detail, we re-initialize the weights associated with unimportant nodes after learning each task in order to facilitate efﬁcient learning and prevent the negative transfer. Throughout the extensive experimental results, we show that ourAGS-CL uses orders of magnitude less memory space for storing the regularization parameters, and it signiﬁcantly outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines on representative benchmarks for both supervised and reinforcement learning.
