Recently, there has been a surge of interest in representation learning in hyperbolic spaces, driven by their ability to represent hierarchical data with signiﬁcantly fewer dimensions than standard Euclidean spaces. However, the viability and beneﬁts of hyperbolic spaces for downstream machine learning tasks have received less attention. In this paper, we present, to our knowledge, the ﬁrst theoretical guarantees for learning a classiﬁer in hyperbolic rather than Euclidean space. Speciﬁcally, we consider the problem of learning a large-margin classiﬁer for data possessing a hierarchical structure. Our ﬁrst contribution is a hyperbolic perceptron algorithm, which provably converges to a separating hyperplane. We then provide an algorithm to efﬁciently learn a large-margin hyperplane, relying on the careful injection of adversarial examples. Finally, we prove that for hierarchical data that embeds well into hyperbolic space, the low embedding dimension ensures superior guarantees when learning the classiﬁer directly in hyperbolic space.
