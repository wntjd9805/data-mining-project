Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning setting where many devices collab-oratively train a machine learning model while keeping the training data decen-tralized. In most of the current training schemes the central model is reﬁned by averaging the parameters of the server model and the updated parameters from the client side. However, directly averaging model parameters is only possible if all models have the same structure and size, which could be a restrictive constraint in many scenarios.In this work we investigate more powerful and more ﬂexible aggregation schemes for FL. Speciﬁcally, we propose ensemble distillation for model fusion, i.e. training the central classiﬁer through unlabeled data on the outputs of the models from the clients. This knowledge distillation technique mitigates privacy risk and cost to the same extent as the baseline FL algorithms, but allows ﬂexible aggregation over heterogeneous client models that can differ e.g. in size, numerical precision or structure. We show in extensive empirical experiments on various CV/NLP datasets (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet, AG News, SST2) and settings (heterogeneous models/data) that the server model can be trained much faster, requiring fewer communication rounds than any existing FL technique so far.
