We introduce a new and completely online contextual bandit algorithm calledGated Linear Contextual Bandits (GLCB). This algorithm is based on Gated LinearNetworks (GLNs), a recently introduced deep learning architecture with properties well-suited to the online setting. Leveraging data-dependent gating properties of the GLN we are able to estimate prediction uncertainty with effectively zero algorithmic overhead. We empirically evaluate GLCB compared to 9 state-of-the-art algorithms that leverage deep neural networks, on a standard benchmark suite of discrete and continuous contextual bandit problems. GLCB obtains meanÔ¨Årst-place despite being the only online method, and we further support these results with a theoretical study of its convergence properties.
