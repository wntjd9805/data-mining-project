A variety of deep functional maps have been proposed recently, from fully super-vised to totally unsupervised, with a range of loss functions as well as different regularization terms. However, it is still not clear what are minimum ingredi-ents of a deep functional map pipeline and whether such ingredients unify or generalize all recent work on deep functional maps. We show empirically the minimum components for obtaining state-of-the-art results with different loss functions, supervised as well as unsupervised. Furthermore, we propose a novel framework designed for both full-to-full as well as partial to full shape matching that achieves state of the art results on several benchmark datasets outperform-ing, even the fully supervised methods.
