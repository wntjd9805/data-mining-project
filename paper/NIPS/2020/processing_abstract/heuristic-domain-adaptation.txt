In visual domain adaptation (DA), separating the domain-speciﬁc characteristics from the domain-invariant representations is an ill-posed problem. Existing meth-ods apply different kinds of priors or directly minimize the domain discrepancy to address this problem, which lack ﬂexibility in handling real-world situations.Another research pipeline expresses the domain-speciﬁc information as a gradual transferring process, which tends to be suboptimal in accurately removing the domain-speciﬁc properties. In this paper, we address the modeling of domain-invariant and domain-speciﬁc information from the heuristic search perspective.We identify the characteristics in the existing representations that lead to larger domain discrepancy as the heuristic representations. With the guidance of heuris-tic representations, we formulate a principled framework of Heuristic DomainAdaptation (HDA) with well-founded theoretical guarantees. To perform HDA, the cosine similarity scores and independence measurements between domain-invariant and domain-speciﬁc representations are cast into the constraints at the initial and ﬁnal states during the learning procedure. Similar to the ﬁnal condi-tion of heuristic search, we further derive a constraint enforcing the ﬁnal range of heuristic network output to be small. Accordingly, we propose Heuristic Do-main Adaptation Network (HDAN), which explicitly learns the domain-invariant and domain-speciﬁc representations with the above mentioned constraints. Ex-tensive experiments show that HDAN has exceeded state-of-the-art on unsuper-vised DA, multi-source DA and semi-supervised DA. The code is available at https://github.com/cuishuhao/HDA.
