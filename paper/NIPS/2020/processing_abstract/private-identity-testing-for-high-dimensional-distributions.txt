We present novel differentially private identity (goodness-of-ﬁt) testers for natural and widely studied classes of multivariate product distributions: product distribu-tions over {±1}d and Gaussians in Rd with known covariance. Our testers have improved sample complexity compared to those derived from previous techniques, and are the ﬁrst testers whose sample matches the order-optimal minimax sample complexity of O(d1/2/α2) in many parameter regimes. We construct two types of testers, exhibiting tradeoffs between sample complexity and computational complexity. Finally, we provide a two-way reduction between testing a subclass of multivariate product distributions and testing univariate distributions, thereby obtaining upper and lower bounds for testing this subclass of product distributions.
