Sample- and computationally-efﬁcient distribution estimation is a fundamental tenet in statistics and machine learning. We present SURF, an algorithm for approx-imating distributions by piecewise polynomials. SURF is: simple, replacing prior complex optimization techniques by straight-forward empirical probability approx-imation of each potential polynomial piece through simple empirical-probability interpolation, and using plain divide-and-conquer to merge the pieces; universal, as well-known polynomial-approximation results imply that it accurately approxi-mates a large class of common distributions; robust to distribution mis-speciﬁcation as for any degree d ≤ 8, it estimates any distribution to an (cid:96)1 distance < 3 times that of the nearest degree-d piecewise polynomial, improving known factor upper bounds of 3 for single polynomials and 15 for polynomials with arbitrarily many pieces; fast, using optimal sample complexity, running in near sample-linear time, and if given sorted samples it may be parallelized to run in sub-linear time. In experiments, SURF outperforms state-of-the art algorithms.
