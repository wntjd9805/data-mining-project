Epoch gradient descent method (a.k.a. Epoch-GD) proposed by [16] was deemed a breakthrough for stochastic strongly convex minimization, which achieves the optimal convergence rate of O(1/T ) with T iterative updates for the objective gap. However, its extension to solving stochastic min-max problems with strong convexity and strong concavity still remains open, and it is still unclear whether a fast rate of O(1/T ) for the duality gap is achievable for stochastic min-max optimization under strong convexity and strong concavity. Although some re-cent studies have proposed stochastic algorithms with fast convergence rates for min-max problems, they require additional assumptions about the problem, e.g., smoothness, bi-linear structure, etc. In this paper, we bridge this gap by providing a sharp analysis of epoch-wise stochastic gradient descent ascent method (referred to as Epoch-GDA) for solving strongly convex strongly concave (SCSC) min-max problems, without imposing any additional assumption about smoothness or the function’s structure. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the ﬁrst one that shows Epoch-GDA can achieve the optimal rate of O(1/T ) for the duality gap of general SCSC min-max problems. We emphasize that such generalization ofEpoch-GD for strongly convex minimization problems to Epoch-GDA for SCSC min-max problems is non-trivial and requires novel technical analysis. Moreover, we notice that the key lemma can also be used for proving the convergence ofEpoch-GDA for weakly-convex strongly-concave min-max problems, leading to a nearly optimal complexity without resorting to smoothness or other structural conditions.
