Non-linear spectral decompositions of images based on one-homogeneous func-tionals such as total variation have gained considerable attention in the last few years. Due to their ability to extract spectral components corresponding to ob-jects of different size and contrast, such decompositions enable ﬁltering, feature transfer, image fusion and other applications. However, obtaining this decomposi-tion involves solving multiple non-smooth optimisation problems and is therefore computationally highly intensive. In this paper, we present a neural network ap-proximation of a non-linear spectral decomposition. We report up to four orders of magnitude (×10, 000) speedup in processing of mega-pixel size images, compared to classical GPU implementations. Our proposed network, TVSpecNET, is able to implicitly learn the underlying PDE and, despite being entirely data driven, inherits invariances of the model based transform. To the best of our knowledge, this is theﬁrst approach towards learning a non-linear spectral decomposition of images. Not only do we gain a staggering computational advantage, but this approach can also be seen as a step towards studying neural networks that can decompose an image into spectral components deﬁned by a user rather than a handcrafted functional.
