In algorithmically fair prediction problems, a standard goal is to ensure the equal-ity of fairness metrics across multiple overlapping groups simultaneously. We reconsider this standard fair classiﬁcation problem using a probabilistic population analysis, which, in turn, reveals the Bayes-optimal classiﬁer. Our approach uniﬁes a variety of existing group-fair classiﬁcation methods and enables extensions to a wide range of non-decomposable multiclass performance metrics and fairness measures. The Bayes-optimal classiﬁer further inspires consistent procedures for algorithmically fair classiﬁcation with overlapping groups. On a variety of real datasets, the proposed approach outperforms baselines in terms of its fairness-performance tradeoff.
