Panoptic segmentation is posed as a new popular test-bed for the state-of-the-art holistic scene understanding methods with the requirement of simultaneously seg-menting both foreground things and background stuff. The state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation network exhibits high structural complexity in different network com-ponents, i.e. backbone, proposal-based foreground branch, segmentation-based background branch, and feature fusion module across branches, which heavily relies on expert knowledge and tedious trials. In this work, we propose an efﬁcient, coop-erative and highly automated framework to simultaneously search for all main com-ponents including backbone, segmentation branches, and feature fusion module in a uniﬁed panoptic segmentation pipeline based on the prevailing one-shot NetworkArchitecture Search (NAS) paradigm. Notably, we extend the common single-taskNAS into the multi-component scenario by taking the advantage of the newly pro-posed intra-modular search space and problem-oriented inter-modular search space, which helps us to obtain an optimal network architecture that not only performs well in both instance segmentation and semantic segmentation tasks but also be aware of the reciprocal relations between foreground things and background stuff classes.To relieve the vast computation burden incurred by applying NAS to complicated network architectures, we present a novel path-priority greedy search policy to ﬁnd a robust, transferrable architecture with signiﬁcantly reduced searching overhead.Our searched architecture, namely Auto-Panoptic, achieves the new state-of-the-art on the challenging COCO and ADE20K benchmarks. Moreover, extensive experi-ments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of path-priority policy and transferability of Auto-Panoptic across different datasets.
