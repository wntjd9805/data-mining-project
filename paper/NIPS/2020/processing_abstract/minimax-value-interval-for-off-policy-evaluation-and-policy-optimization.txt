We study minimax methods for off-policy evaluation (OPE) using value functions and marginalized importance weights. Despite that they hold promises of over-coming the exponential variance in traditional importance sampling, several key problems remain: (1) They require function approximation and are generally biased. For the sake of trustworthy OPE, is there anyway to quantify the biases? (2) They are split into two styles (“weight-learning” vs “value-learning”). Can we unify them?In this paper we answer both questions positively. By slightly altering the deriva-tion of previous methods (one from each style [1]), we unify them into a single value interval that comes with a special type of double robustness: when either the value-function or the importance-weight class is well speciﬁed, the interval is valid and its length quantiﬁes the misspeciﬁcation of the other class. Our interval also provides a uniﬁed view of and new insights to some recent methods, and we further explore the implications of our results on exploration and exploitation in off-policy policy optimization with insufﬁcient data coverage.
