Causal graph discovery refers to the process of discovering causal relation graphs from purely observational data. Like other statistical data, a causal graph mightIn this paper, we leak sensitive information about participants in the dataset. present a differentially private causal graph discovery algorithm, Priv-PC, which improves both utility and running time compared to the state-of-the-art. The de-sign of Priv-PC follows a novel paradigm called sieve-and-examine which uses a small amount of privacy budget to ﬁlter out “insigniﬁcant” queries, and leverages the remaining budget to obtain highly accurate answers for the “sig-niﬁcant” queries. We also conducted the ﬁrst sensitivity analysis for condi-tional independence tests including conditional Kendall’s τ and conditional Spear-man’s ρ. We evaluated Priv-PC on 7 public datasets and compared with the state-of-the-art. The results show that Priv-PC achieves 10.61 to 293.87 times speedup and better utility. The implementation of Priv-PC, including the code used in our evaluation, is available at https://github.com/sunblaze-ucb/Priv-PC-Differentially-Private-Causal-Graph-Discovery.
