Semantic cues and statistical regularities in real-world environment layouts can improve efﬁciency for navigation in novel environments. This paper learns and leverages such semantic cues for navigating to objects of interest in novel environ-ments, by simply watching YouTube videos. This is challenging because YouTube videos don’t come with labels for actions or goals, and may not even showcase op-timal behavior. Our method tackles these challenges through the use of Q-learning on pseudo-labeled transition quadruples (image, action, next image, reward). We show that such off-policy Q-learning from passive data is able to learn meaningful semantic cues for navigation. These cues, when used in a hierarchical navigation policy, lead to improved efﬁciency at the ObjectGoal task in visually realistic simulations. We observe a relative improvement of 15 − 83% over end-to-end RL, behavior cloning, and classical methods, while using minimal direct interaction.
