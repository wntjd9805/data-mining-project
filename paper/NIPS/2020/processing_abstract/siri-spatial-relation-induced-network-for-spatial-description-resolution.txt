Spatial Description Resolution, as a language-guided localization task, is pro-posed for target location in a panoramic street view, given corresponding language descriptions. Explicitly characterizing an object-level relationship while distill-ing spatial relationships are currently absent but crucial to this task. Mimicking humans, who sequentially traverse spatial relationship words and objects with aﬁrst-person view to locate their target, we propose a novel spatial relationship induced (SIRI) network. Speciﬁcally, visual features are ﬁrstly correlated at an implicit object-level in a projected latent space; then they are distilled by each spatial relationship word, resulting in each differently activated feature representing each spatial relationship. Further, we introduce global position priors to ﬁx the absence of positional information, which may result in global positional reasoning ambiguities. Both the linguistic and visual features are concatenated to ﬁnalize the target localization. Experimental results on the Touchdown show that our method is around 24% better than the state-of-the-art method in terms of accuracy, measured by an 80-pixel radius. Our method also generalizes well on our proposed extended dataset collected using the same settings as Touchdown.
