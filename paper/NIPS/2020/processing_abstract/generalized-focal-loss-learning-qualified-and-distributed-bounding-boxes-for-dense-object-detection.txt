One-stage detector basically formulates object detection as dense classiﬁcation and localization (i.e., bounding box regression). The classiﬁcation is usually optimized by Focal Loss and the box location is commonly learned under Dirac delta distribu-tion. A recent trend for one-stage detectors is to introduce an individual prediction branch to estimate the quality of localization, where the predicted quality facili-tates the classiﬁcation to improve detection performance. This paper delves into the representations of the above three fundamental elements: quality estimation, classiﬁcation and localization. Two problems are discovered in existing practices, including (1) the inconsistent usage of the quality estimation and classiﬁcation between training and inference, and (2) the inﬂexible Dirac delta distribution for localization. To address the problems, we design new representations for these ele-ments. Speciﬁcally, we merge the quality estimation into the class prediction vector to form a joint representation, and use a vector to represent arbitrary distribution of box locations. The improved representations eliminate the inconsistency risk and accurately depict the ﬂexible distribution in real data, but contain continuous labels, which is beyond the scope of Focal Loss. We then propose Generalized FocalLoss (GFL) that generalizes Focal Loss from its discrete form to the continuous version for successful optimization. On COCO test-dev, GFL achieves 45.0%AP using ResNet-101 backbone, surpassing state-of-the-art SAPD (43.5%) andATSS (43.6%) with higher or comparable inference speed.
