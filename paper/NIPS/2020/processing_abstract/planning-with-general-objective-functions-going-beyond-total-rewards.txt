Standard sequential decision-making paradigms aim to maximize the cumulativeH h=1 rh reward when interacting with the unknown environment., i.e., maximize where H is the planning horizon. However, this paradigm fails to model important practical applications, e.g., safe control that aims to maximize the lowest reward, i.e., maximize minH h=1 rh. In this paper, based on techniques in sketching algo-rithms, we propose a novel planning algorithm in deterministic systems which deals with a large class of objective functions of the form f (r1, r2, ...rH ) that are of interest to practical applications. We show that efﬁcient planning is possible if f is symmetric under permutation of coordinates and satisﬁes certain technical conditions. Complementing our algorithm, we further prove that removing any of the conditions will make the problem intractable in the worst case and thus demonstrate the necessity of our conditions.P
