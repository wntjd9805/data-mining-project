The scalability of Distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is today limited by communication bottlenecks. We propose a novel SGD variant: Communication-efﬁcient SGD with Error Reset, or CSER. The key idea in CSER is ﬁrst a new technique called “error reset” that adapts arbitrary compressors for SGD, produc-ing bifurcated local models with periodic reset of resulting local residual errors.Second we introduce partial synchronization for both the gradients and the models, leveraging advantages from them. We prove the convergence of CSER for smooth non-convex problems. Empirical results show that when combined with highly aggressive compressors, the CSER algorithms accelerate the distributed training by nearly 10× for CIFAR-100, and by 4.5× for ImageNet.
