This paper introduces the problem of medical report generation and proposes an unsupervised model called Knowledge Graph Auto-Encoder (KGAE). The model utilizes independent sets of images and reports in training and leverages a pre-constructed knowledge graph, a knowledge-driven encoder, and a knowledge-driven decoder. The encoder and decoder are trained to generate reports without relying on labeled image-report pairs. Experimental results show that KGAE outperforms several supervised approaches and can also be applied in a semi-supervised or supervised manner. The effectiveness of KGAE is further validated through quantitative and qualitative analysis, as well as a human evaluation conducted by professional radiologists.
