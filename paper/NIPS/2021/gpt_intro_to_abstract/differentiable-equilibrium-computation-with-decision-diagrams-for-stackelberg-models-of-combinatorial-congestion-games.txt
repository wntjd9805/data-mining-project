Congestion games (CGs) are commonly used to model resource allocation scenarios, with combinatorial CGs (CCGs) being able to capture more complex situations. This paper focuses on the design of non-atomic CCGs from the perspective of the leader, who aims to optimize certain parameters to reduce travel time for players at equilibrium. The leader's objective is to minimize a social-cost function while players minimize a potential function. The authors propose a Stackelberg model of CCGs and develop a differentiable pipeline using zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams (ZDDs) to compute equilibria. Their method is able to handle computationally challenging CCGs with an enormous number of strategies and is demonstrated to be useful in real-world network design instances.
