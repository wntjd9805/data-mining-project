This paper introduces the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in pairwise learning problems in machine learning. Pairwise learning involves quantifying the performance of models on pairs of training examples, and it includes various problems such as AUC maximization, metric learning, and ranking. While SGD is commonly used for pointwise learning, there is limited research on its application to pairwise learning. The objective function in pairwise learning involves a large number of dependent terms, which poses challenges for generalization analysis and algorithmic stability. The existing analysis for SGD in pairwise learning has restrictive assumptions and does not consider the interpolation assumption. In this paper, the authors present a generalization analysis of SGD for pairwise learning under more general assumptions. They develop a high-probability generalization bound for uniformly-stable algorithms and investigate the stability and generalization guarantee for convex and nonconvex loss functions. The paper concludes with the organization of the remaining sections and the inclusion of related work, problem formulation, and experimental results in the appendix.
