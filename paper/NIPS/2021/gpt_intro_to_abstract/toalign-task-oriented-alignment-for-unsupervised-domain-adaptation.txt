Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown impressive performance in image classification tasks. However, when applying these trained models to new domains with different data distributions, performance degradation occurs. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods aim to improve the model's performance on the target domain using only labeled source data and unlabeled target data. Most UDA methods focus on aligning the source and target data distributions. This paper proposes a task-oriented alignment approach called ToAlign, which explicitly aligns target features with task-discriminative source features to improve classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ToAlign in achieving state-of-the-art performance in UDA.
