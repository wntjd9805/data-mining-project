Probabilistic predictions of binary outcomes are widely used in various domains such as election modeling, weather forecasting, and risk assessment. However, less attention has been given to understanding how these predictions evolve over time. This paper introduces a Bayesian framework called the Gaussian latent information martingale (GLIM) to investigate and predict the structure of dynamic probabilistic forecasts, which are referred to as probability paths. The GLIM model is trained on historical paths and learns the heterogeneous, covariate-dependent structure of forecasts. The model satisfies the martingale property, where the expected value of future predictions along the path is equal to the current prediction. The authors demonstrate that the GLIM approach outperforms existing methods for quantifying uncertainty in evolving time series forecasts. This work aims to assist researchers and decision makers in effectively utilizing dynamic predictions in real-time forecasting.
