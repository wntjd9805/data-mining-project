This paper focuses on screen content image super-resolution (SCI SR), which aims to improve the quality of low-resolution (LR) screen content images. Unlike natural scene images, SCIs are characterized by thin and sharp edges, little color variance, and high contrast. The existing SR methods designed for natural images are not effective in capturing these specific characteristics of SCIs. This paper proposes a novel Implicit Transformer Super-Resolution Network (ITSRN) for SCI SR. The network utilizes an implicit transformer to model the relationship between LR and high-resolution (HR) images based on coordinates instead of pixel values. The proposed method outperforms other continuous and discrete SR methods for both compressed and uncompressed SCIs.
