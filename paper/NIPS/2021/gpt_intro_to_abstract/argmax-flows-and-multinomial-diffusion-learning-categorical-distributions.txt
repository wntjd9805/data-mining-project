This paper introduces extensions of flows and diffusion models for categorical variables. The authors propose Argmax Flows, which bridge the gap between categorical data and continuous normalizing flows using an argmax transformation and a corresponding family of probabilistic inverses. They also introduce Multinomial Diffusion, a diffusion model directly defined on categorical variables. These models allow generative normalizing flows and diffusion models to directly learn categorical data, providing a solution for modelling high-dimensional categorical data that is currently primarily modelled by expensive autoregressive models.
