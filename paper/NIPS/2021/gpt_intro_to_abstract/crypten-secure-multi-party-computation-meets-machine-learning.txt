Secure multi-party computation (MPC) enables collaborative computations on combined data sets without revealing individual data, thus addressing data privacy concerns. This capability has the potential to unlock various machine-learning applications, such as joint training of diagnostic models and analysis of sensitive statistics. Despite the potential, the adoption of secure MPC in machine learning remains limited due to the complexity of cryptographic techniques. To address this, we present CRYPTEN, a flexible software framework that makes modern secure MPC techniques accessible to machine-learning researchers and developers. CRYPTEN provides a comprehensive tensor-computation library with an API similar to PyTorch, facilitating easy implementation by machine-learning practitioners. We describe CRYPTEN's design principles, secure MPC protocols implemented, benchmark experiments, and discuss open problems and future development. Our results demonstrate that CRYPTEN enables efficient private inference and training of modern machine-learning models. We hope that CRYPTEN's performance and ease-of-use will encourage the adoption of secure MPC in the machine-learning community and pave the way for secure and private machine-learning systems.
