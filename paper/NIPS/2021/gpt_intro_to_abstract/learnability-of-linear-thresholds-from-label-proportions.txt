This paper investigates the proper learnability of linear threshold functions (LTFs) in the framework of learning from label proportions (LLP). LLP is a scenario where the training data consists of bags of feature-vectors along with the proportion of labels in each bag. The goal is to find an LTF that satisfies the most number of bags. The paper presents an algorithm that satisfies at least a (2/5)-fraction of the bags, and in the case of LLP-OR, a (2/5 + γ0/d)-fraction of the bags, where γ0 is a constant and d is the dimensionality of the feature-vectors. Additionally, the paper shows that finding a function of LTFs that satisfies a (1/2 + δ)-fraction of the bags is NP-hard, establishing the intractability of the problem.
