Traditional hand-written computer programs have limitations when it comes to tasks such as image classification and sentiment extraction from natural language. Neural networks have emerged as the dominant approach for these tasks, but they lack the desirable properties of traditional software. In this paper, we propose a method to bridge the expressivity of deep learning with the engineering practicality of traditional software by training a neural network classifier together with a generative model that maps the activations of the classifier back to the input. This allows for a special form of compositionality, where inputs derived from activations can be fed back into other models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through various experiments, including ensemble-like models, regularization and distillation with pretrained models, and discouraging the use of protected attributes.
