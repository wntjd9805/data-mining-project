Neural networks have seen success in handling different types of data, including graphs. However, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have limitations in recognizing simple graph structures. In this paper, we introduce a new approach called Dropout Graph Neural Networks (DropGNNs) to enhance the expressiveness of GNNs. DropGNNs involve executing multiple runs of the GNN by removing nodes with a small probability. This dropout technique significantly increases the expressive power of GNNs, enabling them to distinguish graphs that are indistinguishable by regular GNNs. We provide examples, analyze the theoretical properties of DropGNNs, discuss their capabilities and limitations, and validate our findings on various datasets, demonstrating the superior performance of DropGNNs in both impossible-to-solve problems and established graph benchmarks.
