This paper addresses the problem of blind inversion in physics-based inversion methods, where the underlying forward model is unknown. Traditional inversion methods assume a known forward model, but this can lead to biased reconstructions. To reduce the effects of model mismatch, the authors propose Deep Generalized Expectation-Maximization (DeepGEM), a variational inference based framework that uses deep learning to estimate the source and forward model together. DeepGEM is applied to blind seismic tomography and blind deconvolution, showing superior performance compared to traditional methods. The effectiveness of DeepGEM is demonstrated through experimental results.
