This paper introduces the concept of a "ladder of causation" that distinguishes three levels of causal concepts: associational, interventional, and counterfactual. The authors discuss the limitations of determining higher level models from lower level information and the importance of reasoning about counterfactuals. They propose viewing the choice of causal mechanism as an optimization problem and explore the criteria for selecting a causal mechanism that yields desirable behavior. The paper establishes connections between causal mechanisms and couplings, and introduces a parameterized family of causal mechanisms that can be learned using gradient-based optimization. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of these learned mechanisms through empirical studies and highlight their ability to generalize to unseen data.
