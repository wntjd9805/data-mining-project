Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been successful in transferring knowledge from labeled data in a source domain to classify unlabeled data in a target domain. However, most existing UDA methods assume that the source data is from a single domain, which is not always the case in real-world applications. To address this limitation, Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA) has been proposed to match features across domains and quantify the contributions of source domains. However, existing MSDA methods require massive labeled source data, which is inefficient and impractical in sensitive applications. In this paper, we introduce the novel problem of Multi-Source-Free Domain Adaptation (MSFDA) and propose the ConÔ¨Ådent-Anchor-induced multi-source-free Domain Adaptation (CAiDA) model. CAiDA captures transferable information from multiple pre-trained source models to improve target prediction without access to source data. We validate the effectiveness of our model through experiments and provide theoretical analysis and bounds for MSFDA. Our contributions include the development of CAiDA, the proposal of the MSFDA problem, and the design of a source-specific transferable perception module and class-relationship-aware consistency loss.
