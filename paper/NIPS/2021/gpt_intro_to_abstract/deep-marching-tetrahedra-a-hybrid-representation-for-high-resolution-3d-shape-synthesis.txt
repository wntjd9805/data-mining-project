Creating high-quality 3D content with rich geometric details and complex topology requires significant expert effort and development time. In contrast, simple 3D shapes created with voxels have been popularized by platforms like Minecraft, allowing non-experts to create content. This paper aims to develop AI tools that enable regular people to upscale voxelized objects into high-resolution, beautiful 3D shapes, as well as turning 3D scans into high-quality forms. The paper introduces a new deep 3D conditional generative model, DMTET, which combines implicit and explicit 3D representations. DMTET utilizes a differentiable shape representation that allows for topological changes in the underlying shape represented by an implicit field. The model incorporates a Marching Tetrahedra algorithm to convert the underlying surface into an explicit mesh, achieving efficiency by selectively subdividing tetrahedra and spending computation only on relevant regions. DMTET outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in 3D shape synthesis and point cloud reconstruction while being 10 times faster at inference time. Overall, the paper demonstrates the technical contributions of using Marching Tetrahedra, incorporating it into a deep learning framework, and introducing a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy for high-resolution reconstruction.
