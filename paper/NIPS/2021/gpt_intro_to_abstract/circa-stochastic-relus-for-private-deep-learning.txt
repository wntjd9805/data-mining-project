Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) provides high-quality user experiences but compromises privacy either by sharing personal data with the server or by disclosing the server's model to the clients. Private inference (PI) protocols have been developed to address this issue, utilizing cryptographic techniques such as homomorphic encryption (HE), Secret Sharing (SS), and secure multiparty computation (MPC) to perform MLaaS computations obliviously. However, existing protocols for PI have impractically high overheads. This paper introduces Circa1, a novel method to reduce the cost of the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) operation in PI. By refactoring ReLU as a sign computation followed by a multiplication, pushing the multiplication from Garbled Circuits (GC) to Secret Sharing, and approximating the sign computation, the proposed method reduces the runtime of PI inference. Additionally, Circa1's stochastic ReLU function introduces faults but is shown to have minimal impact on accuracy, making deep networks resilient to these faults. Compared to existing solutions, Circa-optimized networks achieve up to a 3× speedup, and when combined with current best practices for ReLU count reduction, an additional 1.8× speedup is observed.
