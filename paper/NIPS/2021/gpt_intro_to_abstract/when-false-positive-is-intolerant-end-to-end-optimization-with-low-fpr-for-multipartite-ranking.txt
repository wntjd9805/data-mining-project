The multipartite ranking problem, which involves sorting a dataset with multiple discrete labels, has gained significant attention in computer vision applications. Previous literature has used metrics such as Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), accuracy, and mean square error (MSE) to evaluate the performance of multipartite ranking models. However, it is unclear whether these metrics accurately reflect model performance in different scenarios, especially in cases where false positive rates (FPR) need to be minimized. This is particularly relevant in domains like medical diagnosis and churn prediction, where high FPR can have severe consequences. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new evaluation metric TPR@FPR and proposes Cross-Batch Approximation for Multipartite Ranking (CBA-MR) as a solution. CBA-MR leverages a probability-based loss function and a random-walk model to optimize TPR@FPR, and incorporates a nonparametric cross-batch cache module to approximate the ranking of negative examples more efficiently.
