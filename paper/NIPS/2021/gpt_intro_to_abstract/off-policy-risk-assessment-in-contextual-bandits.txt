This paper introduces the contextual bandits framework, which is commonly used to model practical tasks such as medical treatment and content recommendation. In this framework, an agent makes decisions based on observed context and receives a context-dependent reward. However, traditional research in contextual bandits has focused on optimizing expected reward, while stakeholders often care about other risk functionals that express real-world desires or have desirable statistical properties. The paper explores the importance of considering these risk functionals in decision-making processes.
