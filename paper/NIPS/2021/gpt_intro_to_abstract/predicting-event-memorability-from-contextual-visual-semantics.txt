Episodic event memory is a crucial aspect of human cognition and intelligence, with potential benefits for mental health and executive functioning. Cognitive training, such as regular photo review, can enhance episodic memory. Advances in visual lifelogging technology have made it possible to implement lifelog-based memory interventions. However, the factors that influence event memory and how to design effective cognitive intervention programs remain unclear. This study aims to understand event memory by exploring the recall process with visual cues and examining factors that influence event memorability. The research addresses gaps in the field by developing a novel experiment protocol to collect personal life event information and memory outcomes, creating a dataset with rich contextual and visual semantic features. The study also demonstrates that event memorability depends on contextual information and visual attributes. Furthermore, a contextual event memory network is developed to predict event memorability, serving as a baseline for future computational models. The dataset and predictive model lay the foundation for decoding human episodic memory.
