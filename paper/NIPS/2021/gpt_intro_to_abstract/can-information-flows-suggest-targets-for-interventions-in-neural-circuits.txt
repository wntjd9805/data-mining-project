The reward circuit in the brain plays a significant role in controlling behavior, with addiction and depression being associated with biases in this circuit. Recent advancements in neural probes and optogenetics have provided tools for studying and influencing this circuit. However, there is a need for minimal interventions that correct biases without impacting other functions of the reward network. In this paper, the authors propose using the M-information flow framework to identify interventions that correct biases while preserving desired behaviors. They adapt this framework to artificial neural networks and demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting the impact of interventions on bias and accuracy. The authors also explore different intervention strategies and evaluate their bias-accuracy tradeoffs. The paper concludes with results on synthetic and real datasets and a discussion of the implications of these findings.
