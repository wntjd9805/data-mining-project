Word meaning undergoes changes over time as a reflection of societal and cultural shifts. This phenomenon has been extensively studied, with recent approaches utilizing distributed representations of words and time-specific word vectors. However, existing methods primarily focus on one-hop transformations between pair of timestamps, neglecting the continuous nature of word meaning evolution. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, building upon the 'DiffTime' model, which represents word meaning as implicit functions over time. Specifically, we employ trigonometric functions to effectively capture the change of word meaning. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in tasks such as time-aware word clustering, temporal analogy, and semantic change detection, showcasing its potential for diachronic word meaning representation and processing.
