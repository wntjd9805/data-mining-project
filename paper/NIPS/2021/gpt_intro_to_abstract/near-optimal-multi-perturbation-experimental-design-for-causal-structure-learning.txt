The problem of finding causal relationships between variables is prevalent in various scientific disciplines. In this paper, we focus on learning the causal structure of variables using observational and interventional data. We specifically address the identifiability of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) without unobserved confounding variables. While interventions can improve identifiability, performing experiments can be costly. Therefore, we investigate the batched setting where multiple interventions are performed simultaneously. Existing works have proposed objective functions and algorithms for this problem, but they primarily focus on single-variable perturbations. We explore the multiple-perturbation setting and provide efficient algorithms with performance guarantees. Our methods outperform existing approaches in terms of identifiability, as demonstrated through empirical evaluations on synthetic networks and real gene regulatory networks.
