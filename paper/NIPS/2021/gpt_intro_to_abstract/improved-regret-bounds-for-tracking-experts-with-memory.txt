This paper focuses on the problem of online prediction with expert advice in a non-stationary environment, where nature generates sequential outcomes and the learner tries to predict them based on the advice of a set of experts. The goal is for the learner to predict well relative to a sequence of comparison predictors, where switches occur in the data sequence and different experts may predict well at different times. The paper presents a projection-based algorithm that achieves the best-known regret bound for tracking experts with memory, along with an efficient algorithm for computing exact relative entropy projection. The paper also discusses the relationship between the projection-based algorithm and a weight-sharing algorithm, and provides a guarantee that favors projection-based updates.
