As machine learning becomes more widespread, there is a growing recognition of the importance of tail performance in addition to average performance. Tail performance refers to the accuracy of models on underrepresented groups or minority classes in imbalanced datasets. In the field of algorithmic fairness, it is crucial to design models that perform well across all parts of the data domain, rather than just performing well on average. Previous works have focused on subpopulation shift, either in a domain-aware setting or a domain-oblivious setting. In this paper, we focus on the domain-oblivious setting and propose a framework called Boosted CVaR Classification to train ensemble models using boosting. We show that minimizing the Î±-CVaR loss can be related to boosting an unfair learner to obtain a fair ensemble classifier. We provide background information on subpopulation shift and CVaR, and then present our framework and algorithms for boosting unfair learners. Finally, we evaluate our method on benchmark datasets.
