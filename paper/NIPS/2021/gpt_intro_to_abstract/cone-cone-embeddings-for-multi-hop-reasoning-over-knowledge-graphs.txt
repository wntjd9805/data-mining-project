This paper introduces ConE, a novel geometry-based query embedding model for multi-hop reasoning over knowledge graphs. ConE represents entities and queries as Cartesian products of two-dimensional cones, where the intersection and union of cones correspond to the conjunction and disjunction operations, respectively. To handle negation, ConE employs geometric complement operators in the embedding space. The experimental results show that ConE outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets, making it the first geometry-based QE model capable of handling all first-order logic operations.
