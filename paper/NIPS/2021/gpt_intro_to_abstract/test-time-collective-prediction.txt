Large-scale datasets collected from diverse sources and stored across different machines present challenges for machine learning due to privacy concerns and data ownership. This paper explores a new approach to aggregation problem by drawing insights from the social sciences on how humans reach a consensus. The authors propose a decentralized and adaptive aggregation scheme that mimics human consensus finding, which allows pre-trained machine learning models to collectively make predictions at test time without requiring coordination during the training stage. The scheme is privacy-preserving, does not require hold-out validation data, and is adaptable to variations in predictive quality across different regions of the input space. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme through extensive numerical experiments and highlight its advantages over existing methods.
