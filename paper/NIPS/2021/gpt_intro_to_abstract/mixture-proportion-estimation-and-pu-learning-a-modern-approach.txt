In this paper, we propose Best Bin Estimation (BBE), a technique for Mixture Proportion Estimation (MPE) that produces consistent estimates under mild assumptions, and learning with the Conditional Value Ignoring Risk (CVIR) objective, which removes the incentive to overfit to unlabeled positive examples. Both methods are simple to implement and compatible with arbitrary hypothesis classes. We also introduce an iterated Transform-Estimate-Discard (TED) framework that significantly improves MPE estimation error and classifier error. We validate our methods through empirical experiments and demonstrate their superiority over existing approaches.
