Lookahead search and search algorithms, particularly tabular search, have been crucial in achieving superhuman performance in sequential decision-making problems in artificial intelligence (AI). However, tabular search has limitations in partially observable stochastic environments like the game Hanabi, where the number of possible states becomes intractable. This paper proposes a non-tabular search algorithm inspired by research in continuous control environments, where the policy network is fine-tuned at inference time using finite-horizon model-based rollouts. The proposed method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in Hanabi, allowing for multiple moves ahead and discovering joint deviations. Furthermore, it outperforms Monte Carlo tree search in deterministic and stochastic versions of the Atari game Ms. Pacman.
