The introduction of the computer science paper presents the problem of optimizing complex, high-dimensional training objectives in machine learning models using parallelism. The authors propose an optimal accelerated minibatch stochastic gradient descent algorithm that leverages minibatch stochastic gradient estimates. They discuss the concept of driving the loss to zero and the various names given to this property in different contexts. The authors highlight their contributions, including an analysis of their algorithm, its linear speedup in minibatch size, and faster convergence for objectives satisfying a quadratic growth condition. They prove the optimality of their methods in terms of minibatch size and minimum value of the loss, and extend their results to a setting with bounds on the variance of stochastic gradients. They demonstrate that their algorithm can achieve the optimal error of SGD with a smaller parallel runtime for larger minibatches.
