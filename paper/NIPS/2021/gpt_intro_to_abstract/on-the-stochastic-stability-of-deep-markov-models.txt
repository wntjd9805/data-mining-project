This paper introduces a new analytical method to assess the stochastic stability of Deep Markov Models (DMMs) by utilizing spectral analysis of deep neural networks (DNNs) that model the distributions in DMMs. The paper provides sufficient conditions for stochastic stability of DMMs and proposes practical methods for designing constrained DMMs with stability guarantees. The contributions of this paper include a stability analysis method for DMMs using operator norms of DNNs, sufficient conditions for stochastic stability, methods for designing stable DMMs, and numerical case studies analyzing the connections between neural network design parameters, stochastic stability, and operator norms.
