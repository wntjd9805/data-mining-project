This paper explores the question of whether simulation and reinforcement learning (RL) are necessary for learning indoor navigation. The authors propose a self-supervised approach using passive egocentric videos, which eliminates the need for a simulator and RL. They argue that the structured state space in navigation can be leveraged for credit assignment, obviating the need for explicit policy learning. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, outperforming RL-based methods. They also highlight that their approach can be trained directly on real-world videos, overcoming the sim-to-real gap.
