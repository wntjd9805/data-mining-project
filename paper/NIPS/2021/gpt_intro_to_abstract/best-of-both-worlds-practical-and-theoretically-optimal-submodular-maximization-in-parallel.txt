The optimization of a monotone, submodular function is a common problem in various applications. This paper focuses on the submodular maximization problem with cardinality constraints and studies existing approximation algorithms for this problem. Although recent algorithms achieve near-optimal adaptivity and query complexity, they suffer from impractical constant factors. To address this issue, the paper proposes a new algorithm called LINEARSEQ (LS) with improved query complexity and adaptivity. The paper also introduces a parallelizable thresholding procedure called THRESHOLDSEQ (TS) and presents the algorithm LS+PGB that combines LS and TS. LS+PGB achieves nearly optimal ratio, adaptivity, and query complexity and outperforms previous algorithms in terms of runtime.
