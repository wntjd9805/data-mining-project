Human mobility prediction is crucial for various applications such as targeted advertisements, traffic modeling, and pandemic spread prediction. However, trajectory data for predicting the next point of interest (POI) is typically sparse, making it challenging to accurately predict future POIs. Previous research has focused on utilizing historical visiting information to predict POIs, but this may not be sufficient due to the limited range of preferences revealed in a user's historical log. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel method called MobTCast that incorporates semantic, social, and geographical contexts in a data-driven manner. The proposed approach utilizes a Transformer-based mobility feature extractor to learn semantic-aware mobility features and applies a self-attention mechanism to model social influence. Additionally, an auxiliary trajectory forecasting task is introduced to incorporate geographical context. The results of experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of MobTCast and highlight the value of incorporating different types of context and a consistency loss function. The contributions of this work include the incorporation of auxiliary trajectory forecasting and the introduction of a novel consistency loss function to improve POI prediction performance.
