The increasing demand for computing capacities in electronic processors due to the growing scales of deep learning models and datasets has led to a need for more efficient computing solutions. Optical neural networks (ONNs) have emerged as a promising alternative to conventional electronics, offering sub-nanosecond latency and high energy efficiency. However, robustness and trainability remain critical issues for photonic AI engines. The analog nature of ONNs makes them susceptible to performance degradation and malfunctioning due to manufacturing errors, non-ideal device controls, and circuit noises. While non-ideal effects can be simulated during software training, the accuracy and cost of such simulations are limiting factors. In this paper, we propose an efficient three-stage learning framework called L2ight to address these challenges and push the limits of DNNs in optics. The framework demonstrates scalability, efficiency, learnability, and robustness, making it the first of its kind to support on-chip training on million-parameter ONNs. We provide an open-source PyTorch-centric ONN library and release our on-chip training framework.
