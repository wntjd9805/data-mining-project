This paper introduces a novel shape representation called Shape-As-Points (SAP) for 3D computer vision and computer graphics. SAP overcomes limitations of conventional representations by efficiently encoding surface information and providing flexibility in encoding varied topologies. The paper presents a fast GPU-accelerated Differentiable Poisson Surface Reconstruction (DPSR) solver for SAP, allowing for efficient backpropagation of gradients and updating of the oriented point cloud representation. The advantages of SAP are discussed, including efficiency, accuracy, easy initialization, and high-quality watertight meshes. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SAP in reconstructing surface geometry from unoriented point clouds. The paper concludes with a summary of the main contributions and provides a link to the code.
