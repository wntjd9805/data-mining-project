This article focuses on the development of an active clustering algorithm (AC algorithm) to assist human experts in efficiently building learning data for supervised learning software. The AC algorithm queries the experts on pairs of items to determine if they belong to the same class or not, avoiding the need for experts to learn the classes beforehand. The algorithm terminates once the partition is recovered, and the authors investigate the algorithm's performance under two different random models for the unknown set partition. The article also analyzes scenarios where the experts' answers may contain errors or inconsistencies. The authors provide mathematical proofs using probability theory, graph theory, and analytic combinatorics. The article concludes with open problems and potential research topics.
