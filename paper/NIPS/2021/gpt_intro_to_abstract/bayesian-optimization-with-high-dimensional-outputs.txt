This paper introduces an exact sampling method for Multi-task Gaussian processes (MTGPs) that has additive time costs in the combination of tasks and data points, rather than multiplicative. The paper demonstrates the empirical benefits of large-scale sampling from MTGPs in challenging multi-objective, constrained, and contextual Bayesian Optimization problems. Additionally, the paper introduces a method for efficient posterior sampling for the High-Order Gaussian Process (HOGP) model, allowing for more efficient Bayesian Optimization on high-dimensional outputs. The paper provides a comprehensive review of GPs, MTGPs, and sampling procedures, and presents experimental results on a variety of problems. The code for the method is integrated into BoTorch.
