Matrix decomposition is a widely studied problem in various disciplines such as signal processing, machine learning, and natural language processing. However, due to the existence of infinitely many decompositions, additional structures and priors are necessary to find a preferred representation. In this paper, the focus is on finding a unique sparse low-dimensional representation of a matrix Y by decomposing it into the product of matrices A and X. The formulation of this problem is important for applications including clustering and interpretability of representations. The authors propose an optimization approach based on maximizing the â„“4 norm of qT Y to recover the global solution and provide theoretical guarantees for its performance. Experimental results and further directions are discussed.
