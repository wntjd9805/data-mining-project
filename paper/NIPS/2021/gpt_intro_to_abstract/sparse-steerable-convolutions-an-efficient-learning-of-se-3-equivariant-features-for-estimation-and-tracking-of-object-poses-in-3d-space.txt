SE(3)-equivariant deep networks have shown promise in 3D semantic analysis tasks, particularly the 3D Steerable CNN. These networks employ steerable convolutions to preserve pose information and achieve pose synchronization in output features. However, the use of regular grids limits the application of steerable convolutions to irregular and sparse 3D data. In this paper, we propose Sparse Steerable Convolution (SS-Conv) as a solution to this limitation. SS-Conv accelerates steerable convolutions with sparse tensors while maintaining SE(3)-equivariance. We apply SS-Conv to object pose estimation in 3D space and design a pipeline that utilizes the steerability of learned features for iterative pose refinement. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of our SS-Conv-based pipeline compared to existing methods.
