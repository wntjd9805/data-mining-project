The problem of Dueling-Bandits, a generalization of the multiarmed bandit problem, has received significant attention in the machine learning community. In this online learning framework, the learner selects pairs of arms and receives preference feedback to identify the best arms. Various algorithms have been proposed to minimize regret. However, in real-world applications, the decision space may change over time due to unavailable items. This "sleeping" aspect has been extensively studied in the MAB literature. This paper discusses the application of Sleeping Bandits in the context of dueling bandits and its relevance to real-world scenarios such as movie recommendations and search engine optimization.
