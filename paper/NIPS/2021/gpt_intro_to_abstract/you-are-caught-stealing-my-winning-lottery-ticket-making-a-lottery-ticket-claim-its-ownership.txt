This paper introduces the problem of over-parameterization in deep neural networks (DNNs) and explores the emerging field of the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) as a solution. LTH aims to identify sparse networks within DNNs, known as winning tickets, that can achieve comparable or better inference performance while reducing computational footprints. However, finding winning tickets is a burdensome and computation-consuming task. Additionally, protecting the intellectual property (IP) of winning tickets poses a challenge, as deep networks are vulnerable to IP infringement. Previous methods for ownership verification did not consider structural properties like sparsity. In this paper, the authors propose a novel method that leverages sparse structural information embedded in winning tickets for ownership verification. They formulate the lottery verification problem, define protection scenarios, and present a mask embedding method capable of embedding ownership signatures in the sparse structural connectivity of winning tickets. The proposed method is shown to be robust and capable of defending against various attacks in extensive experiments.
