In this paper, we introduce a new model called the nonparametric Volterra kernels model (NVKM), which extends the Gaussian process convolution model (GPCM) to incorporate nonlinearity and multiple outputs. Unlike previous models, the NVKM drops assumptions on the separability and homogeneity of the Volterra kernels, allowing their form to be learned directly from data. We also develop a fast sampling method that leverages recent results on explicit function sampling from GPs, avoiding the need for computationally expensive numerical integration. The NVKM is suitable for both single and multiple output regression problems and can be interpreted as a nonlinear latent force model (LFM) where the operator is learned from data. Additionally, we present a variation of the NVKM for Bayesian systems identification, demonstrating improved uncertainty quantification compared to recurrence-based methods.
