Teacher-student models have been widely studied in the field of computer science to analyze the performance of learning problems with synthetic data. However, existing models often assume the input data to be Gaussian i.i.d., which is not representative of real-world data. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian covariate model that takes into account the correlation between teacher and student vectors in arbitrary Gaussian spaces. We derive rigorous asymptotic solutions for this model and demonstrate through theoretical analysis and numerical experiments that it accurately captures the learning curves of various feature maps applied to realistic datasets. Our findings provide a unified framework for understanding the performance of different learning approaches and highlight the limitations of the Gaussian covariate model in certain scenarios.
