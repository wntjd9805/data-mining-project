This paper introduces a unified framework called K-Net for bridging different image segmentation tasks, such as semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation. The framework utilizes convolutional kernels that are dynamically updated based on the segmentation targets. It also adopts a bipartite matching strategy for assigning learning targets to each kernel, which resolves the issue of varying numbers of instances in an image. Experimental results on COCO and ADE20K datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of K-Net, surpassing previous state-of-the-art results in panoptic and semantic segmentation benchmarks. The analysis of learned kernels reveals their specialization on objects at specific locations of similar sizes.
