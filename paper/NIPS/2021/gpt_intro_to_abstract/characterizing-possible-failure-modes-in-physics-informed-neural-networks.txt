Partial differential equations (PDEs) are widely used in various scientific and engineering applications. Due to their complexity, numerical methods are often employed to approximate their solutions. However, these methods can be computationally expensive, especially for complex settings such as turbulence simulations. To address this issue and leverage the increasing amount of available data, there has been growing interest in the field of Scientific Machine Learning (SciML). SciML aims to combine traditional scientific modeling based on PDEs with data-driven machine learning approaches, such as neural network training. One recent approach in this field is the use of Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) models, which incorporate domain knowledge as soft constraints in the training process. However, there are challenges and potential pitfalls involved in this approach, which we aim to address in this paper.
