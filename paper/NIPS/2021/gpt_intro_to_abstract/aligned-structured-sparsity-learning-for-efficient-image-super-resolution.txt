Image super-resolution is a challenging problem in computer vision, where the goal is to reconstruct a high-resolution image from a low-resolution input. Deep convolutional neural networks have shown promising results in this task, but existing methods suffer from drawbacks such as heavy model parameters and inference time. In this paper, we propose aligned structured sparsity learning (ASSL) for efficient image super-resolution. ASSL is a regularization-based filter pruning method that introduces weight normalization and sparsity-inducing L2 regularization. Additionally, we address the issue of aligning the sparsity structure across different layers by introducing a novel sparsity structure alignment regularization term. Our ASSLN achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art lightweight image super-resolution methods.
