Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is a visual task that aims to recover high-resolution images from their low-resolution counterparts. Deep learning methods have made significant advancements in SR research, achieving remarkable results on benchmarks. However, most existing works are based on a degradation model that assumes a down-sampled LR image with a blur kernel and additional noise. Recent studies have shown that pre-trained SR models are sensitive to the degradation of LR images, leading to undesirable artifacts and distortions. Blind SR, which aims to super-resolve LR images with unknown kernels, has gained attention due to its relevance to real-world scenes. However, existing blind SR methods are insufficient in addressing the various degradation processes in general scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages the convolution degradation feature in LR images to accurately and robustly estimate the unknown kernel in the frequency domain. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving superior performance compared to existing blind SR methods when combined with non-blind SR models.
