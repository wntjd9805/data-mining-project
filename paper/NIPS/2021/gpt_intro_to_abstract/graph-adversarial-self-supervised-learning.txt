Learning effective representations of graph-structured data is crucial in various real-world applications. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful architectures for learning and analyzing graph representations. However, obtaining a large number of labeled data is challenging, especially in costly areas like biochemistry. Self-supervised learning using unlabeled data has shown promise in enhancing graph deep learning. Existing self-supervised methods rely on handcrafted views, which require expert knowledge and do not consistently improve performance. Additionally, the combination of adversarial training and self-supervised learning for GNNs is still unclear. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial self-supervised learning approach called Graph Adversarial Self-Supervised Learning (GASSL) that maximizes the similarity between a graph and its perturbed adversarial version. GASSL outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised models and performs on par with or superior to supervised baselines in graph classification tasks. Our contributions include proposing GASSL for unsupervised graph representation learning, using adversarial training to generate challenging views, and demonstrating the effectiveness of GASSL across multiple datasets.
