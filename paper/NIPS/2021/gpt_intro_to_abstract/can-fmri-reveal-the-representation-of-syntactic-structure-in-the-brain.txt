Neuroscientists have long been interested in understanding how the brain processes syntax, but there is no consensus on which brain regions are involved in this process. Previous studies have suggested that syntax may involve both left and right hemisphere regions, and there are differing opinions on whether syntax is constrained to specific brain regions or distributed throughout the language system. This paper aims to address the challenges of studying syntactic representations using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) by proposing syntactic structure embeddings as a tool to encode the syntactic information present in natural text. The authors find that these embeddings, along with simpler syntactic features, can explain a significant portion of the variance in fMRI data, suggesting that fMRI can reveal syntactic representations. The predicted regions showing syntactic representations are distributed across the language network and are not selective for syntax alone.
