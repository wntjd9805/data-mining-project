Sampling-based planning is an established method for continuous motion planning in robotics, but it faces challenges when dealing with high-dimensional spaces and motion planning for robots with few degrees of freedom. The bottleneck in this process is the computationally expensive collision checking operation. To address this, learning-based approaches have been introduced to accelerate motion planning by improving the sampling process. In this paper, we propose two novel components that use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to accelerate collision-free path search in batch sampling-based motion planning algorithms. The first component, GNN Path Explorer, finds collision-free paths using a random geometric graph formed by probing samples, while the second component, GNN Path Smoother, optimizes the obtained path. These components leverage the expressiveness and permutation invariance of GNNs to identify geometric patterns and enhance combinatorial search. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces collision checking, improves planning efficiency, and scales well to high-dimensional tasks, maintaining probabilistic completeness properties. The paper concludes by presenting the organization of the remaining sections, including a review of related work, the design of the GNN architectures, and experimental results.
