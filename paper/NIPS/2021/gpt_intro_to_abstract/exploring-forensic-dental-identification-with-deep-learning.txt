Forensic identification plays a crucial role in identifying individuals using trace evidence, with dental data being particularly important due to its high identifying potential and widespread availability. However, current forensic dental examinations rely on visual comparisons and are limited in scalability and prone to errors. This paper proposes a deep learning solution, FoID, for forensic identification using dental panoramic radiographs. The authors outline the challenges in dental identification and develop a comprehensive benchmark dataset. They introduce domain-specific augmentations, hard attention extraction, and a transformer-based self-attention mechanism to enhance the identification process. The proposed solution achieves significant improvements over existing models, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning in dental forensic identification.
