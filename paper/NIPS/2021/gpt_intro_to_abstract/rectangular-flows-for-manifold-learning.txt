In recent years, Normalizing Flows (NFs) have gained significant popularity in generative modelling for density estimation, variational inference, and maximum entropy modelling. However, NFs typically assume that the data is supported on a set of dimension D, which contradicts the manifold hypothesis that high-dimensional data actually resides in a lower-dimensional manifold. To address this issue, we propose the use of injective flows that push forward a random variable on Rd to obtain a distribution on a d-dimensional manifold embedded in RD. Although previous approaches either assume the manifold is known beforehand or use heuristics to avoid computationally prohibitive volume-change computation, we present two methods that make density estimation for injective flows tractable. These methods leverage forward- and backward-mode automatic differentiation and allow backpropagation through the volume term. Our methods do not require prior specification of the data manifold and achieve state-of-the-art performance for likelihood-based Out-of-Distribution detection.
