Deep neural networks (DNNs) have seen significant advancements in computer vision, but they heavily rely on fully-supervised learning with annotated data, which is time-consuming. Semi-supervised learning has been studied to address this issue by incorporating unlabeled images into training. However, most existing methods focus on image classification, while object detection requires more effort in constructing fully-annotated datasets. This paper proposes a semi-supervised learning approach for object detection, where only a small fraction of images are fully-labeled and the rest are unlabeled. The proposed method tackles the inherent noise in pseudo labels by quantifying region uncertainty and introducing it into training. The approach achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets, surpassing supervised methods.
