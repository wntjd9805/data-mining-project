This paper introduces the challenge of solving cryptic crossword puzzles as a rich area for developing more flexible natural language processing (NLP) models. Cryptics are a popular style of crossword in the United Kingdom and pose a significant challenge due to their linguistic complexities. The authors present a cleaned dataset of cryptic crossword clues and propose a novel curriculum learning approach to tackle the task. They also assess the meta-linguistic knowledge and generalization capabilities of a Transformer-based model on this task. The results demonstrate that while progress has been made, fully solving cryptics remains a challenge for modern machine learning, highlighting the need for further research in this domain.
