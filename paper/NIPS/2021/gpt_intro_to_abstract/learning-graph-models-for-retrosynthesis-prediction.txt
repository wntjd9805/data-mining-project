Retrosynthesis prediction, a fundamental problem in organic synthesis, aims to identify a series of chemical transformations for synthesizing a target molecule. Previous methods for retrosynthesis prediction can be categorized into template-based and template-free approaches. Template-based methods match a target molecule against templates, while template-free methods learn a direct mapping from product to reactants. However, template-based methods struggle to generalize to new reactions, and template-free methods generate reactants character by character, increasing complexity. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that combines edit prediction and synthon completion to generate reactants. Our approach aligns with strategies used by expert chemists, leveraging the fact that product atoms are always a subset of reactant atoms and the molecular graph topology is largely unchanged. We construct a vocabulary of subgraphs to simplify reactant generation and improve empirical performance. Evaluations on the USPTO-50k dataset show that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy.
