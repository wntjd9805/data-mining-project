This paper introduces a novel approach for tracking people in 3D using monocular video input. The traditional 2D-based tracking algorithms are limited in their ability to handle occlusions and viewpoint changes. The proposed method, called Human Mesh and Appearance Recovery (HMAR), extracts both 3D geometry and appearance information of the person using a modified version of the HMR model. The extracted 3D information is then aggregated and associated to assign identities to each bounding box, resulting in accurate tracklets. The algorithm is evaluated on three datasets, including one derived from movies, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
