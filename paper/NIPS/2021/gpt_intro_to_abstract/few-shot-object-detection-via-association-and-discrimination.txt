Deep learning has made significant advancements in object detection, but its performance heavily relies on large amounts of labeled training data, limiting its scalability and generalizability. In contrast, human visual systems can easily generalize to new classes with limited supervision. This has led to increased interest in few-shot object detection (FSOD), which aims to train a network with limited annotations of novel classes using sufficient data from base classes. This paper proposes a two-step fine-tuning framework called Few-shot object detection via Association and Discrimination (FADI), which constructs a discriminable feature space for each novel class through association and discrimination steps. Experimental results show that FADI improves upon existing baselines and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.
