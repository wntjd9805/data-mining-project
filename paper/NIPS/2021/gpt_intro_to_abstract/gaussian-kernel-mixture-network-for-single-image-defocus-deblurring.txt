This paper addresses the problem of single image defocus deblurring (SIDD), which involves reconstructing an all-in-focus image from a defocused image. Most existing methods for SIDD use a two-stage approach, which involves estimating a dense defocus map and then performing nonblind image deconvolution to recover the image. However, this approach suffers from inaccurate estimation and high computational cost. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep neural network (DNN) that directly predicts the all-in-focus image from the defocused image. The DNN is based on a Gaussian kernel mixture (GKM) model for defocus blur kernels and a fixed-point iteration unrolling scheme. The proposed DNN is more efficient and more accurate than existing methods, as demonstrated in experiments.
