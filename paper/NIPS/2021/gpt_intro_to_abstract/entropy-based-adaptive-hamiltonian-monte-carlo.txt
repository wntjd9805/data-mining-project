This paper explores the problem of sampling from a target density using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) methods. HMC methods sample from a Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution based on a Hamiltonian function that splits the total energy into potential and kinetic energy terms. The Hamiltonian dynamics are governed by a set of differential equations, and the exact HMC flow preserves volume and conserves total energy. However, the exact flow cannot be computed, so numerical approximations, such as the leapfrog method, are commonly used. The leapfrog method is a second-order integrator that approximates the Hamiltonian flow while preserving some geometric properties. In this paper, the authors aim to explore a generalized speed measure for adapting the HMC algorithm, with a focus on proposals that have a high average log-acceptance rate and high entropy.
