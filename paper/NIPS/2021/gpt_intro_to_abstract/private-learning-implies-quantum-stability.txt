Learning an unknown quantum state is a crucial task in quantum computing, known as tomography, with applications in entanglement verification, noise control, and correlation understanding. Recent breakthroughs have revealed the necessity of exponentially scaling copies of the state for accurate estimation, limiting practical implementation. Concurrently, the use of machine learning techniques in quantum computing has gained popularity. This paper explores the connections between different quantum state learning models, extending classical learning theory to real-valued functions with noisy labels. The results highlight the differences between classical Boolean functions and real-valued settings, with implications for both quantum and classical learning.
