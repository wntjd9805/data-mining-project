The paper introduces the task of few-shot object detection (FSOD) and highlights the challenges of learning generalized and discriminative object features from a small number of annotated training samples. The authors discuss existing approaches that utilize meta-learning strategies but fail to effectively improve generalization and discrimination of object features. To address these limitations, the authors propose a method called SVD-Dictionary enhancement for FSOD, which leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to enhance the generalization and discrimination abilities of detectors. The method involves extracting feature maps, performing SVD, creating a generalization map, enhancing generalization through a residual operation, calculating a discrimination map using residual eigenvectors, and using dictionary learning to capture discriminative information. The authors demonstrate the superior performance of their method through extensive experiments on two benchmarks.
