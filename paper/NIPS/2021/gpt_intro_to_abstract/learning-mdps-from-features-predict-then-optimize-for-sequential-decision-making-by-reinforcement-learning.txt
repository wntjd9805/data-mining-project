This paper introduces the concept of the predict-then-optimize framework for solving optimization problems with unknown parameters. The framework involves training a predictive model to predict the missing parameters from problem features, with the objective of maximizing decision quality when the optimization problem is subsequently solved using the predicted parameters. The paper focuses on studying the predict-then-optimize framework in sequential decision problems formulated as Markov decision processes (MDPs) with unknown parameters. It explores two common types of optimality conditions in MDPs and proposes computational techniques to address the challenges of differentiating through these conditions. The proposed decision-focused learning algorithms are empirically tested and shown to outperform traditional two-stage approaches, with the low-rank approximation technique significantly improving scalability.
