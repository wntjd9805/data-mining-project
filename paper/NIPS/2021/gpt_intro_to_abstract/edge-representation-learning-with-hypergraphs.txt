In this paper, we address the limitations of existing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in capturing edge information in graph-structured data. Most GNNs focus on node-level representation learning and overlook the importance of edges. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel scheme called Dual Hypergraph Transformation (DHT) to represent edges as nodes in a hypergraph. This approach allows us to apply existing message-passing schemes for node-level representation learning to edges. We also introduce two novel graph pooling methods, HyperCluster and HyperDrop, to obtain compact graph-level edge representations. We experimentally validate our methods on graph reconstruction, generation, and classification tasks, demonstrating their effectiveness in accurately representing edges and outperforming existing graph representation learning methods.
