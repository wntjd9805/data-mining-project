In this paper, we investigate the expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in capturing automorphic equivalence (AE) within each node's local neighborhood. AE is a concept that differentiates the structural role of nodes in a graph, and it has implications in various scientific domains. We propose a novel variant of GNN called GRAPE (GRaph AutomorPhic Equivalent network) that can learn expressive representations by differentiating the automorphic equivalences of each node's neighbors. GRAPE extends the AE concept into a localized setting called Ego-AE, identifies local neighborhoods of nodes, partitions neighboring nodes into Ego-AE sets, and designs learnable AE-aware aggregators to model node features in these sets. We also propose an efficient genetic algorithm to automatically search for optimal subgraph templates, and we theoretically prove that GRAPE is expressive in learning distinct representations for nodes with different Ego-AE sets. Empirical validation on real-world datasets demonstrates the superior performance of GRAPE compared to other popular GNN variants, with up to 26.7% accuracy improvement. Case studies and experiments also showcase GRAPE's ability to differentiate the structural roles of node neighbors and the efficiency of the genetic algorithm in generating high-quality subgraph templates.
