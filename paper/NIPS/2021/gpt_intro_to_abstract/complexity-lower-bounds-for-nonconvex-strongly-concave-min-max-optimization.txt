In this paper, we study the oracle complexity lower bound of a min-max optimization problem that arises in various applications, such as two-player zero-sum games, Generative Adversarial Networks, and robust optimization. The problem involves finding the minimum of a function over one set and the maximum of another function over another set. Previous research has mainly focused on convex-concave functions, where the existence of a saddle point is guaranteed. However, for nonconvex-nonconcave problems, the existence of a saddle point is not guaranteed, posing a challenge in finding a suitable definition for min-max points. In this work, we analyze the gradient oracle complexity in the nonconvex-strongly-concave min-max setting and provide an explicit example where no first-order zero-respecting algorithm can achieve an oracle complexity lower than a certain bound. We also extend our results to the stochastic setting and discuss the implications of our findings on the dependency of the condition number.
