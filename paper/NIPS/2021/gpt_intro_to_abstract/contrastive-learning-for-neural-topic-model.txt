Topic models, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation, have been widely used in Natural Language Processing for various applications. However, these models have limitations in capturing multi-modality aspects and semantic patterns of documents. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Adversarial Topic Model (ATM) that addresses these limitations by using a combination of generator and discriminator. We also introduce a new sampling strategy that mimics human behavior when comparing documents. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of topic coherence.
