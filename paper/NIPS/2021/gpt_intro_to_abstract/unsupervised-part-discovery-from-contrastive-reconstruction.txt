Humans perceive the world as a collection of distinct objects, and understanding the parts that make up these objects is crucial for higher-level tasks in visual scene understanding. However, manually annotating these parts is slow and expensive, leading to a growing interest in unsupervised part discovery and segmentation. In this paper, we focus on automatically discovering parts of visual object classes by leveraging unsupervised learning principles, such as consistency to transformation, visual consistency, and distinctiveness. We explore the effectiveness of contrastive learning and the limitations of clustering pre-trained features for part discovery. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation protocol that measures the co-occurrence statistics of predicted parts and ground-truth annotations, resulting in a more meaningful measure for assessing automated part discovery. Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate the improvements made in automated part discovery compared to prior work on standard benchmarks.
