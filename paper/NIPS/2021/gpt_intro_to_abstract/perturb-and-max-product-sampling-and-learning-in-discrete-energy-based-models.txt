In this work, the problem of black-box parameter estimation for discrete energy-based models (EBMs) is examined. The likelihood of the parameters given the data is desired for estimation, but computing the likelihood is challenging due to the partition function. Several existing approaches have been proposed, but they have limitations such as being model-dependent or requiring additional designs. Sampling, particularly Gibbs sampling, has shown promising results for EBM learning. However, slow mixing can limit its usability. A new approach called Perturb-and-MAP is discussed but has not been widely adopted due to computational constraints. This work introduces max-product algorithm as a way to perform efficient MAP inference in non-tractable cases, expanding the applicability of Perturb-and-MAP and potentially outperforming existing methods.
