Foreground extraction is a crucial task in image segmentation, aiming to partition an image into foreground and background regions. Existing methods rely on low-level visual features and human intervention, limiting their practical performance on complex natural images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Deep Region Competition (DRC) that combines energy-based prior with generative image modeling using Mixture of Experts (MoE). Our method leverages the interaction between the mixture components to achieve effective foreground-background partitioning through Expectation-Maximization (EM). Experimental results demonstrate that DRC outperforms prior methods in complex real-world scenarios and provides explicit identification of foreground and background regions. Additionally, DRC shows potential for generalization to unseen foreground objects, which has implications for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in unsupervised disentanglement.
