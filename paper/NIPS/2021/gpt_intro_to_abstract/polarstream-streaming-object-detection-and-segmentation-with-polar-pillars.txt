This paper introduces an efficient streaming-based lidar perception model using a polar grid for accurately perceiving objects in dense urban environments. Existing methods ignore the sequential nature of lidar scans, leading to a large data capture latency. The proposed model represents point cloud sectors using polar pillars, which address the inefficiency of previous streaming approaches. To enhance context, the model pads features from neighboring sectors. The paper also addresses the distortion issue in polar representations by proposing a feature undistortion module and range stratified convolution and normalization layers. The proposed model, PolarStream, achieves superior performance on 3D object detection, lidar segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks, outperforming other streaming methods while maintaining speed. Several contributions, including the efficient streaming model, multi-scale context padding, and improvements to convolutions on a polar grid, are highlighted.
