This paper introduces the problem of decision making in dynamical systems and the challenges of intervention at different time points. It presents a probabilistic framework for finding optimal interventions over time, using the example of an economy's unemployment rate, economic growth, and inflation rate. The paper discusses existing approaches such as Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO), Adaptive Bayesian Optimization (ABO), and Bayesian Optimization (BO), highlighting their limitations in accounting for temporal evolution and causal structure. To address these limitations, the paper proposes Dynamic Causal Bayesian Optimization (DCBO), which integrates CBO with dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN) to capture causal relationships and temporal dynamics. DCBO offers a novel approach for decision making under uncertainty in dynamical systems and demonstrates improved performance compared to competing approaches. The contributions of the paper include formulating the Dynamic Causal Global Optimization (DCGO) problem, providing theoretical results on interventional information transfer, presenting the DCBO methodology, and analyzing its performance in various settings.
