Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown success in various sequential decision-making problems, but solving complex and long-horizon tasks remains challenging. Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) offers a promising direction by enabling control at multiple time scales. Among HRL frameworks, goal-conditioned HRL has been effective in long and complex tasks. However, the acquisition of effective subgoals is crucial, and existing methods often result in poor high-level exploration. To address this, the authors propose a novel framework called HIerarchical reinforcement learning Guided by Landmarks (HIGL). HIGL includes landmark sampling schemes for diverse and novel landmarks and a landmark-guided subgoal generation method. The effectiveness of HIGL is demonstrated in various continuous control tasks, outperforming the prior state-of-the-art method.
