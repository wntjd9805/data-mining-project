Geometric 3D representation is crucial in computer vision and computer graphics tasks, but current representations lack certain properties necessary for effective 3D deep learning. This paper introduces OctField, a novel 3D representation that addresses these limitations by leveraging a hierarchical data structure called Octree. OctField adaptsively subdivides the 3D space based on surface occupancy and geometric details, optimizing modeling capacity and memory efficiency. The paper also presents a hierarchical encoder-decoder network that allows for differentiable learning of the octree structure and surface geometry. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of OctField in terms of shape quality and memory efficiency.
