Black-box optimization problems with multiple noisy objectives are common in science and engineering. This paper introduces a novel multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) algorithm, called noisy expected hypervolume improvement (NEHVI), that can handle noisy observations and scale to highly parallel evaluations. The algorithm is based on expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) and utilizes a differentiable, cached box decomposition (CBD) implementation to efficiently account for uncertainty and generate new candidate points. NEHVI achieves state-of-the-art performance in various benchmarks and provides the most extensive evaluation of noisy parallel MOBO to date. The paper also discusses preliminary concepts, such as multi-objective optimization and Bayesian optimization, and compares MOBO with evolutionary algorithms.
