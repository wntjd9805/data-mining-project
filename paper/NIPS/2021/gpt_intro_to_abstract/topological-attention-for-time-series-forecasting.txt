This paper introduces a novel approach to incorporate local topological information into neural forecasting models. The approach focuses on computing features of short, overlapping time windows, allowing the forecasting model to attend to these features. Unlike previous works, this approach does not compute a global topological summary of historical observations. The proposed method integrates well with recent techniques, such as N-BEATS, and comes with moderate computational cost, making it applicable to large-scale forecasting problems. The problem statement involves learning a function from a given collection of inputs and targets, with two different settings: either a large collection of time series is available, or only a single time series is accessible.
