Integrals are widely used in various scientific fields, but closed-form solutions for integrals are rare. Therefore, numerical integration methods, such as quadratures, are crucial for approximating integrals accurately. Quadratures approximate the integral of a function by a finite mixture of its evaluations, making them practical and versatile. In this paper, we focus on a specific type of quadrature rule known as Ermakov and Zolotukhin quadrature (EZQ) and analyze its properties using kernel methods. By comparing EZQ with the optimal kernel quadrature (OKQ), we show that both belong to a broader class of quadrature rules termed kernel-based interpolation quadrature. Additionally, we investigate the approximation quality of EZQ in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs) and derive a tractable formula for the expected value of the squared worst-case integration error when nodes follow a determinantal point process distribution. Our theoretical guarantees for EZQ are independent of the test function, enabling a straightforward comparison with other quadrature methods. The article is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a review of related work, Section 3 presents the main results and their consequences, Section 4 gives a sketch of the proof, Section 5 presents numerical experiments, and Section 6 concludes the paper.
