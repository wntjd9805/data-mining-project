Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have made significant advancements in computer vision tasks, but their sensitivity to perturbations and noise limit their robustness. Inspired by the brain's feedback connections, this paper explores the potential of incorporating recurrent dynamics to enhance the robustness of artificial neural networks. The authors propose a strategy based on predictive coding and implement it in two pre-trained feedforward architectures. They demonstrate that this method improves robustness against various types of noise and suggest that it can iteratively shift noisy representations towards clean representations. To facilitate further research, they provide a Python package called Predify that can easily implement predictive coding dynamics in any convolutional neural network.
