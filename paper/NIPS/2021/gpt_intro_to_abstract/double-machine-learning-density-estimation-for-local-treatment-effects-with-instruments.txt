Controlled experimentation is a valuable tool in empirical sciences for determining the effect of treatment on outcomes. However, issues such as non-compliance and unmeasured confounding can hinder the identification of treatment effects. To address this, instrumental variables (IVs) are used, which are correlated with the treatment but do not directly influence the outcome. In this paper, we focus on estimating densities of local treatment effects in IV settings under the assumption of monotonicity. We propose two families of methods based on kernel-smoothing and model-based approximations to estimate these densities. The methods are constructed using double/debiased machine learning (DML) style density estimators and we analyze their convergence properties. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods through synthetic and real data experiments.
