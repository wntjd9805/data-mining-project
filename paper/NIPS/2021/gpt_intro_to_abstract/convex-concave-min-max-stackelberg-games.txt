Min-max optimization problems have gained significant attention in machine learning, with applications in various areas such as reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks, and fairness in machine learning. This paper explores the computation of competitive equilibria in Fisher markets as a convex-concave min-max optimization problem with dependent feasible sets. The authors introduce two first-order methods for solving min-max Stackelberg games, providing explicit formulas for the subdifferential of the value function. The algorithms are shown to converge in polynomial time to a Stackelberg equilibrium, and their effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on Fisher markets with different utility structures.
