We introduce the Bipartite Caching problem, which is a critical component of large-scale internet services like Content Distribution Networks (CDN) and Cloud Computing. The problem involves optimizing the placement of files in caches connected to users in order to maximize the number of hits by unknown incoming requests. This problem is a generalization of the online k-sets problem and is challenging due to the interaction among caches and the non-linear reward function. We also provide a reduction of the Network Caching problem to the Bipartite Caching problem and discuss the problem formulation, caching policies, and performance evaluation. Our algorithms can be extended to the general Network Caching problem as well.
