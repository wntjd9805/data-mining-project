Cellular reprogramming, the process of transforming cells from one type to another, holds great promise in regenerative medicine. A common approach to achieve this is by modeling the gene expression of a cell using a structural causal model. By performing interventions such as gene knockouts or over-expression of transcription factors, researchers can infer the structure of the underlying gene regulatory network and identify the intervention needed for successful reprogramming. However, this task is challenging, especially when there is little prior knowledge of the causal model and when the set of interventions is constrained. In this paper, we introduce the concept of causal matching, where a series of interventions is performed to identify a matching intervention that transforms the system to a desired state. We focus on a specific type of intervention called shift intervention, which directly modifies the perturbation targets and their downstream variables. We demonstrate the existence of a unique matching intervention that exactly transforms the mean of the variables into the desired mean. We propose active learning strategies that utilize the Markov equivalence class of a causal graph induced by shift interventions to identify the matching intervention. These strategies are shown to be optimal and more efficient than previous methods. Empirical results also validate the superiority of our proposed strategies.
