In this paper, we propose a dynamic-resolution network (DRNet) that adjusts the input resolution of each sample for efficient inference. We introduce a resolution predictor that determines the minimum resolution required for accurate image classification. By dynamically selecting the resolution, we can save computational costs for easy samples while preserving accuracy for difficult samples. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in reducing computational costs while maintaining network performance.
