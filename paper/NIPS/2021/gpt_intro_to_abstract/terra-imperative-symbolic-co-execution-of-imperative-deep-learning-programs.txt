This paper introduces Terra, an imperative-symbolic co-execution system that aims to address the limitations of previous approaches for executing deep learning programs. Unlike previous systems that either rely solely on imperative execution or symbolic execution, Terra combines both approaches to support all Python features while delegating deep learning operations to symbolic execution. Terra generates a symbolic graph by collecting and merging multiple traces of an imperative program, and it adds additional information to enable communication between imperative and symbolic execution. Through evaluations, Terra is shown to achieve faster performance compared to TensorFlow's imperative execution and AutoGraph, while also correctly handling imperative deep learning programs that previous approaches cannot handle.
