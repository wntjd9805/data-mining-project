This paper introduces a novel class of graph neural networks (GNNs) based on the discretised non-Euclidean diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) in joint positional and feature space. Inspired by the Beltrami flow used in image processing, the proposed model, called Beltrami Neural Diffusion (BLEND), offers a principled view on positional encoding and graph rewiring. By replacing GNN layers with more flexible adaptive numerical schemes, BLEND achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular benchmarks. This approach explores new tools from PDEs and differential geometry, offering a fresh perspective in the graph ML community.
