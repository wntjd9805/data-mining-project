Machine learning models are increasingly being used to make important decisions, such as loan approvals and hiring decisions. As a result, there is a need for tools and techniques that can provide recourse to individuals who have been adversely affected by these predictions. Existing approaches generate recourses under the assumption that the predictive models do not change, but in practice, models are often retrained and updated, leading to model shifts. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic framework called RObust Algorithmic Recourse (ROAR) that generates instance level recourses that are robust to changes in the underlying predictive model. We introduce a minimax objective to construct robust recourses while minimizing recourse costs, and we evaluate our approach on real world data to demonstrate its effectiveness.
