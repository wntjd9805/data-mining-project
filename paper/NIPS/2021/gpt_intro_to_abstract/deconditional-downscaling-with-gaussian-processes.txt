Spatial observations in computer science often suffer from limited resolution, such as in remote sensing atmosphere products that provide measurements of atmospheric properties but only at a low resolution. To refine these low-resolution variables for local-scale analysis, statistical methods can be used to enhance the details by downscaling the observations. This can be achieved by utilizing high-resolution observations to refine the low-resolution field through the aggregation of an underlying high-resolution field. Existing approaches to downscaling rely on access to paired high-resolution covariates and aggregated targets, which may not always be feasible. In this paper, the authors propose a mediated statistical downscaling setup that only requires indirect matching between low-resolution and high-resolution covariates through a mediating field. They introduce a Bayesian formulation of the deconditioning problem and extend it to a multi-resolution setup, providing computationally efficient algorithms to estimate the underlying field. The proposed model is benchmarked against existing methods on synthetic and real-world atmospheric data, demonstrating improved performance.
