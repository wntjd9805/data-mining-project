This paper explores the concept of consciousness in path planning and its potential application in reinforcement learning agents. The authors propose an architecture inspired by human consciousness that allows attention to be focused on a small set of variables at any given time. The architecture utilizes a selective attention bottleneck mechanism and a Model Predictive Control framework for decision-time planning. Experimental results demonstrate improved Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) generalization in environments with consistent dynamics.
