This paper introduces a novel self-supervised learning framework for event-based optical flow estimation using deep spiking neural networks (SNNs). The authors highlight the energy efficiency and low-latency benefits of neuromorphic hardware and propose an event-based communication and processing paradigm for optimal performance. They address the challenges of incompatible pipelines and limited transferability of traditional learning algorithms to SNNs. The main contributions include a reformulated self-supervised loss function and the successful training of deep SNNs for solving the optical flow estimation problem. The proposed framework is extensively evaluated through quantitative and qualitative assessments, considering various factors such as parameter initialization, optimization, surrogate gradient shape, and adaptive neuronal mechanisms.
