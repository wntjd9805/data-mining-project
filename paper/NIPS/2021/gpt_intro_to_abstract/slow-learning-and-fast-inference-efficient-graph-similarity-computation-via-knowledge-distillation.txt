Measuring the similarity between graphs is a core problem in graph data mining, with applications in various tasks such as graph retrieval, plagiarism detection, and graph clustering. Exact computation of graph similarity distances is computationally expensive, especially for large-scale graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for graph similarity computation using graph neural networks (GNNs). Our approach leverages the strong representational power of GNNs and adopts a Graph Isomorphism Network as the backbone. We propose a new design for cross-graph fusion and employ an attention layer for smooth feature fusion. To improve efficiency, we remove early feature fusion modules in the encoder and use knowledge distillation for training a smaller, faster model without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.
