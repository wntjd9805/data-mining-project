This paper addresses the phase retrieval problem of recovering a signal from noisy magnitude-only measurements. The problem is commonly encountered in diffraction imaging, X-ray crystallography, microscopy, optics, and astronomy. To reduce the number of required measurements, the paper explores the use of signal sparsity and generative models. Previous works have shown promising results in using generative priors to reduce measurement requirements. This paper aims to provide recovery guarantees with near-optimal sample complexity bounds for both sparse and generative priors in compressive phase retrieval.
