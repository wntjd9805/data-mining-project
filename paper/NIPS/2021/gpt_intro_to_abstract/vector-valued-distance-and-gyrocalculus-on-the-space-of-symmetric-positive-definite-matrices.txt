This paper introduces the concept of the vector-valued distance function to fully exploit the representation power of Symmetric Positive DeÔ¨Ånite (SPD) matrices in computer vision tasks. The authors address the limitations of previous approximation methods and propose distance metrics on SPD manifolds to leverage the geometric properties of SPD. They also develop gyrocalculus in SPD, allowing for closed-form expressions of arithmetic operations and adapting neural network architectures to SPD manifolds. The authors demonstrate the superiority of SPD models in various experiments and showcase the utility of the vector-valued distance in explaining and visualizing the learned representations. This work contributes to the understanding and application of the rich geometry of SPD matrices in computer science.
