Bayesian inference has been widely used in statistics for image denoising, but existing methods like SURE and Noise2X have limitations. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Noise2Score, which leverages Tweedie's formula from Bayesian statistics to compute the posterior mean of canonical parameters for denoising. By estimating the score function, we can effectively reduce the self-supervised image denoising problem to the problem of estimating the score function. This new perspective offers theoretical implications and flexibility in algorithm implementation. We show that Noise2Score outperforms SURE and Noise2X in empirical experiments with additive Gaussian, Poisson, and Gamma noise models. Furthermore, Noise2Score can be extended to blind setups where noise parameters are unknown.
