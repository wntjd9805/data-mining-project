Recommender systems aim to accurately predict user preferences by capturing information from various aspects. Recently, learning disentangled representations from user behavioral data has shown promising results in improving recommendation accuracy and explainability. Multi-feedback, including both positive and negative feedback, is crucial for understanding unbiased user intentions. However, learning disentangled representations from multi-feedback is challenging due to the complexity and noise in the data. In this paper, we propose a Curriculum Disentangled Recommendation (CDR) model that effectively discovers user intentions from different types of feedback. The CDR model consists of a co-filering dynamic routing mechanism and an adjustable self-evaluating curriculum strategy, which capture complex relational dependencies and filter out noise. We conduct experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed CDR model in recommendation accuracy. Our contributions include proposing a CDR model to handle complex relations and noisy information, introducing a co-filering dynamic routing mechanism, and implementing an adjustable self-evaluating curriculum.
