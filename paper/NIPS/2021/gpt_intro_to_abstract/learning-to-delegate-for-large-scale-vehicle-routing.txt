This paper introduces a learning-based framework called learning-to-delegate for solving large-scale Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs). The authors address the scalability issue of existing methods by training a subproblem selector using machine learning techniques. This selector identifies smaller subproblems that can be easily solved using traditional solvers, reducing computation time while maintaining solution quality. The proposed framework combines the benefits of learning and heuristics, significantly speeding up solution times and achieving good solution quality. Extensive validation demonstrates the effectiveness of learning-to-delegate on various VRP variants, distributions, and solvers. The paper also provides preliminary information on Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problems (CVRP) to establish the problem context.
