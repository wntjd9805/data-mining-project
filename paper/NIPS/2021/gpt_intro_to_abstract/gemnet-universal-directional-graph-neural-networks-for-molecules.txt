Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise in predicting the energy and other quantum mechanical properties of molecules. However, they have limitations in distinguishing between certain molecules and require a large number of training samples. In this paper, we address these limitations by proving the universality of GNNs in the case of invariance to translations and rotations and equivariance to permutations. We also extend this result to rotationally equivariant predictions. We propose an edge-based two-hop message passing scheme called geometric message passing and make structural enhancements to improve its practical performance. We develop the GemNet model, which outperforms previous methods for molecular dynamics prediction.
