Most deep learning methods rely on training with large amounts of labeled data, but struggle to generalize to different domains. Domain Adaptation (DA) addresses this issue by transferring knowledge from a source to a target domain. Existing DA methods typically require labeled source data during the adaptation process, but this is not always practical or accessible. A new challenging scenario called source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) has emerged, where only the source pretrained model is available for adaptation. This paper focuses on closed-set source-free domain adaptation and proposes a method called Neighborhood Reciprocity Clustering (NRC). NRC exploits the intrinsic neighborhood structure of the target data and assigns different weights to the supervision from nearest neighbors, encouraging reciprocal neighbors to have consistent label predictions. Experimental results show that NRC achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to related methods.
