Knowledge graphs are widely used in scientific and machine learning applications and knowledge graph completion, the problem of predicting missing relations in a graph, is crucial in real-world applications. Existing models for knowledge graph embedding often overlook the presence of non-hierarchical relations and are only suitable for graphs with a single hierarchical relation type, limiting their applicability to real-world knowledge graphs that encode multiple hierarchies using different relations. In this paper, we propose ConE, a novel hyperbolic knowledge graph embedding model that addresses these challenges. ConE embeds entities into the product space of hyperbolic planes, where each hyperbolic plane corresponds to a 2D hyperbolic cone. Non-hierarchical relations are modeled as hyperbolic cone rotations, while hierarchical relations are modeled as restricted rotations that guarantee cone containment. By assigning distinct embedding subspaces for each hierarchical relation, ConE preserves multiple heterogeneous hierarchies simultaneously. Experimental results show that ConE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KG completion task and hierarchical reasoning task, outperforming baseline models and effectively modeling multiple hierarchies.
