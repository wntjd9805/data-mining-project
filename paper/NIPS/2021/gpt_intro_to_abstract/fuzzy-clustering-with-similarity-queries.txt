The introduction introduces the k-means objective for clustering, discussing its popularity and the existence of approximate solutions. It then explores the incorporation of active learning in k-means clustering, specifically through label/membership queries. The paper aims to show that a polynomial-time solution exists when a limited number of such queries are permitted. The introduction also discusses the use of crowdsourcing models as oracles for clustering tasks. Additionally, the introduction introduces fuzzy k-means, a generalized model that allows for overlapping clusters and is applicable to various applications. The theoretical and computational tractability of fuzzy k-means are discussed, as well as the use of membership and similarity queries in clustering algorithms. The paper's main motivation is to explore the number of queries needed to efficiently solve fuzzy clustering and provide theoretical guarantees. The paper presents several algorithms and analyzes their query and computational complexities, showcasing their performance on real-world datasets. The introduction emphasizes the technical challenges of fuzzy clustering compared to hard k-means and describes the tools and methods used to address these challenges, including random sub-sampling algorithms and self-normalized importance sampling estimators.
