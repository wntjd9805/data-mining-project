Inverse problems are common in imaging applications, where the objective is to recover an unknown model parameter from incomplete and noisy measurements. In this paper, we consider the variational framework for solving inverse problems by incorporating prior knowledge about the parameter through a regularization functional. We discuss the challenges and advantages of data-driven approaches, specifically end-to-end trained models and learned regularization methods. Our work combines ideas from learned optimization, adversarial machine learning, and the variational framework to propose a method that offers the flexibility of training on unpaired samples, produces fast reconstructions comparable to supervised methods, and maintains the well-posedness and stability guarantees of the learned regularization framework. We provide an overview of the literature on data-driven solutions for inverse problems before detailing our contributions.
