Event data is abundant in various real-world applications, such as financial systems, server logs, and user activity traces. Detecting anomalies in event data can provide significant value, but manual inspection is often infeasible due to its sheer volume. In this paper, we propose an adaptive system for automatically detecting abnormal event sequences in a completely unsupervised way. We formulate the problem as out-of-distribution (OoD) detection and draw connections between OoD detection and goodness-of-fit (GoF) testing for neural temporal point processes (TPPs). We introduce a new test statistic for TPPs that addresses the limitations of popular GoF statistics and demonstrates high accuracy on synthetic and real-world event data. Our contributions fill a gap in the existing literature on neural TPPs and provide a valuable approach for anomaly detection in continuous-time event data.
