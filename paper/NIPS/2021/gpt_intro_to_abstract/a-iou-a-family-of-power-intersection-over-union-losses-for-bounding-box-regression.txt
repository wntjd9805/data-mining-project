Bounding box (bbox) regression is an important task in object detection, localization, and tracking. Previous approaches have used different loss functions for bbox regression, including (cid:96)n-norm losses and the Intersection over Union (IoU) loss. While IoU-based losses have advantages such as scale invariance, they suffer from the gradient vanishing problem and may lead to inaccurate detectors. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new family of power IoU losses, called α-IoU, by applying power transformations to existing IoU-based losses. The authors show that α-IoU losses can improve the accuracy of bbox regression by up-weighting the loss and gradient of high IoU objects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of α-IoU losses on various object detection datasets and models, outperforming existing IoU-based losses and providing robustness for small datasets and noisy bboxes.
