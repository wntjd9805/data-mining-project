Voting systems play a significant role in various aspects of our lives, including democratic elections, decision-making in companies and families, and product design. The development of voting rules is a fundamental aspect of voting theory, which aims to reconcile differences and maximize collective objectives. While numerous voting rules have been proposed, many of them have limitations, such as not considering voters' preferences or being computationally expensive. Additionally, designing voting rules that maximize social welfare is challenging, as diverse social welfare functions exist but lack corresponding optimal voting rules. In this paper, we propose using permutation-invariant neural network (PIN) architectures, such as DeepSet, Set Transformer, and Graph Isomorphism Network, to address these limitations and learn voting rules. We demonstrate the theoretical and empirical suitability of these PIN architectures and their ability to represent classical voting rules accurately. Furthermore, we train the networks to maximize utilitarian and egalitarian social welfare functions and show that they discover novel voting rules that outperform classical voting rules in terms of social welfare maximization. The paper is organized into sections that provide background on voting theory, describe the methodology of using PINs to learn voting rules, present comprehensive experimental results, discuss related work, and highlight limitations and conclusions.
