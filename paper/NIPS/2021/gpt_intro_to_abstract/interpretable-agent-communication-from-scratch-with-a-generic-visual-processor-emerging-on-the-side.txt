This paper focuses on studying emergent discrete referential communication between two deep network agents. The authors explore the relationship between the referential discrimination task and pretext contrastive objectives used in self-supervised visual representation learning. They develop a robust end-to-end variant of a communication game and conduct experiments to show that the networks develop a set of discrete symbols allowing them to successfully discriminate objects in natural images. The emergence of these symbols is seen as a step towards unsupervised image annotation, and the visual representations induced as a by-product can be used as high-quality general-purpose features for object classification tasks.
