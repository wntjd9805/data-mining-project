Collaborative machine learning (CML) is a process where multiple agents pool their resources for a common learning task. This paper focuses on federated learning (FL), a type of CML where agents perform local model training and share their model parameter updates. However, the agents in FL are self-interested, so it is important to incentivize them to contribute high-quality information. To address this, the paper proposes a fair reward mechanism based on FL, using the cosine gradient Shapley value (CGSV) to evaluate the agents' contributions without needing an auxiliary validation dataset. The paper also introduces a gradient reward mechanism that ensures fairness by sparsifying the aggregated parameter updates downloaded from the server as rewards to each agent. The effectiveness of the proposed mechanism is empirically demonstrated on multiple benchmark datasets.
