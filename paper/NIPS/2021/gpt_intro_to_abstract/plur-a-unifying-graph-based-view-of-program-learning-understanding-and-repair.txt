The introduction of this paper discusses the use of sequence-to-sequence and text-to-text abstractions in natural language processing and how they have benefited machine learning researchers. However, when it comes to machine learning for source code (ML4Code), the inherent differences in the structure and characteristics of source code compared to natural language pose unique challenges. The paper proposes the GRAPH2TOCOPO formulation as a unified framework for ML4Code that incorporates graph structures, pointers, and copy mechanisms. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework by achieving state-of-the-art results on various ML4Code tasks and exploring different design choices. The PLUR framework, as a result of this research, offers a powerful and simplified perspective for interpreting and building upon recent ML4Code advancements.
