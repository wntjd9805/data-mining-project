In this paper, we address the problem of computing optimal mechanisms in unstructured dynamic environments. Specifically, we focus on single-agent, discrete-time dynamic environments with a finite time horizon. Our main results include the development of a polynomial-time algorithm for computing optimal mechanisms in fixed time horizons, as well as the identification of the NP-hardness of approximating the principal's optimal utility within a factor of (7/8 + ε) for any ε > 0 for large time horizons. These findings provide insights into the computational complexity of dynamic mechanism design in unstructured environments and contribute to the existing literature in this field.
