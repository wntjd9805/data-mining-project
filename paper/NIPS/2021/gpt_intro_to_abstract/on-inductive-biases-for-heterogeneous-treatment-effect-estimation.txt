The rapid growth of machine learning literature on heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in fields like personalized medicine has sparked interest in the problem of estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) within the potential outcomes framework. While existing methods have focused on addressing the presence of confounding, there has been little attention given to exploiting the similarity between potential outcome functions. In this paper, we investigate approaches that incorporate inductive biases for shared structure into CATE estimation, including a soft approach that uses regularization, a hard approach that uses model specification, and a flexible approach that adapts multi-task learning. We evaluate these approaches using neural networks and find that all methods can improve upon existing baselines, with the flexible approach performing best on average. We also highlight the importance of considering the structural similarities between potential outcome functions in CATE estimation.
