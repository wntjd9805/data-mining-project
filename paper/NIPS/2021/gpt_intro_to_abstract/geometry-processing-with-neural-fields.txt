In this paper, we explore the possibility of performing geometry processing tasks entirely using neural fields as an alternative to polygonal mesh representations. We investigate the challenges associated with implicit representations and propose a method that leverages the infinite differentiability of neural fields to approximate surface geometry properties and optimize loss functions. We focus on shape filtering and topology-preserving deformations as examples of these tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach compared to mesh-based baselines. Our work aims to inspire future developments in geometry processing algorithms using neural fields.
