We present a problem in computer science of estimating a rank-1 signal from a noisy data matrix. We examine the cases of both square symmetric and rectangular data matrices, and explore the performance of the principal eigenvector as an estimator in the symmetric case (singular vectors in the rectangular case). However, the principal component analysis (PCA) estimator is not sufficient for capturing the structure of the unknown signal in many applications. To improve on this, we introduce the use of approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms, which can be tailored to take advantage of prior information about the signal's structure. We focus specifically on AMP algorithms for rank-1 matrix estimation with rotationally invariant noise matrices. Our main contribution is the development of an AMP algorithm initialized with the PCA estimator, and we provide a rigorous characterization of its performance through state evolution analysis. We also propose a two-phase artificial AMP algorithm to circumvent the dependency on the noise matrix in the PCA initialization. We demonstrate the practical performance of AMP through numerical simulations, highlighting the importance of denoising functions in the algorithm's effectiveness.
