Recent research in computer vision has focused on improving the robustness of neural networks. Adversarial training has been a popular approach, where networks are trained to resist perturbations made by adversaries. However, current methods only address small pixel-level perturbations and do not consider other sources of brittleness such as changes in image style and appearance. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Adversarial Batch Normalization (AdvBN) that makes networks robust to various changes in image space including texture, color, and brightness. AdvBN layers perform adversarial feature shifts during gradient updates, allowing networks to resist different domain shifts without the need for additional auxiliary data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AdvBN in improving image appearance, style, and semantic segmentation, as well as enhancing cross-domain generalization.
