Neural systems often involve multiple neurons driven by one external event or convergence of multiple neural inputs onto a single neuron. This raises the question of how multiple variables hold information about a singleton variable. Williams and Beer proposed a partial information decomposition (PID) framework to analyze this issue, decomposing the mutual information between multiple source variables and a target variable into unique, redundant, and synergistic contributions. The PID framework has been useful in various fields, including neuroscience, where understanding how neural circuits integrate information from multiple sources is crucial. This paper extends the PID framework to continuous variables and presents a method to estimate the unique information for generic continuous probability densities. The approach utilizes an appropriate copula parametrization and techniques from variational autoencoders. The method is demonstrated through illustrative examples in Section 4.
