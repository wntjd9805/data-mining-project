This paper addresses the problem of integrating deep learning and symbolic reasoning in artificial intelligence. The authors propose a framework called Scallop, which introduces a parameter k to specify the level of reasoning granularity. By reasoning only about the top-k most likely proofs, Scallop reduces computational cost while maintaining accuracy guarantees. The framework is applied to tasks such as mathematical and logical reasoning over hand-written digits and Visual Question Answering with Reasoning (VQAR). Experimental results demonstrate that Scallop outperforms existing approaches in terms of scalability and accuracy.
