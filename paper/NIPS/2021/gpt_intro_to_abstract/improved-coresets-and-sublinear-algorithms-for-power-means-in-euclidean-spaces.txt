Large data sets have led to the emergence of sublinear algorithms, which aim to solve problems without reading the entire input. This paper focuses on estimating power means in high dimensional Euclidean spaces, where the goal is to determine the number of uniform queries needed to extract a power mean with a desired level of accuracy. The power mean problem has applications in computational geometry, multivariate statistics, and non-Euclidean distances. The authors propose a sublinear algorithm that approximates the power mean with a polylogarithmic query complexity, and they present a novel analysis for constructing coresets for these problems. They also prove the tightness of their algorithm and analyze the challenges of applying stochastic gradient descent and designing uniform sampling techniques in a sublinear setting. The paper introduces improvements to existing frameworks and presents a chaining method for achieving more accurate discretizations. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and simplicity of the proposed algorithm.
