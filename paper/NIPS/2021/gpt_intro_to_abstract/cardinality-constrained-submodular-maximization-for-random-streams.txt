Submodularity is a useful property in discrete optimization problems, representing diminishing returns as the set of items considered increases. This property is relevant in machine learning, information retrieval, and influence maximization. In big data applications, where data may not be available in a random-access model, streaming algorithms are needed to efficiently process massive amounts of data in a small buffer of memory. In this paper, we focus on streaming submodular maximization with random element arrival, which is motivated by the prevalence of submodularity in big-data applications. We consider the problem of maximizing a submodular function under a cardinality constraint in the streaming setting, where an algorithm makes a single pass over the data stream. We introduce an oracle model and distinguish between weak and strong oracle access. Our contributions include approximation algorithms for both monotone and non-monotone submodular maximization with limited memory usage, as well as hardness results that highlight the memory requirements for achieving certain approximation ratios.
