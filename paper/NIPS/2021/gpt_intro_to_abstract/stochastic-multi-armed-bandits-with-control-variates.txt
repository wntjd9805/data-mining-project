This paper introduces the concept of using control variates (CVs) in the stochastic multi-armed bandits (MAB) setting to improve decision making under uncertainty. CVs are observable inputs that are correlated with the random variable of interest, and they can be used to reduce variance and improve precision in estimate calculations. The paper discusses the application of CVs in real-life scenarios, such as job aggregation platforms and wireless systems, and explores methods for constructing tight confidence intervals for mean reward estimators. The authors develop an algorithm called Upper Confidence Bounds with Control Variates (UCB-CV) and compare its performance to existing algorithms. Additionally, they discuss adaptation methods for general distributions and validate the performance of UCB-CV using synthetically generated data.
