We develop upper bounding algorithms for the constrained most probable explanation (CMPE) task, a discrete optimization problem over probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) or log-linear models. The CMPE task adds a global capacity constraint to the classic optimization problem in PGMs called most probable explanation (MPE). Our interest in CMPE stems from its applicability in Explainable AI tasks and other applications such as robust estimation and detecting adversarial attacks. While CMPE is known to be harder than MPE, we propose two approaches for efficiently computing upper bounds for CMPE and evaluate their performance on various CMPE tasks.
