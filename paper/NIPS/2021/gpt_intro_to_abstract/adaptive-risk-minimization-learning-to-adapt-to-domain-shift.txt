The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the problem of distribution shift in empirical risk minimization and the limitations of standard ERM methods in handling this issue. The authors propose the framework of adaptive risk minimization (ARM) to address domain shift by leveraging unlabeled adaptation at test time. They introduce a set of methods that meta-learn a model adaptable to different domains and demonstrate the effectiveness of ARM through experiments on image classification problems. The paper also presents new testbeds and evaluates on WILDS suite of distribution shift problems. The results show that ARM methods outperform prior state-of-the-art methods in terms of test accuracy.
