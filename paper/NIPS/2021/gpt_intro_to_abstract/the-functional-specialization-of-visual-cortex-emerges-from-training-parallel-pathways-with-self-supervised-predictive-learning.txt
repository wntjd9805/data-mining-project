This paper explores the use of deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) to model the specialized pathways in the mammalian visual cortex: the ventral and dorsal pathways. While ANNs have been successful at matching the representations of the ventral pathway, very few studies have examined their ability to capture the dorsal pathway. The authors investigate whether a self-supervised predictive loss function can induce representations that match the ventral and dorsal hierarchies. Using publicly available data from the Allen Brain Observatory, they train a network with two parallel pathways and find that the predictive loss function induces distinct representations that map onto the ventral/dorsal division. This suggests that self-supervised predictive loss functions hold promise for explaining the functional properties of the mammalian visual cortex.
