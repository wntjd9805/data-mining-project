Dynamical systems are prevalent in the natural sciences, and inferring parameters of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) using observational data is an active research area. In complex systems, it is often challenging to describe all individual processes and their interactions. Latent force models (LFMs), which offer a simplified mechanistic representation of the system, have been utilized to capture essential dynamics. However, shallow LFMs struggle to model non-stationarities in nonlinear systems, unlike deep models such as deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) that have hierarchical structures and greater representational power. In this paper, we propose a DGP constructed from physics-informed random Fourier features to model nonlinear dynamics. Our approach integrates a physics-informed prior into the DGP by utilizing a kernel based on an ODE. We demonstrate through experiments that our modeling framework effectively captures highly nonlinear dynamics in both toy examples and real-world data while also being applicable to general regression problems.
