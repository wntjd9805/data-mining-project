Generating realistic and diverse synthetic 3D content is a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. With the increasing demand for automated tools in creating 3D artificial environments for applications like video games and AR/VR, as well as general content creation, there is a need for efficient and effective solutions. This paper introduces ATISS, an autoregressive transformer architecture, to tackle the scene synthesis problem by generating meaningful furniture arrangements in a permutation-invariant fashion. Unlike existing approaches, ATISS treats scene synthesis as an unordered set generation task, making it simpler to implement and train while achieving higher efficiency and improved realism in generated object arrangements. The proposed model can be applied to automatic layout synthesis as well as various interactive scenarios, such as user-provided object placement and room completion.
