This paper addresses the problem of pricing in a dynamic pricing environment where a firm needs to adjust prices frequently to maximize revenue. Existing works have primarily focused on pricing a single product, which may not be effective when dealing with a large number of new products. Therefore, this study considers a feature-based dynamic pricing problem, where the customer's valuation of a product is modeled as a linear function of a feature vector. The goal is to find an acceptable and profitable price based on observations of a single product and historical selling records of other products. The paper presents a formulation of the problem and discusses the online setting in which it is studied.
