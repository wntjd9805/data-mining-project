Online convex optimization (OCO) is a widely studied framework for sequential decision making problems. Existing approaches in OCO allow for freely switching actions during the learning process, which may not be suitable for scenarios where action switching incurs additional costs. To address this problem, recent advancements introduced the switching-constrained problem, where a hard constraint is imposed on the number of action shifts. However, these approaches treat all action changes equally, despite practical applications showing that the price paid for different amounts of action changes varies. In this paper, we propose a novel OCO setting, called OCO with continuous switching constraint (OCO-CSC), where actions are chosen under a hard constraint on the overall 2-norm switching cost. We show that OCO-CSC allows for better control over the overall switching cost compared to binary constraints. We provide an upper bound on regret for OCO-CSC and establish a lower bound, demonstrating a phase transition phenomenon between large and small switching budgets. Finally, we propose a variant of online gradient descent for strongly convex functions to achieve regret bounds in different switching budget regimes.
