This paper explores the concept of sensory substitution, which refers to the brain's ability to use one sensory modality to replace another. While humans have demonstrated the ability to adapt to sensory substitutions, the process typically requires months of training. The goal of this research is to develop artificial systems that can rapidly adapt to sensory substitutions without the need for extensive retraining. The authors investigate agents that are explicitly designed to handle sudden random reordering of sensory inputs while performing tasks. They propose a system that utilizes self-organizing neural networks and an attention mechanism to process sensory inputs in any random order. The experiments demonstrate that the system can learn coherent policies and perform tasks in multiple reinforcement learning environments. The permutation invariant system shows robustness, generalization, and the ability to utilize additional information for better performance. The authors also propose a behavioral cloning scheme to convert existing policies into permutation invariant policies with desirable properties.
