The Hawkes process is widely used in the machine learning community for analyzing temporal events in various fields. The development of the minorization-maximization (MM) algorithm and Granger causal analysis has been important in advancing the understanding and application of Hawkes processes. However, there has been limited attention given to the issue of sparse solutions in Granger causal analysis. In this paper, we propose a cardinality-regularized MM framework for the Hawkes process, providing a mathematically well-defined solution for sparse causal learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in instance-wise causal diagnosis and highlight the importance of achieving sparsity in the learned causal structure. This work represents the first application of a (cid:96)0-regularized MM learning framework for simultaneous instance- and type-level causal analysis in the Hawkes process.
