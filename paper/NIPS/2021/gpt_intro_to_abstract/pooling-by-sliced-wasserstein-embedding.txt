This paper introduces a novel permutation-invariant pooling mechanism called Pooling by Sliced-Wasserstein Embedding (PSWE) for embedding sets of various sizes into a fixed-size representation. The proposed method provides an exact Euclidean embedding for the sliced-Wasserstein distance. The authors compare their approach with basic pooling mechanisms and other recently-proposed pooling methods, demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness in various learning tasks such as point cloud classification, graph classification, and image recognition. The numerical insights highlight that more complex permutation-equivariant backbones benefit from sophisticated pooling mechanisms, including PSWE, while basic pooling mechanisms perform competitively.
