Machine learning (ML) methods have gained popularity in quantum chemistry for their ability to bypass costly ab initio calculations. These methods have been used in various applications such as constructing potential energy surfaces, predicting electron densities and density functionals, and modeling physical observables across chemical space. However, training such models on reference data for specific quantum chemical properties and retraining them for other properties is a cumbersome process. To address this issue, this paper proposes SE(3)-equivariant operations for deep learning architectures for geometric point cloud data, which capture the effects of translations and rotations without explicitly learning them. The authors introduce PhiSNet, a novel deep learning architecture that accurately predicts wavefunctions and electronic densities, outperforming non-equivariant models. This advancement enables the prediction of properties like energies and forces directly from the wavefunction, leading to the development of novel machine-learned semi-empirical methods and the acceleration of conventional ab initio methods. The paper also discusses the potential applications of the proposed deep learning architecture in fields beyond physics, such as computer vision or graphics, where accurate analysis of high-dimensional point clouds is essential. The contributions of this research include the description of SE(3)-equivariant operations and building blocks for constructing DL architectures, the development of PhiSNet for predicting wavefunctions and electronic densities, its application in molecule prediction, transfer learning for higher level of theory predictions, and the use of predicted wavefunctions as initial guesses in quantum chemistry methods.
