Reasoning about discrete objects in an environment is crucial for agents to perceive and interact with their surroundings. However, manually labeling every possible object category is impractical, and there is a need to predict how collections of objects behave. Previous works have explored unsupervised segmentation and object-centric generation, often using variational autoencoders (VAEs). While some models use spatial transformer networks (STNs) or pixel-wise instance segmentation masks, these approaches have limitations in terms of scalability and the imposition of unnatural ordering on objects. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called GENESIS-V2, which leverages an instance colouring stick-breaking process (IC-SBP) for unsupervised segmentation and generation. Our model outperforms recent baselines on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness for object-centric understanding. Code and pre-trained models are available for further exploration.
