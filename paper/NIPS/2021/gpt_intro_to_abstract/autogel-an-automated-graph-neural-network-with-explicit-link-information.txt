Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various graph tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification. However, existing GNNs are limited in their ability to handle different graph tasks and diverse graph datasets. To address this issue, AutoGNNs have been proposed to automatically design suitable GNN architectures for specific datasets. However, current AutoGNNs mainly focus on node and graph classification tasks and do not consider edge embeddings or link information. In this paper, we propose AutoGEL, a novel AutoGNN framework with Explicit Link information, to handle the link prediction task and enhance the performance of AutoGNNs on other graph tasks. AutoGEL explicitly models the link information by learning edge embeddings within the message passing framework and introduces novel design dimensions into the GNN search space. Experimental results show that AutoGEL outperforms manual models in the link prediction task and achieves competitive performance in node and graph classification tasks.
