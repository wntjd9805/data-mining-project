The paper introduces the concept of multimodal regression, which involves leveraging information from multiple modalities to improve learning performance in machine learning. Traditional models assume stable quality for each modality, limiting their reliability and interpretability. Existing models also produce over-confident predictions, which are not suitable for safety-critical applications. To address these issues, the paper proposes a novel algorithm that models uncertainty in a trustworthy manner. The algorithm integrates multiple modalities using a Mixture of Normal-inverse Gamma distributions (MoNIG), effectively promoting regression accuracy and trustworthiness. Experimental results on synthetic and real-application data validate the effectiveness, robustness, and reliability of the proposed model in various multimodal regression tasks.
