The first order derivative of the log data density function, known as score, has various applications in image generation, image denoising, and audio synthesis. Denoising score matching (DSM) provides an efficient method to estimate the score of the data density and has been extensively used in training generative models and denoising. However, existing methods mainly focus on estimating the first order score and are computationally expensive for high dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to directly model and estimate high order scores of a data density from samples. We draw inspiration from Tweedie's formula and show that DSM can be derived from it with the knowledge of least squares regression. Additionally, we introduce variance reduction techniques to improve the optimization of high order score estimation objectives. Our approach achieves more accurate second order score estimation compared to automatic differentiation and is computationally efficient for high dimensional data. We also demonstrate the potential and applications of our method in denoising and improving mixing speed for sampling synthetic data and natural images.
