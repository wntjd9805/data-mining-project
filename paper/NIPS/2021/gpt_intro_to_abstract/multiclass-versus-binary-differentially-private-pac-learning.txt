Machine learning and data analytics are increasingly being used on sensitive information, raising concerns about privacy. Differential privacy offers a rigorous approach to enable these analyses while ensuring individual privacy. While there is a good understanding of private binary classification, less is known about private multiclass learning. This paper explores the relationship between multiclass and binary learning and investigates the transferability of results from the binary setting to the multiclass setting. The authors propose a reduction from multiclass learning to a sequence of binary classification problems and prove that if all binary classes are privately learnable, then the multiclass class is also privately learnable. They also show that this reduction enables improved sample complexity for private multiclass learning. The paper introduces the concept of Littlestone dimensions, which characterizes online and private learnability, and provides upper and lower bounds for private multiclass learning based on these dimensions. The authors demonstrate that their results can be used to automatically improve multiclass learning based on advancements in binary learning. The techniques used in this study may have broader applications in the study of online and multiclass learning. The work is motivated by privacy concerns and aims to clarify the feasibility of private learning techniques.
