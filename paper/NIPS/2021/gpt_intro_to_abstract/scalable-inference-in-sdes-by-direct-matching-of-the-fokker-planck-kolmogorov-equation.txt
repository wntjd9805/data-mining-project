Differential equations are widely used in modeling change over time, and ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are commonly used in deterministic systems. However, there is growing interest in learning ODE dynamics using machine learning techniques, which has led to the exploration of black-box learning of continuous-time dynamics. Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have gained attention in machine learning due to their robustness and usefulness in uncertainty quantification. Unlike ODEs, SDEs have stochastic elements, resulting in a probability distribution solution. Inference in SDEs is typically done through sampling methods, but this approach has limitations. This paper aims to broaden the exploration of SDE solutions beyond traditional sampling approaches by introducing a Gaussian approximation in latent space SDEs. The contributions of this paper include a workflow connecting random ODE models with SDEs driven by a Gaussian process prior and the derivation of approximations to the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation in an assumed Gaussian form, enabling fast inference and applicability to scarce-data applications.
