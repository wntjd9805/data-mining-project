The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a challenging optimization problem with many practical applications. Exact methods for solving TSP are computationally expensive and impractical for large-scale problems, so heuristic solvers that search for near-optimal solutions are often used. Traditional heuristic methods are based on human-interpretable rules, but recent advancements in deep learning have allowed for the training of powerful neural networks to solve TSP. However, these deep learning models still perform worse than traditional heuristics and are limited to small problem sizes. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based method called NeuroLKH that combines a Sparse Graph Network with the efficient local search of the Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) algorithm. NeuroLKH improves the quality of edge candidates and saves time by learning node penalties inductively. Extensive experiments show that NeuroLKH outperforms baseline algorithms on a wide range of problem sizes and can be generalized to other routing problems.
