Transfer learning has achieved notable success in various areas of machine learning, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV). In this paper, we explore the application of transfer learning to algorithmic reasoning on graphs. Specifically, we investigate how to transfer knowledge between similar graph algorithms when we only have access to the execution traces of some algorithms but not others. We propose using the intermediate steps of base algorithms as an inductive bias to enable systematic generalization in solving algorithmic tasks. We introduce new algorithms and extend the architecture of graph neural networks to achieve algorithmic alignment with more tasks. Additionally, we present a benchmark for transferring algorithmic reasoning knowledge on graphs and demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-task learning in improving systematic generalization.
