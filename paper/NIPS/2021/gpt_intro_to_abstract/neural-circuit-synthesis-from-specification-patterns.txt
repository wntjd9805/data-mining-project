This paper introduces a method to generate large amounts of training data for machine learning models in the field of hardware synthesis. The authors propose using hierarchical Transformers to train models on the circuit synthesis problem using the generated data. The models are able to solve a significant portion of problems from the annual synthesis competition and can handle both realizable and unrealizable specifications. The paper presents experimental results showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
