Robust optimization problems are common in various applications, but constructing provably robust solutions can be challenging. Heuristic approaches, such as adversarially robust deep learning, are often used to address these problems effectively in practice. In this paper, we focus on the problem of N-k security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF), which involves scheduling power generation to withstand k potential equipment failures. We frame this problem as a minimax attacker-defender game and optimize it using gradient-based techniques. Our contributions include a generic formulation for gradient-based optimization of minimax problems with implicitly-defined variables, a formulation and optimization approach for N-k SCOPF, and a demonstration of our method's efficacy on a realistic power system. Our method outperforms a baseline optimal power flow approach in terms of feasibility violations and computational efficiency.
