In recent years, marked temporal point processes (MTPPs) have been widely used in various applications such as information diffusion in social networks and epidemic forecasting. However, existing MTPP models often overlook the presence of exogenous events, which limits their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel event selection algorithm called TPP-SELECT, which filters exogenous events from a stream of unlabeled events while simultaneously training the model parameters. We formulate this as a joint optimization problem and show that it is NP-hard. We utilize the notions of approximate submodularity and design an approximation algorithm to solve the problem. We evaluate our algorithm on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in accurately selecting exogenous events and outperforming baselines in the presence of exogenous events. Our code is available online.
