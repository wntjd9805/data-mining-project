Image segmentation and edge detection are important perception problems in computer science. While segmentation subsumes edge detection, edge detection can serve as an auxiliary task to improve segmentation performance. Previous works have focused on perceptual similarity and deep learning techniques for these tasks separately. In this paper, we propose a framework for coupled edge and segmentation learning with the goals of producing high-quality results for both tasks and mutually improving their performance. We introduce a learnable recurrent message passing layer that uses semantic edges as gating signals to refine segmentation. Our framework simplifies normalization and dynamically encodes pixel affinities for improved dense prediction. We also demonstrate state-of-the-art results and improved robustness to natural corruptions. Multitasking segmentation and edge learning is desirable for various downstream applications and challenging scenarios where segmentation quality may be poor but edge quality is superior.
