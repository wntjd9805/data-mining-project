The need for high-quality education at scale is crucial, but providing feedback remains a challenge, specifically for interactive programs. Current coding education platforms struggle to grade interactive programs automatically, leading to a heavy reliance on human labor for feedback. This creates a significant time and resource constraint, especially considering the large number of students enrolled in coding courses. Additionally, providing feedback based solely on code text is a complex machine learning problem due to the statistical distribution and discontinuity of homework datasets. In this paper, we propose a collaborative algorithm that combines reinforcement learning with game-playing to understand and assess student work. Our solution achieves high accuracy and outperforms traditional grading methods using code text. We also provide a dataset and compatible environment to support further research in this area.
