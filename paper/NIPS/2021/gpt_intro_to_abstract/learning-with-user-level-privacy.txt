This paper introduces the concept of user-level differential privacy (DP) in the context of machine learning models. It addresses the limitations of current techniques that either degrade privacy guarantees with increased user participation or add excessive noise, affecting the performance of the model. The paper proposes algorithms and analyses for tasks such as mean estimation, empirical risk minimization, stochastic convex optimization, and learning hypothesis classes. It also provides practical recommendations on sample collection, suggesting that increasing the number of users is more beneficial than increasing the number of samples per user.
