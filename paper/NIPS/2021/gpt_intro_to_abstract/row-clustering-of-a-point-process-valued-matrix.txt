This paper addresses the challenge of identifying groups in large-scale, high-resolution, and irregularly scattered event time data. The authors focus on a dataset collected from Twitter, specifically analyzing posting times of 500 university official accounts. They introduce a mixture model of Multi-level Marked Point Processes (MM-MPP) to characterize the complex posting patterns and propose a semiparametric Expectation-Solution algorithm for learning the underlying cluster structure. The proposed algorithm utilizes MCMC samples and GPU acceleration for efficient computation. The study aims to contribute to the understanding of activity patterns on social media platforms and enable applications such as ad recommendations and disease progression prediction.
