Causal discovery from observational data has become an important area of study due to the challenges and limitations of conducting interventions or randomized experiments. This paper focuses on different methods for causal discovery, including constraint-based methods, greedy search algorithms, and optimization-based approaches. The authors introduce their own strategies to improve the scalability and reliability of exact search methods in the linear Gaussian setting. These strategies include a super-structure estimation method based on the support of the inverse covariance matrix and a local search strategy called Local A*. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through extensive experiments.
