Neural networks (NNs) and Gaussian processes (GPs) are established frameworks for solving regression or classification problems. While NNs are efficient with large datasets, GPs provide robust solutions with uncertainty estimates in low-data regimes. The Deep Gaussian process (DGP) was introduced as a model that combines the strengths of both approaches. However, DGPs are challenging to train compared to NNs. In this work, we aim to unify DGP and NN training by developing a DGP that mimics the forward pass of a typical NN. This link offers practical advantages for both models, improving the training of DGPs and enhancing NNs with better uncertainty estimates.
