This paper addresses two significant challenges in causal discovery. Firstly, it focuses on the problem of identifying intervened nodes in structure learning from interventional datasets, without assuming knowledge of the intervention target set. Secondly, it considers the task of learning structural changes between two related networks and their associated directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), as well as the localization of intervention targets. The paper introduces a soft intervention setting, in which the conditional distributions of target variables are changed without assumptions on causal effects, and proposes an algorithm based on estimating the sparse difference between precision matrices associated with two linear structural equation models (SEMs). The algorithm improves computational complexity and can be used to refine the Markov equivalence class (MEC) of DAGs obtained from observational data to the interventional-MEC. The paper provides theoretical guarantees and experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
