This paper introduces the concept of vector graphics as an alternative image format for image recognition tasks. Traditional raster graphics suffer from aliasing issues when scaled, making them less suitable for precise applications like engineering design. Vector graphics, on the other hand, represent images using parametric equations and primitives, allowing for infinite scalability and higher level structural information. However, vector graphics have been largely unexplored in computer vision literature. To address this gap, the paper proposes YOLaT (You Only Look at the Text), a model that directly processes the textual definition of vector graphics without rasterization. YOLaT preserves more complete information, generates precise object bounding boxes, and achieves superior performance compared to raster graphics-based methods. The paper concludes with evaluations on floorplans and diagrams datasets, demonstrating the advantages of YOLaT in terms of efficiency and accuracy.
