We study smooth (strongly-)convex-(strongly-)concave SPPs over a network of M agents and address the design of distributed algorithms for solving these problems. We consider two types of computational architectures: master/workers networks and mesh networks. Our analysis focuses on SPPs with related local functions, where the functions differ only by a finite quantity. While SPPs have been extensively studied in the centralized and mesh network settings, there is a lack of analysis and algorithms that exploit function similarity to improve communication efficiency. We provide positive results and propose algorithms that achieve lower complexity bounds for these SPPs. Our algorithms outperform existing methods and are matched by lower bounds. Preliminary numerical results on distributed robust logistic regression support our findings.
