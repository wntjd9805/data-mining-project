In this paper, we address the challenges faced by the sensorimotor control system, which include noisy sensory stimuli and delays in sensory feedback. We propose an optimal feedback control (OFC) approach that utilizes an internal model of system dynamics and employs Kalman filtering to integrate predictions with sensory stimuli. Previous neural implementations of OFC have had limitations such as ignoring delayed feedback, focusing only on Kalman filtering without control, requiring knowledge of noise covariances, and lacking biological plausibility. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Bio-OFC, a biologically plausible neural network that combines adaptive model-based state discovery with model-free control. Our network does not require knowledge of noise covariances or system dynamics, considers delayed sensory feedback, and operates online with local learning rules. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Bio-OFC through simulations in various tasks. Our contributions include the development of Bio-OFC as a closed-loop control agent and addressing the weight transport problem.
