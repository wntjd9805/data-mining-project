We propose a framework for bandit quickest change detection (BQCD), where we aim to detect abrupt statistical changes in a multi-dimensional online data stream by adaptively choosing actions based on past observations. Our objective is to detect a change with minimum delay. We provide examples of scenarios where BQCD is applicable, such as surveillance systems and intrusion detection. In this paper, we derive a fundamental characterization for the delay performance of BQCD and establish a tradeoff between delay and false alarms. We prove a lower bound on the expected detection delay and introduce a (cid:15)-Greedy Change Detector ((cid:15)-GCD) algorithm that utilizes forced exploration to identify informative actions and minimize detection delay. We conduct experiments on synthetic and real datasets to showcase the effectiveness of (cid:15)-GCD in adaptive sensing.
