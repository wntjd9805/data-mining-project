In this paper, we propose a method to soften the non-smooth rendering operations in differentiable rendering using randomized smoothing techniques. We formulate the non-smooth operations as optimization problems and introduce random perturbations to make them naturally differentiable. We also introduce a control variate method to reduce variance in estimating gradients and an adaptive scheme to adjust smoothing parameters. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach leads to more accurate solutions compared to existing alternatives.
