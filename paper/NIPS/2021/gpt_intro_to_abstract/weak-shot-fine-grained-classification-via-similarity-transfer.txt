Deep learning has greatly improved computer vision tasks, particularly in fine-grained classification. However, the limited availability of well-labeled training images has critically hindered the progress of fine-grained classification. This paper introduces weak-shot learning, a novel approach that aims to learn novel fine-grained categories by utilizing web data with the support of a clean set of base categories. The proposed framework leverages pairwise semantic similarity between base and novel categories to denoise the web training data and improve classification performance. The authors conduct experiments on multiple datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
