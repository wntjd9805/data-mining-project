In this paper, we focus on the limitations of Simple Graph Convolution (SGC) and propose a new approach called Decoupled Graph Convolution (DGC) to address these issues. SGC, although computationally efficient, suffers from the "over-smoothing" phenomenon where node features become indistinguishable after too many feature propagation steps. Through a dissection of the diffusion process of linear GCNs, we identify that the fixed step size in SGC results in a large numerical error. To overcome this, DGC decouples the terminal time and propagation steps, allowing for a flexible choice of terminal time and more propagation steps. Experimental results show that DGC significantly improves over SGC and achieves state-of-the-art results comparable to many non-linear GCNs, making it a promising baseline for future research.
