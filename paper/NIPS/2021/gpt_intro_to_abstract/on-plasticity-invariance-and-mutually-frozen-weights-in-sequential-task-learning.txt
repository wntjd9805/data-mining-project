In this paper, we explore the concept of lifelong learning and the challenges it presents in terms of adapting to new problem settings while retaining previous knowledge. We discuss the stability-plasticity dilemma and the importance of understanding when a sequence of tasks benefits or hinders further learning. The existing literature on pre-training and curriculum learning provides some insights into the desired characteristics of sequential learning, showing that following a sequence of learning tasks can lead to better results than starting from scratch. However, we also highlight the negative effects of pre-training on certain tasks. To address these issues, we introduce the concept of mutually frozen weights and examine their impact on retraining performance. We show that frozen weights, which are different from regular sparse weights, can lead to a decrease in performance when retraining on a new task. Based on our analysis, we propose an intervention that "resets" frozen weights and improves retraining performance on multiple tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on FashionMNIST image classification.
