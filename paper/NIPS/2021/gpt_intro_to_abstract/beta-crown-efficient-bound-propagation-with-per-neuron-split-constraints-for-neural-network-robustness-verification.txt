This paper addresses the problem of formally verifying the behaviors of neural networks under potentially malicious inputs. The goal is to prove desired relationships between inputs and outputs, such as safety or robustness guarantees. The paper introduces a fast bound propagation-based incomplete verifier called α-CROWN, which can handle neuron split constraints and achieve tight bounds for verification. By combining α-CROWN with branch and bound (BaB) methods and implementing it with an automatic differentiation framework on GPUs, the paper demonstrates significant improvements in verification time compared to traditional linear programming (LP) based verifiers. The proposed approach, α-CROWN BaB, outperforms state-of-the-art GPU-based verifiers and has been validated through winning a competition and achieving high verified accuracy on benchmarking models. Additionally, by terminating the verification early, α-CROWN BaB can function as an accurate incomplete verifier by returning sound lower bounds on explored subdomains. The proposed method surpasses other incomplete verifiers in terms of verified accuracy while significantly reducing verification time.
