Instance-level 3D scene understanding from a single image is a fundamental computer vision task with applications in robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous driving. This paper aims to design a framework that can infer 3D properties such as 3D bounding box and shape of object instances from a 2D image. While previous methods have focused on either 3D box prediction or 3D shape prediction, this work considers both tasks for comprehensive 3D scene understanding. The complexity of real-world scenarios and the diversity of object categories pose challenges in reconstructing the scene context accurately. The authors propose a voxel-based approach that assigns 3D features to voxels in a grid representation, enabling accurate 3D detection and reconstruction. The paper introduces a novel CenterNet-3D detector for improved 3D center accuracy and a multi-level shape representation for fine-level reconstruction. Experimental results showcase the superiority of the proposed method in multiple object 3D reconstruction and detection, as well as 3D shape representation.
