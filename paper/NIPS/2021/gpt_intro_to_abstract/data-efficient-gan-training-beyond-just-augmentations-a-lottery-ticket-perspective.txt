The quantity, diversity, and high quality of natural images have greatly contributed to the success of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, collecting large-scale datasets in specific domains can be challenging due to various constraints. This limits the application of GANs in areas such as medical images, scientific experiments, and rare species. Training GANs with limited data often leads to overfitting and performance degradation. This paper proposes a novel approach that decomposes GAN training in limited data regimes into two sub-problems: finding independent trainable subnetworks and training these subnetworks efficiently with aggressive augmentations. The proposed method leverages the concept of lottery tickets, showing that highly sparse subnetworks can be identified even in data-scarce scenarios. The identified subnetworks serve as a structural prior for data-efficient training, and the combination of new feature-level and existing data-level augmentations further enhances performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in generating high-quality images with limited training data.
