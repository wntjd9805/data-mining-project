This paper addresses the challenge of evaluating the generalization error of a learning algorithm in statistical learning theory. While various approaches have been developed, upper bounds on generalization error may not fully capture the generalization ability of a learning algorithm. Existing bounds fail to capture the interplay between the hypothesis class, learning algorithm, and the underlying data-generating distribution. In this paper, the authors derive an exact characterization of the generalization error for the Gibbs algorithm and discuss its properties and applications in different scenarios. The contributions of this paper include tightening existing error bounds, characterizing the asymptotic behavior of the generalization error, and exploring the generalization error of the Gibbs algorithm with data-dependent regularizers. The motivations for studying the Gibbs algorithm are also discussed.
