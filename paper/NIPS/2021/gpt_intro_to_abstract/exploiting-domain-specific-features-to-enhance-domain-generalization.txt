of the paper, which tackles the problem of generating abstracts for computer science papers using a novel approach. Abstracts are concise summaries of the main findings or contributions of a research paper, enabling readers to quickly grasp the essence of the study without reading the entire paper. However, manually writing abstracts can be time-consuming and requires expert knowledge. This paper presents a machine learning-based solution that automatically generates abstracts by leveraging a large corpus of existing abstracts and their corresponding full-text papers. The proposed approach employs a sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism, trained on a dataset comprising numerous computer science papers. The evaluation results demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements in terms of both fluency and informativeness when compared to existing methods. This research contributes to the field of natural language processing and provides a valuable tool for researchers and readers in the computer science domain.
