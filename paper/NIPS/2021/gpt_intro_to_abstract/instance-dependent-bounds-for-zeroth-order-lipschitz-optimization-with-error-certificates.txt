Optimizing black-box functions with minimal evaluations is a common problem in scientific and industrial fields. In some safety-critical applications, it is essential to certify the accuracy of the optimization method's output. This paper focuses on studying the problem of finding and certifying an Îµ-approximate maximizer of a Lipschitz function. The authors define the setting and assumptions, and introduce the concept of certified algorithms that provide both a recommendation and an error certificate. The main contribution of the paper is a characterization of the optimal sample complexity of certified algorithms, providing upper and lower bounds on the number of evaluations required to achieve a given accuracy. The paper also presents a computationally tractable algorithm that satisfies the lower bound. The authors outline the structure of the paper and highlight their contributions in more detail.
