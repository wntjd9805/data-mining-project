The intersection between deep learning and molecular science has garnered significant attention from researchers in recent years. While progress has been made in various applications, such as molecular property prediction and drug discovery, the first crucial step in these processes is learning representations for molecules. Previous methods have primarily focused on using off-the-shelf network architectures that neglect the physical and chemical essence of molecules. However, there is a growing trend in incorporating 3D conformations of molecules into representations. In this paper, we propose a novel neural architecture called PhysChem that captures and fuses both physical and chemical information of molecules. PhysChem consists of two specialist networks, PhysNet and ChemNet, which understand molecules from a physical and chemical perspective, respectively. PhysNet learns dominant conformations of molecules through simulating molecular dynamics, while ChemNet captures chemical characteristics using a message-passing framework. The two networks also collaborate by sharing expertise. Compared to existing methods, PhysChem offers a more comprehensive and interpretable architecture that incorporates physical and chemical understandings of molecules. Additionally, PhysChem does not require labeled conformations of test molecules, enhancing its applicability in scenarios where such labels are unavailable. Experimental results on benchmark datasets and SARS-CoV-2 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PhysChem.
