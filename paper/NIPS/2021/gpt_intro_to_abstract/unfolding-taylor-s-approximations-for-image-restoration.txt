Image restoration is a crucial task in computer vision, aimed at recovering a clear image from a degraded observation while maintaining fine-grained details and high-level contextualized information. Traditional methods based on optimization techniques and deep learning have been applied, but they face limitations in terms of solution space regularization and optimization difficulties. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in image restoration, but existing CNN-based methods lack rationality and fail to balance spatial details and contextual information effectively. Additionally, these methods lack interpretability and hinder further improvement. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on unfolding Taylor's Formula, which connects the main and derivative parts of Taylor's Approximation to the two competing goals of image restoration. Our approach breaks down the restoration process into two steps, allowing for the efficient learning of high-level contextualized information and the recovery of local spatial details. Furthermore, our framework can be easily integrated with existing methods to achieve improved performance. Extensive experiments on image deraining and deblurring tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our proposed framework. The contributions of this paper include introducing a new perspective on image restoration inspired by Taylor's Approximations, breaking down the restoration process into manageable steps, and proposing an orthogonal framework that can be integrated with existing CNN-based methods for further improvement.
