Graph neural networks (GNNs) and Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) are widely used methods for graph learning tasks. However, the expressive power of MPNNs is limited compared to the one-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm. To overcome this limitation, higher-order MPNNs have been proposed, but they suffer from high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a more practical approach by augmenting vertex labels with local graph structural information, such as homomorphism counts of small graph patterns. We characterize the expressive power of these augmented MPNNs and compare them to higher-order MPNNs. We also address the problem of pattern selection and provide experimental evidence that our approach has a positive effect on various GNN architectures and graph learning tasks. Overall, our results show that augmented MPNNs can increase the expressive power of MPNNs while maintaining low computational cost.
