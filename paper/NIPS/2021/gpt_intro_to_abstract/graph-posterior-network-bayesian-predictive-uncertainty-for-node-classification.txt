Accurate uncertainty estimation is crucial for ensuring the reliability of machine learning models in safety-critical domains. This paper focuses on uncertainty estimation in the context of interdependent node inputs, which is more complex and under-explored compared to i.i.d. inputs. The authors propose Graph Posterior Network (GPN) as a method for uncertainty estimation in node classification tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive evaluations. The contributions of this work include the derivation of axioms for non-independent inputs, the development of GPN, and the establishment of an evaluation setup that assesses uncertainty estimation quality in the presence of attribute and structure anomalies. The experiments show that GPN outperforms other baselines in terms of uncertainty evaluation.
