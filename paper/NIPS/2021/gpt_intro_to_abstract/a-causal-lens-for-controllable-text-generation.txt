This paper introduces the concept of controllable text generation, which aims to produce fluent language with control over various attributes such as sentiment, topic, and politeness. The paper highlights the importance of this problem in NLP applications and focuses on two settings of control: attribute-conditional generation and text attribute transfer. The authors propose a principled causal framework for text generation that unifies these two tasks and addresses the issue of spurious correlations in conditional models. They develop a structural causal model (SCM) that describes the causal relationships between variables and enables unbiased text outputs. Additionally, the paper considers a scenario where confounding information is only available for a small subset of samples and demonstrates the effectiveness of the causal approach in improving control accuracy and reducing bias.
