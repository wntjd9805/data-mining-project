This paper addresses the problem of identifying causal relationships between variables in observational data, which is a fundamental problem in machine learning. The authors introduce a new method called interventional sum-product networks (iSPNs) that combines the expressivity of neural networks and the tractability of sum-product networks to capture interventional distributions. They demonstrate the effectiveness of iSPNs through extensive experiments and show that iSPNs can approximate any interventional distribution permitted by the underlying causal model. The paper also provides a review of related work, presents a curated causal model focused on personal health, and includes code availability for reproducibility.
