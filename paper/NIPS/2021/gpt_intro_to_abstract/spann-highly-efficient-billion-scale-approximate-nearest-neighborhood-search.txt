This paper introduces SPANN, a simple and efficient memory-disk hybrid vector indexing and search system for large-scale datasets. Traditional approaches for approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) focus on in-memory solutions, which become costly and impractical for super large-scale scenarios like web search. The proposed SPANN system leverages the inverted index methodology and stores centroid points in memory while putting large posting lists on the disk. This approach significantly reduces disk accesses and improves the quality of posting lists, resulting in low latency, high recall, and reduced memory cost. Experimental results show that SPANN outperforms existing disk-based ANNS algorithms and has been successfully deployed in Microsoft Bing for billion-scale vector search.
