In this paper, we propose the use of deep self-dissimilarity (DSD) image descriptors to capture the dissimilarity between internal feature distributions at different image scales. We observe that deep features tend to vary significantly for different scales of the same image, which can serve as a powerful image fingerprint. Instead of aggregating deep feature descriptors from multiple scales, we introduce the DSD descriptor, which captures the differences between feature distributions at different scales. We demonstrate that the DSD descriptor can be used as a full-reference and no-reference image quality metric, as well as a loss function for image restoration. Our metrics are highly correlated with human perception and generate high-quality reconstructions without the need for adversarial training.
