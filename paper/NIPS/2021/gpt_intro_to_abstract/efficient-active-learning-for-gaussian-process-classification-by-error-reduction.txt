Active learning is a method that optimally selects instances for labeling in order to improve label efficiency in machine learning models. There are two main scenarios for active learning: query synthesis, where labels are requested for instances generated from a continuous feature space, and pool-based sampling, which selects instances from a finite set. Query synthesis is more challenging due to the infinite search space and higher label uncertainty. Recent research has shown potential for query synthesis with deep generative models. However, in many science and engineering applications, acquiring labels for instances is resource-demanding, making active learning with deep models impractical. This paper focuses on the problem of identifying phase diagrams, where the phase transition response surface can be complex. Active learning strategies using Gaussian Process Classification (GPC) have been proposed, but the computational cost of training GPC models has been a hurdle. To address this, the paper presents computationally efficient algorithms for EER-based active learning with GPC, enabling efficient query synthesis and pool-based active learning. The algorithms are shown to improve data efficiency compared to existing methods in both synthetic and real-world datasets.
