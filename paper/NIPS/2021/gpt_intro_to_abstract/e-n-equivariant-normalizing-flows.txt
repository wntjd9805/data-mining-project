Leveraging data structure has been a fundamental principle in building neural networks, with convolutional layers achieving translation equivariance for images. Similarly, incorporating the symmetries of 3D coordinate data has shown significant performance improvements in discriminatory machine learning tasks. However, for generative tasks like molecular structure sampling, the development of efficient rotation equivariant approaches is still in its early stages. In this paper, we introduce E(n) Equivariant Normalizing Flows (E-NFs), a generative model for E(n) equivariant data such as 3D molecules. We propose a continuous-time flow model with the first-order derivative modeled by an EGNN, ensuring stability. By lifting discrete features to a continuous space and employing recent advancements in the dequantization literature, we demonstrate superior performance compared to non-equivariant variants and previous equivariant generative methods. We apply our technique to molecule generation, achieving the generation of realistic molecules in the QM9 dataset.
