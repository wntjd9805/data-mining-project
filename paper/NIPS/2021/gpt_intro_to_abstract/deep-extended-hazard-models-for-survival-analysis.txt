Survival data analysis is a crucial tool in various fields, such as biomedical science and reliability engineering, for studying the time until specific events occur. However, many occurrence times are not recorded due to censoring of the data. Standard regression approaches are not applicable to censored data, and a naive approach that removes censored individuals would lead to bias. Statistical methodologies like the Kaplan-Meier estimator and the random survival forest model have been developed to address these challenges. Deep learning has also been explored in survival analysis, but there is a lack of mathematical understanding of its success. In this paper, we propose the Deep Extended Hazard (DeepEH) model, which combines the Cox proportional hazards and accelerated failure time models. We provide theoretical support for the DeepEH model and show that neural networks can identify low-dimensional structure in the data, overcoming the curse of dimensionality.
