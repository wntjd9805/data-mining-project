In this paper, we introduce a generalized variational inference (VI) framework for continuous-time hybrid models that combines switching stochastic differential equations (SSDEs) with Markov jump processes (MJPs). We highlight the limitations of discrete-time models and the importance of continuous-time descriptions in real-world physical and biological systems. We discuss the challenges of solving multi-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) in diffusion processes and propose Monte Carlo and variational inference (VI) methods as possible solutions. We build upon previous works on diffusion processes and MJPs and present a VI framework that recovers existing approximations. We specifically focus on meta-stable systems that exhibit distinct regimes over extended periods of time, which have significance in computational structural biology.
