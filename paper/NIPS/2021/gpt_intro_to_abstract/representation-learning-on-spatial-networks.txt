Spatial networks, which combine spatial and network data, are crucial in various domains, but their representation learning is challenging due to the interactions between network and spatial topology. While progress has been made in deep representation learning for spatial data and network data individually, representation learning for spatial networks is largely unexplored. Existing methods struggle to distinguish patterns that require joint consideration of spatial and graph information, maintain invariance to node permutation and translation transformations, and handle large graph sizes efficiently. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a spatial graph message passing neural network (SGMP) that aggregates spatial and graph information, represents node spatial information with geometric invariant features, and introduces an accelerating algorithm. The proposed method is evaluated on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning representations for spatial networks.
