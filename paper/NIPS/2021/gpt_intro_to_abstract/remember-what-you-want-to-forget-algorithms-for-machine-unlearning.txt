Many organizations and companies use user data to train machine learning models for various applications. Laws have been introduced worldwide to mandate user data deletion upon request to prevent misuse. However, there is ambiguity regarding whether deletion should only apply to user data or also extend to machine learning systems trained on this data. Retraining models after every deletion request is impractical due to the time and resources required. This paper introduces the concept of machine unlearning, which aims to remove specific data points from a model without the need for complete retraining. The authors propose a relaxed notion of deletion and explore efficient algorithms for data deletion from machine learning models. They also investigate the generalization properties of unlearning algorithms and address resource constraints such as storage and computation. Furthermore, they demonstrate a separation between differential privacy and machine unlearning and provide efficient unlearning algorithms for both strongly convex and convex loss functions.
