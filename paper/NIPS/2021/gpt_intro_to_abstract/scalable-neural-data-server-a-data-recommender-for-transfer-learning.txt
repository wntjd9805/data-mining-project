Machine learning applications have become prevalent in various fields, and the use of larger training datasets has led to improved performance. However, annotating these datasets is time-consuming and costly. Transfer learning has emerged as an effective approach to reduce labeling requirements by utilizing existing datasets. However, finding the right dataset for transfer learning is challenging. This paper proposes a scalable data recommendation system called Scalable Neural Data Server (SNDS) that indexes and recommends relevant transfer learning data to consumers based on their target tasks. SNDS utilizes intermediary datasets and expert models to compute similarity between the consumer's data and the server's datasets, preserving data privacy. Experimental results show that SNDS generalizes well, improves performance on downstream tasks, and can operate in dissimilar domains.
