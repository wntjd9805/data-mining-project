When optimizing an expectation based objective that involves discrete variables, obtaining gradients with respect to the parameters of the distribution can be challenging. This paper focuses on the specific case of a high dimensional categorical variable and proposes a novel gradient estimator called Categorical-Antithetic-REINFORCE-Multi-Sample (CARMS). The CARMS estimator uses a copula to generate antithetic categorical samples and combines them to create an unbiased estimator for variance reduction. The approach achieves higher performance in terms of the evidence lower bound (ELBO) and log likelihood for conditional image completion compared to state-of-the-art methods.
