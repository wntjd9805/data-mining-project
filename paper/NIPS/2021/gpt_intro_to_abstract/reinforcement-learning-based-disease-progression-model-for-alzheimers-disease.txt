Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent and debilitating disease that requires models to understand its progression and enable early detection. In this paper, we propose a model that predicts an individual's future AD progression based on their baseline data. We combine differential equations (DEs) to capture the relationships between factors related to AD and use reinforcement learning (RL) to extract missing relationships. By optimizing a domain knowledge-based reward function, RL helps to describe the evolution of factors important for modeling AD progression. We address challenges such as identifying factors involved in each DE and proposing novel DEs relating cognition, brain region sizes, and brain activity. Our model shows promising results in predicting long-term cognition trajectories and provides valuable insights into AD progression. This framework can be applied to other neurological disorders and has the potential for clinical use in identifying individuals at risk of cognitive decline.
