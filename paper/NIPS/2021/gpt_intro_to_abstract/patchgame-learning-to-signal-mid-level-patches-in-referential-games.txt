Language plays an integral role in human communication and is essential for collaboration, information representation, and concept development. This similarity between natural and programming languages allows the study of language evolution to provide insights into intelligent machines capable of communication. In this paper, we aim to develop and understand an emergent language by exploring how neural network agents can communicate with each other. Previous supervised approaches lack the ability to capture the functional relationships between symbols, leading us to focus on emergent language research that demonstrates the development of communication protocols through agent cooperation. To achieve this, we adopt a referential game task where a speaker agent sends a message consisting of symbols to a listener agent. This game allows us to derive meaning from the language and its use. Furthermore, we propose the PatchGame, a referential game formulation where the speaker agent communicates using mid-level patches rather than the entire image. In this formulation, both the speaker and the listener agents undergo training using a large-scale image dataset and self-supervised learning techniques. We introduce patch-based and transformer-based architectures for the speaker and listener agents, respectively, and assess the success of PatchGame through qualitative and quantitative evaluations. The results demonstrate the ability of the speaker's PatchRank model to identify important patches in an image, the listener's vision model achieving high accuracy in image classification, and the analysis of learned symbols and hyperparameter impact.
