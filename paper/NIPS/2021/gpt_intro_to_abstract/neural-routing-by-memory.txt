Human memory is a vital aspect of human intelligence, consisting of short-term and long-term memory. Inspired by the neural mechanisms of episodic memories, this paper introduces the routing-by-memory mechanism to neural networks. This mechanism utilizes memory to guide networks in processing different features with different procedures, enhancing learning and performance. Referred to as Routing-by-Memory Networks (RMNs), this approach is applied to feature extraction in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By introducing parallel procedures and assigning similar features to specialized procedures, the RMN improves model capacity and performance without increasing computational cost. Additionally, a training strategy is proposed to initialize and update memory and procedures. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in accuracy on benchmark datasets for various CNN architectures. The contributions of this paper include the novel routing-by-memory mechanism, the plug-and-play nature of the approach in existing CNN architectures, and the improved performance on benchmark datasets.
