This paper investigates the conceptual relationship between plug-and-play priors (PnP)/regularization by denoising (RED) methods and compressed sensing using generative models (CSGM). While PnP/RED algorithms have computational advantages over CSGM, they lack theoretical recovery guarantees. By presenting the first recovery analysis of PnP/RED under the assumptions of CSGM, this paper characterizes the distance of PnP solutions to the true image and identifies conditions for exact recovery. Numerical results comparing the performance of PnP/RED to other algorithms in compressed sensing highlight the effectiveness of both methods, especially when using pre-trained artifact removal operators as priors. The paper also provides additional technical details and simulations in the Supplement.
