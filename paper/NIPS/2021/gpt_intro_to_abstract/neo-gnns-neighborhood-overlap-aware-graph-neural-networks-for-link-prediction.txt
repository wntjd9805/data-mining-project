Graph-structured data is widely present in various domains, and Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been proposed to learn representations of nodes or graphs. GNNs have shown significant improvements over traditional methods in tasks like node classification and graph generation. However, in link prediction, traditional heuristic methods still perform better than GNNs, as GNNs rely more on smoothed node features rather than structural information. To address this limitation, we propose Neighborhood Overlap-aware Graph Neural Networks (Neo-GNNs) that consider key structural information regarding links without manual processes. Our model combines scores from Neo-GNNs and feature-based GNNs to consider both structural information and input node features. Experimental results on Open Graph Benchmark datasets demonstrate that Neo-GNNs consistently outperform both state-of-the-art GNNs and heuristic methods in link prediction. Our contributions include the proposal of Neo-GNNs that learn structural features and estimate overlapped neighborhoods, generalization of neighborhood overlap-based heuristic methods, and achieving state-of-the-art performance in link prediction.
