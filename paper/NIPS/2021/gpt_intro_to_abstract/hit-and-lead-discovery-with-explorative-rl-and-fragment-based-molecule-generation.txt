Searching for "hits", or molecules with desired therapeutic potentials, is a critical task in drug discovery. Traditional approaches involve screening countless potential candidates in a brute-force manner, but designing drugs with sample-efficient generative models has emerged as a promising strategy. While many generative models for drug design are trained on the distribution of known active compounds, they tend to produce molecules that are similar to the training dataset, limiting the discovery of novel molecules. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework called Fragment-based generative RL with an Explorative Experience replay for Drug design (FREED), which combines fragment-based generation with RL and exploration techniques. We demonstrate that our framework enables the generation of qualified molecules with high therapeutic potential and significantly improves model performance through explorative algorithms based on curiosity-driven learning and prioritized experience replay.
