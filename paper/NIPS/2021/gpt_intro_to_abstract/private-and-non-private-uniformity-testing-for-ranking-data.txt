Testing whether data conforms with a model is a common task in data analysis, especially in machine learning and data science. In this paper, we focus on the problem of uniformity testing for rankings, where we aim to determine if the data is generated from a uniform distribution over rankings or from a distribution that is significantly different from the uniform. We specifically consider the Mallows model, which is widely used in ranking statistics and machine learning, and propose two tests for uniformity testing with this model. Additionally, we explore the application of these tests in the context of differential privacy, a commonly used privacy-preserving framework. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our tests in both central and local differential privacy settings.
