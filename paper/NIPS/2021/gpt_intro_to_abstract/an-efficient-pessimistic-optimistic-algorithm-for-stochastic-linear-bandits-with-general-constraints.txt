Stochastic linear bandits are widely used in various applications such as online recommendations, job assignments, and clinical trials. However, most existing studies focus on unconstrained optimization problems, limiting their applicability to problems with operational constraints. In this paper, we address this limitation by considering a stochastic linear bandit with general constraints. We introduce a novel anytime cumulative constraint that imposes a cumulative constraint in every round, ensuring that the time-average cost is below a threshold in each round. To solve this problem, we propose a pessimistic-optimistic algorithm based on the primal-dual approach, which achieves low regret and zero constraint violation. Our algorithm is computationally efficient and provides strong guarantees, even for non-linear cost functions. Overall, our work extends the existing literature on stochastic linear bandits and offers practical solutions for problems with constraints.
