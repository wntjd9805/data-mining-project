The paper introduces the study of multi-armed bandit problems with supply or budget constraints, which is a challenging research area in computer science, operations research, and economics. The authors propose a general model called Bandits with Knapsacks (BwK), which incorporates various realistic applications involving constrained resources. The goal is to maximize total reward while considering the constraints imposed by the available resources. The paper presents results on instance-dependent regret rates, simple regret, and improved algorithms for a large number of arms. The authors also analyze the UcbBwK algorithm, which achieves optimal worst-case regret bound.
