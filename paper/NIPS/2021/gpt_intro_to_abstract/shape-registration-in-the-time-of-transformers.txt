Recent advancements in 3D acquisition pipelines have led to the availability of vast amounts of data, resulting in a lack of standardization in the acquisition process. This creates a need to align the data, especially for data-driven statistical approaches that rely on the analysis of aligned data. The field of Computer Vision has made significant efforts to address the analysis of 3D objects, particularly in the domain of non-rigid registration, which involves aligning geometries that may differ by bending and stretching. This problem becomes even more complex when the geometry representation is limited to sparse point clouds. In this paper, we propose the use of transformers, specifically the attention mechanism, in the non-rigid registration task. We modify the attention mechanism to consider the density and underlying geometry of the point cloud, and we demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods. Our contributions include the introduction of the transformer-based approach, modification of the attention mechanism, and significant improvements in performance across various datasets and challenging scenarios. The code and data for our method are publicly available.
