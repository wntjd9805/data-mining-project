Fonts are a fundamental component of documents, with a wide range of styles and topologies. While vector representations of fonts offer compactness and flexibility, they are not easily adaptable to deep learning setups optimized for regular structures. Rasterizing vector fonts as images allows for the use of image-based deep learning methods, but it introduces problems such as aliasing artifacts and loss of sharp features. This paper proposes a new approach called multi-implicit neural representation, which offers high-fidelity font reconstruction and generation while preserving edges and corners. The authors present a network structure and training procedure that enable the use of local supervision to train the multi-implicits, and demonstrate the advantages of this representation through various tasks like reconstruction, interpolation, and synthesis.
