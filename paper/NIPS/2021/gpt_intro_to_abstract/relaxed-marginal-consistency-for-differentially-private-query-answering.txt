This paper introduces a novel approach, called APPROX-PRIVATE-PGM (APPGM), to address the scalability limitations of PRIVATE-PGM in the reconstruct phase of differentially private algorithms. PRIVATE-PGM, although more scalable than traditional methods, still has limitations in terms of memory and runtime when the underlying graphical model becomes too large. To overcome this, the authors propose a relaxation of the estimation objective that enforces local consistency constraints among marginals, rather than global ones, and can be solved efficiently. The proposed approach, APPGM, offers similar benefits to PRIVATE-PGM but can be deployed in a wider range of settings without strict constraints on the selected measurements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of APPGM in improving the accuracy and scalability of existing mechanisms.
