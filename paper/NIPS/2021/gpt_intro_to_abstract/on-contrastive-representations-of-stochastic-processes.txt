The introduction of this computer science paper introduces the concept of stochastic processes and their applications in various fields. It highlights the need for machine learning algorithms that operate on data generated from stochastic processes and introduces the idea of learning from a small set of covariate-observation pairs. The introduction also mentions traditional methods for learning from stochastic processes and their limitations in handling high-dimensional and multimodal data. The paper proposes a general framework called Contrastive Representations of Stochastic Processes (CRESP) that eliminates the requirement of explicit likelihood and focuses on downstream tasks. The CRESP framework is described to consist of a flexible encoder network architecture and a self-supervised learning objective. The paper concludes by mentioning the evaluation of CRESP on various datasets and its superior performance compared to existing methods. The code for CRESP is provided as well.
