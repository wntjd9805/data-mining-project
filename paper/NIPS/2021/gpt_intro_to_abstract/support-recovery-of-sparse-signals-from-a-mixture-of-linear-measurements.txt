This paper addresses the problem of support recovery for sparse vectors in the context of mixture models. The authors consider the mixture of sparse linear classifiers (MLC) and mixture of sparse linear regressions (MLR) problems, where the goal is to accurately learn the unknown hyperplanes that generate the responses. They propose a new algorithm based on low-rank tensor decomposition for support recovery in these models. The paper also compares their results to previous works and shows that their approach is more general and has better query complexity guarantees. Overall, the paper provides contributions to the field of compressed sensing and sparse recovery in mixture models.
