This paper introduces the concept of adversarial attacks on video classification models in both white-box and black-box settings. Unlike image classification models, video models require significantly more queries to estimate gradients for crafting adversarial samples. The authors propose a novel query-efficient black-box attack algorithm called GEO-TRAP that parameterizes the temporal dimension of videos using geometric transformations, resulting in a reduced and structured search space. GEO-TRAP outperforms existing methods by achieving higher attack success rates with significantly fewer queries.
