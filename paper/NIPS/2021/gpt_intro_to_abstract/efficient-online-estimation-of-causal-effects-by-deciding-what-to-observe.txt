Statistical and causal modeling often assumes that the observed variables are already known, but this ignores the challenging decisions involved in data collection. These decisions impact the questions that can be asked and the accuracy of the answers. Cost and limited control over observed variables make it impractical to collect all possible data. In this paper, we introduce the online moment selection (OMS) framework, which uses the generalized method of moments (GMM) to estimate a target parameter and decide which data sources to query. Our adaptive strategies, OMS-ETC and OMS-ETG, optimize the allocation of data sources based on estimated model parameters. We prove that these strategies achieve zero asymptotic regret and demonstrate their effectiveness through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.
