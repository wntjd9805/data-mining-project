This paper introduces PiRank, a listwise approach for Learning-To-Rank (LTR) models. LTR models aim to rank candidate items based on relevance labels for each item, but the downstream metrics of interest, such as NDCG and ARP, cannot be optimized directly due to the non-differentiability of the ranks induced by the models. To address this challenge, PiRank uses deep neural networks to learn item scores and a differentiable relaxation to the sorting operator to define the surrogate loss. The proposed method outperforms competing approaches on various ranking metrics, can scale to large item lists, and analyzes the impact of training list size. Additionally, the paper provides an open-source implementation based on TensorFlow Ranking.
