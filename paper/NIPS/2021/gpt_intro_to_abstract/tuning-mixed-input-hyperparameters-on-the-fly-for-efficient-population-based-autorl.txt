Reinforcement Learning (RL) has gained significant attention in recent years due to its success in games and robotics. However, RL algorithms are challenging to use in practice as they are sensitive to hyperparameters and difficult to reproduce. This paper focuses on Population Based Training (PBT), a method that has shown strong performance in RL settings. The authors propose a new hierarchical approach to PBT that efficiently models both continuous and categorical variables. Their contributions include introducing a new explore step and demonstrating improved performance on the Procgen benchmark.
