Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable performance in complex generation tasks, but they often fail to cover sparse regions of data manifold and underrepresent minor groups in the dataset. Previous techniques focused on improving overall sample quality but suffered from reduced diversity and biases against minor groups. In this work, we aim to improve diversity in sample generation without degrading overall quality, specifically for minor groups. We develop two new metrics to detect underrepresented samples and propose a novel method to emphasize them during GAN training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving sample quality, coverage, and quality for minor subgroups.
