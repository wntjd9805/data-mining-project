Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely used machine learning models for modeling non-Euclidean data and inter-related samples. Despite their successful applications in various domains, such as drug discovery and computer vision, there is limited theoretical understanding of their generalization ability. This paper presents a novel PAC-Bayesian analysis for GNNs on node-level tasks with non-IID assumptions. It provides generalization bounds for GNNs based on characteristics of the models and node features. Additionally, the paper discovers and empirically verifies the presence of accuracy disparity among different subgroups of test nodes, indicating potential unfairness in GNN predictions.
