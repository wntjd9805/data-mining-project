Optimal auctions are important in economic theory and have various applications across industries and online platforms. However, in practice, the auction designer may not have access to the prior distributions of valuations, making it challenging to design optimal auctions. Recent literature has focused on learning optimal auctions from samples, but there is a concern regarding adversarial corruptions of the samples. This paper explores the problem of robust learning of optimal auctions, where the samples of valuations are subject to corruption and have unbounded support. The goal is to design mechanisms that achieve a minimum error in revenue approximation with a minimal number of samples. The paper presents tight upper bounds on revenue approximation under corrupted distributions, proposes a theoretical algorithm for learning in the population model, and provides sample complexity upper bounds for learning near-optimal auctions.
