In this paper, we introduce the NeuroSEED framework, which provides a general approach to map biological sequences into geometric vector spaces. We highlight the importance of embedding geometry in capturing the relationships between sequences and compare various distances, including Euclidean, cosine, and hyperbolic distances. We also test different encoder models, such as linear layers, MLPs, CNNs, GRUs, and transformers, to map sequences to points in the embedding space. Additionally, we propose several heuristic approaches for classical bioinformatics problems, such as hierarchical clustering and multiple sequence alignment, that are constructed on top of NeuroSEED embeddings. Our results show that NeuroSEED outperforms previous approaches in terms of accuracy and speed, demonstrating its potential for a wide range of biological research tasks.
