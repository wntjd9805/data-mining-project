A key task in modern data analysis is aligning data that are acquired in multiple domains, under different conditions, using different equipment, and at different sites. This paper focuses on aligning data embedded in hyperbolic spaces, which have become popular for representing hierarchical data. The problem of alignment in hyperbolic spaces has been studied in various contexts, but relying on optimal transport (OT) approaches has limitations. In this paper, we propose a new method called hyperbolic Procrustes analysis (HPA) that uses purely geometric considerations. HPA is based on the Lorentz model of hyperbolic geometry and introduces new implementations of the components of Procrustes analysis based on Riemannian geometry. We show that HPA achieves improved alignment compared to existing methods and has advantages such as out-of-sample extension, support for small and big data, and computational efficiency. We apply HPA to batch correction in bioinformatics tasks, specifically gene expression and mass cytometry data, and demonstrate accurate removal of batch effects while preserving the intrinsic structure of the data. Our contributions include the implementation of PA in the Lorentz model, theoretical analysis based on new derivations of Riemannian geometry operations, and experimental results on hierarchical bioinformatics datasets.
