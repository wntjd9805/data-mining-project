Modeling symmetry in data is essential in machine learning as it allows for generalization and performance improvements. In applications such as computational physics and deep neural networks, exact symmetry is required. Equivariance, which captures the goal of invariance or co-variance, is achieved when a function follows a specific property under the action of a group. To make convolutional neural networks (CNNs) equivariant, group convolutional networks (G-CNNs) are typically used. Nonlinearities, however, pose challenges to equivariance, and various solutions have been proposed. In this paper, we focus on the effect of nonlinearities on Fourier-domain representations and specifically study the case of SO(2). We develop an algorithm for polynomial nonlinearities that maintains a band-limited representation and efficiently computes the Fourier representation. We also extend our representation to surface data and evaluate our networks on image and object recognition benchmarks. Our contributions include an analytical model for the effect of nonlinearities on Fourier representations and an efficient algorithm for applying nonlinearities, allowing the use of standard CNN architectures without compromising equivariance.
