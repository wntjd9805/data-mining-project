This paper introduces the concept of spatio-temporal variational Gaussian processes (ST-VGP) as a probabilistic modeling paradigm for tasks such as modeling air pollution across a city. The authors discuss the limitations of existing methods for spatio-temporal GPS and propose ST-VGP as a solution. They demonstrate how ST-VGP can be derived using a natural gradient variational inference approach, allowing for the use of more inducing points and improving predictive performance. Additionally, they show how the spatio-temporal structure can be further exploited to improve computational scaling in both the temporal and spatial dimensions. The authors provide an analysis of the performance and scalability of their proposed methods, highlighting their ability to apply GPS to large-scale spatio-temporal scenarios without sacrificing inference quality.
