This computer science paper introduces a new method called Adaptive Pseudo Augmentation (APA) for training state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with limited data. The paper addresses the problem of discriminator overfitting, which leads to poor-quality image synthesis when training data is insufficient. APA exploits the generator in the GAN itself to provide augmentation, without the need for external augmentations or regularization terms. It adapts to different settings and training statuses without manual tuning and improves the discriminator's ability to distinguish between real and fake distributions. The paper presents experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of APA and its potential to enhance existing GAN training methods.
