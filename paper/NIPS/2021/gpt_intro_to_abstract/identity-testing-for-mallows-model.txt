The introduction of the paper presents the problem of identity testing of discrete distributions, specifically focusing on rankings over m items. The authors discuss the challenges of identity testing for ranking data and introduce the exponential family on rankings as a tractable subclass. They highlight the applications of the Mallows model in various domains and emphasize the need for scalable identity tests. The authors also mention the lack of extensive hypothesis testing literature related to Mallows model and ranking distributions. They outline the goals of their study, which include devising hypothesis tests for the Mallows model and exploring both asymptotic and non-asymptotic scenarios. Finally, they provide a summary of their main results, which include the development of a Uniformly Most Powerful Unbiased (UMPU) test for asymptotic cases, conversion of the UMPU test into a non-asymptotic test, proposal of an optimal non-asymptotic test for small spread parameter, consideration of tests for cases where the central ranking needs to be estimated, and demonstration of the algorithm's versatility with large m on synthetic data.
