The introduction of this computer science paper addresses the challenge of designing and using voting rules in practice, despite the existence of impossibility results in social choice theory. The dominant approach for designing voting rules is the axiomatic approach, where rules are evaluated and compared based on their satisfaction of desirable normative properties (axioms). However, the traditional worst-case analysis of axiom satisfaction may not be practical for comparing voting rules in low-stakes applications. This paper proposes a semi-random model to measure the likelihood of axiom satisfaction under realistic distributions of agents' preferences. The authors present their contributions in terms of the semi-random satisfaction of two important axioms, the Condorcet criterion (CC) and the participation axiom (PAR), under various voting rules. They also introduce a categorization lemma that can be applied to analyze other axioms in future work.
