Learning probabilistic models for data in machine learning and statistics has traditionally focused on Euclidean spaces, with little attention given to non-Euclidean spaces despite their prevalence in various problem domains. This paper presents a novel approach for learning density models over non-Euclidean spaces using continuous normalizing flows (CNFs). While previous work has extended CNFs to Riemannian manifolds, it fails to properly model necessary symmetries, which are crucial in many scientific applications. The authors address this limitation by designing equivariant manifold flows that maintain symmetry invariance, providing a general framework for learning equivariant manifold flows and demonstrating their effectiveness in learning gauge invariant densities over SU(n) in quantum field theory. The paper also highlights the benefits of incorporating symmetries into manifold flow models and includes a detailed evaluation comparing the proposed approach to previous methods.
