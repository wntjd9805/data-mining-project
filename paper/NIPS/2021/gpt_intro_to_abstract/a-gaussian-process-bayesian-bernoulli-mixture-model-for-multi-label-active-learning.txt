In multi-label classification (MLC), each data instance may have multiple associated labels, allowing for a more complex representation of data-label distributions. Binary relevance machines (BRMs) transform MLC problems into multiple binary problems and train independent binary classifiers for each label. However, applying BRMs to a correlated and large label space presents challenges due to the high cost of training per label and the difficulties of predicting complex labels directly. In this paper, we propose a novel Gaussian Process-Bayesian Bernoulli Mixture (GP-B2M) model for cost-effective sampling in multi-label active learning (ML-AL). The GP-B2M model addresses the limitations of existing methods by encoding label correlations using a Bayesian Bernoulli mixture of label clusters and integrating a predictive Gaussian Process to connect data features with the label clusters. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art active learning performance by accurately modeling label correlations and quantifying a data sample's overall contribution to a correlated label space.
