The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the concept of differential privacy and its applications in answering numeric queries. It introduces the DP mechanism, which involves adding noise to preserve privacy, and highlights the popular examples of the Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms. The paper then addresses the importance of estimation accuracy in choosing between these mechanisms and considers the contradiction that arises when moving from Laplace to Gaussian, where both privacy and accuracy seem to worsen. It proposes the truncated Laplace mechanism as an alternative and raises questions about its design and applicability in high-dimensional settings. The paper aims to answer these questions and presents two main contributions: a Central Limit Theorem that shows the convergence to Gaussian Differential Privacy (GDP) in high dimensions and a characterization of the optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off using the Gaussian mechanism. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their privacy conclusion but emphasize the interesting phenomenon and the potential for further exploration in non-linear functionals of high-dimensional distributions.
