Neural sequence models often struggle with generating consistent and coherent text, leading to issues such as forgetting character attributes, neglecting established relationships, contradicting prior statements, and violating world knowledge. This paper draws inspiration from cognitive science's dual process theories of reasoning to propose a neuro-symbolic approach to improve the coherence and consistency of neural sequence models. By treating the predictions of a neural model as "System 1" proposals and using a logical and deliberative "System 2" to filter and validate these proposals, the proposed approach aims to enhance the generation process. The paper showcases the effectiveness of this approach in two domains: text generation and instruction following, achieving improved coherence and consistency in text generations as measured by human judgment. The findings suggest that integrating neuro-symbolic and dual process models can address the robustness and consistency challenges of neural sequence models.
