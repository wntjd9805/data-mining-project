In this paper, we introduce the concept of Scene Graph Generation (SGG) as a means to achieve a comprehensive understanding of visual scenes by capturing the relationships between different objects and their relations within a scene. We highlight the limitations of previous SGG methods that often ignore the dependency between objects and relations, and propose a new approach called Joint Modeling for Scene Graph Generation (JM-SGG) to address this issue. JM-SGG leverages a Conditional Random Field (CRF) framework to model the joint distribution of objects and relations and defines potential functions on both nodes (objects) and edges (relations) to capture the dependencies within a scene graph. To tackle the challenges of learning and inference in such a complex model, we propose an efficient and effective mean-field variational inference algorithm. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach through performance experiments and highlight the efficiency and efficacy of our proposed inference algorithm.
