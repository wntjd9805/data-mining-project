This paper introduces RegGAN, a new image-to-image translation mode in the field of computer science. RegGAN aims to overcome the limitations of existing modes such as Pix2Pix and Cycle-consistency by treating misaligned target images as noisy labels and applying supervised learning with noisy labels. RegGAN incorporates an additional registration network to adaptively fit the misaligned noise distribution and search for the common optimal solution for both image-to-image translation and registration tasks. Experimental results show that RegGAN outperforms both Pix2Pix on aligned data and Cycle-consistency on misaligned or unpaired data. Additionally, RegGAN can be seamlessly integrated into other methods without requiring changes to the original network architecture, offering better performance with fewer network parameters.
