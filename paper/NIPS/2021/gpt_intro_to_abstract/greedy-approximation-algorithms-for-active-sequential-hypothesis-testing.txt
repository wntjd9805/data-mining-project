In this paper, we address the problem of active sequential hypothesis testing (ASHT), where the goal is to learn the true hypothesis from a set of candidate hypotheses with minimal cost. We focus on two types of adaptivity: partial adaptivity, where the sequence of actions is decided upfront, and full adaptivity, where the choice of action depends on previous outcomes. We propose new approximation algorithms that provide upper bounds on the expected costs, running in polynomial time and achieving a non-trivial multiplicative factor of the optimal costs. Our results are based on connections to submodular function ranking and optimal decision tree problems, allowing us to overcome the inherent combinatorial nature of ASHT. Existing heuristics fail to account for this combinatorial difficulty, while previous results for related problems do not consider the presence of noise.
