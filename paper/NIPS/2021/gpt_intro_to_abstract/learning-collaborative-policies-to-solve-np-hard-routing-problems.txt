Routing problems, such as the traveling salesman problem (TSP), are important in various engineering fields. However, these problems are NP-hard, making it difficult to design exact solvers. Current approaches rely on mixed-integer linear programming solvers and handcrafted heuristics, but they have limitations. To overcome these limitations, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks have been proposed. This paper presents a novel DRL scheme called learning collaborative policies (LCP) that uses a seeder and reviser policy to generate and refine candidate solutions. The reviser can re-evaluate underrated candidates, allowing for better solution quality. The proposed method is architecture-agnostic and outperforms other DRL frameworks on TSP-like problems. Extensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.
