With the increasing complexity and size of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), theoretical analysis and performance evaluation become more challenging. This is particularly problematic for applications like inverse problems in scientific computing, where stability and robustness are crucial. The instability of current DNN implementations and the lack of accurate upper bounds on Lipschitz constants of DNNs highlight the need for precise evaluation of critical indicators. Existing approaches to DNN certification rely on complex techniques that may suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a new approach using Monotone operator equilibrium networks (monDEQs), which have simpler layer structures compared to DNNs. We present three semialgebraic models of ReLU monDEQs for certification, including robustness, Lipschitz constant estimation, and ellipsoid outer-approximation. These models are evaluated on MNIST dataset, showing superior performance compared to existing approaches. Furthermore, our experiments suggest that monDEQs are less robust to Lâˆž perturbations than L2 perturbations, in contrast to classical DNNs.
