Spectral methods have proven to be powerful techniques in machine learning, with applications in clustering, image and video segmentation, and network analysis. While most research has focused on linear Laplacian operators for graphs, recent work has explored non-linear Laplacian operators for more complex objects like hypergraphs. In this paper, we introduce and study a non-linear Laplacian-type operator for hypergraphs and propose a polynomial-time algorithm for finding bipartite components in hypergraphs. We also present a Cheeger-type inequality for hypergraphs and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms through extensive experimental studies. These findings have implications for unsupervised learning in hypergraphs and offer potential applications in various datasets.
