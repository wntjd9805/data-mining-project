This paper introduces a new sketched ALS algorithm for Tucker decomposition, which aims to compute low-rank decompositions for large, potentially sparse tensors. The algorithm updates one factor matrix along with the core tensor in each subproblem, similar to the traditional HOOI. The authors compare their algorithm to previous randomized Tucker algorithms and demonstrate improved decomposition accuracy. The paper also provides theoretical upper bounds for sketch size using leverage score sampling and TensorSketch, showing that leverage score sampling performs better in terms of efficiency and accuracy. Additionally, an initialization scheme based on randomized range finder (RRF) is proposed to enhance the accuracy of leverage score sampling on tensors with high coherence. The authors also propose a Tucker + CP method for more efficient and accurate CP decomposition. Overall, this paper presents several contributions including a new algorithm, theoretical bounds, comparison of sketching techniques, and the proposed initialization scheme.
