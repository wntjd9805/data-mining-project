This paper introduces a contact model for handling frictional contacts with or without elasticity and enforcing energy conservation during smooth portions of trajectories. The contact model expands the scope of energy-conserving neural networks and solves convex optimization problems to calculate velocity jumps during contact. The paper also builds upon recent progress in differentiating through convex optimization problems and demonstrates the performance of the differentiable contact model in learning coefficients of restitution and friction for various 2D and 3D contacts. Additionally, the framework is tested as a differentiable physics simulator in downstream planning tasks.
