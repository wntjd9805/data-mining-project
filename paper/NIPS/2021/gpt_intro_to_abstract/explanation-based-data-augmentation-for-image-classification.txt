Machine learning models rely on training datasets to learn decision boundaries. However, under-represented regions in the dataset can lead to sub-optimal decision boundaries and misclassification of data points. This paper introduces a framework called BRACE that utilizes concept-based explanations to identify candidate samples from image repositories for data augmentation. The proposed approach aims to select samples with high utility scores, increasing the representativeness of the training dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that BRACE outperforms existing augmentation methods.
