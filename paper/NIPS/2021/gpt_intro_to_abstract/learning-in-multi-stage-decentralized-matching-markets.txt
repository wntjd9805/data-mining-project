Two-sided matching markets, which allocate goods to decision-making agents based on mutual compatibility, have been widely studied in microeconomics. These markets are often organized in a decentralized manner, with each agent making independent decisions and engaging in multiple stages of interaction with the other side of the market. In such multi-stage decentralized matching markets, uncertain preferences pose challenges for agents in formulating optimal strategies. This paper addresses two research questions: (i) How can agents with uncertain preferences learn optimal strategies that maximize expected payoffs based on historical data? (ii) What are the implications of multi-stage decentralized matching on welfare and fairness? The paper proposes a new algorithm for maximizing expected payoffs that incorporates learning stage-wise optimal strategies and calibrating state parameters based on historical data. The algorithm balances the opportunity cost and penalty for exceeding quotas. The paper also provides an analytical framework for understanding the implications of the approach for welfare and fairness. The authors show that agents prefer arms with stable and realistic matching opportunities, leading to better expected payoffs. However, this strategic behavior can result in unfair outcomes for arms. The paper concludes that agents benefit more from multi-stage decentralized matching compared to single-stage decentralized matching.
