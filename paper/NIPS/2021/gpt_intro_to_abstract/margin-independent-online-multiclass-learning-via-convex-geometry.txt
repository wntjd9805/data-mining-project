Online multiclass classification is a common problem in machine learning, where a learning algorithm is tasked with assigning labels to incoming query points. Traditionally, theoretical treatments of this problem rely on the notion of a margin Î³, representing the separation between different classes. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach that weights each mistake based on the ambiguity of the classification task. We partition the space of query points into regions and incur a loss based on the distance needed to move a query point to its correct region. We present efficient algorithms for learning linear classifiers and nearest neighbor partitions, with total losses of O(d log d) and O(k^2d log d) respectively. We also provide mistake bounds that match the best-known halving algorithms.
