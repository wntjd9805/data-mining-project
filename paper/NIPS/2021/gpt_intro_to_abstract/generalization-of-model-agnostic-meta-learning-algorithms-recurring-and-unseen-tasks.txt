In this paper, we explore the concept of meta-learning and its application in machine learning problems. Specifically, we focus on the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm, which uses training data from multiple tasks to generate a meta-initialization that can adapt well to new tasks. We investigate the generalization error of MAML, both when the test task is one of the training tasks and when it is a new, unseen task. We propose a novel stability definition for meta-learning algorithms and provide guarantees on the test error and generalization error of MAML. Additionally, we analyze the impact of problem parameters, such as the number of tasks and the number of samples, on the generalization error. Our findings contribute to the understanding of meta-learning algorithms and their performance in different scenarios.
