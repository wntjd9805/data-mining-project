Deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used in various tasks, but they often lack the ability to incorporate "rules" or prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose DEEPCTRL, a framework that combines data-driven and rule-driven learning to enable DNNs to learn from both labeled data and rules. DEEPCTRL uses separate encoders for data and rules, and allows for controllable adjustment of the strength of rule-driven learning at inference without the need for retraining. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DEEPCTRL in tasks from Physics, Retail, and Healthcare, showing improved rule verification ratio and target task performance by adjusting the rule strength.
