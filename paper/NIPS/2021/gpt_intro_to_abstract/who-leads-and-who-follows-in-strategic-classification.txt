This paper introduces the concept of strategic adaptation in decision-making algorithms, also known as Goodhart's law, where individuals strategically adapt to decision rules to achieve desirable outcomes. The paper focuses on strategic classification as a two-player game, with the decision-maker leading and strategic agents following. The goal is to develop strategy-robust decision rules that remain meaningful even after agents have adapted. The paper argues that the order of play in strategic interactions can be reversed, with agents leading and the decision-maker following. The authors show that by tuning their update frequency appropriately, the decision-maker can select the order of play, and in natural settings, allowing agents to play first can be preferable for both the decision-maker and the agents. The paper highlights the importance of the rate of agents' re-evaluation and modification of features, introducing the concepts of proactive and reactive decision-makers. The main contribution is the proof that the choice of being proactive or reactive fundamentally determines the order of play and the convergence to different equilibria. The paper also suggests that both decision-makers and agents may prefer the agents' equilibrium over the decision-maker's equilibrium in certain learning problems. These findings open up new possibilities for studying more desirable solutions in strategic settings.
