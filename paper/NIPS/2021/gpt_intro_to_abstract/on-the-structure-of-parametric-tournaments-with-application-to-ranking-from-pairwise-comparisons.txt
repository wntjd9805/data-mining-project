In this paper, we investigate the Minimum Feedback Arc Set on Tournament (MFAST) problem for several classes of tournaments that naturally occur in learning to rank from pairwise comparisons. We focus on parametric pairwise preference classes, such as the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) and Thurstone models, which give rise to acyclic tournament matrices. However, real-world datasets often exhibit cyclic tournament structures that cannot be modeled using these simple preference models. We aim to identify and study non-trivial classes of parametric preference matrices that can generate cyclic tournaments. We also introduce the concept of forbidden configurations in tournaments and derive upper and lower bounds for the size of these configurations for rank r tournament classes. Additionally, we propose a flexible class of tournaments called the Block Rank 2 class, which extends the rank 2 class and can capture both locally cyclic and globally acyclic relations. We provide algorithms for solving the MFAST problem for these classes of tournaments and evaluate their performance on real-world and synthetic datasets.
