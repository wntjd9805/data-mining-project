Gaussian Process (GP) is a popular method for function learning, but stationary kernels may not be suitable for complex data structures like graph-structured data. To address this, expressive kernels such as compositional kernels and deep kernels have been proposed. However, these kernels have limitations in terms of expressiveness and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a Structure-aware Random Fourier (SRF) kernel that combines feature-based and structure-aware approaches to improve kernel expressiveness. The SRF kernel converts the kernel learning problem into a distribution inference problem and enables scalable learning through a random Fourier feature formulation. We also introduce a variational Expectation-Maximization method to optimize GPs with the SRF kernel. Experimental results on real-world graph datasets demonstrate that our proposed GPSRF model outperforms existing methods in graph learning tasks, such as object classification and link prediction.
