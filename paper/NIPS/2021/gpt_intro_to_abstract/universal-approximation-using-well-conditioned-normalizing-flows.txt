Normalizing flows are generative models that parameterize a distribution in Rd by transforming a simple distribution (such as Gaussian) through an invertible map. This paper focuses on affine coupling flows, a family of normalizing flows that has been successfully scaled up to high-resolution datasets. However, theoretical understanding of these models is still lacking, particularly regarding their representational power. The paper addresses the question of whether well-behaved distributions can be approximated by an affine coupling flow with a well-conditioned Jacobian. The authors provide an affirmative answer for a class of distributions called log-concave distributions, by using Gaussian padding instead of zero-padding. The results have implications for fitting distributions using affine coupling flows and reveal connections between these flows and stochastic differential equations and dynamical systems.
