In this paper, we introduce SketchGen, a generative framework for learning a distribution of constrained sketches in Computer Aided Design (CAD) tools. We address the challenge of working with the heterogeneous nature of CAD models by developing a well-structured language for representing sketches as sequences of tokens. Our architecture utilizes transformers to capture long-range dependencies and outputs both primitives and their constraints. We evaluate SketchGen on a large constrained sketch dataset and demonstrate improved sketch generation quality compared to existing works. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to assess the effectiveness of our design choices.
