Our work focuses on edge independent graph models, where each edge in the graph is added independently with a certain probability. This type of model includes classic random graph models such as the Erdos-RÃ©nyi model and the stochastic block model. We explore the suitability of edge independent models in capturing real-world network features like power-law degree distributions and high clustering coefficients. We also investigate the limitations of these models in generating graphs with high triangle densities. Our main result shows that edge independent models with bounded overlap cannot generate graphs with a large number of triangles. We provide bounds for the density of other subgraphs and the global clustering coefficient as well. Our theoretical findings shed light on why edge independent graph models often generate fewer triangles and squares compared to real-world graphs. We validate our results empirically by testing different models and observing the underestimation of triangle counts. We introduce simple baseline models with tunable overlap to better understand the trade-off between overlap and realistic graph generation.
