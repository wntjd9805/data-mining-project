Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have gained significant attention in various domains such as computer vision, computational biology, recommendation systems, and social network analysis. However, GCNs still face challenges related to shallow architectures and application-specific customization. This paper introduces a novel approach called PDE-GCN, which leverages the similarities between GCNs and Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) to design universal GCN architectures. The authors propose general graph convolution operators based on graph gradient and divergence and formulate various graph-related problems as discretized PDEs. The method enables the construction of deep GCNs without over-smoothing and provides theoretical guarantees. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach compared to state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy.
