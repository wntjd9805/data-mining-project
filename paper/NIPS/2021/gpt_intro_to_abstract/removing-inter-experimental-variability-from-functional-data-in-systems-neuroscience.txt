This paper addresses the issue of inter-experimental variability in systems neuroscience by applying methods from domain adaptation, a problem commonly encountered in machine learning. The authors propose and evaluate different approaches for removing inter-experimental variability in functional data, leading to improved cell type assignment and preservation of biological signals. The effectiveness of their method is demonstrated through comparisons with anatomical data and downstream analysis, showing clear biological effects that were previously obscured. This work fills a gap in the field of systems neuroscience, where approaches for addressing inter-experimental variability have been lacking.
