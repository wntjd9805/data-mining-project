This paper explores the construction of a system that can discover compositional components in an unsupervised manner and combine them across different modalities and datasets. Two separate lines of work are discussed - one focuses on obtaining global, holistic, compositional factors by situating data points in a factored vector space, while the other decomposes a scene into underlying 'object' factors defined by segmentation masks. To address the weaknesses of these approaches, the paper proposes decomposing a scene into factors represented as energy functions. The authors draw inspiration from previous work on energy-based models and aim to discover concepts in an unsupervised manner. The proposed approach, called COMET, is compared favorably to existing unsupervised approaches and is shown to enable the scaling to more realistic datasets while allowing for compositional generalization across different modes of data.
