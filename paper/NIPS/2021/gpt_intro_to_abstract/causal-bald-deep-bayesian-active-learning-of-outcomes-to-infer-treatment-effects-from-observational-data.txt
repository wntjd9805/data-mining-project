This paper introduces the concept of personalized treatment effects and the challenges in estimating them from observational data. It highlights the increasing use of pre-treatment covariates from high-dimensional, heterogeneous measurements in healthcare and the need for data-efficient methods, such as active learning, to minimize the amount of labeled data required. The paper discusses the biases induced by active learning and the potential positive and negative consequences of these biases. It also explores the importance of overlap in the data for accurate treatment effect estimation and proposes epistemic uncertainty-aware methods for active learning. The performance of these methods is demonstrated using synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.
