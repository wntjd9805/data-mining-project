Hierarchical clustering (HC) is a widely used technique in data analysis for partitioning a dataset into clusters of decreasing size. While traditional HC algorithms lack a well-defined objective function, recent research has introduced a cost function to measure clustering quality. In this paper, we propose two new approximation algorithms for constructing HC trees that can be rigorously analyzed based on the cost function. Our first algorithm constructs an HC tree based on the degree sequence of an input graph and guarantees approximation with respect to the conductance of the graph. The second algorithm focuses on well-clustered graphs and improves on previous results by providing an O(1)-approximation algorithm for constructing HC trees. We compare our algorithm's performance to previous methods and demonstrate its effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
