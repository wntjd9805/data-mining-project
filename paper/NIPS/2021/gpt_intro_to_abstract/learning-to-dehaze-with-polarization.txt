In this paper, we address the problem of hazy image dehazing by proposing a generalized physical formation model that considers the polarization effects of both transmitted light and airlight, as well as the spatially-variant real-world scattering. We propose a robust polarization-based dehazing pipeline that utilizes deep learning to estimate the necessary physical parameters, such as the infinite airlight and the degree of polarization (DoP) of both transmitted light and airlight. Unlike previous methods, our pipeline does not require specific clues or assumptions and makes use of semantic and contextual information to handle spatially-variant scattering. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on synthetic data and real-world hazy images.
