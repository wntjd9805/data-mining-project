Federated learning (FL) has gained attention as a distributed learning paradigm that trains centralized models on decentralized data while maintaining data privacy. FL allows local systems to benefit from each other's data, particularly for systems with scarce training data or lack of diverse distributions. However, FL faces the challenge of data distribution heterogeneity due to the different methods and tasks of the decentralized data collected by different institutes. In the field of graph learning, graph classification using techniques like graph kernels and graph neural networks has become popular, with applications in molecular property prediction and protein representation learning. In this paper, we explore the question of whether real-world graphs from heterogeneous sources can provide useful common information. We conduct data analysis on various graph properties and find statistically significant common patterns among real-world graphs across different domains. Additionally, we propose a graph-level clustered FL framework (GCFL) that integrates graph neural networks to address the heterogeneity of non-iid graphs. We also propose an improved version of GCFL called GCFL+ that incorporates gradient-series-based clustering. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our frameworks in reducing structure and feature heterogeneity, and our GCFL+ framework consistently outperforms other baselines in cross-dataset/cross-domain FL for graph classification.
