This paper focuses on achieving pure Differential Privacy (DP) when releasing a statistical summary that takes values on a complete Riemannian manifold. Riemannian manifolds are used to analyze nonlinear data or parameters that may not be well defined under linear operations. Traditional privacy approaches typically utilize ambient linear spaces, but there are drawbacks to this approach. This paper proposes working directly with the manifolds and explores the implications of curvature on privacy and utility. The authors introduce tools from Differential Geometry to extend the Laplace mechanism for DP to general Riemannian manifolds and provide bounds on privacy noise. The influence of curvature is demonstrated through numerical examples. This is an important contribution as manifolds have not been extensively explored in the context of DP.
