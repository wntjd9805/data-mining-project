This paper focuses on the challenge of computationally modeling the flow of water in a floodplain to predict flooding events. Traditional numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in these models are time-consuming and require resolving spatiotemporal features over multiple scales. To address this issue, the authors propose optimizing the coarse grid representation of the elevation map using a combination of deep neural networks (DNN) and PDEs. By minimizing the distance between the solutions on the fine and coarse grids, the authors demonstrate improved accuracy in water flow estimation. They also provide a configured dataset for 2D water flow estimation and show the feasibility of real-time flood warning with a significant speedup.
