With the rapid progress of AI technologies, AI algorithms are being deployed in various societal settings, including job and education distribution. However, the complex social effects can significantly impact the performance of these algorithms. In this paper, we focus on the fair assignment of part-time jobs to students by the Students Affairs Office (SAO). The SAO clerk's task is to make the assignment fair and ensure equal opportunities for all students. We approach this problem by incorporating concepts from job scheduling and fair AI algorithms. We consider two widely accepted definitions of fairness, maximin share (MMS) and envy-freeness (EF), and aim to compute allocations that satisfy both criteria. Our main results include the design of approximation algorithms for computing MMS and EF schedules, as well as the exploration of the compatibility between EF and Pareto efficiency (PO). We also introduce the concept of individual optimality (IO) and provide algorithms for computing EF and IO schedules.
