Voting is a popular method for groups to make collective decisions, but it is susceptible to strategic manipulations. While manipulation in single-round voting systems has been extensively studied, less is known about the effect of strategic behavior in sequential and iterative voting procedures. This paper aims to address this gap by characterizing the additive dynamic price of anarchy (ADPoA) of iterative voting under different social welfare notions. The results show that for fixed utility vectors, the ADPoA is proportional to the number of agents, indicating a negative impact on social welfare. However, when agents' preferences are randomly generated, the expected ADPoA is negative, suggesting that strategic behavior can lead to higher expected social welfare. The paper utilizes techniques such as partitioning profiles based on potential winners and analyzing head-to-head competitions to derive these results.
