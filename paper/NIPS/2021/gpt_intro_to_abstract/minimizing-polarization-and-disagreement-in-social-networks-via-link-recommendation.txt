Social networks and social media platforms have greatly influenced the propagation and formation of opinions, leading to shifts in how individuals share and shape their viewpoints. This has resulted in the emergence of social phenomena like polarization and disagreement, which are important factors in data mining applications. However, existing recommender systems that aim to increase user engagement may unintentionally create "echo-chambers" by recommending content that aligns with users' existing opinions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to suggest links in a social network that minimize both disagreement and polarization. We formulate this as an optimization problem and present greedy algorithms that efficiently address the challenge. Our experiments on real networks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithms compared to other edge creation strategies. The full paper provides further proofs and implementation details.
