This paper discusses the importance of providing complex machines, such as robots, with the ability to learn effective models of their dynamics from their physical interactions with the world. While analytical models derived from physical principles have been successfully used in various domains, the complex natural phenomena encountered in real-world interactions are difficult to describe mathematically. Data-driven approaches, specifically the Koopman formalism, have emerged as a promising way to learn and analyze complex dynamics. However, applying this formalism to instrumented systems like robots presents challenges, particularly in terms of online update capacities to account for new measurements and maintain accurate prediction capabilities in changing environments. The objective of this research is to address these challenges and develop effective dynamical representations for real-world applications.
