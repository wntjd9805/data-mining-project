Graph representation learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) have been successfully used in domains with available graph structures. GNNs have particularly shown promising results in semi-supervised classification when the graph structure exhibits high homophily. However, we aim to investigate the feasibility of using GNNs for classification problems where a graph structure is not readily available. Existing approaches either fix a similarity graph or learn the GNN parameters and graph structure simultaneously. In this paper, we explore alternative methods to tackle this problem.
