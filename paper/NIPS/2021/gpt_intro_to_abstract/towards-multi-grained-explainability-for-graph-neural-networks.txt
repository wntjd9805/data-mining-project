Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved significant success in various applications but lack explainability. This paper addresses the problem of GNN explainability and proposes a novel explainer model called ReFine. ReFine combines pre-training and fine-tuning techniques to generate multi-grained explanations for GNN models. It aims to provide both global understanding of the model's inner workings and local insights on specific instances. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in explaining GNNs and demonstrates its effectiveness compared to existing explainers.
