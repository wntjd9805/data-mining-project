Designing molecules that bind to specific protein binding sites is a challenging task in drug discovery. In recent years, machine learning approaches have shown success in molecule generation, but they are limited in their ability to perceive molecular interactions in 3D space. This paper proposes a 3D generative model to address this limitation and aims at modeling the distribution of atom occurrence in the 3D space of the binding site. The authors design a neural network architecture to take a 3D coordinate as input and output the probability of that coordinate being occupied by an atom of a particular element. Furthermore, they propose an auto-regressive sampling algorithm to generate valid and diverse molecules. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in generating drug-like molecules with high binding affinity and other relevant tasks such as linker design.
