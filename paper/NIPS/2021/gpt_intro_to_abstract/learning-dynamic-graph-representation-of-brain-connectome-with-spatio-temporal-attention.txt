This paper introduces a novel method called Spatio-Temporal Attention Graph Isomorphism Network (STAGIN) for learning the dynamic graph representation of the brain connectome using functional connectivity (FC) data obtained from neuroimaging modalities. The proposed method incorporates temporal features of the FC network to improve the classification accuracy of the model, while also providing spatial-temporal explainability. STAGIN achieves state-of-the-art performance in gender classification and task decoding using resting-state and task fMRI data. Interpretation of the learned spatio-temporal attention replicates findings from previous fMRI studies, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method. This research has the potential to impact the field of brain decoding and biomarker discovery, although ethical considerations related to privacy concerns must also be acknowledged.
