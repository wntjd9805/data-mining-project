This paper introduces the concept of using continuous-time (CT) neural networks equipped with causal structures to model physical systems and improve generalization. The authors investigate the spectrum of causal modeling, from physical models to statistical models, and propose that CT networks, specifically liquid time-constant networks (LTCs), can serve as causal models. They demonstrate the effectiveness of LTC-based models in visual drone navigation tasks and highlight their ability to capture causal structures directly from visual inputs, resulting in improved robustness and interpretable decision-making. The contributions of the paper include theoretical evidence, extensive experiments, and robustness analysis of CT models in real-world scenarios.
