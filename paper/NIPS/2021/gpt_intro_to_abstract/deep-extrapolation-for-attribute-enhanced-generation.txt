Deep generative neural networks have shown promising results in generating realistic data across various domains, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and speech. However, generating data samples beyond the training distribution remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a method called GENhance, which focuses on extrapolating sequences to generate enhanced attributes. GENhance consists of a generator and a discriminator that are jointly trained to minimize generation and discrimination losses. We evaluate GENhance on two datasets, the Stanford Sentiment Treebank and a protein stability dataset, and demonstrate its superior performance compared to baseline methods. We also release the benchmarks, evaluation metrics, and scripts for automatic evaluation.
