Recent advancements in computational optimal transport (OT) have sparked interest in its application in various domains of machine learning and statistics. The goal of OT is to find the minimal cost of moving masses between probability distributions. However, the estimation of transport cost is not robust against outliers. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of robust OT and its corresponding barycenter problem. We propose algorithms with improved complexities compared to existing methods and provide empirical studies to validate our findings. This work contributes to a better understanding of robust OT and its practical application in solving complex optimization problems.
