This paper focuses on the importance of understanding how individual privacy degrades as more analyses are conducted using their data in privacy-preserving data analysis. Existing composition theorems for differential privacy typically consider worst-case privacy loss, which can be overly conservative. The authors propose a tighter analysis of privacy loss composition by computing individual privacy losses, allowing for a personalized estimate of privacy loss divergence for each individual in the dataset. They present a privacy filter for RÃ©nyi differential privacy (RDP) that justifies stopping analyses based on the sum of privacy parameters under fully adaptive composition. The authors also demonstrate the applicability of their results to individual privacy accounting, providing better utilization of data points within a given budget. They further apply their technique to high-dimensional linear queries generated by gradient descent and show improved privacy-utility tradeoff.
