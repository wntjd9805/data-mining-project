This paper introduces a machine learning method for learning checklists from data in healthcare applications. The method overcomes challenges in checklist development by solving an integer programming problem to return the most accurate checklist that follows user-specified constraints. The method optimizes exact measures of model performance and allows adaptive binarization of features. It also enables practitioners to meet custom requirements on model form or prediction by encoding them as constraints. The paper presents empirical studies on clinical classification datasets, showing that predictive checklists can perform well and provides an optimality gap to identify cases where it is not sufficient. The paper also includes a Python package for training and customizing predictive checklists using open-source and commercial solvers.
