This paper explores the problem of selective classification in low-power or battery-limited edge devices that rely on resource-intensive models implemented on cloud servers for accurate decisions. The goal is to learn a rule that classifies easy instances locally and sends harder ones to the cloud, minimizing resource consumption. The paper proposes an online selective classification scheme with an emphasis on minimizing mistakes and excess abstentions compared to the best-in-hindsight error-free selective classifier. The scheme guarantees a controlled number of mistakes and excess abstentions against adaptive adversaries, and also provides improved regret bounds against stochastic adversaries. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the scheme and validates it through experiments on benchmark datasets.
