Standard methods in statistical analysis often assume that data values are independent and drawn from an underlying distribution, but can perform poorly when this assumption is violated. Robust statistics methods address this issue by allowing for outliers while assuming that the majority of the data values are independent samples. However, there are natural scenarios where data values are strongly correlated to sample membership, leading to inaccurate results. Inaccurate predictions in these scenarios can have significant societal consequences, such as in predicting election outcomes or the spread of a contagious disease. In this paper, we introduce a framework that captures statistical estimation in these challenging settings by assuming worst-case data values and leveraging knowledge of the randomized data collection process. We propose algorithms based on online gradient descent to approximate the optimal semilinear estimator for both (cid:96)âˆž-bounded and (cid:96)2-bounded values, achieving improved runtime and comparable performance to existing methods. We also provide a combinatorial condition that guarantees any estimator to have constant worst-case expected error.
