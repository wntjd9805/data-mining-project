Generative trajectory forecasting plays a vital role in path planning and tracking, requiring the learning of future trajectory distributions based on past information. In interactive multi-agent environments such as team sports or driving, individual actions are influenced by intentions, relations, and observations of other agents. However, these factors are dynamic, hidden, and stochastic, resulting in highly variable future trajectories. Existing models either focus on individual intentions or social relations, leading to compromised performance. To address these limitations, we propose the Generative Relation and Intention Network (GRIN), which explicitly models uncertainties in both intentions and relations. Our model is trained using variational inference and learning and features a disentangled architecture for separate modeling of intention and relation uncertainties. We evaluate the model using synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its superior performance compared to advanced baselines in accurately predicting multiple possible trajectories. This highlights the critical advantage of generative modeling for intentions and relations.
