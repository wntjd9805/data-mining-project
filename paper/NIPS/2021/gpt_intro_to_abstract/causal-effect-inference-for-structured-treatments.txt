Estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) from observational data is a critical problem in various domains, including studying the impact of interventions on COVID-19 transmission, child health, and chemotherapy effects. However, traditional supervised learning methods face challenges, such as missing interventions and confounding factors. This paper introduces a framework for estimating CATEs with structured interventions, such as molecular graphs, food labels, and geographical regions. The contributions include a generalized Robinson decomposition (GRD) for vectorized treatments, a quasi-oracle convergence guarantee, a structured intervention network (SIN) algorithm, evaluation metrics for structured treatments, and experimental results showing the superior performance of SIN compared to previous approaches.
