Safety is crucial when deploying learning or control algorithms in real-world systems, especially in safety-critical physical systems where violating constraints can lead to irreparable damage. However, there is a lack of systematic and principled treatments for safety-critical learning and control problems. Existing strategies are either overly conservative or only guarantee near-constraint violation tolerance. Moreover, these strategies often suffer from high computational and data complexity. To fill these research gaps, this paper proposes a safe differentiable programming framework that systematically handles different types of constraints, provides provable safety and accuracy guarantees, enables learning of unknown aspects of constrained decision-making systems, and can be integrated into differentiable programming frameworks for efficient solution of large-scale safe learning and control tasks.
