This paper introduces a novel linear transform called deformable butterfly (DeBut) that overcomes the limitations of existing methods by allowing for adaptive input-output dimensions and non-power-of-two constructions. DeBut chains can be used as substitutes for both convolutional (CONV) and fully connected (FC) layers, providing a flexible tradeoff between the number of parameters and representation power. The DeBut linear transform is proposed for the first time in this work, and its use in deep neural networks (DNNs) is showcased to provoke further insights in the field.
