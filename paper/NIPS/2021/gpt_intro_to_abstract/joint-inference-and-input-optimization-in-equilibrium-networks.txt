This paper introduces the use of implicit layer models in the context of input optimization routines. By combining the optimization fixed-point iteration with the forward DEQ fixed-point iteration in a single "augmented" DEQ model, the authors demonstrate faster performance in both inference and optimization procedures. The proposed approach is applied to various tasks, including training generative models, solving inverse problems, adversarial training, and gradient-based meta-learning. The results show significant speed improvements compared to a more naive inner/outer optimization approach, indicating new potential applications for optimization with implicit models.
