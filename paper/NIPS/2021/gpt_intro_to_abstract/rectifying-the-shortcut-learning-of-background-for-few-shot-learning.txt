This paper introduces the concept of Few-Shot Learning (FSL), which aims to learn from limited data by leveraging prior knowledge. The category gap between training and evaluation is a challenge in FSL, as the learned knowledge may not be applicable to novel categories. The paper identifies image background as a harmful source of knowledge for FSL, due to spurious correlations between background and category. To address this issue, the paper proposes a novel framework called COSOC, which extracts the foreground of images using shared patterns among images. This framework improves the evaluation performance of FSL tasks by focusing on foreground objects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Overall, this paper contributes to understanding the role of image foreground and background in FSL and provides a solution to mitigate the negative impact of background knowledge.
