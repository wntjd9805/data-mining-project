In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach to propagation-based learning in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) by combining symbolic and connectionist methods. We utilize the Holographic Reduced Representation (HRR) approach, which allows vectors to have symbolic meaning and supports the construction of statements. However, back-propagation through HRR operations is not effective in practice. Our goal is to find conditions for successful back-propagation based learning with HRR and provide evidence of its potential for neuro-symbolic architectures. We focus on eXtreme Multi-Label (XML) classification tasks as our application area and show how HRRs can be used to improve the performance of deep extreme multi-label models. Our experiments demonstrate the reduction in model size, training time, and maintenance of accuracy.
