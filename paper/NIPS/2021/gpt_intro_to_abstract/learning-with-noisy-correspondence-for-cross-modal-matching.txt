This paper introduces the problem of noisy correspondence in cross-modal matching and proposes a novel method, called Noisy Correspondence Rectifier (NCR), to address this problem. The noisy correspondence refers to the alignment errors in paired data, which can significantly degrade the performance of cross-modal matching methods. NCR utilizes the memorization effect of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to partition the data into noisy and clean subsets. It then employs an adaptive prediction function for label rectifying and proposes a triplet loss for robust cross-modal matching. Experimental results on image-text matching tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of NCR in handling noisy correspondence.
