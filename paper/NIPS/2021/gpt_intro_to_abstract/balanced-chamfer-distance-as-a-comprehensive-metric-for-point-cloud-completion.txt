The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the growing popularity of point cloud as a 3D representation and the importance of a proper similarity measure between two point clouds. The Chamfer Distance (CD) and Earth Moverâ€™s Distance (EMD) metrics are commonly used but have their limitations. This paper proposes a new similarity measure called Density-aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) to address these challenges. DCD is derived from CD but is more sensitive to distribution quality and better at capturing details. Experimental results demonstrate that DCD provides a more consistent and reliable evaluation compared to CD and EMD, and it shows promise as a loss function for point cloud completion tasks.
