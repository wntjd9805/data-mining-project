Understanding the progression of diseases is crucial for effectively monitoring, diagnosing, and predicting patients' health. Disease progression modeling analyzes longitudinal data to capture common and individual-specific progression patterns. However, constructing models that are both flexible enough to account for disease heterogeneity and interpretable enough to derive practical conclusions is a challenge. In this paper, we review models that address time and space variability in patients' trajectories to explore the trade-off between flexibility and interpretability. We then propose a semi-parametric method using a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) to learn the Riemannian metric of Disease Course Mapping (DCM) models, which allows for the inter-variability of patient trajectories. We validate our method on synthetic data and a real dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting biomarker progression. We also discuss limitations and potential future research directions.
