Object pose estimation is an important computer vision task with applications in robotics, human-object interaction, and augmented reality. Previous work in this area has focused on two approaches: classic instance-level object pose estimation, which assumes exact CAD models for all object instances, and category-level object pose estimation, which defines a category-level reference frame and can generalize to unseen object instances. Category-level pose estimation requires a larger amount of annotated data, but obtaining such data is expensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, self-supervised methods that do not require pose annotations are needed. However, designing self-supervised methods for category-level pose estimation is challenging, especially when no CAD models or annotations are available. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised system that uses an SE(3)-invariant network for shape reconstruction and an SE(3)-equivariant network for pose estimation, allowing the emergence of a category-level reference frame during training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in accurate 6D pose estimation for both synthetic and real-world datasets.
