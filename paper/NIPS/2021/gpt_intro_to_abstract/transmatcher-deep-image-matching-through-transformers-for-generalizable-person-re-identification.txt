The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the Transformer, a neural network based on attention mechanisms that has shown success in natural language processing and is now being explored for computer vision tasks. The authors investigate the possibility of using Transformers for image matching and metric learning, specifically in the context of person re-identification. They introduce the TransMatcher, a simplified decoder design that improves the effectiveness and efficiency of image matching. The contributions of the paper include evaluating the generalizability of Transformers for image matching, proposing the TransMatcher model, and demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on popular datasets for person re-identification.
