Understanding causal relationships is crucial for human reasoning and artificial intelligence. This paper focuses on the problem of learning causal relationships between latent variables, which is closely related to learning causal representations. The paper highlights the importance of causal graphical models and discusses their limitations in identifying latent variables. The paper proposes a modular approach for learning the latent causal graph and introduces algorithms for reconstructing the graph and learning the latent distribution. The contributions of the paper include providing conditions for identifiability, analyzing the reconstruction of the bipartite graph, developing an efficient algorithm for learning the latent distribution, and implementing the algorithms in a pipeline for learning the full causal graph. The paper also discusses related work, emphasizes the optimistic approach towards learning causal relationships, and mentions the implementation of mixture oracles using clustering algorithms. The practical applications and potential societal impacts of latent variable models are discussed, emphasizing the importance of safeguarding protected data.
