Modelling interacting dynamical systems with neural networks has gained significant interest due to its potential to learn long-term behaviors directly from observations. Many of these systems consist of objects in physical space, such as pedestrians in a traffic scene or colliding subatomic particles. These systems can be represented as geometric graphs, where nodes describe the physical coordinates of the objects. Existing learning algorithms for dynamical systems assume an arbitrary global coordinate system, but this paper argues that taking into account the relative nature of dynamics is crucial for accurate modeling. Inspired by the concept of Galilean invariance, the paper focuses on inducing roto-translation invariance in interacting dynamical systems and their geometric graphs to address the challenges posed by symmetries and non-stationarity. The paper proposes a novel methodology that utilizes local coordinate frames to achieve roto-translation invariance and equivariance. The contributions include the introduction of canonicalized roto-translated local coordinate frames, roto-translation invariant edge prediction, and roto-translation equivariant trajectory forecasting. The proposed method is evaluated through experiments on various scenarios.
