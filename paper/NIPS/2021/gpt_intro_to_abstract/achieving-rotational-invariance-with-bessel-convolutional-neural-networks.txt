Deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are powerful tools for image analysis and constantly upgraded for better performance. While CNNs achieve translation invariance, obtaining rotational invariance is more challenging and relevant for applications such as medical imaging or satellite imaging. Previous works propose solutions for rotational invariance in CNNs, but many only improve robustness to rotations without guarantees on invariance or handle a limited set of rotation angles. This paper introduces Bessel-Convolutional Neural Networks (B-CNNs), which use Bessel functions to build a representation of images adapted for rotations. The rotational equivariance of B-CNNs can lead to rotational invariance with the right architecture. The paper proceeds to formally define the problem, discuss related works, present the B-CNN method and experiments, and conclude with a discussion of future works.
