During the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a growing need for computer-based personalized education (CBPE) on Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices to facilitate remote learning. However, traditional machine teaching (MT) techniques are not suitable for real-time interaction and on-device training, making them prohibitive for IoT devices. In this paper, we propose an iterative machine teaching (IMT) algorithm called Locality Sensitive Teaching (LST) that addresses these limitations. LST leverages hash tables to enable efficient sampling of teaching examples, improving time and energy efficiency. We demonstrate through theoretical and empirical analysis that LST achieves the same or even better teachability compared to IMT. Furthermore, we present a system design that optimizes LST for integrated CPU-GPU SoC platforms, leading to significant speedups and energy savings on IoT devices. In real-world teaching scenarios, LST achieves exponential teachability and outperforms IMT with speedups up to 425.12Ã— and energy savings of 99.76%.
