Sparse tensor principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical primitive that combines sparse PCA and tensor PCA. In this paper, we are given a tensor YYY consisting of multi-linear measurements and our goal is to estimate the structured unit vector x. We enforce sparsity on x, where the support of x is limited to a size of at most k. The model can be extended to include multiple spikes. This work provides a unified framework to study the computational and statistical aspects of sparse PCA and tensor PCA, allowing for a better understanding of the computational phenomena involved. The paper presents an algorithm that outperforms known tensor algorithms for highly sparse signal vectors and also provides a lower bound against low-degree polynomials, providing insights into the interactions between the parameters n, k, and p.
