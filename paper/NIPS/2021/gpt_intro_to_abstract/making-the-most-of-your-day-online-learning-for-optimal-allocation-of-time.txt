This paper addresses the trade-off faced by individuals or systems that have a unique resource which can be allocated to tasks or clients for a certain duration. Allocating the resource has a cost but also generates rewards, which can be unknown and random. The ideal request would be short in duration and high in reward, but such requests may be rare. The paper explores the trade-offs between accepting only profitable requests and accepting every request, as well as the learning phase involved in determining the net reward of a request. The paper introduces a model for an agent seeking to optimize their income by accepting or rejecting task proposals based on their expected duration and reward. The agent's policies are evaluated based on their expected regret compared to an optimal policy. The paper presents a quasi-optimal policy based on a profitability threshold, as well as algorithms for cases where the reward function is known or estimated. The algorithms are evaluated with toy examples, and the proofs are provided in the Appendix.
