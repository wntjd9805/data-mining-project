Deep neural networks have shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) in various problem domains. This paper explores the use of implicit neural representations with periodic activation functions for structural topology optimization, which is a challenging inverse elasticity problem widely used in engineering. The authors propose a self-supervised, fully mesh-free method based on implicit neural representations and introduce a displacement network and a density network to solve the forward problem and learn optimal material distributions. They use Monte Carlo sampling to address the nonlinear nature of implicit neural representations and introduce concepts from finite element analysis-based topology optimization methods to stabilize the training process. The method is evaluated on standard topology optimization problems and demonstrates comparable performance to state-of-the-art mesh-based solvers. The authors also show the potential for self-supervised learning of continuous solution spaces using this approach.
