Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely used in various fields, including robotics, to solve complex problems. However, RL still faces challenges when it comes to realistic settings that involve interaction with multiple objects or destinations. In this paper, we propose the use of Goal-Aware Cross-Entropy (GACE) loss and Goal-Discriminative Attention Networks (GDAN) for multi-target tasks in reinforcement learning. These methods aim to enable semantic understanding of goals and improve sample-efficiency and generalization. We also introduce visual navigation and robot arm manipulation tasks as benchmarks for multi-target task experiments. Our proposed method achieves superior performance in terms of success ratio, sample-efficiency, and generalization compared to baseline methods. We provide the benchmarks and implementation of our method for further research.
