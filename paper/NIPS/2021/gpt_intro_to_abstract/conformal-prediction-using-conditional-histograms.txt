This paper addresses the problem of predicting a response variable given a set of features, utilizing machine learning algorithms. The goal is to construct prediction intervals that satisfy three criteria: finite-sample marginal coverage, approximately conditional coverage, and narrowness. The authors propose a solution using conformal inference, which converts the output of a black-box model into prediction intervals. They introduce a method called conformal histogram regression (CHR), which approximates the desired intervals using a histogram approximation of the unknown distribution. The effectiveness of CHR is demonstrated through a comparison with conformalized quantile regression (CQR) in an example with toy data.
