Undesirable features, which are irrelevant to a target task, often appear in training data, leading to biased predictions and poor generalization. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are highly susceptible to capturing these undesirable features due to their high capacity. Previous research has explored using out-of-distribution (OOD) data to mitigate this bias, but existing methods lack flexibility and can still entangle desirable and undesirable features. In this paper, we propose a task-agnostic and feature-level calibration method called TAUFE, which explicitly deactivates undesirable features in OOD examples. TAUFE operates at the penultimate layer of the network, allowing it to be applied to various downstream tasks. Our experimental results on image classification, bounding box regression, and weakly supervised object localization demonstrate the effectiveness of TAUFE in removing undesirable features and outperforming existing methods. Our contributions include the development of TAUFE as a simple but effective method, insights into the differential effects of feature-level and softmax-level calibration, and validation of TAUFE's task-agnostic nature and performance advantage.
