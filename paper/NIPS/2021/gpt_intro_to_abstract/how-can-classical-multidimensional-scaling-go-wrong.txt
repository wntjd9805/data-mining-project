This paper introduces multidimensional scaling (MDS), a technique for embedding data into Euclidean space based on pairwise dissimilarities. MDS has been widely used in various applications including data visualization, network analysis, and bioinformatics. The paper focuses on two main objective functions associated with MDS, namely STRESS and STRAIN. The classical MDS algorithm (cMDS) is commonly used due to its speed and ability to scale to large matrices. However, the point set produced by cMDS may not be the closest to the input dissimilarity matrix under certain objective functions. The paper explores the theoretical and practical differences between optimizing for STRESS and STRAIN, and proposes a new lower bound solution that outperforms cMDS in the presence of noisy or missing data. The main contributions of the paper include a decomposition of error in the embedding and an efficiently computable algorithm for improved solutions.
