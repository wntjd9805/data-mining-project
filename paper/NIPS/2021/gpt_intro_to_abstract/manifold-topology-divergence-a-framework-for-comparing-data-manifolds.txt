Geometric perspective in working with data distributions has been widely explored in machine learning. The development of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has greatly improved the reconstruction of data from limited observations. However, evaluating the quality and diversity of generated samples remains a challenge. The Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) is commonly used for GAN evaluation, but it is limited to 2D images and biased in certain cases. In this paper, we propose a new topology-based measure, Cross-Barcode(P, Q), for comparing two manifolds approximated by point clouds. We also introduce the Manifold Topology Divergence (MTop-Div) as a measure for comparing data manifolds. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MTop-Div in evaluating GANs across different domains and compare it with seven established evaluation methods. Additionally, we address scalability issues in Topological Data Analysis (TDA) and conduct MTop-Div calculations on large datasets.
