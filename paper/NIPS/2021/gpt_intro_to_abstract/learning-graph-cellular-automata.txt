This paper focuses on graph cellular automata (GCA), a generalised version of cellular automata (CA) that allows cells to have an arbitrary and variable number of neighbours. The authors draw a parallel between graph neural networks (GNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and propose a framework called Graph Neural Cellular Automata (GNCA) to learn a desired GCA transition rule. They present a general-purpose architecture for GNCA that can represent any arbitrary GCA with finite and discrete state space and discuss its expressive power for continuous state spaces. The authors also demonstrate the applicability of GNCA to various problems, including Voronoi GCA with binary states, the Boids algorithm for simulating bird flocking behavior, and learning GNCA in continuous state spaces. The practical implications of this work lie in utilizing GNNs to model GCA on graphs, allowing for the discovery of unknown rules and enabling emergent and distributed computation in complex and coordinated systems.
