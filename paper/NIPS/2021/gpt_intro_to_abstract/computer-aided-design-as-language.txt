This paper introduces the concept of using machine learning, specifically deep learning and the Transformer model, to automate predictable design tasks in Computer-Aided Design (CAD). The paper discusses the importance of sketches in mechanical CAD and the constraints that define their geometric entities. The similarities between sketch construction and natural language modeling are explored, highlighting the potential of machine learning in generating sketches. The authors propose a method for describing structured objects using Protocol Buffers and techniques for capturing distributions of serialized objects. They also present a large dataset of parametric CAD sketches and validate their generative models, demonstrating the scalability of their approach.
