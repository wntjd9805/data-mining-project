This paper introduces a new framework called multi-pass dual learning (MPDL) for stylized dialogue generation. The MPDL framework leverages unlabeled data and introduces two discriminators to evaluate the quality of the generated data. The authors conduct experiments on benchmarks of formal and Shakespearean response generation and achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of automatic evaluation and manual judgment. The contributions of this work include the proposal of the MPDL framework, the introduction of discriminators in dual learning, the creation of a new dataset, and the empirical verification of MPDL's effectiveness.
