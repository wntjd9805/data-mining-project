This paper addresses the problem of black-box optimization with an unknown objective function. The objective function can only be accessed through a noisy oracle, and the goal is to approach the maximizer of the function through a sequence of query points. The classical exploration-exploitation tradeoff in online learning is present in this problem. Gaussian process models are commonly used to model the unknown function, particularly in Bayesian optimization. The GP-UCB algorithm is a popular approach that constructs a proxy of the function using the upper confidence bound concept. While GP-UCB algorithms have good empirical performance, their regret guarantees and computational complexity can be improved. This paper introduces a new algorithm called GP-ThreDS that uses domain shrinking to focus queries on high-performing regions and reduce computational complexity. GP-ThreDS achieves a regret upper bound that matches the lower bound and reduces the computational complexity from O(T^2d+3) to O(T^4).
