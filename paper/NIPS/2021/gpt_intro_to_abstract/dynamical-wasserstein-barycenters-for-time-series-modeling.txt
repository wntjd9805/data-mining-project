We address the problem of estimating the dynamically evolving state of a system from time-series data by considering a hybrid of continuous and discrete state representation approaches. We introduce a displacement-interpolation model for time series, where the data-generating distribution is given by the weighted Wasserstein barycenter of a set of pure-state emission distributions and a time-varying state vector. We propose a simplex-valued random walk to model the system state and exploit the Riemannian structure of Gaussian distributions under the Wasserstein distance for parameter estimation. Our method is evaluated on human activity data, demonstrating its ability to accurately capture both stationary and transition dynamics.
