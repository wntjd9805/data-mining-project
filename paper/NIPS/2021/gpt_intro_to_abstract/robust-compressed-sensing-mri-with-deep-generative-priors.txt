Compressed sensing has been successful in reducing the number of measurements required for imaging inverse problems, particularly in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, sparsity-based methods have limitations in terms of achievable acceleration rates. Deep learning techniques, on the other hand, have been used as data-driven reconstruction methods for inverse problems. This paper focuses on deep learning inversion techniques based on distribution learning, which are trained without reference to measurements and easily adapt to changes in the measurement process. The paper introduces a score-based generative model for MR images and demonstrates its effectiveness in reconstructing under-sampled MRI data. The proposed method achieves competitive performance compared to end-to-end deep learning methods when test data are within the training distribution and shows robustness to out-of-distribution shifts. The paper also discusses the ability of the method to obtain multiple samples from the posterior, allowing for uncertainty quantification in the reconstruction. The main results are summarized in Figure 1.
