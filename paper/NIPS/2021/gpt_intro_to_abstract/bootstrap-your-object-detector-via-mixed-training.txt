Object detection in computer vision is a challenging task that involves locating objects and classifying them in images. Previous works have focused on improving detection frameworks, network architectures, data augmentation strategies, label assignment, and training losses. However, few works have explored alternative training methods. In this paper, we propose a new training paradigm called MixTraining that utilizes a mixed augmentation strategy and mixed training targets to enhance object detection performance. We observe that different images may require different magnitudes of augmentation, and strong augmentations can be helpful only in specific cases. We also address the issue of noisy or incomplete human annotations by introducing pseudo boxes generated by an online detector. Our experiments show that MixTraining significantly improves the performance of leading object detectors without introducing additional computational or model parameters at inference time.
