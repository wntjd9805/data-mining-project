Image classification is a crucial task in computer vision, particularly in the advancement of convolution neural networks (CNNs). While much research has focused on object classification, scene classification poses additional challenges due to the complexity and distributed nature of scene characteristics. Existing methods for scene classification often extract and aggregate unspecified or specific regions independently of the main CNN backbone, resulting in incompatibility issues and increased computational consumption. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to understanding scene images and CNN models for scene classification by focusing on the region consisting of pixels with high aggregated activation values. We observe that the characteristics of CNNs differ between scene and object classification, and these differences align with the properties of scene images. We also find that certain training schemes can drive the development of larger focus areas in the corresponding CNN model, raising questions about optimizing training strategies to consider scene characteristics. To leverage the advantages of scene characteristics, we introduce a tailored loss and learning scheme to inspire CNN models to focus on more regions. This is achieved by erasing already activated regions in the images and requiring consistent outputs, enabling the CNN models themselves to expand the focus area through optimization. Our method employs pairwise consistency in an adversarial learning mechanism, integrating unconstrained exploration with modified images and the original image branch, resulting in comprehensive information extraction. Experimental results on the Places365 dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its ability to explore larger focus areas in CNNs, aligning with the characteristics of scene images. Additionally, evaluations on ImageNet reveal insights into the specific working mechanism designed for scene images.
