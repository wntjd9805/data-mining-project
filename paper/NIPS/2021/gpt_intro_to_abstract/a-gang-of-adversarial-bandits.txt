Multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms have gained significant attention in machine learning and related fields due to their practical and theoretical importance. These algorithms aim to find the best option (or arm) within a given set by sequentially exploring the environment and receiving feedback after each exploration. In this paper, we focus on the problem of multiple MAB problems that are interconnected by an interaction graph. We specifically look at the application of online recommendation systems, where each user is associated with a MAB problem, and the graph represents the social network among users. We propose two novel algorithms, GABA-I and GABA-II, which exploit the network structure and show improved regret bounds compared to running standard MAB independently on each user. Our algorithms leverage the principle of network homophily and use a randomized sparsification technique to achieve efficient predictions. Theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our proposed algorithms.
