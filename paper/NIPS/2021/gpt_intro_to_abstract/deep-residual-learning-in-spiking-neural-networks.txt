This paper introduces the concept of Spiking ResNet, a deep spiking neural network inspired by the residual structure in artificial neural networks (ANNs). The authors propose a new model called Spike-Element-Wise (SEW) ResNet to address the limitations of Spiking ResNet, including inapplicability to all neuron models and the problem of vanishing/exploding gradients. They demonstrate the effectiveness of SEW ResNet through experiments on static and neuromorphic datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art directly trained spiking neural networks in terms of accuracy and time-steps. This research contributes to the exploration of deep spiking neural networks and presents the first investigation of directly trained SNNs with more than 100 layers.
