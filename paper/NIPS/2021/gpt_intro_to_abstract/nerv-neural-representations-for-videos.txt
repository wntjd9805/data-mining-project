This paper introduces NeRV, a novel image-wise implicit representation for videos. NeRV represents a video as a neural network, converting video encoding to model fitting and video decoding as a simple feedforward operation. Compared to pixel-wise implicit representations, NeRV outputs the whole image and shows great efficiency, improving the encoding speed by 25× to 70× and the decoding speed by 38× to 132×, while achieving better video quality. NeRV also allows for converting the video compression problem to a model compression problem, enabling the use of standard model compression tools and achieving comparable performance with conventional video compression methods. Additionally, NeRV shows promising results in other tasks such as video denoising, outperforming traditional hand-crafted denoising algorithms and ConvNets-based denoising methods.
