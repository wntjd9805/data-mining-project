Due to the success of deep learning in image, audio, and text data domains, there has been growing research interest in applying deep learning to problems with tabular data. Tabular data, commonly found in industrial applications and machine learning competitions, consists of heterogeneous feature vectors. The use of deep learning for tabular data is appealing as it allows for the construction of multi-modal pipelines, combining tabular data with other DL-friendly data such as images and audio. However, the lack of established benchmarks and the use of different datasets for evaluation in existing papers hinder the comparison of proposed DL models. Additionally, the field lacks simple and reliable solutions that provide competitive and stable performance across tasks. To address these challenges, this paper reviews recent developments in the field and proposes two simple models inspired by well-known architectures from other domains - a ResNet-like architecture and FT-Transformer. These models are compared to existing solutions on a diverse set of tasks, revealing the ResNet-like model as an effective baseline and FT-Transformer as a powerful solution for tabular data. However, there is still no universally superior solution when compared to GBDT. The contributions of this paper include a thorough evaluation of main tabular DL models, the introduction of the ResNet-like architecture as a baseline, the introduction of FT-Transformer as a powerful solution, and the observation that no universally superior solution exists between GBDT and deep models.
