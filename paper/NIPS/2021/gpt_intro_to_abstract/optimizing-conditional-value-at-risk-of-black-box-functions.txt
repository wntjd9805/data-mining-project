In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) of a black-box function. While previous work has focused on optimizing Value-at-Risk (VaR), optimizing CVaR allows for a more accurate evaluation of risk, particularly in scenarios where the extreme tails of the random variable have significant consequences. We propose two computationally efficient algorithms, CVaR optimization with upper confidence bound (CV-UCB) and CVaR optimization with Thompson sampling (CV-TS), both of which provide theoretical performance guarantees. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms through empirical evaluation on synthetic benchmark functions, a yacht optimization problem, portfolio optimization, and a simulated robot task.
