Blind source separation is a challenging problem in signal processing, with the goal of recovering multiple intrinsic components from their mixture. In computer vision, image reflection separation is a common scenario when capturing images through a transparent medium. This mixture of transmitted scene and reflection can interfere with vision-oriented algorithms, but may also contain valuable information. This paper proposes a transmission-reflection decomposition technique to effectively separate these components. The captured image is modeled as a linear combination of a transmission layer and a reflection, and various schemes have been developed to solve the decomposition problem. However, the additive property of the image has been largely overlooked in the literature. This paper introduces a general interactive dual-stream strategy, called Your Trash is My Treasure (YTMT), to exchange information between deep features of dual-stream networks. The proposed strategy mitigates information loss and dead ReLU problems, and accelerates the training process. Ablation studies and experimental results on SIRS datasets demonstrate the efficacy of YTMT, surpassing other state-of-the-art alternatives.
