This paper introduces the problem of keyword search in graphs with missing information, which is a common scenario in real-world graphs. The existing methods for graph keyword search assume complete graph data and cannot provide accurate results in the presence of missing edges and attributes. The authors propose a novel auto-encoder and GNN-based model called KS-GNN to address this problem. KS-GNN utilizes the graph neural network to obtain representative node embeddings that capture the keyword information, while also considering the graph structure, keyword distribution, and keyword frequency. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model compared to baseline methods. This work contributes to the field by being the first to explore keyword search in incomplete graphs and providing a solution that outperforms existing approaches.
