This paper introduces the LADDER approach, a novel method for performing Bayesian optimization (BO) over combinatorial spaces in the small-data setting. The authors identify the limitations of the Na√Øve latent space BO approach and propose a principled Gaussian process-based approach to improve surrogate modeling by combining structural information with the learned latent space representation using a structure-coupled kernel. Experimental results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of LADDER compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code and data for LADDER are available on the GitHub repository.
