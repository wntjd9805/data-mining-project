Coresets and approximation algorithms for k-clustering problems, specifically k-MEANS and (k, z)-CLUSTERING, are explored in the context of data sets with missing values. Dealing with missing values is a fundamental challenge in data science, and while data imputation is a popular method, it often requires prior knowledge or statistical assumptions. In contrast, the proposed worst-case approach does not depend on prior knowledge. The focus is on clustering using available coordinates, which presents computational challenges due to the violation of the triangle inequality. Previous work has studied clustering with missing values, but only a few results are known. The paper presents a near-linear time construction of coresets for k-MEANS with missing values, offering efficient approximation schemes. The results are supported by theoretical analysis and experiments on real and synthetic datasets. Additionally, a near-linear time PTAS for k-MEANS with missing values is derived from the proposed coreset construction. The overall approach is based on the importance sampling framework and extends it to handle missing values. The coreset construction for k-CENTER with missing values is achieved by constructing restricted data sets without any missing values and using a classical coreset construction for k-CENTER. The authors also propose a dynamic implementation of Gonzalez's algorithm to improve performance.
