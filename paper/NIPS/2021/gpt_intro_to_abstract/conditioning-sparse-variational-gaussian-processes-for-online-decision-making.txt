This paper introduces Online Variational Conditioning (OVC), a method to efficiently condition variational Gaussian processes (SVGPs) on new data without re-optimizing the variational posterior. OVC allows SVGPs to update their posterior distribution in response to new data, making them suitable for online decision-making. The authors provide stable inducing point initialization for SVGPs and enable the inducing points and variational parameters to update with the new data. This method enhances the effectiveness of SVGPs in applications such as black-box optimization, controlling dynamical systems, and active learning. The limitations and broader impacts of the work are discussed, and the code is available for reference.
