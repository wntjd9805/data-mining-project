In this paper, we propose a general optimization procedure for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (RL) in order to generate gate and depth-efficient quantum circuits. We utilize curriculum learning to adapt the complexity of the learning problem based on the algorithm's performance. We apply our approach to the problem of finding the ground state energy of the LiH molecule and achieve chemical accuracy while maintaining a low-depth quantum circuit and demonstrating state-of-the-art gate efficiency. Our method has potential applications beyond ground state estimation, as it can be applied to any variational-circuit-based algorithm. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related works, Section 3 introduces our method with assumptions about the exact ground state energy, and Section 4 presents results assuming access to the exact energy. Finally, Section 5 provides results for the full method using a rough proxy of energy obtained with classical methods, and we conclude the paper with a discussion of future directions.
