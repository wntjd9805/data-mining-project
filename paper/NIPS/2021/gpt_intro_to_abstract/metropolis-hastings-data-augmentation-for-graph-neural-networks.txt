Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in representation learning on graph-structured data, but they often suffer from weak generalization due to the small and sparsely labeled graph datasets. Data augmentation has been used as a remedy to improve generalization, but designing effective and label-preserving augmentation for individual graph samples is challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Metropolis-Hastings Data Augmentation (MH-Aug) that draws augmented graphs from a target distribution with desired strength and diversity. We adopt the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for sampling and also incorporate consistency training for unlabeled data. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MH-Aug in improving the performance of graph neural networks. Our contributions include proposing a new perspective on data augmentation for graph-structured data, theoretical and experimental proof of the effectiveness of MH-Aug, and a semi-supervised learning strategy using sequentially generated samples.
