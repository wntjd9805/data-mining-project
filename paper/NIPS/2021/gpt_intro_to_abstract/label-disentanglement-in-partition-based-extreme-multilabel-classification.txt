The eXtreme Multi-label Classification (XMC) task involves finding relevant labels from a large candidate label space, which can be in the order of millions or more. This problem is important in both academia and industry, with applications such as tagging web pages, product recommendation, and keyword advertising. The challenge lies in the scalability of the data and the sparsity of the labels. Many existing XMC algorithms use a partition-based approach to address these challenges. However, partitioning labels into mutually-exclusive clusters may not be ideal for some cases where labels have complex and multi-modal semantics. In this paper, we propose a novel assignment-based framework that allows label disentanglement and optimizes the label assignment using the current matching models. Our approach is plug-and-play and can be applied to existing partition-based methods, yielding consistent improvements over two leading methods.
