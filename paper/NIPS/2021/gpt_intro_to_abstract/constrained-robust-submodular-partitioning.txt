The problem of partitioning a given set into multiple blocks with no shared items arises in various real-world scenarios and machine learning applications. This paper explores the use of submodular functions, a type of set function that captures the diversity of a set, to measure the utility of the blocks. The objective is to maximize the submodular utility function for each block, encouraging representativeness of the entire set. The paper focuses on the robust submodular partitioning problem, which aims to maximize the minimum value among the blocks according to the submodular function. Several algorithmic approaches are proposed, including Min-Block Greedy and Round-Robin Greedy, under different constraints such as cardinality, matroids, and knapsack. The constraints greatly enhance the applicability of robust submodular partitioning in various applications, such as distributed training in machine learning, efficient information transfer over graphs, and ensuring reliability in device networks. The paper presents approximation bounds and running time analyses for the proposed algorithms.
