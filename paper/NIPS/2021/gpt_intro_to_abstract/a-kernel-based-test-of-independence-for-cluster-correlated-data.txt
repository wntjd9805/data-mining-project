In this paper, we aim to develop an approach for assessing the dependence between two multivariate variables in the presence of clustered correlation among observations. We propose a non-parametric kernel-based measure called the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), which can assess the generalized dependence between the variables without making assumptions about their distributions or the nature of the dependence. We extend the HSIC to cluster-correlated data and derive its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of independence. We also examine the behavior of the HSIC under the alternative hypothesis and establish the consistency of our test. Our simulation studies show that our proposed test controls type I error rates well and has higher statistical power compared to other methods. In an application to a longitudinal microbiome-metabolite dataset, our test identifies a larger number of significant associations between the overall microbiome composition and host metabolites, demonstrating its value in scientific studies.
