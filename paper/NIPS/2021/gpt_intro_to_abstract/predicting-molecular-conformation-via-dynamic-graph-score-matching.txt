Graph-based representations have become popular for various tasks in molecular science, but the 3D geometry or conformation of molecules is a more natural and intrinsic representation. However, determining the conformation of a molecule is challenging and computationally expensive. Machine learning approaches have shown promise in generating molecular conformations, but they often fail to capture long-range interactions between non-bonded atoms. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Graph Score Matching (DGSM) method for molecular conformation generation that dynamically constructs graph structures based on spatial proximity. This allows the model to capture both local and long-range interactions and improves performance compared to existing methods. We validate our approach through extensive experiments on standard conformation generation and property prediction tasks, as well as more challenging tasks such as protein sidechain conformation prediction and multi-molecular complex structure prediction.
