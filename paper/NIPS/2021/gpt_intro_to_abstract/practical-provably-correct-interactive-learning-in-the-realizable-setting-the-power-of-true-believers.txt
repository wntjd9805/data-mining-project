In this paper, the authors explore the field of interactive learning, where algorithms make decisions and update their behavior based on observed feedback. They discuss the increasing prevalence of interactive learning problems in various domains, such as A/B/n testing, active classification, and environmental monitoring. The paper focuses on two main algorithmic paradigms: agnostic algorithms, which are robust to model misspecification and noise, and realizability-based algorithms, which leverage the structure of the model class for faster learning. The authors present negative results that highlight the significant cost of robustness for agnostic algorithms and propose a general framework for developing efficient and sample-efficient algorithms for generic function classes in the realizable setting. They also demonstrate empirical evidence of the effectiveness and practicality of their approach. The paper addresses three specific objectives: best arm identification, cumulative loss minimization, and active classification, and aims to achieve minimax optimality for each objective. The authors present their contributions, including a computationally efficient algorithm for best arm identification, a new algorithm for loss minimization that achieves a state-of-the-art regret bound, and a comparison between agnostic and realizability-based algorithms for active classification.
