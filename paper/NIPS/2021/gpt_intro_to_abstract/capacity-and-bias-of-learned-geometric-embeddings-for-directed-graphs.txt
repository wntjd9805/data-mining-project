Geometric embeddings, such as box embeddings, have been proposed as powerful alternatives to standard vector embedding models for representing asymmetric relationships in graph data. However, there are still open questions regarding the performance, theoretical representation, and empirical analysis of these embeddings. In this paper, we introduce a novel box embedding model that can effectively utilize both lower and higher dimensions, offering better performance than existing methods. We provide theoretical analysis of this approach and compare its representational capacity to other region-based embeddings. Additionally, we design a rigorous evaluation framework to compare the performance of different methods. Our experimental results show that geometric embedding models perform well in low dimensions and our proposed model outperforms other geometric embeddings in high dimensions. Furthermore, region-based embeddings excel in transitively-closed graphs.
