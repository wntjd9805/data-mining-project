This paper introduces the concept of submodular functions in combinatorial optimization and machine learning, highlighting their presence in various applications such as image segmentation, data subset selection, and document summarization. While strong polynomial time algorithms for general submodular minimization exist, they are often impractical in real-world scenarios. Therefore, the paper focuses on decomposable submodular function minimization (DSFM) and specifically explores cardinality-based DSFM. The authors present the first approximation algorithms for Card-DSFM, using a combinatorial approach that reduces the problem to a sparse graph cut problem. They develop new approximate reduction methods and prove bounds on the sparsity of reduced graphs. Their algorithm achieves fast runtime guarantees for finding approximate solutions to Card-DSFM and demonstrates significant practical improvements in image segmentation and hypergraph clustering experiments.
