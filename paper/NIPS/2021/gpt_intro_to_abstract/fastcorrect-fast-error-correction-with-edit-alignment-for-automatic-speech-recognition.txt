In recent years, error correction techniques have been widely used to refine the output sentences from automatic speech recognition (ASR) models for further word error rate (WER) reduction. However, autoregressive models, which have been commonly adopted for ASR error correction, suffer from slow inference speed and do not meet the latency requirements for online ASR services. Non-autoregressive (NAR) models, which can generate target sequences in parallel, have attracted attention in neural machine translation (NMT) but have not been successfully applied to ASR error correction. In this paper, we propose FastCorrect, a novel NAR error correction model designed specifically for ASR error correction. FastCorrect leverages edit alignment between the ASR output and the ground-truth sentence to guide the training process and achieve more effective error correction. Additionally, we construct a pseudo correction dataset using crawled text data to overcome the limitation of limited errors in ASR outputs. Experimental results demonstrate that FastCorrect significantly reduces inference latency compared to autoregressive models while achieving comparable accuracy and outperforms popular NAR models in machine translation and text edition.
