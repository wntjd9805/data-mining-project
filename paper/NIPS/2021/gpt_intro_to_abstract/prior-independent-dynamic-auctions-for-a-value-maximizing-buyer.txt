Automatic bidding has become a prevalent method for advertisers to purchase online advertising opportunities. This is due to the simplification of the interaction between advertisers and advertising platforms. However, the dynamic and evolving nature of the competitive landscape makes it difficult for advertisers to optimize their bids for each auction individually. To address this, automatic bidding products ask advertisers to provide high-level objectives and constraints, while the product bids on their behalf using prediction algorithms trained with large amounts of data. The emergence of automatic bidding products presents opportunities for novel auction mechanisms, as traditional mechanisms designed for utility-maximizing bidders may not perform well in this environment. This paper aims to design prior-independent dynamic auction mechanisms against automated bidders, with the main result being a novel mechanism achieving regret of ËœO(T 2/3) against a strategic automated bidder.
