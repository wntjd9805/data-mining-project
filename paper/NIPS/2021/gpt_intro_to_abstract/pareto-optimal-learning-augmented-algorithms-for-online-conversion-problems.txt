In this paper, we address the question of whether it is possible to design a Pareto-optimal learning-augmented online algorithm (LOA) for the online conversion problem. We introduce an online threshold-based algorithm (OTA) that unifies the design of 1-max-search and one-way trading. By incorporating predictions into OTA, we achieve bounded consistency and robustness. We also derive lower bounds for robustness-consistency trade-offs and show that our learning-augmented OTA achieves these lower bounds, making it Pareto-optimal. Additionally, we provide a sufficient condition for the design and analysis of LOA with a guaranteed generalized competitive ratio. We also present a novel approach to deriving lower bounds on the robustness-consistency trade-off. Our contributions are demonstrated and validated through numerical experiments based on real-world data tracking Bitcoin prices.
