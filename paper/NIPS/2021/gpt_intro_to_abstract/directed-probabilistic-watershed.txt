In recent years, machine learning has seen significant advancements due to the availability of large amounts of data and the increasing accessibility of powerful processing capacities. However, the acquisition of labeled data remains challenging in certain applications such as computer-aided diagnosis and drug discovery. Semi-supervised learning, a subfield of machine learning, aims to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data. Graph-based semi-supervised learning, which assigns labels to nodes in a network based on topology, has been applied in various domains. While most existing algorithms focus on undirected weighted graphs, directed graphs are common in many cases. This paper introduces the "Directed Probabilistic Watershed" (DProbWS), an extension of the transductive graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm Probabilistic Watershed (ProbWS), specifically designed for directed graphs. The paper presents the theoretical analysis, computational equivalences, and empirical performance of DProbWS, along with a comparison to other semi-supervised transductive methods.
