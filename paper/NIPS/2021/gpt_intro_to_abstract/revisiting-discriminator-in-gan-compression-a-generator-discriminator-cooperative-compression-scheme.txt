Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have gained popularity in image synthesis tasks but face challenges in terms of computational and memory requirements. Previous attempts to compress GANs using traditional model compression techniques have been unsuccessful. This paper introduces a generator-discriminator cooperative compression scheme (GCC) that addresses these challenges. GCC includes a pruned generator and a selective activation discriminator to maintain the Nash equilibrium. It also employs online collaborative distillation to improve the performance of the lightweight generator. Experimental results demonstrate that GCC effectively reduces computational costs while maintaining image translation performance. The contributions of GCC include revisiting the role of the discriminator, introducing selective activation and online collaborative distillation, and demonstrating the effectiveness and generality of the approach.
