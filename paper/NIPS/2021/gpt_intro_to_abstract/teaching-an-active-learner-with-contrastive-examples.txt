Active learning, which involves learners actively engaging in the learning process, has been successful in both education and machine learning. In machine learning, active learning has traditionally focused on the active instance labeling problem, where the learner selectively queries labels of data points to learn a concept. Recent research has explored richer interaction protocols, such as learning from feature feedback or demonstrations, but these assume adversarial or stochastic teachers, which may not be representative of real-world cooperative learning scenarios. In this paper, motivated by cooperative learning scenarios, we consider an interaction protocol between an active learner and a helpful teacher, where the teacher provides contrastive examples to guide the learning process. We focus on designing a teaching algorithm that provides informative contrastive examples to the learner, aiming to speed up the learning process. We explore the theoretical properties of the greedy teacher algorithm and demonstrate its power and limitations.
