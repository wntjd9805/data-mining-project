Auctions are widely used in various marketplaces, and the design of auctions with desirable properties is a crucial problem. Ensuring strategyproofness, where bidders are incentivized to truthfully share their valuations, is a common requirement. The Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism is both strategyproof and welfare-maximizing for maximizing total welfare, but the problem becomes more challenging when the goal is to maximize revenue. Previous work has focused on single-item or single-bidder scenarios, and there are limited results for multiple items and bidders. Recent approaches have used machine learning to approximate optimal auctions, but they primarily focus on revenue or welfare maximization. However, other goals, such as fairness or considering third-party effects, may be important in certain auction scenarios. This paper introduces PreferenceNet, an extension to RegretNet, that encodes socially desirable constraints from data and captures noisy human preferences. The authors conduct experiments and surveys to evaluate the effectiveness of PreferenceNet in capturing fairness constraints and matching the performance of standard approaches in different auction settings. They demonstrate the ability of PreferenceNet to capture nuanced human preferences in auction design.
