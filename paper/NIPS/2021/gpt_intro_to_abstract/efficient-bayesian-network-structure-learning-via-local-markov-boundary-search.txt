Learning the structure of a distribution in the form of a graphical model is a fundamental problem in statistical machine learning. In this paper, we focus on the structure learning problem for Bayesian networks (BNs) and analyze a polynomial time and sample complexity algorithm for learning the structure of BNs. Our main contributions include a new identifiability condition for DAG learning, finite-sample guarantees for a Markov boundary learning algorithm, and a proposed algorithm for learning an identifiable DAG. We also apply our results to the problem of learning polytrees and provide generalizations and extensions of our assumptions. Additionally, we highlight the limited theoretical work on the finite-sample properties of related algorithms and aim to fill this gap.
