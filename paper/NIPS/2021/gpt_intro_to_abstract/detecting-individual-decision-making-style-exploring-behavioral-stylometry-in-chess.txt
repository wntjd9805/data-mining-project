The advent of machine learning models that surpass human decision-making ability in complex domains has prompted the development of AI systems that can collaborate and interact effectively with humans. In order to achieve this goal, it is necessary to algorithmically characterize human behavior, specifically at an individual level. By detecting signatures of individual decision-making style, AI systems can better coordinate and adapt to individuals, pinpoint their strengths and areas for improvement, and shed light on the structure of decision-making in the domain. However, identifying individuals from their behavioral traces raises ethical concerns regarding privacy and generalization to high-stakes domains. In this paper, we focus on the problem of behavioral stylometry, specifically in the domain of chess, and present a transformer-based approach that achieves high accuracy in detecting individual decision-making style. The resulting embeddings reveal a structure of human style in chess, and we discuss the implications of these findings as well as the ethical consequences of identifying individuals from their behavioral data.
