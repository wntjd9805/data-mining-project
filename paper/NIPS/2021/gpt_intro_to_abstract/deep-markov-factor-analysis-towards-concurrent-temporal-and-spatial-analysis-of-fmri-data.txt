Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used in cognitive neuroscience to study brain structures and functional connectivity. However, analyzing functional connectivity from fMRI data can be challenging due to its high dimensional nature. Most traditional methods use region of interest (ROI)-based approaches, but these may result in a loss of information. Recently, probabilistic generative models have been proposed for factorizing fMRI data, but they do not capture temporal dynamics. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian model called deep Markov factor analysis (DMFA) that learns a deep generative Markovian prior to capture nonlinear temporal dynamics. We also incorporate a discrete latent for multimodal dynamical estimation and clustering. Our experiments demonstrate that DMFA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in uncovering clusters and predicting unseen data.
