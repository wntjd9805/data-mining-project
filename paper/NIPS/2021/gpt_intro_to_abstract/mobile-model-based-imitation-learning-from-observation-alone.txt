This paper introduces MobILE, a model-based framework for solving the Imitation Learning from Observation Alone (ILFO) problem. Unlike existing model-based approaches, MobILE learns the forward transition dynamics model and combines exploration and imitation through a bonus-based, optimistic distribution matching step. The paper presents theoretical results and experimental studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of systematic exploration and optimism in solving ILFO reliably and efficiently. Furthermore, the paper proves that incorporating optimism into the ILFO framework is beneficial both theoretically and empirically. The experimental results show that MobILE outperforms existing approaches in benchmark tasks.
