This paper introduces the concept of PragmatIc COmpression (PICO), a human-in-the-loop learning approach to data compression. Instead of optimizing compression models for a task-agnostic perceptual similarity objective, PICO optimizes for functional similarity by producing compressed images that induce users to take the same actions as they would with the original uncompressed images. The authors formulate compression as a human-in-the-loop learning problem, where a neural network encoder-decoder model is trained to generate compressed images based on user actions. Adversarial learning is used to define the loss function, and the PICO algorithm is validated through user studies on image tasks, showcasing significant improvements in compression efficiency compared to non-adaptive baseline methods.
