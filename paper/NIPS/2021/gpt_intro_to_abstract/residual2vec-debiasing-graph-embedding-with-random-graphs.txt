In this paper, we explore the implications of the friendship paradox, which is a sampling bias that arises in graph embedding. We discuss the use of random walks as the default sampling paradigm in graph embedding methods and raise the question of whether this bias is undesirable and how it can be debiased. We introduce the concept of graph embedding as a dense vector representation of a graph and discuss the common approach of generating synthetic "sentences" from a graph using random walks. We demonstrate that random walks have a strong preference towards visiting nodes with many neighbors, leading to an overrepresentation of certain nodes in the generated sentences. We show that word2vec, a widely used embedding method, has an implicit bias that can negate the friendship paradox bias. We propose a new framework called residual2vec that can further compensate for systematic biases in random walks. We evaluate the performance of residual2vec compared to conventional embedding methods in link prediction and community detection tasks, using a citation graph of 260k journals. We demonstrate that by removing the bias, residual2vec better captures the characteristics of the journals. The code for residual2vec is available on GitHub.
