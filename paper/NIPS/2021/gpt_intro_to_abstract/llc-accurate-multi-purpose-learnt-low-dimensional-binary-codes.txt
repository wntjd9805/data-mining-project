Embedding data in low-dimensional binary space is a long-standing machine learning problem that has gained significant interest in the computer vision domain. Low-dimensional binary codes have proven to be crucial in various large-scale machine learning applications, such as extreme classification and efficient retrieval settings. However, compressing information into binary codes while preserving relevant information is challenging. Traditional methods often relied on side-information and separate encoding of classes and instances. In this paper, we propose a method called Learning Low-dimensional binary Codes (LLC) that learns both class and instance codes using a given labeled multi-class dataset. LLC formulates the code learning problem as a low-dimensional binary embedding task and uses a two-phase approach to learn class codes first and then use them to learn instance codes. Our experiments on ImageNet-1K demonstrate that LLC achieves high accuracy in classification, captures semantic similarities between classes, and enables efficient retrieval and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. We also compare LLC's performance with existing methods in hashing-based retrieval and OOD detection, showing superior results. The contributions of this work include the LLC method, accurate and efficient classification using low-dimensional codes, improved performance in retrieval tasks, and sample-efficient OOD detection.
