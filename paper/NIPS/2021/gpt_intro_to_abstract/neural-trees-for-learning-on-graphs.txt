Graph-structured learning problems have become prominent in various fields, including biology, computer vision, computer graphics, and social networks. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as an effective approach for regression and classification over graphs. However, recent studies have highlighted limitations of existing GNN architectures, particularly in terms of expressivity and the ability to approximate G-invariant functions. This paper proposes a novel GNN architecture called Neural Tree, which operates on a tree-structured graph constructed from the input graph. The Neural Tree architecture is capable of approximating any G-compatible function and can be used for semi-supervised node classification. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Neural Trees over traditional GNNs in 3D scene graphs and citation networks, offering scalability even for large graphs with the help of a treewidth graph sub-sampling algorithm. The code for the proposed architecture is publicly available.
