This paper focuses on the problem of pure exploration in the context of misspecified linear bandits. The authors propose the first algorithm for Top-m identification in this setting and derive an upper bound on its sample complexity. They show that knowing an upper bound on the misspecification is necessary for achieving optimal sample complexity, and they evaluate their algorithm on synthetic problems and real datasets, demonstrating its competitive performance. The contributions of this paper include a lower bound on the sample complexity, the design of a novel algorithm, and an analysis that reveals adaptation to the amount of misspecification.
