General Recovery Inverse problems in various fields require the recovery of an unknown signal from its corrupted or compressed version. Existing models for the degradation process often lead to unstable solutions, necessitating the incorporation of additional knowledge of the signal. This has led to the development of regularization methods, including the plug-and-play priors (PnP) methodology, which uses denoisers to solve inverse problems. However, the lack of a clearly formulated regularization term corresponding to the denoiser poses a challenge in ensuring stability, requiring careful parameter tuning. To address this, the regularization by denoising (RED) framework presents an explicit Laplacian-based regularization that relies on a denoiser. While RED has demonstrated impressive recovery performance, some denoisers do not satisfy the required conditions, leading to a lack of justification for the method and the absence of convergence analysis. Therefore, both RED and PnP exhibit state-of-the-art empirical results without provable stability.
