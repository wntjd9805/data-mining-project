Density estimation is a fundamental challenge in machine learning, but most existing methods focus on learning the joint distribution of random variables. However, there is often a need to learn conditional probabilities, which provide the likelihood of an event given prior information. This paper introduces a method called Arbitrary Conditioning with Energy (ACE) that can assess any conditional distribution over any subset of random variables using a single model. ACE is designed to be simple and scalable, and it outperforms current methods for arbitrary conditional density estimation and data imputation. The paper also compares ACE to other existing approaches and highlights its advantages, including its ability to handle both continuous and discrete values and its lack of constraints on the parameterization of the energy function. The contributions of this work include the development of the first energy-based approach to arbitrary conditional density estimation, empirical demonstration of ACE's state-of-the-art performance, and the finding that a simple scheme can outperform prior approaches. The paper also briefly discusses related work in density estimation and missing data imputation.
