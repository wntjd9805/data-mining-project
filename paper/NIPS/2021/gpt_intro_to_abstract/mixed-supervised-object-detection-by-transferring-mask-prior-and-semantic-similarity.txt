Object detection has made significant advancements in recent years with the use of convolutional neural networks and large-scale fully-annotated detection datasets. However, fully supervised object detection requires time-consuming and labor-intensive annotations, limiting its applicability in real-world scenarios. Weakly supervised object detection methods have been proposed as an alternative, relying on unsupervised proposal generation strategies. However, these methods often struggle with accurate localization and distinguishing objects from distractors. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a new learning paradigm called Weak-SHot Object Detection (WSHOD) that transfers knowledge from fully-annotated base categories to weakly-annotated novel categories. The authors propose to transfer not only objectness but also mask prior and semantic similarity from the base categories to improve detection performance on novel categories. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed TraMaS method outperforms existing weakly supervised object detection methods.
