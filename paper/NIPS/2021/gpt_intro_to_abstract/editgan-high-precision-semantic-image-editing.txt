AI-driven image editing has the potential to revolutionize the work of photographers and content creators, enabling new levels of creativity and digital artistry. This paper introduces EditGAN, a GAN-based image editing framework that allows users to make high-precision semantic edits by modifying object part segmentations. Unlike existing methods, EditGAN requires minimal annotated training data and can be used interactively in real time. The framework achieves efficiency by learning editing vectors in the latent space, which can be directly applied to other images without additional optimization steps. Experimental results show that EditGAN outperforms baselines in terms of identity preservation, quality preservation, and target attribute accuracy, while requiring significantly less annotated training data. Furthermore, EditGAN can be applied to a wide range of images and works on both embedded and GAN-generated images. This makes EditGAN the first framework to offer precise, data-efficient, real-time image editing capabilities with composability and applicability across different image domains.
