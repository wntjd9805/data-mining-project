Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning task with various applications in anomaly detection, recommender systems, and cancer diagnosis. In this paper, we focus on studying k-median clustering in the sequential no-substitution setting, where data is observed sequentially and selected as cluster centers immediately after observation. We introduce a new algorithm, MUNSC, that achieves a constant approximation guarantee with a quasi-linear number of selected centers in a random stream order. Our guarantees are stronger and more general than previous works, and our algorithm can be extended to other clustering objectives. While our assumption of a random order may not always hold exactly, we expect our techniques to be foundational for future treatments of non-random and non-adversarial input orders.
