Video analysis is a crucial area of research in computer science, with various problems like action recognition, temporal action localization, video grounding, and video question answering. Temporal action localization (TAL) is particularly important, as it aims to identify the start and end points of action instances in untrimmed videos. Most TAL models are based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) consisting of a video encoder and a TAL head. However, the standard optimization process for TAL models often leads to suboptimal performance due to a task discrepancy problem. In this paper, we propose a low-fidelity (LoFi) video encoder optimization method specifically designed to improve TAL model training. Our method addresses the task discrepancy problem, achieving state-of-the-art performance and better efficiency/accuracy trade-off.
