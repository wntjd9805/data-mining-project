Understanding objects in computer vision has been a significant challenge, traditionally requiring large annotated datasets. However, unsupervised approaches utilizing self-supervision have emerged to eliminate the need for labels. While these methods have been successful in 2D image understanding, their application to 3D point clouds remains relatively unexplored. Additionally, recent advancements in 3D deep representation learning have shown promising results in shape auto-encoding but heavily rely on pre-aligned and object-centric datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel capsule network architecture called Canonical Capsules, which allows for unsupervised learning of 3D deep representations without the requirement for semantically aligned datasets. By leveraging capsule decomposition, we achieve a learned canonical frame of reference that facilitates more effective shape auto-encoding and unsupervised classification. Our experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in various tasks, including auto-encoding, canonicalization, and unsupervised classification of 3D point clouds.
