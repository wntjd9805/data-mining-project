This paper introduces the application of deep learning methods to aid in the solving of computationally challenging constrained optimization (CO) problems. It highlights the difficulty of learning the combinatorial structure of CO problems and the presence of multiple symmetric solutions, as well as the challenge of learning sub-optimal solutions due to time constraints and randomization techniques. The paper proposes a method for producing (exact or approximate) solutions to optimization problems that are more amenable to supervised learning tasks by introducing the problem of optimal dataset design. The authors present a tractable algorithm for generating datasets that improve the accuracy of trained models and provide state-of-the-art results on two optimization problems. This work has broader implications for the integration of CO in predictive and prescriptive analytics and for approximating solutions to physics constrained learning problems.
