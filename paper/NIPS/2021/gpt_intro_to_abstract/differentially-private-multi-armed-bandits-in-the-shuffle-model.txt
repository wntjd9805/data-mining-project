The multi-armed bandit problem is a classic sequential decision-making problem in which an agent tries to maximize a cumulative stochastic reward under uncertainty. This paper addresses the issue of privacy in the context of the multi-armed bandit problem, specifically focusing on the scenario of an advertisement system where users' click decisions depend on private characteristics. The paper introduces the concept of differential privacy and explores the shufﬂe model as a middle ground between centralized and local differential privacy. The authors propose two algorithms for the shufﬂe model and analyze their regret bounds, showing improvements compared to the local model.
