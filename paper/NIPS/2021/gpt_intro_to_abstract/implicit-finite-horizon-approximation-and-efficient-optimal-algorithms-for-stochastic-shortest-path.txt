We study the Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) model for regret minimization, where an agent aims to reach a goal state with minimal cost in a stochastic environment. Although SSP has been extensively studied in empirical and optimal control theory settings, it has received less attention in the regret minimization setting. Previous algorithms have achieved regret bounds, but they are model-based with high space complexity and time complexity. In this paper, we propose a generic template for regret minimization algorithms in SSP and introduce two new algorithms: LCB-ADVANTAGE-SSP, a model-free algorithm with efficient performance, and SVI-SSP, a computationally efficient model-based algorithm. We provide theoretical analyses and empirical evaluations to support our contributions.
