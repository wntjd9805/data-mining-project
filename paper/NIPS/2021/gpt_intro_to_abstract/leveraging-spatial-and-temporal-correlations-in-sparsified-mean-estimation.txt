This paper introduces a problem in distributed data science applications, which is estimating the mean of a set of vectors collected from a distributed system of nodes. The authors focus on the constraint that the nodes sending the data are resource-constrained and bandwidth-limited edge devices, making sending high-dimensional vectors expensive and slow. To address this, they propose a solution to reduce communication costs by sending sparsified vectors that only contain a subset of the original vector's elements. The paper also explores the spatial and temporal correlations in the vectors sent by the nodes and presents methods for combining sparsified vectors to estimate their mean, taking into account these correlations. The authors propose two novel estimators, Rand-k-Spatial and Rand-k-Temporal, which leverage spatial and temporal correlations, respectively. They also provide theoretical analysis and experimental results showing the effectiveness of these estimators.
