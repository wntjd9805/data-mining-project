This paper addresses the problem of estimating a signal from nonlinear measurements using a sensing matrix and a nonlinear function. The authors focus on the impact of the spectrum of the sensing matrix on the difficulty of signal recovery, particularly for the expectation propagation (EP) algorithm. They introduce a measure of spectrum "spikiness" and show that it affects the performance of EP depending on the choice of the nonlinear mapping function. The authors also investigate the relationship between spectrum characteristics and the number of measurements needed for perfect recovery.
