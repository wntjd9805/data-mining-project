In this paper, we study a specific instance of the composite minimization problem where f and g are convex, proper, and lower-semicontinuous, and A is a linear operator. Problems of this form have been studied in the literature under various assumptions on f and g. In particular, when A is proximal-friendly and f is L-smooth, forward-backward splitting algorithms such as the Proximal Gradient algorithm and its accelerated counterpart can be applied. However, in general, the proximal operator of g is not easily computable, so a popular approach is to reformulate the problem as a convex-concave saddle-point problem. In this work, we focus on studying stepsize regime automation for primal-dual algorithms targeting this reformulated problem, with the aim of improving convergence by adapting to the local problem geometry without resorting to linesearch. We propose a first-order primal-dual scheme that achieves this goal, and provide theoretical convergence guarantees. Experimental results are presented for various applications.
