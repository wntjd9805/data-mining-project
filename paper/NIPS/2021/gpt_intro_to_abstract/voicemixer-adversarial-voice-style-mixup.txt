This paper introduces VoiceMixer, a system that aims to decompose and transfer voice style using a novel similarity-based information bottleneck and adversarial feedback. It incorporates self-supervised representation learning to disentangle and transfer voice style without the need for text transcriptions or external feature extractors. The proposed similarity-based information bottleneck successfully disentangles content and style, leading to improved audio quality in the converted speech. Additionally, an adversarial voice style mixup technique is proposed to enhance the generalization of the converted speech. Through subjective and objective evaluations, VoiceMixer demonstrates superior disentanglement and transfer performance compared to other baselines in various voice style transfer scenarios.
