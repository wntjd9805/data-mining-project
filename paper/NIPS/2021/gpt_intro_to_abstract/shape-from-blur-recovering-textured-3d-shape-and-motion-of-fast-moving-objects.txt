Motion blur is a common problem in image quality caused by camera motion, fast object motion, or long exposure times. This paper focuses on deblurring fast moving objects (FMOs) by decomposing their appearance and recovering their shape, motion, and sharp texture. The accurate reconstruction and motion estimation of FMOs have various applications such as sports analysis, astrophysics, and driver alert systems. Existing deblurring methods perform poorly on FMOs, and all previous methods tackle deblurring in the 2D image domain. This paper proposes a novel approach that models object shape, motion, and texture in the 3D domain, resulting in better deblurring results. The contributions of this work include a method for jointly estimating the 3D shape, texture, and motion of an object from a single image, as well as an effective pipeline for optimization and the proposal of suitable regularizers.
