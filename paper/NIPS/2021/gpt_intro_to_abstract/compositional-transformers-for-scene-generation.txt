This paper proposes GANformer2, a structured object-oriented transformer that aims to make generative modeling more compositional, interpretable, and controllable. GANformer2 decouples the visual synthesis task into two stages: planning and execution. At the planning stage, a set of latent variables representing the objects and entities of the scene are transformed into a schematic layout. At the execution stage, the layout is translated into the final image using bipartite attention. The authors conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that GANformer2 achieves state-of-the-art results in both conditional and unconditional synthesis, with high fidelity, diversity, and semantic consistency. Additionally, the model exhibits spatial disentanglement, separation between structure and style, and the ability to amodally complete occluded objects. The produced layouts and their components provide transparency and explainability to the generative process. The integration of compositional structure improves robustness, controllability, and interpretability in generative modeling.
