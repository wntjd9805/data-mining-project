Binary classification models are widely used for online decision-making in various practical applications. One specific problem in this domain is the bank loan problem (BLP), where a learner interacts with a sequence of loan applicants and must decide whether to issue a loan or not based on the applicant's features. The objective is to maximize the reward by approving loans to applicants who can repay them and rejecting loans for those who cannot. This task becomes challenging due to the unknown probabilities of repayment and the potential bias in the training data. Existing contextual bandit approaches assume known reward functions and often use linear or generalized linear models. However, in practice, deep neural networks (DNNs) are commonly used, presenting a richer scenario. In this paper, we propose PLOT, an algorithm that trains DNNs to make optimistic online decisions for the BLP by incorporating optimism in both representation learning and decision making. Our empirical results demonstrate that PLOT achieves competitive performance on benchmark problems in the BLP domain and is more likely to accept true accepts compared to true rejects.
