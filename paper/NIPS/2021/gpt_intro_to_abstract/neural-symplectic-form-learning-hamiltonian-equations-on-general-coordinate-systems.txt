This paper introduces a method to learn the Hamilton equation from data represented in arbitrary coordinate systems. The proposed approach utilizes the symplectic geometric approach to learn the symplectic 2-form, which corresponds to a skew-symmetric matrix. Instead of directly learning the 2-form, the method learns a 1-form that derives the symplectic 2-form. By utilizing the coordinate-free representation of the Hamilton equation, the proposed method can determine whether the provided data can be explained by the underlying theory of classical mechanics. The paper also provides a universal approximation theorem and compares the proposed approach with other studies.
