Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has shown remarkable success in games and robotics. Applying MARL to real-world problems, such as power networks, has gained increasing interest. Power networks involve a multitude of agents collaborating or competing, making it an ideal test field for MARL algorithms. However, a major obstacle in applying MARL to power networks is the lack of transparency and guarantee. To address this, we propose focusing on less sensitive yet challenging problems, such as active voltage control in power distribution networks. This problem has become more significant due to the growing penetration of distributed resources like rooftop photovoltaics. Excessive active power injection can lead to voltage fluctuations, which can be alleviated by coordinating multiple controllable apparatuses. We introduce the active voltage control problem, highlighting its unique properties, and discuss previous attempts to apply MARL in this context. To facilitate further research, we present a comprehensive test-bench and open-source environment for MARL-based active voltage control, along with large-scale experimentation using state-of-the-art MARL algorithms. We also highlight the importance of designing appropriate voltage barrier functions and discuss potential challenges and future directions for MARL in solving the active voltage control problem.
