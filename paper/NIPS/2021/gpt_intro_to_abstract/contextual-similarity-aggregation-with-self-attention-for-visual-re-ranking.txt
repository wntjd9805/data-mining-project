This paper proposes a novel visual re-ranking method for instance image retrieval. It addresses the issue of initial retrieval results lacking contextual information by selecting top-ranked images as anchors and computing similarity features. The paper also introduces a data augmentation method and a transformer encoder to improve re-ranking performance. Two loss functions are used for training the re-ranking model. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, which can be easily combined with existing image retrieval algorithms. The method also has lower time and memory complexity compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
