This paper explores the problem of dynamic influence maximization (DIM), which aims to find a seed set of nodes with the largest expected influence spread in a social network that evolves over time. The authors highlight the limitations of existing influence maximization algorithms in capturing the dynamic nature of social networks and propose a systematic study on DIM. They present two types of evolution models and discuss the challenges of achieving optimal approximation guarantee while maintaining a low amortized running time. The paper provides resolutions to these challenges, including an algorithm with a (1 - 1/e) approximation ratio in the incremental model and a computational hardness result in the fully dynamic model. The authors also propose novel adaptive sampling strategies and a combinatorial algorithm for the DIM problem. Overall, this research contributes to both influence maximization and submodular maximization communities.
