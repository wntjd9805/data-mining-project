In this paper, we propose a meta-learning solution for the multi-image capability in Single image GANs. We explore different forms of conditioning and ultimately advocate for the use of hypernetworks, which consist of a primary network for computation and a hypernetwork for conditioning. Our method allows for training on multiple images simultaneously and achieves comparable results to single-image training for various applications. Additionally, it enables interpolation between single-image GANs derived from multiple images and provides fast inference generation for novel images. We also provide a theoretical analysis of our algorithm, demonstrating its effectiveness in minimizing the objective function and the necessity of its components. This is the first method, to our knowledge, that performs adversarial training using hypernetworks.
