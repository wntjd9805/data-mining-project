This paper addresses the challenge of predicting future 3D human motion based on observed past video frames. The authors propose a framework that utilizes action-specific representative motion dynamics stored in a memory bank to guide the motion prediction process. A query-read process is used to extract relevant motion dynamics from the memory bank, which are then used to improve the accuracy of future motion prediction. The approach also includes an action constraint loss to maintain semantic consistency in the predicted motion. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, which outperforms previous methods in 3D human motion prediction.
