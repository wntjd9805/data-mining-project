The goal of this paper is to investigate the combination of human and machine predictions in a K-way classification task, such as image classification. The paper proposes a framework for combining predictions using confidence levels from a model and categorical information from a human. The authors show that relatively simple probabilistic combination techniques can outperform individual human and machine predictions in terms of classification accuracy and calibration. The paper presents empirical results on two image classification datasets and develops theoretical understanding of the trade-offs between calibration and accuracy for both human and model predictions. The proposed methodology is illustrated with an example from the ImageNet-16H dataset. Overall, the paper contributes a general framework for combining human and machine predictions, validates its effectiveness through experiments, and provides theoretical insights into combination performance.
