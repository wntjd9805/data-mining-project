Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown remarkable success in various tasks, but the labels of accumulated datasets are often corrupted, hindering the generalization ability of DNNs. Therefore, it is important to train DNNs that are robust to corrupted labels. This paper introduces a novel framework called FINE (filtering noisy labels via their eigenvectors) for detecting clean instances from noisy datasets. FINE utilizes the high-order topological information of data in latent space through eigen decomposition, providing a robust decision boundary. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FINE in improving detection quality and generalization in the presence of noisy data. The paper also explores the application of FINE in existing learning with noisy label methods and presents experimental validations.
