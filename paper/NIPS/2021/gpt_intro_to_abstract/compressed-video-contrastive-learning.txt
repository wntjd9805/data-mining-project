Recent self-supervised image representation learning approaches have shown promising results by leveraging large amounts of unlabeled data for pre-training and designing powerful algorithms to discriminate different semantic meanings. However, self-supervised video representation learning (SSVRL) lags behind supervised methods due to scalability issues and the rich visual content in videos. Existing methods focus on effective algorithms without considering storage and computation costs. This paper proposes a Motion Vector based Cross Guidance Contrastive learning approach (MVCGC) that efficiently decodes RGB frames and motion vectors from compressed videos and learns discriminative features from both streams. Experimental results show that MVCGC achieves state-of-the-art performance on action recognition and action retrieval tasks while being more efficient than existing methods.
