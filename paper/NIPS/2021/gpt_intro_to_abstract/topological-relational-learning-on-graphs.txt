Node classification is a key area of focus in graph learning, aiming to predict labels for unlabelled nodes in an attributed graph. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been effective in addressing this problem, but they are vulnerable to graph perturbations and attacks. Recent studies have shown that incorporating local graph information and topological side information can enhance the robustness of GNNs. In this paper, we propose the use of local algorithms and topological data analysis (TDA) to introduce the concept of topological relational inference (TRI) into GNNs. We present two options for information passing based on the local topological structure of nodes, including injecting topology-induced multiedges and enriching node features with topological side information. Our experimental results demonstrate that our TRI-GNN approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of node classification accuracy and robustness under noisy scenarios.
