Advances in biomedical imaging techniques have led to an increase in 3D biomedical image data. Machine learning models have shown good performance on tasks when provided with labels, but obtaining these labels, especially for segmentation, is costly and limited by human expertise. In this paper, we propose a solution for unsupervised segmentation in 3D biomedical image data by leveraging the hierarchical structure inherent in these images. We introduce the use of hyperbolic embeddings, which better preserve hierarchical relationships compared to traditional Euclidean embeddings. We employ a 3D hyperbolic variational autoencoder along with a gyroplane convolutional layer for embedding and decoding the images in hyperbolic space. Additionally, we introduce a self-supervised loss to capture the hierarchical structure and train on subvolumes sampled at multiple scales. Our model achieves better segmentation performance than prior unsupervised methods on synthetic datasets and a real-world medical image dataset, outperforming prior works by 19% and even comparable to semi-supervised methods without using any labels.
