We consider the problem of learning relative priorities of jobs and making scheduling decisions in order to minimize the expected total cumulative cost. This problem is motivated by various applications such as content moderation on social media platforms, energy consumption optimization in data centers, and patient scheduling in emergency medical departments. We model the problem as a single-server scheduling system with unknown mean values of job holding costs. We propose an algorithm called the preemptive-then-nonpreemptive empirical cÂµ rule that combines the preemptive and nonpreemptive scheduling approaches. We provide theoretical analyses and instance-dependent upper bounds to show that our algorithm achieves sublinear expected regret in the number of time steps and subquadratic regret in the number of jobs. Numerical experiments support our theoretical findings.
