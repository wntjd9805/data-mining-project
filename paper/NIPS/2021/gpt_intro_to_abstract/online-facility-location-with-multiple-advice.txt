Clustering is a popular topic in unsupervised learning, and the online version of clustering has gained attention in recent years. This paper examines the use of machine-learned advice from multiple sources to improve the performance of clustering algorithms in the online setting. Specifically, the focus is on facility location, a classic clustering problem with applications in computer science and operations research. The paper introduces an online randomized algorithm called TAKEHEED that leverages multiple sets of suggested facilities to compute a near-optimal solution. Experimental analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm, and a robust version called WARY is also developed. Additionally, an algorithm called BUCKETHEED is designed to handle large, bad advice sets. Overall, the paper provides insights into the interplay between online algorithms and multiple advice in the context of facility location clustering.
