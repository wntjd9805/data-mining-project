In this paper, we introduce GainTuning, a framework that bridges the gap between models pre-trained on large datasets and models trained exclusively on test images, in the context of image denoising. GainTuning adapts pre-trained CNN models to individual test images by optimizing a single multiplicative scaling parameter (the "Gain") for each channel within each layer of the CNN. This reduces the parameter set and prevents overfitting to the test data. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that GainTuning improves the denoising performance of state-of-the-art CNNs on standard benchmarks, especially when the test images differ systematically from the training data. We also evaluate GainTuning in a real scientific-imaging application, achieving effective denoising with minimal artifacts.
