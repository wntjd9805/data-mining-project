The paper introduces the concept of tailoring, a framework for encoding inductive biases by minimizing unsupervised losses at prediction time. It also formulates meta-tailoring, which adjusts the outer objective to optimize only the task loss, and proposes a new algorithm called CNGRAD for efficient meta-tailoring. The paper demonstrates the application of meta-tailoring in various domains, including physics prediction problems, enhancing resistance to adversarial examples, and improving prediction quality with a contrastive loss. Overall, the paper makes contributions to the field of machine learning by proposing a novel approach to improving generalization in models through tailored predictions.
