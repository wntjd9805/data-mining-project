Neural networks are commonly used in supervised learning tasks such as classification and density estimation. Deep generative models, which utilize deep density estimators, have applications in generating realistic images, detecting adversarial attacks, and hybrid modeling. In this paper, we explore a new approach called i-DenseNets, where densely connected blocks are used as a residual layer. We introduce a new activation function called CLipSwish, which has a stronger Lipschitz bound. We demonstrate that i-DenseNets can be efficiently trained as a generative model, outperforming other flow-based models.
