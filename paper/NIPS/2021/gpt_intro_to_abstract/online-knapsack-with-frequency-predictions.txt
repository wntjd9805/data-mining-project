In this paper, we explore the concept of learning-augmented algorithm design in the online setting, where predictions about future inputs are provided to the algorithm. We focus specifically on the online knapsack problem and introduce a new model that considers frequency predictions, where a range of values is provided for key parameters of the problem. Our main result is the design of an algorithm called SENTINEL, which achieves a nearly optimal competitive ratio for the KNAPSACK-FP problem. We also extend our model and results to the generalized one-way trading problem and the two-stage online knapsack problem. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm augmented with frequency predictions compared to the classic worst-case algorithm.
