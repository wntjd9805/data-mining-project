The class incremental learning (CIL) problem in machine learning involves learning new class objects without forgetting past learned classes. Recent research has focused on the classification setting, but there are additional difficulties in the class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS) problem, particularly with the semantic drift of the background class. Previous works have partially addressed this issue, but there is still room for improvement. This paper proposes SSUL-M, a method that addresses the multi-label prediction challenge of CISS. It introduces an "Unknown" class label for background objects, utilizes pseudo-labeling with separate sigmoid output classifiers for each class, freezes past class classifiers, and utilizes an exemplar memory. Experiments show that SSUL-M outperforms recent baselines and provides a state-of-the-art solution to the problem.
