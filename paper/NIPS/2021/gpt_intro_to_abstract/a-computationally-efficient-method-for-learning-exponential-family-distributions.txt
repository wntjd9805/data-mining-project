We are interested in the problem of learning the natural parameters of a minimal exponential family with bounded support. Exponential families are parametric probability distributions that have analytically tractable properties and appear in various applications. Truncated exponential families, which arise from truncating the support of an exponential family, are particularly relevant when working with truncated datasets. Despite the long history of these families, there is limited progress in learning the natural parameters of a minimal truncated exponential family. In this paper, we propose a computationally tractable method with statistical guarantees for learning distributions in truncated minimal exponential families. We introduce a novel loss function and establish the consistency, normality, and finite sample guarantees of our estimator. Additionally, we establish connections between our method and maximum likelihood estimation.
