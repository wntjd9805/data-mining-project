Change point detection (CPD) is a task focused on identifying significant changes in the temporal evolution of a system from noisy observations, with applications in various fields. The CPD problem has been studied under different variations, including the detection of distribution changes from independent and identically distributed observations, as well as changes in the temporal structure of dependent time series data. This paper introduces a variant of the singular spectrum analysis (SSA) algorithm for CPD in multivariate time series, extending its use to develop an online detection method. The proposed algorithm utilizes the low-dimensional structure of the time series to construct a cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistic based on subspace distance. The performance of the algorithm is analyzed in terms of average running length (ARL), showing exponential expected running length in the absence of change and linear expected detection delay in the presence of change. Comparative empirical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art CPD methods across benchmark datasets.
