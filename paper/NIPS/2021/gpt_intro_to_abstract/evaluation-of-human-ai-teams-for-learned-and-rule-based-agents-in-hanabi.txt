Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to agents achieving superhuman performance in various domains through reinforcement learning (RL). However, the focus has primarily been on adversarial games, neglecting the study of teaming intelligence and collaboration with human teammates. This paper aims to evaluate human-AI teaming in the game of Hanabi, considering both objective performance and subjective human reactions. The hypothesis that RL techniques can create collaborative AI outperforming rule-based agents is tested, but the results show a clear preference for rule-based AI despite similar performance. This is the first study comparing objective performance and subjective human preferences in Hanabi AI.
