Shape registration is a challenging problem in computer vision, with applications ranging from pose estimation to medical image registration. Existing approaches typically involve feature extraction, feature matching, and regularization. This work focuses on improving the feature matching step using tools derived from optimal transport theory. The authors provide an overview of related methods, including feature extraction techniques and different approaches for feature matching, such as nearest neighbor projections, kernel convolutions, and optimal transport. They discuss the limitations of current state-of-the-art methods, including the difficulty in training deep learning models on non-smooth shapes and the challenges of scaling up point neural networks. The goal of this work is to overcome these limitations and enable the widespread use of optimal transport for registration problems.
