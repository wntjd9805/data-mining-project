This paper explores the cost of exploration in learning problems with multiple stakeholders. It presents two motivating examples: personalized medicine and adaptive trials, and revenue management for search advertising. The paper introduces the concept of regret and fairness in sharing the cost of exploration among different groups. It then discusses the use of axiomatic bargaining theory to reason about fair regret profiles. The paper develops the Nash bargaining solution for the grouped bandit problem and makes several contributions, including the identification of unfair regret optimal policies, the derivation of an achievable fairness bound, and the presentation of the Nash solution with a small price of fairness. The paper also extends the framework to linear contextual bandits and applies it to the real-world case of warfarin dosing. The related literature on fairness in bandits and welfare economics is discussed, and the paper concludes with an overview of the axiomatic bargaining framework for bandits.
