Parametric stochastic simulators are widely used in scientific research, and solving the Bayesian inverse problem using these simulators is a topic of interest. Traditional methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and nested sampling are applicable when the likelihood is tractable, but when the likelihood is implicitly defined by the simulator or computationally inefficient, likelihood-free or simulation-based inference methods like Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) are used. Simulation-based inference (SBI) is closely related to ABC and has been an area of research since the 1980s. Recent advancements in deep learning have accelerated progress in SBI, with proposed algorithms utilizing density estimation to learn the likelihood or posterior. This paper introduces an algorithm called Truncated Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (TMNRE) that combines targeted inference, marginal posteriors, and consistency checks through local amortization. TMNRE approximates the likelihood-to-evidence ratio in a sequence of rounds and is particularly useful when the joint posterior is computationally expensive. The algorithm generates simulations in relevant regions of the parameter space, allows estimation of all marginals simultaneously, and yields locally amortized posteriors. The proposed method offers a balance between accuracy and empirical testability, providing trustworthy scientific results.
