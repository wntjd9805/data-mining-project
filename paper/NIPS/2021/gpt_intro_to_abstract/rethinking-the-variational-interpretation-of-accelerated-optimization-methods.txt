This paper addresses the problem of unconstrained convex optimization, specifically finding the minimum of a lower bounded convex L-smooth loss function. The Accelerated Gradient Descent (AGD) method, proposed by Nesterov in 1983, achieves the optimal convergence rate of O(k^-2), surpassing the convergence rate of Gradient Descent (GD) which is O(k^-1). Su et al. (2016) observed that the convergence rate gap between GD and AGD is maintained in continuous-time limits, leading to the derivation of the GD-ODE and AGD-ODE models. In this paper, the authors analyze the variational formulation of AGD and explore the minimality of Nesterov's path using calculus of variations. Their findings reveal that Nesterov's path is optimal under certain conditions, but can also be a saddle point for the action in certain cases. The implications of these results for accelerated methods and future research directions are discussed.
