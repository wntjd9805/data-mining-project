Combinatorial Optimization (CO) problems pose challenges for traditional solvers due to their NP-hard nature. To address this, heuristic algorithms and data-driven approaches are commonly used. However, existing machine learning (ML) models for CO problems are often limited in capacity and tailored for specific problems. Additionally, obtaining high-quality labels for training such models is difficult. In this paper, we propose a hybrid MLCO approach that combines traditional optimization methods with ML. Our approach reformulates CO into a bi-level optimization problem, where the upper-level objective is minimized by optimizing the graph structure using reinforcement learning (RL), while a lower-level problem is solved using a heuristic. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various graph-based CO problems and show that it outperforms traditional heuristics and single-level learning methods.
