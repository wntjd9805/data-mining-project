Generative models such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) have become increasingly popular in recent years. Tabular data synthesis using GANs is a challenging task due to the presence of sensitive information and the need to share data with both trustworthy and untrustworthy individuals. In this paper, we propose a framework called invertible tabular GAN (IT-GAN) that integrates adversarial training with the negative log-density training of neural networks. Our approach allows for a trade-off between synthesis quality and privacy protection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on real-world tabular datasets, where it outperforms existing approaches.
