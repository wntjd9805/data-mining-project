Cooperative pedagogy is a widely studied concept in various fields such as language, cognitive development, cultural anthropology, and robotics. With the increasing usage of artificial intelligence and machine learning systems, it is anticipated that human-computer and agent-agent pedagogical scenarios will become more prevalent. However, current machine learning methods are primarily focused on individual learners and lack the ability to teach or learn from humans as effectively as humans do. This paper aims to address this gap by proposing a teacher-aware learner that can significantly improve the learning process. The learner estimates the teacher's data selection process and adjusts its likelihood function accordingly, enabling it to utilize both explicit and implicit information from the selected data. Theoretical proofs and empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, highlighting its potential in human-machine interactions and machine-machine communications.
