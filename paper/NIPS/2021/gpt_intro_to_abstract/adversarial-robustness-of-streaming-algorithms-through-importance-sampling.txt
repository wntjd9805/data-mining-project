Robustness against adversarial attacks is a critical aspect of algorithmic design for machine learning tasks. In this paper, we delve into the field of adversarially robust streaming algorithms, where data points are generated in a stream and the objective is to compute meaningful functions while utilizing limited memory. The streaming model is widely applicable in various algorithmic and ML-related tasks, such as IP traffic flow monitoring, web search query analysis, and feature selection in machine learning. However, in the adversarial streaming model, an adversary strategically selects updates based on the algorithm's previous outputs, posing challenges for achieving robustness. This paper explores the possibility of adversarially robust streaming algorithms and presents a formal definition of the model as a two-player game between a streaming algorithm and an adversary. The ultimate goal is to develop algorithms that can withstand adversarial attacks and provide accurate responses throughout the streaming process.
