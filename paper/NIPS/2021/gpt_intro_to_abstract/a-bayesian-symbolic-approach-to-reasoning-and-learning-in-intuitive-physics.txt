This paper introduces Bayesian-symbolic physics (BSP), a model that combines the sample efficiency of symbolic methods with the accuracy and generalization of data-driven approaches. BSP utilizes a generative program to model the dynamics of the environment, treating the properties of entities as random variables and using symbolic regression to learn explicit force expressions. To address the challenges of data efficiency and dealing with global constants, a grammar of Newtonian physics is introduced, along with a bilevel optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate BSP's high data efficiency and its ability to discover physical laws from real-world scenes. The paper also explores BSP's performance on tasks related to human physical reasoning.
