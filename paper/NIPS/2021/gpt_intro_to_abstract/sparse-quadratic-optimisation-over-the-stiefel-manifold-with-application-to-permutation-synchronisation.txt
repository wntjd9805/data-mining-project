The paper introduces an optimization problem of maximizing a function within a specific set. Despite the non-convexity of the problem, it can be solved to global optimality using eigenvalue decomposition. The paper focuses on solving combinatorial problems using this formulation but faces difficulties in discretizing the continuous solution. The common approach of integrating sparsity-promoting regularizers is not compatible with the eigenvalue decomposition. Instead, the paper proposes a method that exploits orthogonal-invariance to ensure sparsity in the solution. The main contributions include an algorithm that combines orthogonal-invariance and sparsity in quadratic optimization problems, building upon the Orthogonal Iteration algorithm. The algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the dominant subspace and provides a global optimal solution. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the approach in the context of the permutation synchronization problem.
