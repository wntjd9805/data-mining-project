This paper presents a novel method, called Dynamic Salient Regions Graph Neural Network (DyReg-GNN), that enhances the relational processing of videos by learning to discover salient regions that are relevant for the current scene and task. Unlike previous works, our approach introduces nodes that are constructed for spatial reasoning and can adapt to the input, improving the modeling of object interactions. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the regions discovered by our method are well correlated with the objects present in the video, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach for tasks requiring spatio-temporal reasoning. The main contributions of this work include the proposed method to augment spatio-temporal GNNs, the enhanced relational processing achieved through salient regions discovery, and the unsupervised prediction of salient regions in videos.
