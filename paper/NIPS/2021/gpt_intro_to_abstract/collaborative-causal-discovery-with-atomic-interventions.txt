In this paper, we propose a new model for causal discovery called Collaborative Causal Discovery, which aims to learn all the causal graphs in a system using a collection of entities. We assume that each entity is associated with a mixed ancestral graph (MAG) and that the entities can be partitioned into clusters based on the similarities of their MAGs. We design algorithms that have worst-case guarantees on the number of interventions needed to recover the MAGs, taking into account the clustering of entities. We present an algorithm that can provably recover an approximate MAG for each entity using a small number of interventions per entity. Under a more restrictive clustering assumption, we provide algorithms that can exactly recover all the MAGs with a slightly higher number of interventions per entity. We also provide a lower bound on the number of interventions required for this causal discovery problem. Experimental results on real and synthetic networks demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms.
