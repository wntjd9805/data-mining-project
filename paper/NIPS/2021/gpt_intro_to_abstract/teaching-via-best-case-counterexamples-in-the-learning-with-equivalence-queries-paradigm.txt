In this paper, we explore the learning-with-equivalence-queries (LwEQ) paradigm, where a learner asks only equivalence queries to a teacher who responds with "yes" or "no" along with a counterexample. We focus on understanding the query complexity for this paradigm, specifically how many equivalence queries are needed for exact identification of a target hypothesis. Previous studies have looked at worst-case and random counterexamples, but we consider a more powerful teaching setting where the optimal teacher provides best-case counterexamples. We introduce a new notion of teaching complexity for the LwEQ paradigm called LwEQ teaching dimension (LwEQ-TD), and characterize the query complexity for the optimal teacher. Our results show that best-case counterexamples significantly reduce query complexity compared to worst-case and random counterexamples, and we establish connections between LwEQ-TD and the teaching dimension in the learning-from-samples paradigm.
