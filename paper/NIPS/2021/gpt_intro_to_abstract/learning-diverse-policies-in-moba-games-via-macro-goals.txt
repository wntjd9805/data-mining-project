Game AI has made significant advancements in recent years, particularly in the field of Multi-player Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games. However, existing AI systems in MOBA games lack policy diversity, resulting in agents with similar strategies and limited ability to exploit the strengths of different heroes and lineups. In this paper, we propose a novel learning paradigm called Macro-Goals Guided (MGG) learning to train diverse policies in MOBA games. We define macro-goals as strategic decisions and use them to guide the policy learning process. Experimental results on the popular MOBA game, Honor of Kings, demonstrate that our approach improves the Elo score and outperforms existing AI systems in terms of policy diversity. This research is the first to address the problem of policy diversity in MOBA games and offers a new framework for learning diverse strategies.
