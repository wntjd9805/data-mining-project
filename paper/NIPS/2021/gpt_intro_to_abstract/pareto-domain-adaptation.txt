Domain adaptation (DA) is a widely studied approach in machine learning for training a model on a target domain with the assistance of a labeled source domain. It addresses the issue of label scarcity by adapting the model to the target domain, despite the presence of data bias. Many DA methods have been proposed in recent years, achieving impressive results in various domains such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection. However, most existing approaches overlook a crucial dilemma where the optimization objectives of domain alignment and source classification can conflict with each other, leading to suboptimal solutions. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Pareto Domain Adaptation (ParetoDA) that dynamically guides the optimization process based on the gradient of a target-classification-mimicking loss on a held-out unlabeled target dataset. By considering the Pareto front of the objectives, ParetoDA aims to reach a set of solutions that minimize the target classification loss while ensuring alignment between domains. We experimentally validate the effectiveness of ParetoDA on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks, demonstrating its superiority over existing DA methods.
