Non-linear dynamical systems (NLDS) are widely used in various domains such as control theory and time-series analysis, but accurately estimating the parameters of these systems is a challenging problem. Existing techniques rely on mixing time arguments and do not provide optimal results. In this paper, we propose algorithms for NLDS identification in both offline and online settings, assuming an expansive link function. Our main contribution is that our algorithms achieve error rates that are independent of the mixing time, which is the first result of its kind. We also introduce a streaming algorithm with small space and time complexity. Our proofs utilize exponential martingales and stability analysis. Overall, our work provides efficient algorithms for learning NLDS in the presence of dependent data, and our results have implications for other settings beyond NLDS identification.
