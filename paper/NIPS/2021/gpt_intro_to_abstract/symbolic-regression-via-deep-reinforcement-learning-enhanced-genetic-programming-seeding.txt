Symbolic regression is a process that involves searching for mathematical expressions to fit a given dataset, aiming to illuminate the underlying process that generated the data. This process is reminiscent of how a physicist derives fundamental expressions to describe natural phenomena. Symbolic regression is a challenging problem due to the exponential growth of the search space. Traditional approaches, such as genetic programming (GP), and more recent methods, like neural-guided search, have been used to tackle this problem. In this paper, we propose combining GP and neural-guided search to leverage their respective strengths. We explore different training methods for the recurrent neural network (RNN) used in neural-guided search, including reinforcement learning-based methods and priority queue training.
