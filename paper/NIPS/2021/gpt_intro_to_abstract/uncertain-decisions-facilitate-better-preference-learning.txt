The paper discusses the problem of inferring human preferences and the shortcomings of existing methods for preference learning. It explores the use of inverse decision theory (IDT) as a tool for preference learning and analyzes the impact of uncertainty on the identifiability of human's loss function. The results show that observing humans making decisions under uncertainty actually makes preference learning easier and helps identify their loss function. The paper also presents models of suboptimality and demonstrates that decisions made under uncertainty can still aid in recovering the human's loss function. The implications of the findings for preference learning and decision-making in uncertain situations are discussed.
