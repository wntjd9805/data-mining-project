This paper introduces the concept of message passing in regular cell complexes to address the limitations of message passing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in detecting higher-order meso-scale structures in graphs. The authors propose a novel message passing procedure that utilizes the flexibility of cell complexes to decouple the input and computational graphs. They demonstrate the expressive power of their approach using a cellular version of the Weisfeiler-Lehman test and show that their model, called CW Networks (CWNs), performs at least as well as the WL test. Additionally, they explore the use of induced cycles in molecular graphs as a lifting map, which leads to a hierarchical message passing procedure and achieves state-of-the-art results on large-scale molecular graph datasets. The paper provides code for their approach and is the first to propose a cell complex representation for molecules.
