The field of 3D shape reconstruction using deep learning techniques has seen significant progress in recent years, with numerous methods developed for various reconstruction problems. However, the generation of regular meshes with known genus has become a necessity for applications such as physics simulation, 3D-printing, and clinical analysis. This paper introduces CorticalFlow (CF), a new geometric deep learning model that efficiently deforms a template mesh towards complex shapes, producing high-resolution regular meshes. CF utilizes a 3D convolution neural network to predict a flow field from a volumetric image, and a mathematical framework to compute diffeomorphic mappings for each vertex. The performance of CF is evaluated in the context of brain cortical surface reconstruction, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, surface regularity, speed, and memory efficiency.
