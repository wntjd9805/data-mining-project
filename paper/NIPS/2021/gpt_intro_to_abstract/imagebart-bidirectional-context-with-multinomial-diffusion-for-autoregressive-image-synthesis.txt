In recent years, deep generative modeling has made significant progress by factorizing the likelihood of data using an autoregressive (AR) fashion. This approach has been successful in various domains, including language modeling, music generation, and image synthesis. However, the direct applicability of this approach to image synthesis is challenged by the high dimensionality and redundancy of image data. This paper introduces a novel approach called ImageBART, which addresses the limitations of traditional autoregressive models by incorporating bidirectional context, global context, and a hierarchical compression process. The proposed approach not only improves sample quality and coherence but also enables user-interactive image editing. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in various conditional synthesis tasks.
