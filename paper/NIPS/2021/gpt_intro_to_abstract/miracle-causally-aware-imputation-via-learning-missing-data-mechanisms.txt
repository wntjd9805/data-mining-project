Missing data is a common issue in various domains, such as medicine, where data may be intentionally omitted, misrecorded, or left blank. Imputation algorithms can be used to estimate missing values, but their accuracy depends on the type of missingness. This paper proposes a novel imputation method called Missing data Imputation ReÔ¨Ånement And Causal LEarning (MIRACLE) that aims to preserve the causal structure of the data. MIRACLE operates on any baseline imputation method and iteratively refines imputations by learning a missingness graph and incorporating information from the causal graph. Experimental results demonstrate that MIRACLE consistently improves imputation performance across various scenarios.
