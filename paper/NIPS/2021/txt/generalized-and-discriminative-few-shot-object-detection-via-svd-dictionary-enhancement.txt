Abstract
Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect new objects based on few anno-tated samples. To alleviate the impact of few samples, enhancing the generalization and discrimination abilities of detectors on new objects plays an important role.
In this paper, we explore employing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to boost both the generalization and discrimination abilities. In speciﬁc, we propose a novel method, namely, SVD-Dictionary enhancement, to build two separated spaces based on the sorted singular values. Concretely, the eigenvectors corre-sponding to larger singular values are used to build the generalization space in which localization is performed, as these eigenvectors generally suppress certain variations (e.g., the variation of styles) and contain intrinsical characteristics of objects. Meanwhile, since the eigenvectors corresponding to relatively smaller sin-gular values may contain richer category-related information, we can utilize them to build the discrimination space in which classiﬁcation is performed. Dictionary learning is further leveraged to capture high-level discriminative information from the discrimination space, which is beneﬁcial for improving detection accuracy. In the experiments, we separately verify the effectiveness of our method on PASCAL
VOC and COCO benchmarks. Particularly, for the 2-shot case in VOC split1, our method signiﬁcantly outperforms the baseline by 6.2%. Moreover, visualization analysis shows that our method is instrumental in doing FSOD. 1

Introduction
With the rejuvenation of deep neural networks, for object detection, many progresses [11, 12, 1, 26, 22] have been achieved. Though these methods obtain outstanding detection performances, they usually require a large number of labeled samples for training, which are labored yet expensive to collect and annotate. On the contrary, human beings are born with the ability to learn a new visual concept with only few samples. To imitate such an ability of human beings, the task of few-shot object detection (FSOD) [2, 17, 36] has been proposed, which aims to improve the detection performance for new objects that contain few annotated training samples.
The main challenge of FSOD lies in how to learn generalized and discriminative object features from both abundant samples in base object categories and few samples in new object categories, which can improve the representation ability of object features and alleviate overﬁtting on new objects.
Following the popular methods for few-shot image classiﬁcation, earlier attempts [38, 37, 33, 8] in
FSOD utilize the meta-learning strategy [29, 31, 10], whose goal is to learn detectors across tasks and then transfer to the few-shot detection task. However, compared with traditional two-stage ﬁne-tuning based approaches [34, 35, 30], the meta-learning strategy fails to effectively improve generalization

Figure 1: SVD-Dictionary enhancement for FSOD. ‘SVD-Large’ indicates that we use the eigenvec-tors corresponding to larger singular values to build the generalization space in which localization is performed. ‘SVD-Small’ indicates that we use the eigenvectors corresponding to smaller singular values to build the discrimination space in which classiﬁcation is performed. Meanwhile, dictionary learning [41] is used to capture high-level discriminative information from the discrimination space, which is beneﬁcial for improving the detection accuracy. and discrimination of object features and leads to weak performance. The reason may be that during each training episode, meta-learning methods focus on transferability across different tasks and ignore learning of generalized and discriminative feature representations.
For FSOD, the generalized representations may contain intrinsical characteristics of object features, which is beneﬁcial for adapting knowledge from base object categories to new object categories.
Meanwhile, the discriminative representations may contain certain category-related information, which is helpful for boosting the detection accuracy. Furthermore, recent research [3] has shown that from a spectral analysis perspective, the feature representations can be decomposed into eigenvectors with importance quantiﬁed by the corresponding singular values. The eigenvectors corresponding to larger singular values contribute to the generalization ability, as these eigenvectors could suppress certain variations (e.g., the variations of style and texture). Meanwhile, since the eigenvectors corresponding to relatively smaller singular values contain richer category-related information (e.g., the structures of objects), these eigenvectors are beneﬁcial for discrimination. Therefore, in this paper, we explore employing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (as shown in Fig. 1) to promote detectors to learn generalized and discriminative object features.
Particularly, we propose a method named as SVD-Dictionary enhancement for FSOD. Given an input image, a backbone network is ﬁrst used to extract the corresponding feature map. Then, SVD is performed on the feature map. Here, we select the eigenvectors corresponding to the ﬁrst k largest singular values to compute a generalization map. And the generalization ability is enhanced by a residual operation between the generalization map and the original feature map. Next, the residual eigenvectors are used to calculate a discrimination map. Meanwhile, to further enhance discrimination, we deﬁne a codebook containing multiple codewords and employ dictionary learning
[41] to capture high-level discriminative information from the discrimination map, which is good for accurate detection. Compared with most methods [35, 33, 17] for FSOD, our method includes two virtues. One is that during enhancing generalization, our method does not introduce extra parameters.
The other is that with the help of the discrimination map and dictionary learning, our method could capture high-level discriminative information of different categories, which is conductive to reducing the data-scarce impact on new object categories. During training, we ﬁrst train the model on the data-abundant base object categories. Then, the model is ﬁne-tuned on a reconstructed training set that contains a small number of balanced training samples from both base and new object categories.
Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate the superiorities of our method.
The contributions of our work are summarized as follows:
• To boost both the generalization and discrimination abilities, we propose to build the generalization and discrimination spaces based on the sorted singular values.
• To further enhance the discrimination ability, we explore dictionary learning to capture high-level discriminative information from the discrimination map.
• By plugging our method into two two-stage methods, i.e., MPSR [35] and FSCE [30], our method signiﬁcantly improves their performances on PASCAL VOC [6, 7] and COCO [20]. 2
