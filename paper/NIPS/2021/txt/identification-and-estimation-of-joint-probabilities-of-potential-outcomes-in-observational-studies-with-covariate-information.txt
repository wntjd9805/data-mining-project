Abstract
The joint probabilities of potential outcomes are fundamental components of causal inference in the sense that (i) if they are identiﬁable, then the causal risk is also identiﬁable, but not vise versa (Pearl, 2009; Tian and Pearl, 2000) and (ii) they enable us to evaluate the probabilistic aspects of “necessity”,
“suﬃciency”, and “necessity and suﬃciency”, which are important concepts of successful explanation (Watson, et al., 2020). However, because they are not identiﬁable without any assumptions, various assumptions have been utilized to evaluate the joint probabilities of potential outcomes, e.g., the assumption of monotonicity (Pearl, 2009; Tian and Pearl, 2000), the inde-pendence between potential outcomes (Robins and Richardson, 2011), the condition of gain equality (Li and Pearl, 2019), and the speciﬁc functional relationships between cause and eﬀect (Pearl, 2009). Unlike existing identi-ﬁcation conditions, in order to evaluate the joint probabilities of potential outcomes without such assumptions, this paper proposes two types of novel identiﬁcation conditions using covariate information. In addition, when the joint probabilities of potential outcomes are identiﬁable through the proposed conditions, the estimation problem of the joint probabilities of potential outcomes reduces to that of singular models and thus they can not be evaluated by standard statistical estimation methods. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a new statistical estimation method based on the augmented Lagrangian method and shows the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators. Given space constraints, the proofs, the details on the statistical estimation method, some numerical experiments, and the case study are provided in the supplementary material. 1
