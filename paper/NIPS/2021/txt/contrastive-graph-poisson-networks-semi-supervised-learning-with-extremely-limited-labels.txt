Abstract
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable performance in the task of semi-supervised node classification. However, most existing GNN models require sufficient labeled data for effective network training. Their performance can be seriously degraded when labels are extremely limited. To address this issue, we propose a new framework termed Contrastive Graph Poisson Networks (CGPN) for node classification under extremely limited labeled data. Specifically, our CGPN derives from variational inference; integrates a newly designed Graph
Poisson Network (GPN) to effectively propagate the limited labels to the entire graph and a normal GNN, such as Graph Attention Network, that flexibly guides the propagation of GPN; applies a contrastive objective to further exploit the supervision information from the learning process of GPN and GNN models.
Essentially, our CGPN can enhance the learning performance of GNNs under extremely limited labels by contrastively propagating the limited labels to the entire graph. We conducted extensive experiments on different types of datasets to demonstrate the superiority of CGPN. 1

Introduction
Graph-based Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) refers to classifying unlabeled data based on a handful of labeled data and a given graph structure indicating the connections between all data. Recently, graph-based SSL has attracted increasing attention due to its solid mathematical foundation, and satisfactory performance [1, 2, 3].
As the mainstream to solve graph-based SSL problems, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which operate in the graph domain, have achieved impressive performance in recent years [4, 5, 6, 7].
Nevertheless, current GNNs, such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) [8] and graph attention networks (GATs) [9], require sufficient labeled data to obtain satisfactory generalization abilities.
Unfortunately, the reliance on sufficient labeled data increases the burden of data collection, and the number of labels can be extremely limited in some real-world scenarios. The performance of most

current GNNs seriously declines as the label size shrinks, since the scarce supervision signals are insufficient to train a model with satisfactory discriminative ability, see Figure 1. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have focused on semi-supervised classification with GNNs at extremely low label rates [10].
In line with the aforementioned observations, this paper proposes a new framework termed Con-trastive Graph Poisson Networks (CGPN) to ad-dress the problem of semi-supervised node clas-sification under extremely low label rates. Deriv-ing from the variational inference [12, 13], our proposed CGPN framework approximates the in-tractable posterior with a surrogate distribution, where two types of GNNs have been adopted for instantiation.
Accordingly, we first design a new Graph Poisson
Network (GPN) to propagate the limited labels to the entire graph effectively. Specifically, our GPN is motivated by Poisson learning [14]; flexibly models the Poisson label propagation based on attention mechanism; and leverages the structural information to better guide the propagation of labels. Meanwhile, we exploit another GNN, such as
GAT, together with the proposed GPN to model the approximated posterior according to variational inference.

GAT, and our proposed CGPN with different sizes of labeled data on Cora [11] dataset.
On this basis, we acquire predictions from two comparable views, where a contrastive objective can be naturally incorporated to jointly refine the learning process of the GPN and GNN models. Moreover, the supervision signals implicitly contained in the massive unlabeled data can be exploited with the formulated contrastive loss. As a result, the model learning ability of our proposed framework can be lifted. Experimental results on benchmark datasets confirm the strong benefits of our proposed
CGPN when dealing with semi-supervised node classification at very low label rates.
In summary, the contributions of this paper lie in three folds:
First, we propose a novel GNN framework termed CGPN to solve the semi-supervised node classifi-cation with extremely limited labels. CGPN significantly outperforms the existing GNNs.
Second, we design a new Graph Poisson Network (GPN). Different from the Poisson learning algorithm, our GPN incorporates graph-structure information and could be trained in an end-to-end manner to guide the propagation of labels more flexibly.
Third, we integrate contrastive learning into the variational inference framework, so that extra supervision information can be explored from the massive unlabeled data to help train our CGPN framework. 2 Problem description
We start by formally introducing the problem of graph-based SSL. Given a set of n = l + u examples
Ψ = {x1, · · · , xl, xl+1, · · · , xn}, where the first l examples are provided with the labels {yi}l i=1 and the remaining u examples constitute the unlabeled set with typically l ≪ u. Let X ∈ Rn×d denote the feature matrix with the i-th row formed by the feature vector xi, and Y ∈ Rn×c denote the label matrix with its (i, j)-th element Yij = 1 if xi belongs to the j-th class and 0 otherwise. Here d is the feature dimension and c is the number of classes. The dataset Φ is represented by an undirected graph G = ⟨V, E⟩, where V represents the node set containing all examples and E is the edge set modeling the similarity among the nodes/examples. The adjacency matrix of G is denoted as A, where Aij = 1 if there exists an edge between xi and xj and Aij = 0, otherwise. In this paper, we target transductive graph-based SSL which aims to find the labels yl+1, yl+2, · · · , yn of the unlabeled examples xl+1, xl+2, · · · , xn based on Ψ. 2
