Abstract
Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for graph clas-siﬁcation and representation learning. However, GNNs tend to suffer from over-smoothing problems and are vulnerable to graph perturbations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel topological neural framework of topological rela-tional inference (TRI) which allows for integrating higher-order graph information to GNNs and for systematically learning a local graph structure. The key idea is to rewire the original graph by using the persistent homology of the small neigh-borhoods of nodes and then to incorporate the extracted topological summaries as the side information into the local algorithm. As a result, the new framework enables us to harness both the conventional information on the graph structure and information on the graph higher order topological properties. We derive theoretical stability guarantees for the new local topological representation and discuss their implications on the graph algebraic connectivity. The experimental results on node classiﬁcation tasks demonstrate that the new TRI-GNN outperforms all 14 state-of-the-art baselines on 6 out 7 graphs and exhibit higher robustness to perturbations, yielding up to 10% better performance under noisy scenarios. 1

Introduction
Node classiﬁcation is one of the most active research areas in graph learning. The target here is, given a single attributed graph G and a small subset of nodes with prior label information, to predict labels of all remaining unlabelled nodes. Applications of node classiﬁcation are very diverse, ranging from customer attrition analytics to tracking corruption-convictions among politicians. Graph neural networks (GNNs) offer a powerful machinery for addressing such problems on large heterogeneous networks, resulting in an emerging ﬁeld of geometric deep learning (GDL) which adapts deep learning to non-Euclidean objects such as graphs [9, 51, 54, 16].
Although GDL achieves a highly competitive performance in various graph-based classiﬁcation and prediction tasks, similarly to the image domain deep learning on graphs is often found to be vulnerable to graph perturbations and adversarial attacks [43, 50, 26]. In turn, most recent results [42, 19] suggest that local graph information may be invaluable for robustifying GDL against graph perturbations and adversarial attacks. Also, as shown by [36, 4, 53] in conjunction with network community learning, local algorithms (i.e., algorithms based only on a small radius neighborhood around the node) may demonstrate superior performance if coupled with side information in the form of a node labeling positively correlated with the true graph structure. Inspired by these results, the ultimate goal of this 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021).
paper is to introduce the idea of local algorithms with local topological side information on similarity of node neighborhood shapes into GNN. By shape here, we broadly understand data characteristics which are invariant under continuous transformations such as stretching, bending, and compressing, and to study such graph shapes properties, we invoke the machinery of topological data analysis (TDA) [21, 11].
Topological Relational Inference: from Matchmaking to Adversarial Graph Learning and Be-yond In particular, to capture more complex graph properties and enhance model robustness, we introduce the concept of topological relational inference (TRI) and propose two novel options for information passing which rely on the local topological structure of each node: (i) Inject a new topology-induced multiedge between two nodes based on shape similarity of their local neighbor-hoods; (ii) Enrich each individual node features by harnessing local topological side information from its neighbors. The rationale behind our idea is multi-fold. First, we assess not only global graph topology and relationships between the feature sets of two individual nodes, as with the current diffusion mechanisms and random walks on graphs, but we also examine important interactions between shapes of the feature sets of the node neighborhoods. As a result, our new topology-induced multigraph representation (TIMR) of graph G in (i) strengthens the relationship among nodes which might not be (yet) connected by a visible (or "tangible") edge in G but whose higher order intrinsic characteristics are very similar. The intuitive analogy here might be with a matchmaking agency who aims to connect two people on a blind date, based on a careful assessment of interplay among similarities of their interests, socio-demographics as well as that of their close friends, rather than bringing in two individuals together through a random walk among all available proﬁles of potential candidates. Another example is the customer churn and retention analytics based on peer effects [15].
That is, the goal here is to classify the node as potential churn customer based not only on the individual attributes but on interactions among its neighbor attributes. Second, such a new multiedge in (i), based on shape similarity of node local neighborhoods may assist not only the matchmaking agency in coupling the most appropriate individuals (or link prediction in less romantic and more technical terms), but to enhance resilience of the graph structure and associated graph learning.
Indeed, a new multiedge in (i) can be used as an essential remedial ingredient in graph defense mechanisms as criteria to clean the perturbed graph, i.e., to reconstruct edges removed by the attacker or to suppress edges induced by the attacker, depending on the strength of the topology-induced link. Third, by learning shape properties within each local node neighborhood, our TRI allows for systematic recovering of intrinsic higher-order interactions among nodes well beyond a level of pair-wise connectivity, and such local topological side information in (ii) enhances accuracy in node classiﬁcation tasks even on clean graphs. Signiﬁcance of our contributions are the following:
• We propose a novel perspective to graph learning with GNN – topological relational inference, based on the idea of similarity among shapes of local node neighborhoods.
• We develop a new topology-induced multigraph representation of graphs which systematically accounts for the key local information on the attributed graphs and serves as an important remedial ingredient against graph perturbations and attacks.
• We derive theoretical stability guarantees for the new local topological representation of the graph and discuss their implications for the graph algebraic connectivity.
• Our expansive node classiﬁcation experiments show that TRI-GNN outperforms 14 state-of-the-art baselines on 6 out 7 graphs and delivers substantially higher robustness (i.e., up to 10% in performance gains under noisy scenarios) than baselines on all 7 datasets. 2
