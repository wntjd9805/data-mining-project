Abstract
We initiate the work towards a comprehensive picture of the worst average-case satisfaction of voting axioms in semi-random models, to provide a ﬁner and more realistic foundation for comparing voting rules. We adopt the semi-random model and formulation in [54], where an adversary chooses arbitrarily correlated “ground truth” preferences for the agents, on top of which random noises are added. We focus on characterizing the semi-random satisfaction of two well-studied voting axioms: Condorcet criterion and participation. We prove that for any ﬁxed num-ber of alternatives, when the number of voters n is sufﬁciently large, the semi-random satisfaction of the Condorcet criterion under a wide range of voting rules is 1, 1 − exp(−Θ(n)), Θ(n−0.5), exp(−Θ(n)), or being Θ(1) and 1 − Θ(1) at the same time; and the semi-random satisfaction of participation is 1−Θ(n−0.5). Our results address open questions by Berg and Lepelley [3] in 1994, and also conﬁrm the following high-level message: the Condorcet criterion is a bigger concern than participation under realistic models. 1

Introduction
The “widespread presence of impossibility results” [48] is one of the most fundamental and signif-icant challenges in social choice theory. These impossibility results often assert that no “perfect” voting rule exists for three or more alternatives [1, 28, 45]. Nevertheless, an (imperfect) voting rule must be designed and used in practice for agents to make a collective decision. In the social choice literature, the dominant paradigm of doing so has been the axiomatic approach, i.e., voting rules are designed, evaluated, and compared to each other w.r.t. their satisfaction of desirable normative properties, known as (voting) axioms.
Most deﬁnitions of dissatisfaction of voting axioms are based on worst-case analysis. For example, a voting rule r does not satisfy CONDORCET CRITERION (CC for short), if there exists a collection of votes, called a proﬁle, where the Condorcet winner exists but is not chosen by r as a winner. The
Condorcet winner is the alternative who beats all other alternatives in their head-to-head competi-tions. As another example, a voting rule r does not satisfy PARTICIPATION (PAR for short), if there exists a proﬁle and a voter who has incentive to abstain from voting. An instance of dissatisfaction of PAR is also known as the no-show paradox [19]. Unfortunately, when the number of alternatives m is at least four, no irresolute voting rule satisﬁes CC and PAR simultaneously [39].
While the classical worst-case analysis of (dis)satisfaction of axioms can be desirable in high-stakes applications such as political elections, it is often too coarse to serve as practical criteria for compar-ing different voting rules in more frequent, low-stakes applications of social choice, such as business decision-making [5], crowdsourcing [34], informational retrieval [33], meta-search engines [14], recommender systems [51], etc. A decision maker who desires both axioms would ﬁnd it hard to choose between a voting rule that satisﬁes CC but not PAR, such as Copeland, and a voting rule that satisﬁes PAR but not CC, such as plurality. A ﬁner and more quantitative measure of satisfaction of axioms is therefore called for. 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021).
One natural and classical approach is to measure the likelihood of satisfaction of axioms under a probabilistic model of agents’ preferences, in particular the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) uniform distribution over all rankings, known as Impartial Culture (IC) in social choice.
This line of research was initiated and established by Gehrlein and Fishburn in a series of work in the 1970’s [24, 26, 25], and has become a “new sub-domain of the theory of social choice” [13].
Some classical results were summarized in the 2011 book by Gehrlein and Lepelley [27], and recent progresses can be found in the 2021 book edited by Diss and Merlin [13].
While this line of work is highly signiﬁcant and interesting from a theoretical point of view, its practical implications may not be as strong, because most previous work focused on a few speciﬁc distributions, especially IC, which has been widely criticized to be unrealistic (see, e.g., [42, p. 30],
[23, p. 104], and [30]). Indeed, conclusions drawn under any speciﬁc distribution may not hold in practice, as “all models are wrong” [9]. Technically, characterizing the likelihood of satisfaction of CC and of PAR are already highly challenging w.r.t. IC, and despite that Berg and Lepelley [3] explicitly posed them as open questions in 1994, not much is known beyond a few voting rules.
Therefore, the following question largely remains open.
How likely are voting axioms satisﬁed under realistic models?
The importance of successfully answering this question is two-fold. First, it tells us whether the worst-case violation of an axiom is a signiﬁcant concern in practice. Second, it provides a ﬁner and more quantitative foundation for comparing voting rules.
We believe that the semi-random models [15], originally investigated by Blum [7] and [8] and in-cludes the models employed in the celebrated smoothed analysis proposed by Spielman and Teng
[49], provides a promising framework for addressing the question. In this paper, we adopt the semi-random model by Xia [54], which models the satisfaction of a per-proﬁle voting axiom X by a function X(r, P ) ∈ {0, 1}, where r is a voting rule and P is a proﬁle, such that r satisﬁes X if minP X(r, P ) = 1. Let Π denote a set of distributions over all rankings over the m alternatives (denoted by L(A)), which represents the “ground truth” preferences for a single agent that the ad-versary can choose from. Let n denote the number of agents. Because a higher value of X(r, P ) is more desirable to the decision maker, the adversary aims at minimizing expected X(r, P ) by choos-ing (cid:126)π ∈ Πn—the proﬁle P is generated from (cid:126)π. The semi-random satisfaction of X under r with n agents, denoted by (cid:101)X min
Π (r, n), is deﬁned as follows [54]:
Π (r, n) (cid:44) inf(cid:126)π∈Πn PrP ∼(cid:126)π X(r, P )
Notice that agents’ ground truth preferences can be arbitrarily correlated, while the noises are inde-pendent, which is a standard assumption in the literature and in practice [54]. (cid:101)X min (1)
Example 1 (Semi-Random CC under plurality). Let X = CC and r = Plu denote the ir-resolute plurality rule, which chooses all alternatives that are ranked at the top most often as the (co-)winners. Suppose there are three alternatives, denoted by A = {1, 2, 3}, and suppose
Π = {π1, π2}, where π1 and π2 are distributions shown in Table 1. we have (cid:102)CC
Then,
= inf(cid:126)π∈{π1,π2}n PrP ∼(cid:126)π CC(Plu, P ).
When n = 2, the adversary has four choices of (cid:126)π, i.e.,
{(π1, π1), (π1, π2), (π2, π1), (π2, π2)}. min
Π (Plu, n) 123
π1 1/4
π2 1/8 132 1/4 1/8 231 1/8 3/8 321 1/8 1/8 213 1/8 1/8 312 1/8 1/8
Table 1: Π in Example 1.
Each (cid:126)π leads to a distribution over the set of all proﬁles of two agents, i.e., L(A)2. We have min
Π (Plu, 2) = 1, because CC is satisﬁed at all proﬁles of two agents. As we will see later in (cid:102)CC
Example 3, for all sufﬁciently large n, (cid:102)CC min
Π (Plu, n) = exp(−Θ(n)). 1.1 Our Contributions
We initiate the work towards a comprehensive picture of semi-random satisfaction of voting axioms under commonly-studied voting rules, by focusing on CC and PAR in this paper due to their impor-tance, popularity, and incompatibility [39]. Recall that m is the number of alternatives and n is the number of agents. Our technical contributions are two-fold. 2
First, semi-random satisfaction of CC (Theorem 1 and 2). We prove that, under mild assump-tions, for any ﬁxed m ≥ 3 and any sufﬁciently large n, the semi-random satisfaction of CC under a wide range of voting rules is 1, 1 − exp(−Θ(n)), Θ(n−0.5), exp(−Θ(n)), or being Θ(1) and 1 − Θ(1) at the same time (denoted by Θ(1) ∧ (1 − Θ(1))). The 1 − exp(−Θ(n)) case is positive news, because it states that CC is satisﬁed almost surely when n is large, regardless of the adver-sary’s choice. The remaining three cases are negative news, because they state that the adversary can make CC to be violated with non-negligible probability, no matter how large n is.
Second, semi-random satisfaction of PAR (Theorems 3, 4, 5, 6). We prove that, under mild assumptions, for any ﬁxed m ≥ 3 and any sufﬁciently large n, the semi-random satisfaction of PAR under a wide range of voting rules is 1 − Θ(n−0.5). These are positive news, because they state that
PAR is satisﬁed almost surely for large n, regardless of the adversary’s choice. While this message may not be surprising at a high level, as the probability for a single agent to change the winner vanishes as n → ∞, the theorems are useful and non-trivial, as they provide asymptotically tight rates.
In particular, straightforward corollaries of our theorems to IC address open questions posed by Berg and Lepelley [3] in 1994, and also provides a mathematical justiﬁcation of two common beliefs related to PAR: ﬁrst, IC exaggerates the likelihood for paradoxes to happen, and second, the dissat-isfaction of PAR is not a signiﬁcant concern in practice [31], especially when it is compared to our results on semi-random CC. Table 2 summarizes corollaries of our results under some commonly-studied voting rules w.r.t. IC as well as the satisfaction of CC and PAR on Preﬂib data [35], where
Θ(1) ∧ (1 − Θ(1)) means that there exists constants 0 < α < β ≤ 1 that do not depend on n, such that the likelihood is in [α, β].

Table 2 provides a more quantitative way of comparing voting rules. Suppose the decision maker puts 50% weight (or any ﬁxed non-zero ratio) on both CC and PAR, and assume that the preferences are generated from IC. Then, when n is sufﬁciently large, the last ﬁve voting rules in the table (that satisfy CC) outperform the ﬁrst ﬁve voting rules in the table (the ﬁrst four satisﬁes PAR).
Beyond CC and PAR. Theorems 1–6 are proved by (non-trivial) applications of a categorization lemma (Lemma 1), which characterizes semi-random satisfaction of a large class of axioms that can be represented by unions of ﬁnitely many polyhedra, including CC and PAR. We believe that
Lemma 1 is a promising tool for analyzing other axioms in future work. 1.2
