Abstract
Episodic event memory is a key component of human cognition. Predicting event memorability, i.e., to what extent an event is recalled, is a tough challenge in memory research and has profound implications for artiﬁcial intelligence. In this study, we investigate factors that affect event memorability according to a cued recall process. Speciﬁcally, we explore whether event memorability is contingent on the event context, as well as the intrinsic visual attributes of image cues. We design a novel experiment protocol and conduct a large-scale experiment with 47 elder subjects over 3 months. Subjects’ memory of life events is tested in a cued recall process. Using advanced visual analytics methods, we build a ﬁrst-of-its-kind event memorability dataset (called R3) with rich information about event context and visual semantic features. Furthermore, we propose a contextual event memory network (CEMNet) that tackles multi-modal input to predict item-wise event memorability, which outperforms competitive benchmarks. The ﬁndings inform deeper understanding of episodic event memory, and open up a new avenue for prediction of human episodic memory. Source code is available at https:

Introduction 1
Episodic event memory is a key component of human cognition and intelligence. Maintaining high-level event memory is good for mental health and executive functioning [34]. Episodic memory can be enhanced by cognitive training, such as regular photo review that triggers the reactivation of certain memory traces [25, 42]. Recent advancements in visual lifelogging, including affordable hardware and powerful visual analysis software, make it possible to implement lifelog-based memory intervention [19, 31, 43]. However, without clear understanding of what factors inﬂuence event memory (e.g., what events have higher value for training? how to select “good” photo cues to boost training effect?), it is difﬁcult to design effective cognitive intervention programs. This study attempts to understand event memory, i.e., to what extent an event can be recalled. We probe the recall process with visual cues, and explore factors that inﬂuence event memorability. We aim to extend the understanding of event memory, beyond simple image recognition [22] and memory of event categories [8], to the prediction of item-wise event memorability using contextual visual semantics.
A few major gaps exist in this ﬁeld. First, there is scarcity of data for evaluating event memorability.
A sensible analysis requires rich event knowledge, including spatial-temporal information, personal experience and proﬁles, as well as quantiﬁable memory performance on the respective events. 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021).

Considering that life events are highly personalized and seldom repeatable, it is difﬁcult, if not impossible, to collect such data in laboratories by replicating a controlled process. This makes the generation of large dataset for event memorability study a major challenge. Second, event memory involves a complicated cognitive process in the human brain, so that the mapping relationship between event information and the memory outcome is obscure and fuzzy. It is affected by a number of factors, such as personal experience, cognitive status, and new, potentially conﬂicting input. Therefore, the memory outcome often has immense variability, making it extremely difﬁcult to be predicted reliably.
This study ﬁlls these gaps in three aspects. First, we develop a novel experiment protocol to collect personal life event information along with the human subjects’ memory outcome on selected events (Figure 1). We build a ﬁrst-of-its-kind event memorability dataset consisting of 10, 654 valid samples with rich information about event context and visual semantic features. Based on data collected in a large-scale user study with 47 elder subjects, each in three months, we apply a suite of visual analysis methods, such as contextual event segmentation (CES) and information-theoretic entropy analysis, which collectively extract visual semantic features and contextual information. Second, we provide evidence that event memorability is contingent on extrinsic, contextual information, as well as intrinsic visual attributes. Third, inspired by image memorability studies [45], we develop a simple yet effective contextual event memory network to predict event memorability by combining multi-modal visual semantics, including the image cues and multiple aspects of contextual information.
The model predicts item-wise event memorability with reasonable accuracy and serves as a baseline for more sophisticated methods. The dataset and baseline predicative model establish the foundation for developing computational models to decode human episodic memory. 2
