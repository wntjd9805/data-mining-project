Abstract
To deal with ambiguities in partial multi-label learning (PML), state-of-the-art methods perform disambiguation by identifying ground-truth labels directly. How-ever, there is an essential question:“Can the ground-truth labels be identiﬁed precisely?". If yes, “How can the ground-truth labels be found?". This paper provides afﬁrmative answers to these questions. Instead of adopting hand-made heuristic strategy, we propose a novel Mutual Information Label Identiﬁcation for Partial Multi-Label Learning (MILI-PML), which is derived from a clear probabilistic formulation and could be easily interpreted theoretically from the mutual information perspective, as well as naturally incorporates the feature/label relevancy into consideration. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets clearly demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed MILI-PML. 1

Introduction
Partial multi-label learning (PML) [1, 2] is a weakly supervised learning problem, where each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels, but only a part of them are the ground-truth labels while others are false positive labels.
In recent years, many real-world applications are arising due to the growing demand for identifying ground-truth labels from partially labeled data, which are easier and less costly to obtain. For example, in crowdsourcing image annotation, a web image might be annotated online by a potential unreliable annotator with many speciﬁc labels, but only some of them are accurate.
PML aims to train a classiﬁer from partially labeled data so as to predict the ground-truth labels for an unseen instance automatically. The main challenge is how to deal with the ambiguities caused by false positive labels in candidate label set. One straightforward way is to simply treat all candidate labels equally as the ground-truth labels, and then solve the PML problem by standard multi-label classiﬁcation methods [3, 4]. However, these methods can be easily misled by the noisy false-positive labels in the candidate set, and fail to generalize well in testing. To deal with the problem, the state-of-the-art PML research attempts to identify the ground-truth labels directly from the candidate label set, which becomes a popular and effective disambiguation strategy.
However, there are two fundamental issues, “Can the ground-truth labels be identiﬁed precisely?". If yes, “How can the ground-truth labels be found?". Moreover, the state-of-the-art PML methods are constructed by hand-designed heuristic modeling under considerations like feature/label correlations with no theoretical interpretation.
In this paper, instead of hand-made heuristic modeling, we propose a novel MILI-PML model, which is derived from a clear probabilistic formulation and can be easily interpreted theoretically by infor-mation theory. Besides, MILI-PML naturally incorporates the feature/label relevancy considerations rather than that of heuristic modeling. 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021).
To answer the ﬁrst question “CAN", we deﬁne an (cid:15)-identiﬁable score function to evaluate whether a
PML method is workable for identifying the ground-truth labels precisely. Moreover, we demonstrate that the derived MILI-PML is (cid:15)-identiﬁable under certain assumptions and conditions theoretically.
To answer the second question “HOW", we design an efﬁcient optimization algorithm called MILI
Algorithm to optimize the objective function.
Extensive experiments are conducted on six synthetic datasets as well as four real-world datasets.
The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed MILI-PML consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of ﬁve widely-used multi-label metrics including ranking loss, hamming loss, one error, coverage, and average precision. 2
