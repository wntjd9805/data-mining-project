Recently, there has been interest in utilizing machine-learned predictions to enhance the worst-case guarantees of online algorithms. This study focuses on the online knapsack problem and examines the impact of having limited predictions, specifically an upper and lower bound for the quantity of items with each value. Our research systematically develops online algorithms that achieve the optimal competitive ratio for any given prediction. Furthermore, we extend our findings to more complex scenarios such as generalized one-way trading and two-stage online knapsack. This work demonstrates that even seemingly weak predictions can be effectively employed to demonstrably enhance the performance of online algorithms.
