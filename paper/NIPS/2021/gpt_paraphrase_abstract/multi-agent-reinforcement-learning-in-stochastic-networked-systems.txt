We investigate multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) in a stochastic agent network, aiming to find localized strategies that maximize the overall reward. The main challenge lies in scalability, as the global state/action space can exponentially grow with the number of agents. Current scalable algorithms only work in cases with static, fixed, and local dependencies, such as those between neighboring agents in an unchanging graph. This study introduces a Scalable Actor Critic framework that accommodates non-local and stochastic dependencies, and presents a finite-time error bound that reveals how convergence rate is influenced by the network's information spread speed. Moreover, this analysis produces new finite-time convergence outcomes for a general stochastic approximation scheme and for temporal difference learning with state aggregation, extending beyond the context of MARL in networked systems.
