Heavy-tailed statistical distributions are commonly preferred over Gaussian distributions as they provide a more realistic model for data generation in financial markets. However, estimating graphs in heavy-tailed settings presents challenges due to mathematical complexities such as nonconvexities. This study introduces graph learning estimators based on the Markov random field framework, assuming a Student-t data generating process. To address the challenges, scalable numerical algorithms are designed using the alternating direction method of multipliers. These algorithms are capable of learning both connected and k-component graphs, and their theoretical convergence guarantees are provided. Experimental results using publicly available data from the S&P500 index, foreign exchanges, and cryptocurrencies demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing benchmarks.
