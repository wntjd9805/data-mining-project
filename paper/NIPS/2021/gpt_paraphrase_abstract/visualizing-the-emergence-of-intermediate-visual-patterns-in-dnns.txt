This paper presents a technique for visualizing the discriminatory power of visual patterns encoded by a deep neural network (DNN) at intermediate layers. The method allows us to observe how the DNN progressively learns regional visual patterns in each intermediate layer during training. Additionally, it demonstrates how the DNN utilizes non-discriminatory patterns in low layers to construct discriminative patterns in middle/high layers through forward propagation. By employing this visualization method, we can quantify the knowledge points, indicating the number of discriminative visual patterns learned by the DNN. This quantification helps us evaluate the representation capacity of the DNN. Furthermore, the proposed method offers insights into signal-processing behaviors of existing deep learning techniques, including adversarial attacks and knowledge distillation.
