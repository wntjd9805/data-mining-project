We propose a new approach to unpaired image-to-image translation that addresses the limitations of existing methods. These methods learn deterministic mappings without considering outliers or predictive uncertainty, leading to decreased performance when faced with unseen perturbations during testing. Our method, called Uncertainty-aware Generalized Adaptive Cycle Consistency (UGAC), introduces a probabilistic approach that models per-pixel residuals using a generalized Gaussian distribution capable of capturing heavy-tailed distributions. We compare our model with state-of-the-art methods on challenging tasks involving unpaired image translation in various domains, including autonomous driving, maps, facades, and medical imaging (MRI). Our experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits enhanced robustness against unseen perturbations in test data.
