We investigate the issue of list-decodable linear regression, where a majority of the examples can be corrupted by an adversary. We are given a set of labeled examples, with a fraction α being independent and identically distributed samples from a linear regression model, and the remaining fraction (1-α) drawn from a noise distribution. The objective is to produce a small list of hypothesis vectors, with at least one vector being close to the target regression vector. Our main finding is a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound of dpoly(1/α) for this problem. This lower bound aligns with the performance of existing algorithms, suggesting that current upper bounds for this task are nearly optimal.
