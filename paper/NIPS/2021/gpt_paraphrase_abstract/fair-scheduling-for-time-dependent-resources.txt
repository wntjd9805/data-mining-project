We investigate a problem of fairly allocating resources to machines operated by intelligent agents. The resources consist of interval jobs with specific release times, deadlines, and processing times. These jobs can only be processed if their complete processing period falls within their release time and deadline. Each machine earns different utilities by processing different jobs, and it is important that all jobs assigned to a machine are processed without overlapping. We explore two commonly studied solution concepts, maximin share fairness and envy-freeness, and examine the existence of fair allocations and propose constant approximation algorithms for different scenarios.
