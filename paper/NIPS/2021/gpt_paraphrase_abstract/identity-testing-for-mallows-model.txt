This paper presents identity tests for ranking data generated from the Mallows model in both asymptotic and non-asymptotic scenarios. Initially, two algorithms are devised to test the spread parameter of the Mallows model when the central ranking is known. The first algorithm is a Uniformly Most Powerful Unbiased (UMPU) test in the asymptotic setting, which is then converted into a sample-optimal non-asymptotic identity test. However, this test is impractical for medium-sized data as it requires computing the distribution of the sufficient statistic. The second non-asymptotic test is derived from an optimal learning algorithm for the Mallows model, offering both easy computation and sample optimality across a wide range of parameters. Furthermore, the paper addresses testing Mallows models for unknown central rankings by introducing a bias that exponentially decays with the sample size in the asymptotic setting. Extensive numerical experiments support the findings and demonstrate that the proposed tests scale effectively with the number of items to be ranked.
