We introduce a new stochastic algorithm named RSG+ for canonical correlation analysis (CCA) that utilizes a different parameterization of the projection matrices. This parameterization allows us to adapt established techniques for numerical optimization on Riemannian manifolds. Our approach complements existing methods for CCA that have either high time complexity per iteration and a slow convergence rate, or limited ability to extract multiple canonical components. In contrast, our algorithm achieves a better runtime complexity and convergence rate for extracting multiple canonical components. Although our focus is on the formulation and algorithm, our experiments demonstrate promising results on common datasets. We also explore the potential application of our algorithm in training fair models with missing sensitive attributes.
