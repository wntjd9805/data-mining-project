Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used in various domains to learn from graph-structured data. They have shown significant improvements compared to traditional heuristic approaches in tasks like node and graph classification. However, GNNs tend to perform poorly in link prediction because they heavily rely on smoothed node features rather than considering the graph structure, which is crucial for this task. To overcome this limitation, we propose Neighborhood Overlap-aware Graph Neural Networks (Neo-GNNs). Neo-GNNs learn structural features from an adjacency matrix and estimate overlapped neighborhoods to improve link prediction. Our approach generalizes neighborhood overlap-based heuristic methods and effectively handles overlapped multi-hop neighborhoods. Extensive experiments on Open Graph Benchmark datasets (OGB) demonstrate that Neo-GNNs consistently achieve state-of-the-art performance in link prediction.
