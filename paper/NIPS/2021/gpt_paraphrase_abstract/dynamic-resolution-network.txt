Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are often designed with many learnable parameters to ensure accuracy. However, deploying these networks on mobile devices can be costly. Recent research has focused on reducing redundancy in pre-defined architectures to address this issue. However, the redundancy in input resolution has not been fully explored. This paper introduces a novel dynamic-resolution network (DRNet) that adjusts the input resolution based on each input sample. The network includes a resolution predictor that determines the smallest resolution needed to accurately predict an image. This predictor is optimized alongside the network. During inference, each input image is resized to its predicted resolution to reduce computation burden. The authors conducted experiments on benchmark networks and datasets, demonstrating that DRNet can significantly reduce computational complexity. For example, DR-ResNet-50 achieved comparable performance with a 34% reduction in computation and a 1.4% increase in accuracy compared to the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet. The code for DRNet is available at [link].
