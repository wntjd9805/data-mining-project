Modeling the temporal behavior of a system in response to external stimuli is a fundamental challenge in various fields. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods are often ineffective when dealing with limited data samples and lack the ability to provide actionable insights beyond predictions. To address this, incorporating expert domain knowledge into ML models has shown promise. In the context of predicting patient health status and disease progression over time, where extensive domain knowledge from pharmacology is available, pharmacological models based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) are commonly used. However, these models only cover a limited set of variables, many of which are not observable in clinical settings. To bridge this gap, we propose the latent hybridization model (LHM), which combines expert-designed ODEs with machine-learned Neural ODEs to fully capture the dynamics of the system and establish connections between expert and latent variables and observable quantities. We assessed the performance of LHM using synthetic data and real-world intensive care data from COVID-19 patients. LHM consistently outperformed previous approaches, particularly when training data was scarce, such as during the early stages of the pandemic.
