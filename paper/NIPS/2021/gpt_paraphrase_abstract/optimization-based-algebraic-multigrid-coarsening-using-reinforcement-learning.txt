Large sparse linear systems of equations are commonly encountered in science and engineering, particularly in the context of discretizations of partial differential equations. Algebraic multigrid (AMG) methods are frequently used to solve such linear systems, supported by a substantial body of mathematical theory. To solve the system, a graph is constructed based on the unknowns, and each level of the multigrid solver requires the selection of an appropriate coarse graph, as well as restriction and interpolation operators that map to and from the coarse representation. The effectiveness of the multigrid solver heavily relies on this selection, and various methods have been developed over time. Recently, it has been shown that it is possible to directly learn the interpolation and restriction operators of AMG, given a coarse graph selection. In this study, we address the complementary problem of learning how to coarsen graphs for a multigrid solver, which is a crucial step in developing fully learnable AMG methods. We propose a method that utilizes a reinforcement learning (RL) agent based on graph neural networks (GNNs). This RL agent can learn to perform graph coarsening on small planar training graphs and can subsequently be applied to unstructured large planar graphs, assuming the node degree is bounded. Our experiments demonstrate that this method can generate superior coarse graphs compared to existing algorithms, even as the graph size increases and other graph properties vary. Additionally, we introduce an efficient inference procedure for graph coarsening, which achieves linear time complexity in graph size.
