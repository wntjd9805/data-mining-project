Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have made significant progress in synthesizing images. However, when the amount of training data is limited, the quality of synthesis decreases. Previous methods have used data augmentation to address overfitting in the discriminator, but still train it with a binary classification task (real vs. fake). In this study, we propose a data-efficient method called Instance Generation (InsGen) based on instance discrimination. In addition to distinguishing real and fake images, the discriminator is trained to differentiate between individual images, regardless of their source. This allows the discriminator to benefit from an infinite number of synthesized samples, reducing overfitting due to limited training data. We also introduce a noise perturbation strategy to enhance the discriminator's discriminative power. Furthermore, we use the discriminator's learned instance discrimination capability to encourage diverse generation by the generator. Our method is extensively evaluated on various datasets and training settings, and achieves notable improvements. Notably, on the FFHQ dataset with 2K training images, we outperform the state-of-the-art approach by 23.5% in terms of FID improvement.
