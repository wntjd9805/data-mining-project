To perform counterfactual reasoning in Structural Causal Models (SCMs), it is necessary to understand the causal mechanisms, which involve conditional distributions and deterministic functions. However, determining the causal mechanism is challenging as it cannot be uniquely identified through data gathered from observing and interacting with the world. Oberst& Sontag (2019) proposed Gumbel-max SCMs as an intuitive choice due to their counterfactual stability property. In contrast, we argue for selecting a causal mechanism based on quantitative criteria such as minimizing variance in estimating counterfactual treatment effects. We propose a parameterized family of causal mechanisms that extend the Gumbel-max approach. Our approach can be trained to minimize variance and other losses on a distribution of queries, resulting in lower variance estimates of counterfactual treatment effects compared to fixed alternatives. Additionally, our approach can generalize to unseen queries.
