This study focuses on few-shot object detection (FSOD), which involves detecting new objects with limited annotated samples. The goal is to enhance the generalization and discrimination abilities of detectors for new objects. The authors propose a novel method called SVD-Dictionary enhancement that utilizes Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to achieve this. By sorting the singular values, two separate spaces are created: a generalization space for localization and a discrimination space for classification. The eigenvectors associated with larger singular values are used for generalization, as they suppress variations and contain intrinsic object characteristics. On the other hand, the eigenvectors linked to smaller singular values contain category-related information and are utilized for discrimination. Dictionary learning is employed to capture high-level discriminative information from the discrimination space, thereby improving detection accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through experiments on PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in performance compared to the baseline, particularly in the 2-shot case in VOC split1. Visualization analysis confirms the instrumental role of the proposed method in FSOD.
