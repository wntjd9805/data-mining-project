This study introduces a Gaussian covariate generalization of the teacher-student model to overcome the limitations of the traditional Gaussian i.i.d. input data assumption. The new model allows the teacher and student to operate in different spaces using fixed but generic feature maps. Despite being solvable in closed form, this generalization accurately captures the learning curves of various realistic datasets, thus enhancing the potential of the teacher-student framework. The study offers two key contributions: first, a rigorous formula for the asymptotic training loss and generalization error is derived; second, several scenarios are presented where the model's learning curve matches that of realistic datasets learned using different methods and feature maps. The framework's strengths and limitations are discussed.
