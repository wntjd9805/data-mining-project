This paper explores the use of vector graphics as a data format for images, contrasting it with raster graphics commonly used in image recognition. Unlike raster graphics, vector graphics can be scaled without losing information or experiencing aliasing due to their analytic representation. Additionally, vector graphics provide valuable structural information about the grouping of low-level elements to form higher-level shapes. However, existing methods have not fully utilized these advantages. To address this, the paper focuses on object localization and classification tasks and proposes an efficient CNN-free pipeline called YOLaT (You Only Look at Text). YOLaT does not convert vector graphics into pixels (rasterization), but instead takes textual documents of vector graphics as input. It employs multi-graphs to model the structural and spatial information, and a dual-stream graph neural network to detect objects. Experimental results demonstrate that YOLaT outperforms baseline methods based on raster graphics in terms of both average precision and efficiency. The code for YOLaT is available at https://github.com/microsoft/YOLaT-VectorGraphicsRecognition.
