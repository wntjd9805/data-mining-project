Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have shown great effectiveness in analyzing graph data by aggregating node representations based on the assumption of network homophily. However, this assumption is not always valid in real-world scenarios where networks can exhibit heterophily or randomness. This raises the question of whether different network structures require different propagation mechanisms. In this study, we experimentally investigate this question and find that there are specific rules for propagation mechanisms based on network properties: 1-hop, 2-hop, and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) neighbors are more suitable for networks with complete homophily, complete heterophily, and randomness, respectively. However, real-world networks are complex and often exhibit diverse structural properties. To address this challenge, we propose a universal GCN framework called U-GCN. U-GCN incorporates a multi-type convolution to extract information from 1-hop, 2-hop, and kNN networks simultaneously and utilizes a discriminative aggregation method to fuse them for learning objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of U-GCN compared to existing methods. The U-GCN code and data are available at https://github.com/jindi-tju.
