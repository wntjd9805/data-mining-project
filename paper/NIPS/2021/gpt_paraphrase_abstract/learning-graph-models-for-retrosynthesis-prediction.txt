This study addresses the problem of retrosynthesis prediction in organic synthesis, which involves identifying precursor molecules that can be used to synthesize a desired molecule. To create effective neural models for this task, it is important to align the model design with the strategies used by chemists. In this paper, a graph-based approach is proposed, taking advantage of the fact that the graph structure of precursor molecules remains mostly unchanged during a chemical reaction. The model predicts the set of graph edits required to transform the target molecule into incomplete molecules called synthons. Subsequently, the model learns to expand synthons into complete molecules by attaching relevant leaving groups. This decomposition simplifies the model architecture, enhancing interpretability and manual correction. The proposed model achieves a top-1 accuracy of 53.7%, surpassing previous methods that do not rely on templates or rely on semi-templates.
