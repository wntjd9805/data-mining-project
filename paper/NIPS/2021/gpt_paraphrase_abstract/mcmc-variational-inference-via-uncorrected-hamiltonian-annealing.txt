We introduce a new method called Uncorrected Hamiltonian Annealing, which is based on Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) with Hamiltonian MCMC. This method addresses the challenges of tuning parameters in AIS by using differentiable transition kernels. Our approach provides tight and differentiable lower bounds on the log normalization constant of an unnormalized target distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms other existing approaches, and the ability to tune parameters using reparameterization gradients can lead to significant performance improvements.
