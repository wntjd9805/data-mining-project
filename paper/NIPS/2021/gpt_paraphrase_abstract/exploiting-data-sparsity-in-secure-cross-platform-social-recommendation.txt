Social recommendation has shown promise by using social correlation data in addition to traditional systems. However, existing works assume that all data is available to the recommendation platform, which is not the case in practice. User-item interaction data and user-user social data are typically generated by different platforms and contain sensitive information. Therefore, it is a challenge to perform secure and efficient social recommendation across different platforms with highly sparse data. This work introduces secure computation techniques into social recommendation and proposes S3Rec, a sparsity-aware secure cross-platform social recommendation framework. S3Rec improves recommendation performance by incorporating sparse social data while also protecting data privacy. Additionally, two secure sparse matrix multiplication protocols are proposed to enhance model training efficiency using homomorphic encryption and private information retrieval. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that S3Rec improves computation time and communication size significantly compared to the state-of-the-art model.
