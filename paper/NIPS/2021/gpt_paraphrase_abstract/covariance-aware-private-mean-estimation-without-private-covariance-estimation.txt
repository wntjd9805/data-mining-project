We introduce two efficient methods for estimating the mean of d-dimensional (sub)Gaussian distributions with unknown covariance. These estimators provide differential privacy and require fewer samples compared to existing methods. Our first estimator selects a point with high Tukey depth using the exponential mechanism, while the second estimator perturbs the empirical mean with noise calibrated to the empirical covariance. Both methods require data preprocessing to ensure differential privacy.
