Flood forecasting is crucial in mitigating the impact of floods, but current methods using physical water flow simulations are computationally expensive. To address this, we propose training a deep neural network to down-sample terrain maps, optimizing the coarse grid representation to match the fine grid solution. We create a specific dataset for this task and show that this approach significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining accuracy in flood prediction. We provide a reference implementation, along with documentation and code for dataset reproduction.
