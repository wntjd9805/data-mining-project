Learning the underlying relationship between data entities through graph topology is crucial in machine learning and data analysis. Traditional methods use explicit convex functions to represent topological priors, but they lack flexibility in learning complex structures. To address this, we propose a method based on learning to optimize (L2O). Our model converts an iterative primal-dual splitting algorithm into a neural network, replacing the key structural proximal projection with a variational autoencoder. This enhances the estimated graph's topological properties. The model is trained end-to-end using pairs of node data and graph samples. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that our model is more efficient than classic iterative algorithms in learning graphs with specific topological properties.
