Spatial networks are networks that are constrained by geometry and embedded in real space, which greatly impacts their topological properties. While there have been advancements in representing spatial and network information separately, there is a lack of research on representing spatial networks. To overcome this, this paper introduces a generic framework for learning representations of spatial networks. The framework includes a representation that is invariant to node permutation, rotation, and translation, ensuring that both spatial and network information are considered. Additionally, a higher-order spatial network convolution operation that aligns with the proposed representation is introduced. To improve efficiency, a new approach is proposed that utilizes sampling random spanning trees, reducing time and space complexity. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.
