This research focuses on developing models that can predict future human motion based on past video frames. The study suggests that human motion is closely linked to the actions being performed, and proposes exploring action context to improve motion prediction. To accomplish this, the researchers create an action-specific memory bank to store representative motion dynamics for each action category. They also design a query-read process to retrieve relevant motion dynamics from the memory bank, which act as a strong prior knowledge for guiding motion prediction. Additionally, an action constraint loss is formulated to ensure the overall semantic consistency of the predicted motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 3D human motion prediction.
