This paper investigates the concept of overparameterization in the context of meta-learning. While previous research has focused on overparameterization in supervised learning, this study aims to understand its implications for meta-learning. The authors examine a sequence of linear-regression tasks and address two key questions: (1) How can we determine the optimal linear representation of features for a new task based on previous tasks? and (2) How many samples are needed to construct this representation? Surprisingly, the authors find that overparameterization naturally emerges as the solution to these questions. They demonstrate that learning the optimal representation involves designing a task-specific regularization technique that promotes inductive bias. This bias explains why overparameterization is beneficial for meta-learning, in contrast to prior work on few-shot learning. Additionally, the authors develop a theory that explains how feature covariance can implicitly reduce the sample complexity and estimation error. By combining these insights, they present a performance guarantee for their meta-learning algorithm. The findings are supported by numerical experiments using both real and synthetic data.
