This abstract discusses the importance of the doubly robust (DR) estimator in causal inference, which involves two nuisance parameters: the conditional mean outcome and the logging policy. The paper introduces a new DR estimator specifically designed for dependent samples obtained from adaptive experiments. To handle non-Donsker nuisance estimators and obtain an asymptotically normal semiparametric estimator, the paper proposes a variant of sample-splitting called adaptive-fitting. Additionally, the paper presents an empirical paradox, where the proposed DR estimator outperforms other estimators that utilize the true logging policy. This phenomenon is not explained by traditional explanations based on asymptotic efficiency, and simulation studies confirm this hypothesis.
