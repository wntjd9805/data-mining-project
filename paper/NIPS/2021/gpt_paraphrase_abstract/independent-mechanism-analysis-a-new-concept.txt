Independent component analysis (ICA) is a reliable method for learning representations without supervision. It has a strong theoretical foundation regarding the identifiability of the hidden factors responsible for generating the data, even when only mixtures of these factors are observed. However, when the mixing is nonlinear, the model becomes nonidentifiable because statistical independence alone is not sufficient to solve the problem. To address this issue, identifiability can be restored by introducing additional variables that are typically observed during the generative process. Instead of taking this traditional approach, we explore a different direction by incorporating assumptions based on independent causal mechanisms, which are commonly used in the field of causality. Inspired by the notion that each source independently influences the mixing process, we propose a new framework called independent mechanism analysis. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we demonstrate that our approach overcomes several nonidentifiability challenges that arise in nonlinear blind source separation.
