We aim to predict future demands for taxi rides based on historical data of ride counts between departure and destination locations. Additionally, we seek to effectively and efficiently forecast future events in a data stream with evolving seasonal patterns. To address this, we propose a method called Shifting Seasonal Matrix Factorization (SSMF). SSMF can adaptively learn multiple seasonal patterns (regimes) and switch between them. Our approach offers the following advantages: (a) it accurately predicts future events by detecting shifts in seasonal patterns as the data stream progresses; (b) it operates in an online setting, processing each observation quickly and with minimal memory usage; (c) it effectively identifies regime shifts without human intervention through a lossless data compression scheme. Through experiments on three real-world data streams, we demonstrate that our algorithm surpasses state-of-the-art baseline methods in accurately forecasting upcoming events.
