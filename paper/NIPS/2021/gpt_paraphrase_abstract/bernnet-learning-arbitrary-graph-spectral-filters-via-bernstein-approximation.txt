Existing graph neural networks (GNNs) approximate graph convolutions using graph spectral filters. However, these approaches either use predefined filter weights or learn them without necessary constraints, resulting in oversimplified or ill-posed filters. To address this, we propose BernNet, a novel GNN that offers a simple but effective method for designing and learning arbitrary graph spectral filters. BernNet estimates the filters using an order-K Bernstein polynomial approximation over the normalized Laplacian spectrum of a graph, and designs their spectral properties by setting the coefficients of the Bernstein basis. Additionally, the coefficients (and corresponding filter weights) can be learned based on observed graphs and their associated signals, allowing BernNet to specialize for the given data. Experimental results demonstrate that BernNet can learn various spectral filters, including complex band-rejection and comb filters, and outperforms other methods in real-world graph modeling tasks.
