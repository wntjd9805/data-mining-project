We examine a real-time iteration (RTI) approach for solving online optimization problems in nonlinear optimal control. The proposed RTI scheme alters the existing RTI-based model predictive control (MPC) algorithm by dynamically selecting the stepsize of each Newton step using a differentiable exact augmented Lagrangian. This adaptation allows the scheme to adjust the penalty parameters of the augmented Lagrangian in real-time, which are proven to stabilize after a certain amount of time. We demonstrate that the scheme achieves global convergence by selecting stepsize instead of always employing a full Newton step, as done by most existing RTIs. Regardless of the initial point, the KKT residuals of the subproblems converge to zero under generic assumptions. A crucial aspect is demonstrating the continuous decrease of the augmented Lagrangian as the horizon progresses. We validate the global convergence behavior of the proposed RTI scheme through a numerical experiment.
