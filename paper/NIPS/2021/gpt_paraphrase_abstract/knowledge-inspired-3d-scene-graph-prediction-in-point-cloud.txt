This paper proposes a novel method for predicting 3D scene graphs based solely on point clouds, using prior knowledge integration. The approach involves addressing two sub-problems: knowledge learning and scene graph prediction. Unlike traditional methods that rely on visual information, this method aims to minimize misunderstandings caused by appearance similarities and other perceptual confusion. A graph auto-encoder is employed to extract class-dependent representations and topological patterns from class labels and their intrinsic graphical structures, enabling the prior knowledge to avoid errors and noises. A scene graph prediction model is then developed to predict reliable relationship triplets by incorporating prototype knowledge and perceptual information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully learns representative knowledge embeddings and significantly improves the accuracy of relationship predictions. It also outperforms other scene graph prediction methods, establishing its state-of-the-art performance.
