Haze, a common type of adverse weather caused by atmospheric scattering, reduces visibility and impairs computer vision algorithms. Although single-image dehazing methods have proven effective in various scenes, they rely on manually crafted priors or learned features that do not generalize well to real-world images. While polarization information can alleviate this issue, existing polarization-based methods struggle with real-world images as they assume minimal polarization in transmitted light and necessitate specific clues to estimate required physical parameters. This paper presents a generalized physical formation model for hazy images and a robust polarization-based dehazing pipeline that does not rely on the aforementioned assumptions or requirements. The pipeline incorporates a tailored neural network. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on both synthetic data and real-world hazy images.
