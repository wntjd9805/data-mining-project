Adversarial robustness is crucial in many machine learning applications, but there are still unanswered questions about it. This study focuses on the Bayes optimality for adversarial robustness and presents general conditions for the existence of a Bayes optimal classifier. These findings can be valuable for further research on surrogate losses and their consistency properties in adversarial robustness.
