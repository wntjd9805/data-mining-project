Deep learning has revolutionized image restoration by balancing fine-grained details and high-level contextualized information. However, current methods lack rationality and neglect prior knowledge of restoration tasks. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework inspired by Taylor's Approximations. We utilize Taylor's Formula to construct our framework, where the main and derivative parts of the approximations correspond to the competing goals of contextualized information and spatial details in restoration. Our framework comprises two steps: one for learning contextualized information and another for progressively recovering spatial details. Our approach can easily integrate with existing methods and achieve further improvements. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our framework. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.
