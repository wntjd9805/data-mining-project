We propose novel techniques for learning Bayesian networks that enable efficient inference. Instead of relying on the traditional treewidth measure, we introduce the use of maximum state space size as a more precise indicator of the reasoning complexity of a Bayesian network. This allows us to consider variables with different domain sizes. Our approach combines heuristic algorithms for learning the structure of Bayesian networks with the recently developed MaxSAT-powered local improvement method (PeruvembaRamaswamy and Szeider, AAAIâ€™21). Experimental results demonstrate that our new learning methods generate Bayesian networks that enable significantly faster exact probabilistic inference compared to networks learned using treewidth bounds.
