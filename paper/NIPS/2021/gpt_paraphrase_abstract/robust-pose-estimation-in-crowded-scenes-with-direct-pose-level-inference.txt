This paper presents a novel approach called PINet for multi-person pose estimation in crowded scenes. The current challenges in this field include difficulties in detecting person bounding boxes and inferring pose cues due to overlapping and occlusions. To overcome these challenges, PINet introduces a direct pose-level inference strategy that eliminates the need for bounding box detection and key-point grouping. Instead of inferring individual keypoints, PINet directly predicts complete pose cues for each person based on their visible body parts. PINet utilizes the Part-based Pose Generation (PPG) to estimate multiple coarse poses for each person using their body parts. These coarse poses are then refined using the Pose Refinement module, which incorporates pose priors. Finally, the refined poses are fused together in the Pose Fusion module. To differentiate overlapped persons, PINet relies on discriminative body parts. It also leverages visual body cues to infer global pose cues. Experimental results on various crowded scenes pose estimation benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of PINet. For example, it achieves a significantly higher average precision (AP) of 59.8% on the OCHuman dataset compared to recent works.
