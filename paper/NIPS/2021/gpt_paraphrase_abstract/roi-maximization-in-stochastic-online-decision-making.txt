We present a new theoretical framework for maximizing Return On Investment (ROI) in repeated decision-making situations. This framework is particularly relevant for companies that regularly receive proposals for technological innovations and need to make quick decisions on their implementation. To address this, we develop an algorithm that learns decision-making policies aimed at maximizing ROI for a sequence of innovation proposals. Our algorithm is proven to converge to an optimal policy within the class Π, with a convergence rate of order min (cid:8)1/(N ∆2), N −1/3}, where N represents the number of innovations and ∆ is the suboptimality gap within Π. A major distinguishing factor of our approach, as compared to other online learning problems like bandits, is that running a policy does not yield an unbiased estimate of its performance.
