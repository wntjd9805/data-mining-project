Deep-learning based Super-Resolution (SR) methods have shown promise in improving the quality of low-resolution (LR) images when the blur kernel is known. However, in practical applications, the blur kernels of LR images are often unknown. This can lead to significant performance degradation when the degradation process of training images differs from that of real images. In this study, we propose a new blind SR framework that can enhance LR images degraded by any blur kernel by accurately estimating the kernel in the frequency domain. Our approach is the first deep learning method to estimate blur kernels in the frequency domain. We demonstrate that representing features in the frequency domain is more effective for blur kernel reconstruction than in the spatial domain. We introduce a Spectrum-to-Kernel (S2K) network that can estimate general blur kernels in various forms. By combining a Conditional GAN (CGAN) with an SR-oriented optimization target, our network learns to translate degraded images' spectra into unknown kernels. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world images show that our method significantly reduces blur kernel estimation error, allowing non-blind SR methods to effectively work in blind settings. Our method also outperforms state-of-the-art blind SR methods, achieving an average improvement of 1.39dB and 0.48dB for scale factors 2× and 4×, respectively, in common blind SR settings (with Gaussian kernels).
