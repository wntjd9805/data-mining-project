Partial Domain Adaptation (PDA) is a method used to address the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation when the target label space is a subset of the source label space. Existing PDA methods typically assign weights to classes or individual samples to handle inconsistent label spaces, aiming to discard irrelevant source data. However, we argue that samples from these irrelevant classes still contain valuable information for positive transfer. In this study, we propose the Implicit Semantic Response Alignment to uncover the inherent relationships among different categories by applying a weighted schema at the feature level. Specifically, we introduce a class2vec module to extract implicit semantic topics from visual features. Using an attention layer, we calculate the semantic response based on each implicit semantic topic. Then, we align the semantic responses of source and target data to preserve relevant information from multiple categories by weighting the features instead of the samples. Our experiments on various cross-domain benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to state-of-the-art PDA methods. Furthermore, we conduct in-depth analyses to gain further insights into the implicit semantic alignment.
