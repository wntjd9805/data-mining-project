This paper presents a novel method for computing prediction intervals in non-parametric regression that can effectively handle skewed data. The method utilizes black-box machine learning algorithms to estimate the conditional distribution of the outcome using histograms. It then converts the estimated distribution into prediction intervals with the shortest possible length and approximate conditional coverage. The resulting prediction intervals are shown to have reliable coverage in finite samples and achieve optimal length in asymptotic scenarios, assuming consistency of the black-box model. The method is evaluated using simulated and real data, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing approaches such as conformalized quantile regression and other distributional conformal prediction methods.
