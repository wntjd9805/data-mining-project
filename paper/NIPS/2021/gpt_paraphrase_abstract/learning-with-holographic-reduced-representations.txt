Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR) are a technique for symbolic artificial intelligence (AI) using real-valued vectors. This approach, which has been mostly used in older symbolic AI and cognitive science, is now being revisited to explore its potential for integration with deep learning as a differentiable component. However, HRRs suffer from numerical instability, making them ineffective in a differentiable solution. To address this issue, we propose a projection step that ensures the vectors exist in a well-behaved point in space. This improvement significantly enhances the concept retrieval effectiveness of HRRs. We demonstrate the use of HRR properties in developing an output layer and loss function for multi-label classification, enabling effective learning. By employing an HRR neuro-symbolic learning approach, we are able to examine its advantages and disadvantages.
