This study explores the capability of advanced spatiotemporal deep neural networks to track moving objects, similar to how higher biological visual systems do. The researchers introduce PathTracker, a visual challenge that requires humans and machines to track a target object among similar-looking distractor objects. While humans excel at PathTracker and adapt to variations in the task, deep networks struggle. To overcome this limitation, the researchers analyze and model circuit mechanisms in biological brains that are involved in object tracking based on motion cues. By implementing this model as a recurrent network, they achieve a robust visual strategy that performs similarly to humans on PathTracker and explains a significant portion of their decision-making. The circuit model's success also extends to object tracking in natural videos. Integrating it into a transformer-based architecture enhances tolerance to visual disturbances that affect object appearance, setting a new benchmark on the TrackingNet challenge. This research emphasizes the importance of understanding human vision to advance computer vision capabilities.
