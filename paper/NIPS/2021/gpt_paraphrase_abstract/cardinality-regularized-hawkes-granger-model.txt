A new framework is proposed for learning causal relationships in temporal event data, specifically focusing on a type of point process called the Hawkes process. Existing algorithms for sparse causal learning in the Hawkes process suffer from a singularity issue, resulting in sparse solutions that are only numerical artifacts. To address this, a mathematically defined sparse causal learning framework is introduced, utilizing a cardinality-regularized Hawkes process to overcome the problems of previous approaches. The proposed algorithm is applied to instance-wise causal event analysis, where sparsity is crucial. The framework is validated using real-world scenarios in the power grid and cloud data center management domains.
