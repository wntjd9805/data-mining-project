Mammals have specialized pathways in their visual system that support specific behaviors. The ventral pathway is responsible for visual recognition, while the dorsal pathway is involved in movement. Previous studies have focused on modeling the ventral pathway using deep neural networks, but it is unclear if both pathways can be modeled with a single network. In this study, we investigate whether a single model with a single loss function can capture the characteristics of both pathways. We use data from mice, which have similar specialized pathways, and train a deep neural network with two parallel pathways using a self-supervised predictive loss function. Our results show that this approach outperforms other models in fitting the mouse visual cortex and successfully models both the dorsal and ventral pathways. These findings suggest that self-supervised predictive learning can account for the functional specialization observed in mammalian visual systems.
