We focus on optimizing combinatorial congestion games (CCGs) in Stackelberg models, with the goal of achieving desirable equilibria despite the selfish behavior of non-atomic players. These models are important for designing social infrastructures like traffic and communication networks. However, existing computational approaches face two challenges: (I) the structure of bilevel programming and (II) the combinatorial nature of CCGs. To overcome these challenges, we propose a solution that combines differentiable optimization and zero-suppressed binary decision diagrams (ZDDs), which efficiently represent sets of combinatorial strategies. Our algorithm approximates CCG equilibria and allows for differentiation with respect to CCG parameters using automatic differentiation. This enables us to apply gradient-based methods to Stackelberg models of CCGs. Our method incorporates Nesterov's acceleration and leverages the compactness of ZDDs, enabling us to handle CCGs with a large number of strategies. Experiments on real-world network design scenarios demonstrate the practicality of our approach.
