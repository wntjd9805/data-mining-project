AutoML aims to automate the design of neural networks for new tasks in unexplored areas. In line with this objective, our study focuses on enabling users to identify the appropriate neural operations based on their specific domain data. We introduce XD-Operations, a set of operations that replicate the inductive bias of standard multi-channel convolutions but offer greater expressiveness. Through our research, we demonstrate that XD-Operations encompass numerous named operations across various application domains. We illustrate how to convert any standard backbone, such as ResNet, into a search space using XD-Operations and propose a straightforward weight-sharing scheme for traversing this space. Our approach consistently outperforms baseline networks and often surpasses expert-designed domain-specific methods in solving tasks like PDEs, protein folding distance prediction, and music modeling.
