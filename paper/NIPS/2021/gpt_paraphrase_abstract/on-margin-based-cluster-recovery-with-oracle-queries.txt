We examine a problem involving the recovery of clusters using a limited number of queries. The problem involves determining whether two points belong to the same cluster. We introduce a concept of margin between clusters, which encompasses previous margin definitions used in similar studies. We develop algorithms that can recover all clusters using a small number of queries, under certain margin assumptions. For convex clusters, we present an algorithm that recovers clusters exactly and with fewer queries compared to existing algorithms. In cases where clusters do not have a defined shape, we propose an algorithm that achieves near-optimal query bounds based on the packing number of the space. Additionally, we provide a combinatorial characterization of the number of queries required for cluster recovery in binary concept classes, and demonstrate the equivalence between this characterization and our margin condition for many concept classes. Our findings highlight the strong relationship between cluster margins and the ability to actively recover clusters.
