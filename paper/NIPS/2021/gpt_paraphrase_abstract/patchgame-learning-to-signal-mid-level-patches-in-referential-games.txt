We examine a referential game, a form of signaling game, in which two agents communicate through a discrete bottleneck to achieve a shared objective. In this game, the speaker aims to create a message or symbolic representation of significant image patches, while the listener's task is to match the speaker's message to a different perspective of the same image. Our research demonstrates that the two agents can establish a communication protocol without explicit or implicit guidance. We also explore the resulting protocol and its potential applications, such as enhancing the efficiency of Vision Transformers by focusing solely on important patches and utilizing it for pre-training in recognition tasks like classification.
