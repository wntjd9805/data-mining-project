This study focuses on A/B/n testing and examines a finite set of distributions (arms), with one arm designated as the control. The population is divided into homogeneous subpopulations, and at each time step, a subpopulation is randomly selected and an arm is chosen. The resulting observation from the chosen arm is an independent draw based on the subpopulation. The quality of each arm is evaluated using a weighted combination of its subpopulation means. The authors propose a sequential strategy for selecting one arm per time step in order to quickly determine if any arms have a higher weighted expectation than the control. The strategy is proven to be asymptotically optimal, meaning that the time it takes to output the correct answer with a given probability decreases linearly with the logarithm of the inverse of that probability. The paper identifies this optimal rate in three different scenarios: when the experimenter does not have access to subpopulation information, when the subpopulation of each sample is observed but not chosen, and when the experimenter can select the subpopulation for each response. The effectiveness of the strategy is demonstrated through numerical simulations using synthetic and real data from an A/B/n experiment.
