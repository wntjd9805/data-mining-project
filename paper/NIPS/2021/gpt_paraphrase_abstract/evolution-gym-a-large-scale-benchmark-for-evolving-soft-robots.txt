Design and control are both important factors in a robot's performance, but the focus has been primarily on control rather than design optimization. The lack of a comprehensive evaluation benchmark for co-optimization has hindered progress in this area. To address this, we introduce Evolution Gym, a large-scale benchmark for co-optimizing the design and control of soft robots. Our benchmark includes diverse robot compositions using different types of voxels, allowing for modular and expressive design options. The benchmark covers various tasks such as locomotion and manipulation on different terrains. We develop robot co-evolution algorithms by combining design optimization methods and deep reinforcement learning techniques. Evaluating these algorithms on our benchmark, we observe increasingly complex behaviors and successful task completion. Interestingly, the evolved robot designs often resemble natural creatures and outperform hand-designed robots. However, none of the tested algorithms were able to succeed in the most challenging environments, indicating the need for more advanced algorithms to explore the high-dimensional design space and evolve intelligent robots. We provide a website with code, environments, documentation, and tutorials to facilitate further research and progress in this field.
