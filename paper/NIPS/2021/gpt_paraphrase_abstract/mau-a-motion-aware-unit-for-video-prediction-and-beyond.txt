The paper introduces a Motion-Aware Unit (MAU) for accurately predicting inter-frame motion in video prediction tasks. The MAU consists of an attention module and a fusion module. The attention module learns an attention map based on correlations between current and historical spatial states, which is then used to aggregate historical temporal states into an augmented motion information (AMI). This allows the predictive unit to capture more temporal dynamics from a wider receptive field. The fusion module combines the AMI with the current appearance information to generate the final predicted frame. The MAU has low computational load and can be easily integrated into other predictive models. The paper also employs an information recalling scheme to preserve visual details in the predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the MAU outperforms existing methods in both video prediction and early action recognition tasks.
