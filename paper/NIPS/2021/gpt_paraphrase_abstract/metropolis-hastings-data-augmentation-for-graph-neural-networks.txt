Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) often struggle to generalize well due to limited labeled data, despite their promising performance on graph-based tasks. Data augmentation is a common technique used to enhance model generalization in various domains. However, designing effective augmentation methods for graphs is challenging due to the non-Euclidean nature of data and the interdependencies between samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework called Metropolis-Hastings Data Augmentation (MH-Aug) for semi-supervised learning. MH-Aug generates augmented graphs from an explicit target distribution, allowing for flexible control over augmentation strength and diversity. Since directly sampling from the complex target distribution is difficult, we employ the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to obtain augmented samples. Additionally, we present a simple yet effective semi-supervised learning strategy utilizing the generated samples from MH-Aug. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MH-Aug significantly enhances GNN performance by generating a sequence of samples aligned with the target distribution.
