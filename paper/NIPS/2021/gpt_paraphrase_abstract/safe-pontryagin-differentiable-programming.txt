We present a methodology called Safe Pontryagin Differentiable Programming (Safe PDP) that offers a theoretical and algorithmic framework for addressing safety-critical learning and control problems. These problems require the guarantee of satisfying safety constraints at every stage of the learning and control process. Similar to interior-point methods, Safe PDP incorporates various types of system constraints on states and inputs by including them as barrier functions in the cost or loss. We establish three key principles of Safe PDP: firstly, the solution and its gradient can be approximated by solving their unconstrained counterparts, resulting in improved efficiency; secondly, the level of approximation can be controlled through a barrier parameter to achieve any desired level of accuracy; and thirdly, all intermediate results during the approximation and optimization strictly adhere to the constraints, ensuring safety throughout the entire learning and control process. We showcase the capabilities of Safe PDP by successfully solving a range of safety-critical tasks, including safe policy optimization, safe motion planning, and learning Model Predictive Controllers (MPCs) from demonstrations. These tasks are demonstrated on challenging systems such as a 6-DoF maneuvering quadrotor and a 6-DoF rocket powered landing.
