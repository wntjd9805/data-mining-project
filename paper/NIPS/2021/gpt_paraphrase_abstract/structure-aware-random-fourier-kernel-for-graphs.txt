We propose a novel structure-aware random Fourier (SRF) kernel for Gaussian Processes (GPs) that is particularly useful for modeling graph-structured data. The SRF kernel is defined using a spectral distribution based on the Fourier duality given by Bochner's theorem. This allows us to transform the kernel learning problem into a distribution inference problem. Additionally, the SRF kernel can be formulated using random Fourier features, making it scalable for optimization. We also demonstrate that the SRF kernel can leverage geometric structures by taking subgraphs as inputs. To optimize GPs with the SRF kernel, we develop a variational EM algorithm that alternates between an inference procedure and a learning procedure. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in object classification and link prediction tasks.
