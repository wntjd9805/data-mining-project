This paper introduces a unified framework called K-Net for semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentations. K-Net utilizes a group of learnable kernels to consistently segment instances and semantic categories. To overcome the challenge of distinguishing different instances, the framework proposes a kernel update strategy that allows each kernel to adapt dynamically and conditionally based on its relevant group in the input image. K-Net can be trained end-to-end using bipartite matching and does not require non-maximum suppression (NMS) or bounding boxes. Despite its simplicity, K-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in panoptic segmentation and semantic segmentation tasks. It also achieves comparable instance segmentation performance to Cascade Mask R-CNN but with significantly faster inference speeds. The code and models for K-Net will be made available at https://github.com/ZwwWayne/K-Net/.
