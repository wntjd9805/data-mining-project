We present a new problem called Collaborative Causal Discovery, which addresses the simultaneous learning of multiple independent causal graphs. In this scenario, each entity has its own causal graph, and our objective is to learn all of these graphs together. We approach this problem without assuming causal sufficiency, using Maximal Ancestral Graphs (MAG) to model the causal relationships. We also assume that we can actively intervene on individual entities by performing single vertex interventions. If the underlying causal graphs of the entities exhibit a natural clustering property, we propose algorithms that exploit this property and successfully recover all the causal graphs. These algorithms require a logarithmic number of atomic interventions per entity, which is significantly fewer than the number of interventions needed to learn each causal graph separately. We support our findings with a lower bound and discuss potential extensions to our collaborative framework.
