We propose a new approach called heavy ball neural ordinary differential equations (HBNODEs) to enhance the training and inference of neural ODEs (NODEs). HBNODEs have two key advantages over NODEs: (i) The adjoint state of an HBNODE also satisfies an HBNODE, leading to faster forward and backward ODE solvers and reducing the number of function evaluations required. This improves the usefulness of trained models. (ii) HBNODEs have a well-structured spectrum, allowing effective learning of long-term dependencies in complex sequential data. We demonstrate the advantages of HBNODEs over NODEs in various tasks, such as image classification, learning complex dynamics, and sequential modeling. Our method requires significantly fewer function evaluations, achieves higher accuracy, and learns long-term dependencies more effectively than other ODE-based neural network models. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/hedixia/HeavyBallNODE.
