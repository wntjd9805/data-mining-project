Hyperspectral imaging has a wide range of applications, including environmental monitoring, precision farming, and astrophysics. However, the diverse spectral information also poses challenges due to degradation and the lack of accurate ground-truth data. Training deep neural networks for restoration is particularly difficult compared to traditional RGB imaging. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach based on sparse coding principles, which combines classical techniques with handcrafted image priors. This approach allows for end-to-end training of model parameters with limited data, while maintaining interpretability. Our method is computationally efficient and significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art denoising techniques.
