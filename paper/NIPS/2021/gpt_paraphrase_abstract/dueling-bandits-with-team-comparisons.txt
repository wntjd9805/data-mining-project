We present a new problem called the dueling teams problem, which occurs in an online-learning scenario. The learner is given noisy comparisons between disjoint pairs of teams consisting of k players from a total of n players. The objective is to minimize the number of duels needed to confidently identify a Condorcet winning team, which is a team that can defeat any other disjoint team with a probability of at least 1/2. The noisy comparisons are associated with a total order on the teams. We formalize this problem by extending the dueling bandits setting and propose various algorithms for both stochastic and deterministic settings. In the stochastic setting, we reduce the problem to the classical dueling bandits setting and devise an algorithm that can identify a Condorcet winning team in O((n+k log(k)) max(log log n,log k)) duels, where âˆ† represents a gap parameter. For deterministic feedback, we also present a gap-independent algorithm that can identify a Condorcet winning team in O(nk log(k) + k5) duels.
