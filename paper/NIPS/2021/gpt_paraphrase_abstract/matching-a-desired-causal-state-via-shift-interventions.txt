This paper focuses on the problem of transforming a causal system from an initial state to a target state. This task is important in various fields such as control theory, biology, and materials science. The transformation can be achieved through interventions. The goal of this study is to identify a shift intervention that matches the desired mean of the system using active learning. The authors define the Markov equivalence class that can be identified from shift interventions and propose two active learning strategies that guarantee an exact match of the desired mean. They also establish a lower bound on the number of interventions required and demonstrate that their strategies are optimal for certain types of graphs. The authors show that their strategies require significantly fewer interventions compared to previous approaches that focus on structure learning in the causal graph. The experimental results support the theoretical findings, confirming that the proposed active learning strategies require fewer interventions compared to baseline methods.
