The Whittle index policy is a useful tool for solving the challenging problem of restless bandits. However, determining the Whittle indices for practical restless bandits with complex transition kernels is still difficult. This study introduces NeurWIN, a neural network called the neural Whittle index network, which aims to learn the Whittle indices for any restless bandits by utilizing the mathematical properties of these indices. We demonstrate that a neural network that generates the Whittle index also produces the optimal control for a set of Markov decision problems. This discovery motivates the use of deep reinforcement learning in training NeurWIN. We evaluate the performance of NeurWIN by testing it on three recently studied restless bandit problems. The results of our experiments show that NeurWIN outperforms other reinforcement learning algorithms significantly.
