We introduce a canonical point autoencoder (CPAE) that predicts dense correspondences between 3D shapes of the same category. The CPAE consists of two main functions: encoding an unordered point cloud into a canonical primitive (e.g., a sphere) and decoding the primitive back into the original shape. The primitive serves as a bottleneck, allowing all unordered point clouds to be mapped onto a common surface and reconstructed in an ordered manner. By training the model, we can identify pairs of correspondences by locating points from different shape instances that are mapped to the same positions on the primitive surface. Our approach does not rely on any annotation or self-supervised part segmentation network and can handle unaligned input point clouds within a certain rotational range. Experimental results on 3D semantic keypoint transfer and part segmentation transfer demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art correspondence learning methods.
