The focus of our study is on testing the uniformity of statistical data that consists of rankings over a set of items, specifically considering the Mallows models as the alternative class. Testing ranking data is difficult due to the large factorial domain size, necessitating the use of alternative class structure. We demonstrate that uniform distribution can be distinguished from samples with a 1/2 probability based on pairwise statistics, specifically for Mallows models with O(m) complexity. This enables uniformity testing using only two samples when the number of items, m, is sufficiently large. We also explore uniformity testing with central and local differential privacy (DP) constraints. We propose a central DP algorithm that requires O(max) privacy budget, where ‚úè0 is the privacy budget parameter. Interestingly, our uniformity testing algorithm can be easily applied to the local DP scenario as it utilizes binary statistics extracted from the ranking data. We conduct large-scale experiments, including m = 10,000, to demonstrate the scalability of our uniformity testing algorithms with m.
