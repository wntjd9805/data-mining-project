In image analysis, it is crucial to have learning models that can handle translations and rotations. This is particularly important in medical imaging where objects of interest can appear in various positions and orientations. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are currently the most effective tools for image analysis, as they can achieve translation invariance through convolutions. This study introduces a novel convolutional layer called Bessel-CNN (B-CNN), which utilizes Bessel functions from physics. By incorporating Bessel functions, B-CNNs are designed to be invariant to the continuous range of possible rotation angles.
