To address the issue of domain shift in visual unsupervised domain adaptation, various methods have been used to eliminate the covariate shift cross domains. However, current alignment methods, such as prototype based or sample-level based methods, fail to consider the structural properties of the distribution and may even violate the condition of covariate shift. In order to overcome these limitations and conflicts, we introduce a novel concept called (virtual) mirror, which represents the equivalent sample in another domain. Mirror pairs, consisting of equivalent sample pairs, are used to reflect the natural correspondence of the empirical distributions. To enhance domain alignment, a mirror loss is constructed to align the mirror pairs across domains. Importantly, this proposed method preserves the internal structure of the underlying distribution and we provide theoretical proof that mirror samples and mirror loss have better asymptotic properties in reducing domain shift. By incorporating the virtual mirror and mirror loss into a generic unsupervised domain adaptation model, we consistently achieved superior performance on various mainstream benchmarks.
