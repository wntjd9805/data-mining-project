This study explores the application of robust optimal transport (OT) in shape matching. It demonstrates that recent OT solvers enhance optimization-based and deep learning methods for registering point clouds, improving accuracy without excessive computational costs. The manuscript offers an overview of modern OT theory and addresses challenges in utilizing this framework for shape matching. The performance of transport-enhanced registration models is showcased in various difficult tasks, including rigid registration for partial shapes, scene flow estimation on the Kitti dataset, and nonparametric registration of lung vascular trees. The OT-based methods achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of accuracy and scalability on both the Kitti dataset and the challenging lung registration task. Additionally, the authors release a new public dataset called PVT1010, consisting of 1,010 pairs of lung vascular trees with densely sampled points, which serves as a demanding use case for point cloud registration algorithms dealing with complex shapes and deformations. The study demonstrates that robust OT enables efficient pre-alignment and fine-tuning for a wide range of registration models, making it a valuable addition to the computer vision toolbox.
