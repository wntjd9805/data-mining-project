According to neuroscience's Complementary Learning Systems (CLS) theory, humans engage in effective continual learning through two systems: a fast learning system centered on the hippocampus for rapid acquisition of specific experiences, and a slow learning system located in the neocortex for gradual acquisition of structured knowledge about the environment. Inspired by this theory, we propose a new continual learning framework called "DualNet." DualNet consists of a fast learning system for supervised learning of pattern-separated representation from specific tasks and a slow learning system for unsupervised representation learning of task-agnostic general representation using Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). These two learning systems are complementary and work together seamlessly in a holistic continual learning framework. Our experiments on challenging continual learning benchmarks (CORE50 and miniImageNet) demonstrate that DualNet significantly outperforms existing methods. We also conduct ablation studies on different SSL objectives to validate the effectiveness, robustness, and scalability of DualNet. The code for DualNet is publicly available at https://github.com/phquang/DualNet.
