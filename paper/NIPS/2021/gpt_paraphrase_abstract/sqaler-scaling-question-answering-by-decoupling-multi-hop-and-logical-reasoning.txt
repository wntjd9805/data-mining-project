Current methods for reasoning and answering questions using knowledge graphs (KGs) are limited by their scalability, as they can only effectively handle small subsets of the graph. In this study, we propose a solution to this problem by demonstrating that multi-hop and complex logical reasoning can be performed separately without sacrificing expressive power. Based on this insight, we introduce an approach to multi-hop reasoning that scales linearly with the number of relation types in the graph, which is typically much smaller than the number of edges or nodes. This generates a set of potential solutions that can be refined to obtain the correct solution to the original problem. Our experiments on knowledge-based question answering demonstrate that our approach successfully solves the multi-hop MetaQA dataset, achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the more challenging WebQuestionsSP dataset, offers significantly improved scalability compared to competing methods, and exhibits compositional generalization beyond the training data. The answer format only provides an abstract representation.
