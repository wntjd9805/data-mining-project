This study addresses the challenge of learning representations for entire graphs without human supervision. Existing self-supervised learning methods require human experts to design transformations (views) for training models to be invariant to. To overcome this limitation, we propose an adversarial self-supervised learning (GASSL) framework that learns unsupervised representations of graph data without the need for handcrafted views. GASSL generates challenging views by perturbing the input and trains the encoder in an adversarial manner. Our method optimizes the min-max problem and incorporates a gradient accumulation strategy to enhance training speed. Experimental results on ten graph classification datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised learning baselines and performs competitively with supervised models.
