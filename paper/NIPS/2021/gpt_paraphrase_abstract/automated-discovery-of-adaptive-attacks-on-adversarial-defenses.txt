Current methods for evaluating adversarial defenses are limited to manual crafting of attacks by experts or using a fixed set of attacks that may not be effective for a specific defense. However, we propose a new approach that utilizes reusable building blocks to automatically discover attacks for unknown defenses. This approach outperforms the current state-of-the-art tool for evaluating adversarial defenses, producing significantly stronger attacks and generating additional adversarial examples for most models tested.
