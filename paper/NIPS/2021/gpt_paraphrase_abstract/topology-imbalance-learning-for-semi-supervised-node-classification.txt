The imbalance problem in learning node representations has gained attention in the community. Existing studies focus on the quantity imbalance, where there is an unequal number of labeled examples in different classes. However, we argue that graph data also present a topology imbalance, where labeled nodes have different structural roles in the graph. In this study, we explore the characteristics, causes, and threats of topology imbalance in semi-supervised node classification. We propose a unified approach to analyze both quantity and topology imbalance by considering the node influence shift phenomenon using the Label Propagation algorithm. Based on our analysis, we introduce a metric called Totoro to measure the degree of graph topology imbalance and propose a model-agnostic method called ReNode to address the topology imbalance by adaptively re-weighting the influence of labeled nodes based on their positions relative to class boundaries. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method in alleviating topology imbalance and improving semi-supervised node classification. Furthermore, we discover that different graph neural networks have varying sensitivity to topology imbalance, which can be a new perspective for evaluating GNN architectures.
