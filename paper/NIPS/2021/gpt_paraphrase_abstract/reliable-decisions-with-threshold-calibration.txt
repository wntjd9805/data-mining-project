Decision makers often rely on probabilistic forecasts to predict the loss associated with different decision rules before implementing them. Accurate prediction of these losses requires the forecasted probabilities to match the true frequencies. While it is impossible to have perfect forecasts, probabilities can be calibrated to match the true frequencies on average. However, relying on average calibration does not guarantee accurate prediction of decision losses, particularly in the case of threshold decisions in regression settings. To address this issue, we propose a stronger concept called threshold calibration, which ensures accurate prediction of decision losses for threshold decisions. We have developed an efficient algorithm that can transform an uncalibrated forecaster into a threshold-calibrated one. This allows decision makers to confidently estimate the loss associated with any threshold decision using any threshold loss function. In empirical tests involving hospital scheduling and resource allocation decisions, we have found that threshold calibration improves decision loss prediction without compromising the quality of the decisions made.
