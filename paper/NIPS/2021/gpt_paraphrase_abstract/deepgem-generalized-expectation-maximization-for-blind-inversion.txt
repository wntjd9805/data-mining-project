In conventional inversion algorithms, it is assumed that the forward model, which relates a source to its measurements, is known and fixed. However, when the forward model is unknown or imperfect, artifacts can occur in the recovery of the source. This paper focuses on the problem of blind inversion, where the goal is to solve an inverse problem without knowledge of the forward model parameters. The proposed approach, called DeepGEM, is a variational Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework that can estimate the unknown parameters of the forward model in an unsupervised manner. DeepGEM utilizes a normalizing flow generative network to effectively capture complex posterior distributions, resulting in more accurate evaluation of the source's posterior distribution used in EM. The effectiveness of DeepGEM is demonstrated by achieving strong performance in blind seismic tomography, surpassing the standard method used in seismology. Additionally, DeepGEM's generality is showcased by applying it to a simple case of blind deconvolution.
