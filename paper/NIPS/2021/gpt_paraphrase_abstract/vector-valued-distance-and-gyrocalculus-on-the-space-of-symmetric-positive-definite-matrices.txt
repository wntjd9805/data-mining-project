We propose using the vector-valued distance for computing distances and extracting geometric information from symmetric positive definite matrices (SPD). Additionally, we introduce gyrovector calculus, which enables us to perform vector space operations in this curved space. We demonstrate the versatility of these operations in knowledge graph completion, item recommendation, and question answering tasks. Experimental results show that the SPD models outperform their counterparts in Euclidean and hyperbolic space. By utilizing the vector-valued distance, we are able to visualize embeddings and observe that the models effectively differentiate between positive and negative samples.
