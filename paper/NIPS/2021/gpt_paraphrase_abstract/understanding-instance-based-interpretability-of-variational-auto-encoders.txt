This paper investigates the application of instance-based interpretation methods, specifically influence functions, in the context of unsupervised learning. The study focuses on deep generative models called variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and explores the counterfactual question addressed by influence functions in this setting. Theoretical analysis is conducted to understand the insights provided by influence functions regarding the impact of training samples on unsupervised learning methods. The paper proposes VAE-TracIn, a computationally efficient and theoretically sound solution for VAEs based on previous research. The effectiveness of VAE-TracIn is evaluated using real-world datasets through extensive quantitative and qualitative analysis.
