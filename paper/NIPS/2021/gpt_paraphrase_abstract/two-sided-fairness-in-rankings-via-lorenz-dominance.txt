This abstract discusses the problem of creating fair rankings in recommender systems that benefit both users and item producers. It focuses on both traditional recommendation scenarios (e.g., music or movies) and reciprocal recommendation scenarios (e.g., dating). The concept of fairness is based on distributive justice in welfare economics and aims to improve the well-being of individuals who are worse off. This is achieved by using the Lorenz efficiency criterion, which ensures that rankings are Pareto efficient and effectively redistribute utility from better-off to worse-off individuals while maintaining overall utility. The proposed approach involves maximizing concave welfare functions and utilizes the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for efficient inference. Unlike existing methods that rely on fairness constraints, this approach consistently generates fair rankings. Experimental results demonstrate that it enhances the well-being of the worse-off individuals while minimizing the impact on overall utility.
