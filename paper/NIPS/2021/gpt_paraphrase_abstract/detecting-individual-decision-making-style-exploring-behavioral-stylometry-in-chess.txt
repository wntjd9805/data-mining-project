The rise of machine learning models that outperform humans in complex domains has led to the development of AI systems that interact with humans. A crucial aspect of this is understanding human behavior algorithmically. While previous research has focused on aggregate behavior, the ultimate goal is to create behavioral models that can differentiate between individuals. To address this, we investigate the problem of behavioral stylometry, specifically in the context of chess. Our transformer-based approach achieves 98% accuracy in identifying chess players from their games, even with limited labeled data. Surprisingly, our model can also generalize to professional players, despite being trained on amateur games. Additionally, we explore the insights gained from our embeddings and discuss the ethical implications of using powerful methods to identify individuals based on their behavior.
