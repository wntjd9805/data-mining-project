Recent studies have identified lidars as a data source that streams continuously. These studies have demonstrated that the latency of lidar perception models can be greatly reduced by processing wedge-shaped sections of the point cloud instead of the entire cloud. However, the current methods waste memory and computational resources by representing these sections as rectangular regions within a cartesian coordinate system. In this research, we propose a solution by employing a polar coordinate system and making two key enhancements to the design. Firstly, we enhance the spatial context by including neighboring sectors from the previous and subsequent scans through multi-scale padding. Secondly, we improve the core polar convolutional architecture by introducing feature undistortion and range stratiÔ¨Åed convolutions. Our experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate significant improvements compared to other streaming methods. Additionally, we achieve comparable results to existing non-streaming methods but with lower latencies.
