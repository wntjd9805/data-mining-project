The manual process of searching for and extracting information from clinical databases is crucial for various clinical tasks. However, this process has become more challenging due to the growth of large databases and the presence of unlabelled instances. To overcome this challenge, we propose a framework called CROCS that utilizes supervised contrastive learning. CROCS learns embeddings of cardiac signals associated with patient attributes, allowing for clustering and retrieval of unlabelled signals based on multiple attributes. Our results demonstrate that CROCS outperforms the current state-of-the-art method and retrieves relevant cardiac signals from a large database. Additionally, the clinical prototypes generated by CROCS are arranged in a meaningful way based on patient attributes, providing a high level of interpretability.
