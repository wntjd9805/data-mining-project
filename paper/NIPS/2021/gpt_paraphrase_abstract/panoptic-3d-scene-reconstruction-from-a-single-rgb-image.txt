We propose a new approach called panoptic 3D scene reconstruction, which combines geometric reconstruction, 3D semantic segmentation, and 3D instance segmentation into a single task. Our approach predicts the complete geometric reconstruction of a scene from a single RGB image, along with semantic and instance segmentations. We achieve this by lifting and propagating 2D features from the input image to a 3D volumetric scene representation. Our holistic approach outperforms alternative methods that treat these tasks independently, demonstrating the benefits of joint scene reconstruction, semantic, and instance segmentation. This work has implications for robotics, motion planning, and augmented reality.
