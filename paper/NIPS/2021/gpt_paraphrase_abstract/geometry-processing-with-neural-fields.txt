The majority of current geometry processing algorithms rely on meshes as the primary shape representation. However, manipulating meshes necessitates the maintenance of high-quality surface discretization, often requiring additional procedures like remeshing when changing the mesh's topology. In contrast, this study proposes the utilization of neural fields for geometry processing. Neural fields possess the ability to compactly store intricate shapes without the need for spatial discretization. Furthermore, neural fields are infinitely differentiable, enabling optimization for objectives involving higher-order derivatives. Consequently, the question arises: can neural fields be employed exclusively for geometry processing? To address this, we introduce loss functions and architectures that demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing neural fields for challenging geometry processing tasks, including deformation and filtering. Experimental results indicate that our methods perform comparably to established mesh-based approaches, all while avoiding commitment to a specific surface discretization.
