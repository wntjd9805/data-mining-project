Feature-based dynamic pricing is a popular method for setting prices for unique products in various industries. This approach involves proposing prices for products based on their specific features, and it has applications in digital marketing, online sales, and real estate. The problem of dynamic pricing has been studied as an online learning problem, where a seller must determine prices for a sequence of products in real-time. In this study, we revisit this problem and present two algorithms (EMLP and ONSP) for different types of feature settings. We prove that both algorithms have optimal regret bounds of O(d log T), where d is the dimensionality of the product features and T is the number of products. This is an improvement over existing results, which have regret bounds of O(T^(2/3)). Additionally, we establish a lower bound of â„¦(T) for a more general setting, showing that having knowledge of the demand curve can greatly enhance feature-based dynamic pricing.
