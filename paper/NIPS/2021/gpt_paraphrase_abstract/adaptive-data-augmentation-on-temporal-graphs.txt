Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) are effective in modeling complex temporal graph data, but they are prone to overfitting and capturing random noise instead of important semantic information. To address this issue, we propose using data augmentation with adaptive magnitudes to transform the temporal graphs. This augmentation technique preserves essential semantic information while effectively augmenting the input features. We introduce the MeTA (Memory Tower Augmentation) module, which processes augmented graphs of different magnitudes on separate levels and performs message passing across levels to provide adaptively augmented inputs for predictions. MeTA can be easily incorporated into popular TGN models to enhance their effectiveness without increasing time complexity. Additionally, we propose three data augmentation strategies that realistically model noise by modifying both temporal and topological features. Experimental results on standard datasets demonstrate that MeTA significantly improves edge prediction and node classification tasks for popular TGN models in an efficient manner.
