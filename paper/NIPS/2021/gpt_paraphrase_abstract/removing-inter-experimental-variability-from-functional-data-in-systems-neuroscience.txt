Integrating data from multiple experiments in systems neuroscience is a common practice, but it is challenging due to inter-experimental variability. This variability can significantly impact the outcome of data analysis pipelines. Traditional statistical methods often struggle to address this issue, but modern machine learning approaches offer flexible solutions through domain adaptation. While these approaches have been primarily applied in single-cell genomics, this study introduces a theoretical framework for domain adaptation in systems neuroscience. The researchers propose an adversarial optimization scheme that effectively removes inter-experimental variability while preserving the biological signal of interest. They evaluate their method on a large-scale dataset of retinal bipolar cell responses to visual stimuli, which contains significant inter-experimental variability. Through supervised and unsupervised analyses, the researchers demonstrate that their approach achieves the best balance between removing inter-experimental variability and preserving the biological signal. This work provides a flexible approach to integrate datasets across experiments in systems neuroscience, with code available for implementation. The study was conducted by researchers from the University of TÃ¼bingen and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and it will be presented at the 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021).
