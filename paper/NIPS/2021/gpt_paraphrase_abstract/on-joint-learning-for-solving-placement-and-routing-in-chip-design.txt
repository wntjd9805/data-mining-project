Machine learning has become a valuable tool in chip design due to its ability to accelerate processes and reduce reliance on human experts. However, there are still fundamental challenges in achieving end-to-end learning for placement and routing in chip design. In this study, we propose two joint learning methods: DeepPlace, which combines reinforcement learning with a gradient optimization scheme for macro and standard cell placement, and DeepPR, which utilizes reinforcement learning for both macro placement and routing. Our approach incorporates a multi-view embedding model to encode global and local information of input macros, and employs random network distillation to encourage exploration. Experimental results on chip design benchmarks demonstrate that our methods effectively learn from experience and provide intermediate placement within a short training time.
