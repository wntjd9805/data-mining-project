DNNs are widely used in computer vision, but they are computationally expensive. Existing methods for accelerating runtime involve pruning connections or filters, but they require re-training the model. In this paper, we introduce RED, a data-free structured approach to structured pruning. Our approach involves adaptive hashing of DNN weight distribution densities, merging redundant neurons based on their similarities, and using an uneven depthwise separation technique for pruning convolutional layers. Through various benchmarks, we show that RED outperforms other data-free pruning methods and achieves comparable performance to data-driven methods.
