This paper introduces a new generative vision transformer for salient object detection. The model incorporates a novel energy-based prior for latent variables and is trained using Markov chain Monte Carlo-based maximum likelihood estimation. The proposed framework allows for the generation of pixel-wise uncertainty maps that indicate the model's confidence in predicting saliency. Unlike existing models using a simple isotropic Gaussian distribution for the prior, our model employs an energy-based informative prior that better captures the latent space of the data. The framework is evaluated on RGB and RGB-D salient object detection tasks and achieves accurate saliency predictions and meaningful uncertainty maps that align with human perception.
