This study focuses on self-supervised video representation learning (SSVRL), a recently popular topic. Existing methods for SSVRL prioritize either storage and computation efficiency or effectiveness, but not both. This work introduces a novel approach called Motion Vector based Cross Guidance Contrastive learning (MVCGC) that achieves both goals simultaneously. By utilizing compressed videos and capturing mutual information between input streams, the MVCGC method decodes RGB frames and motion vectors from compressed videos in real-time for efficiency. Additionally, a cross guidance contrastive learning algorithm is designed to enhance the representation ability of motion vectors by incorporating supervision signals from RGB frames and vice versa. Through comprehensive experiments on two downstream tasks, it is demonstrated that the MVCGC approach achieves state-of-the-art results while being significantly more efficient than competing methods.
