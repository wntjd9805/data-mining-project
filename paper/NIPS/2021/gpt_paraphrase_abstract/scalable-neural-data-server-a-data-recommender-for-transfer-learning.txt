The lack of labeled data in a specific field can hinder the practical application of machine learning algorithms. Transfer learning is commonly used to improve performance by utilizing additional data, but finding the most relevant data to transfer from is challenging. The Neural Data Server (NDS) was previously introduced as a search engine that suggests relevant data for a given task. However, NDS's computational cost increases with the number of data sources. To overcome this, we propose the Scalable Neural Data Server (SNDS), a large-scale search engine capable of indexing thousands of datasets to provide relevant machine learning data to users. SNDS trains its experts on intermediary datasets and represents both the data sources and tasks based on their proximity to these intermediary datasets. This ensures that the computational cost for SNDS users remains constant as new datasets are added. We validate SNDS on various real-world tasks and find that the recommended data improves performance compared to baseline methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate SNDS's scalability by successfully selecting relevant data for transfer in different settings beyond natural images.
