This paper introduces the Delayed Propagation Transformer (DePT), a novel transformer-based model designed for multi-agent control in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). Existing control methods in CPS often face challenges such as incomplete sensing and decentralized design, resulting in non-Markovian states and poor convergence. DePT addresses these issues by incorporating a cone-shaped spatial-temporal attention prior, which integrates information propagation and aggregation principles to enable a global view. Additionally, DePT is designed with a physical constraint inductive bias, making it suitable for a wide range of multi-agent systems. Experimental results on a network-scale traffic signal control system demonstrate that DePT outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The code for DePT is publicly available on GitHub at: https://github.com/VITA-Group/DePT.
