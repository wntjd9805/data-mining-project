We introduce a novel slot-wise, object-based transition model that breaks down a scene into objects and aligns them using a slot-wise object memory to maintain consistency over time. This model predicts the evolution of objects across frames and is trained without supervision using transition losses at the object-structured level instead of pixels. Our model addresses two key challenges in transition models - object persistence and object identity - by incorporating a unique alignment module. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our model, with its object-level loss and accurate object alignment, surpasses a state-of-the-art baseline. It also performs well in handling object occlusion and re-appearance in partially observable environments.
