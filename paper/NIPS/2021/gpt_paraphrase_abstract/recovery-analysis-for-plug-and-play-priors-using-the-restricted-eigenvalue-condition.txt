The plug-and-play priors (PnP) and regularization by denoising (RED) techniques are commonly used for solving inverse problems using pre-trained deep denoisers as image priors. While there has been extensive investigation into the empirical imaging performance and theoretical convergence properties of these methods, their recovery properties have not been theoretically analyzed. To address this gap, we propose establishing theoretical recovery guarantees for PnP/RED by assuming that the solution lies close to the fixed-points of a deep neural network. Additionally, we conduct numerical experiments to compare the recovery performance of PnP/RED in compressive sensing with that of recent compressive sensing algorithms based on generative models. Our results indicate that PnP with a pre-trained artifact removal network achieves significantly better outcomes compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
