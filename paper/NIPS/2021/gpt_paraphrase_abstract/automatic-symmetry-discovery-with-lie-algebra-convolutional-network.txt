Current equivariant neural networks rely on prior knowledge of the symmetry group and discretization for continuous groups. However, we propose a novel approach using Lie algebras instead of Lie groups. Our model, the Lie algebra convolutional network (L-conv), can autonomously uncover symmetries without the need for group discretization. We demonstrate that L-conv can serve as a fundamental component for constructing any group equivariant feedforward architecture. Notably, both CNNs and Graph Convolutional Networks can be expressed as L-conv by employing appropriate groups. Intriguingly, we establish direct links between L-conv and physics, such as the generalization of field theory through group invariant loss, the measurement of robustness via the Euler-Lagrange equation, and the emergence of conservation laws and Noether current through equivariance. These connections present exciting opportunities for designing more versatile equivariant networks and their application to significant problems in the field of physical sciences.
