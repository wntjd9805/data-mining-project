Automated machine learning (AutoML) enhances the productivity of data scientists. However, completely automating machine learning eliminates the opportunity for data scientists to apply their intuition. Therefore, data scientists often prefer a gradual automation approach, where they have control over certain decisions while AutoML explores the remaining options. Unfortunately, current tools for gradual AutoML require significant code modifications, making the process cumbersome. To address this, the paper proposes the use of combinators, a concept from functional programming, to achieve more concise and modular code. These combinators allow for the composition of machine learning operators into pipelines. The paper also introduces a translation scheme that maps pipelines and associated hyperparameter schemas to search spaces for AutoML optimizers. Building upon this foundation, the paper presents Lale, an open-source AutoML library that is compatible with the popular sklearn framework. The effectiveness of Lale is evaluated through a user study.
