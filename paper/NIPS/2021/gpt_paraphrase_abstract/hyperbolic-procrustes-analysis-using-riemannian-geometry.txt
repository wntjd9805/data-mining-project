Label-free alignment of datasets collected at different times, locations, or using different instruments is a crucial scientific task. Recently, hyperbolic spaces have proven to be effective for representing hierarchical data. In this study, we propose a purely geometric approach called hyperbolic Procrustes analysis (HPA) for label-free alignment of hierarchical datasets. HPA incorporates the three main components of Procrustes analysis (translation, scaling, and rotation) using the Riemannian geometry of the Lorentz model of hyperbolic space. We analyze the properties of these components and demonstrate the effectiveness, stability, and computational efficiency of HPA through simulations. Furthermore, we apply HPA to three batch correction tasks involving gene expression and mass cytometry data. Our results show that HPA successfully removes batch effects in an unsupervised manner, outperforming recent methods for label-free alignment in hyperbolic spaces.
