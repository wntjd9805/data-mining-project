We have developed new width-based planning and learning algorithms by examining the design choices made by previous width-based planners. These algorithms were tested on Atari-2600 games and our most successful algorithm, N-CPL, outperforms 𝜋-IW(1), 𝜋-IW(1)+, and 𝜋-HIW(n, 1). Additionally, we have categorized the Atari-2600 games based on their defining characteristics. This analysis provides further understanding of the algorithms' behavior and performance. Specifically, N-CPL performs better than 𝜋-IW, 𝜋-IW(1)+, and 𝜋-HIW(n, 1) in games with high branching factors and sparse meaningful rewards.
