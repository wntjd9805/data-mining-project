Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) face limitations in their ability to express complex relationships, handle long-range interactions, and model higher-order structures. These limitations arise from the strong coupling between the computational and input graph structures. Message Passing Simplicial Networks have been introduced to address this issue by decoupling the elements through message passing on the clique complex of the graph. However, Simplicial Complexes (SCs) can impose rigid constraints on these models. In this study, we extend theoretical results on SCs to regular CellComplexes, which offer more flexibility by encompassing both SCs and graphs. We demonstrate that this generalization allows for powerful graph transformations, leading to a hierarchical message passing procedure. These methods, collectively known as CW Networks (CWNs), are more expressive than the WL test and at least as powerful as the 3-WL test. Specifically, we showcase the effectiveness of one CWN scheme, based on rings, for solving molecular graph problems. Our proposed architecture offers higher expressivity compared to commonly used GNNs, principled modeling of higher-order signals, and compression of node distances. Through experiments on various molecular datasets, we demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results.
