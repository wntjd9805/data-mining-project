Recent attention has been focused on Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) due to their potential for real-world applications using near-term quantum devices. However, the effectiveness of VQEs relies on the structure of the variational ansatz, which must balance circuit depth and expressivity. Due to limitations in near-term quantum devices, the optimization of VQE ansatz requires maximizing circuit expressivity while minimizing depth. Although various methods for VQE structure optimization have been introduced, the utilization of machine learning in this problem remains largely unexplored. In this study, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm that autonomously explores possible ansatzes and identifies efficient circuits that provide accurate estimates of ground energy. The algorithm employs feedback-driven curriculum learning to adjust the complexity of the learning problem based on the algorithm's current performance, gradually improving result accuracy while minimizing circuit depth. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on the estimation of ground-state energy in different configurations of lithium hydride (LiH). Our algorithm achieves chemical accuracy and state-of-the-art results in terms of circuit depth.
