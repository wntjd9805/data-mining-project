This study addresses the problem of recovering independent factors from unlabeled high-dimensional data. It is commonly believed that these factors can be obtained through a smooth nonlinear function. However, recent research has shown that this "disentanglement" is not possible without additional assumptions. The authors propose that by assuming local isometry and non-Gaussianity of the factors, it is indeed feasible to recover disentangled representations. They use deep generative models to construct realistic image manifolds with known latent representations and test various methods for recovering the factors. They find that a spectral method optimizing local isometry and non-Gaussianity consistently identifies the correct factors, while baseline autoencoders fail to do so. They also propose a way to encourage autoencoders to find encodings that satisfy local isometry, which improves their ability to discover disentangled representations. Overall, the results suggest that unsupervised disentanglement is possible in certain realistic scenarios, without requiring domain-specific assumptions.
