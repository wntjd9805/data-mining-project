In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), multiple agents work together to solve a shared problem by interacting with a common environment and each other. This approach has various applications in fields like gaming, robotics, and finance. In this study, we introduce a new law of iterated logarithm for a group of distributed nonlinear stochastic approximation methods that are applicable in MARL. Our findings describe the convergence rate on almost every sample path where the algorithm converges. Unlike existing studies that only discuss convergence rates in expected or CLT sense, our result provides deeper insights. Importantly, our result holds under weaker assumptions, as neither the gossip matrix needs to be doubly stochastic nor the stepsizes square summable. As an example, we demonstrate that the distributed TD(0) algorithm with a stepsize of n−γ (where γ ∈ (0, 1)) and linear function approximation has a convergence rate of O( n−1 ln ln n) a.s. These decay rates are not dependent on the graph representing interactions among the agents.
