To overcome the negative impact of machine learning models on underrepresented groups, we explore the concept of constructing training sets that promote fairness. Our approach involves an adaptive sampling algorithm based on optimism, which yields theoretical performance bounds. Additionally, we present heuristic extensions of this algorithm for practical, large-scale problems. By establishing lower bounds for a specific problem class, we demonstrate that our adaptive scheme generally achieves optimal performance. Experimental validation using logistic regression classifiers on synthetic tasks and convolutional neural networks on real-world tasks supports the advantages of adaptively constructing training sets.
