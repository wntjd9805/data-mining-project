We explore the problem of efficiently learning the natural parameters of a k-parameter exponential family with minimal representation from independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples. We focus on cases where both the support and the natural parameters are bounded appropriately. Although the traditional maximum likelihood estimator for this type of exponential family is consistent, asymptotically normal, and asymptotically efficient, it is computationally challenging to evaluate. In this study, we propose a computationally efficient estimator that is consistent and asymptotically normal under mild conditions. We provide finite sample guarantees, achieving an error of α in parameter estimation with sample complexity O(poly(k/α)) and computational complexity O(poly(k/α)). To establish these results, we demonstrate that our method can be seen as the maximum likelihood estimation of a re-parameterized distribution in the same class of exponential family at the population level.
