With the rise of machine learning models in critical fields like law and finance, there is a growing need for post-hoc methods to generate counterfactual explanations. These explanations help individuals who are negatively affected by predicted outcomes by providing them with guidance on how to change their characteristics to achieve a positive result. To address this, we introduce a new algorithm that combines adversarial training and PAC confidence sets. This algorithm ensures that affected individuals have a high probability of obtaining recourse. Through extensive experiments on real data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
