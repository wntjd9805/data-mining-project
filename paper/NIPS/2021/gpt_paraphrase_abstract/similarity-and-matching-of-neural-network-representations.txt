We introduce a tool called Dr. Frankenstein for analyzing the similarity of deep neural network representations. By utilizing this tool, we aim to align the activations of specific layers in two different neural networks by incorporating a stitching layer. Surprisingly, we demonstrate that even with just a single, simple stitching layer, we can accurately match the inner representations of deep convolutional neural networks with the same architecture but different initializations. We explore various linear transformations for the stitching layer and assess their performance and characteristics. The task of matching representations is closely linked to similarity concepts, and our toolset offers a new perspective on similarity indices in neural network research by considering task performance.
