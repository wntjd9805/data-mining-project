We present Unlabeled Principal Component Analysis (UPCA), a robust method for analyzing data matrices corrupted by permutations. By using algebraic geometry, we demonstrate that UPCA is a well-defined algebraic problem, with the ground-truth matrix being the unique solution to a polynomial system of equations. We propose a two-stage algorithm for UPCA, suitable for cases where only a fraction of the data is permuted. In Stage-I, outlier-robust PCA methods estimate the true column-space. In Stage-II, recent methods for unlabeled sensing are applied to restore the permuted data. Our experiments on various datasets show the potential of UPCA for applications such as data privatization and record linkage.
