Estimating personalized treatment effects from high-dimensional observational data is crucial when experimental designs are not possible, unethical, or costly. Current methods involve fitting deep models on outcomes observed for treated and control populations. However, when individual outcome measurements are expensive, such as in the case of a tumor biopsy, a more efficient approach for acquiring each result is needed. Deep Bayesian active learning offers a solution by selecting points with high uncertainty. Nonetheless, existing methods prioritize acquiring training data from regions where the treated and control populations do not overlap. This approach is not efficient because the treatment effect cannot be identified in such regions. To address this issue, we propose causal, Bayesian acquisition functions based on information theory. These functions bias data acquisition towards regions where the treated and control populations overlap, maximizing sample efficiency for learning personalized treatment effects. We validate the performance of our proposed acquisition strategies using synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets (IHDP and CMNIST) and their extensions, which simulate common biases and pathologies found in real-world datasets.
