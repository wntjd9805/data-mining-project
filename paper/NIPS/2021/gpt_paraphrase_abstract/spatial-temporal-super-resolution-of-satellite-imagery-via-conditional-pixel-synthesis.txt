The use of high-resolution satellite imagery has proven valuable for various purposes such as measuring global human population, local economic livelihoods, and biodiversity. However, the scarcity and cost of obtaining high-resolution imagery make it challenging to efficiently and effectively apply these tasks across different time periods and geographic areas. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called conditional pixel synthesis model, which utilizes abundant, inexpensive, low-resolution imagery to generate accurate high-resolution imagery in inaccessible locations and times. Our model achieves exceptional sample quality, resembling real photos, and outperforms other methods in object counting, particularly in rapidly changing geographic areas.
