Switching dynamical systems are a useful tool for analyzing time-series data in various fields. We propose a model that combines a Markov jump process with a subordinated diffusion process to describe systems in continuous time. While we provide the exact equations for the prior and posterior densities, solving them directly is computationally challenging. To address this, we introduce a new continuous-time variational inference algorithm that combines a Gaussian process approximation and posterior inference for Markov jump processes. By minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence, we can estimate the latent states of the system and unknown parameters. We validate our algorithm using both simulated data and real-world examples.
