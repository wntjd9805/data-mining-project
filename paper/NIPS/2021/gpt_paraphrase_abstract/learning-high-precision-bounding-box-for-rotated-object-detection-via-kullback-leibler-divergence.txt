Existing rotated object detectors have limitations in performing high-precision detection, particularly for objects with large aspect ratios. This is due to the current regression loss design inherited from horizontal detection. In this paper, we propose a deduction-based approach to design the rotation regression loss. We modulate the coupled parameters in the loss to allow them to influence each other adaptively and synergistically during optimization. We convert the rotated bounding box into a 2-D Gaussian distribution and calculate the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) between the distributions as the regression loss. The KLD dynamically adjusts the parameter gradients based on the object's characteristics, such as aspect ratio, thereby improving high-precision detection. We have shown that KLD is scale invariant and can be degenerated into the ln-norm loss for horizontal detection. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach across seven datasets using different detectors. The codes are available at https://github.com/yangxue0827/RotationDetection.
