This paper introduces BAIT, a new active learning algorithm designed to be compatible with deep neural networks. BAIT is based on the Fisher-based active selection objective, which has been revisited in this study. The algorithm optimizes a bound on the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) error using the Fisher information. This optimization can be efficiently implemented on modern hardware due to its linear-algebraic structure. BAIT outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both classification and regression tasks and can be used with various model architectures.
