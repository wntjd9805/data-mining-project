This paper introduces a new approach to the federated linear contextual bandits model, where different clients face interconnected stochastic bandits with common global parameters. The proposed collaborative algorithm, called Fed-PE, addresses client heterogeneity without sharing local feature vectors or raw data. Fed-PE utilizes a novel multi-client G-optimal design and achieves near-optimal regrets for both disjoint and shared parameter scenarios with low communication costs. Moreover, a concept called collinearly-dependent policies is introduced, leading to a tight minimax regret lower bound for the disjoint parameter case. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms using synthetic and real-world datasets.
