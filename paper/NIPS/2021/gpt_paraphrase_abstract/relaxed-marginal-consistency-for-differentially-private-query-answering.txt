Many algorithms that preserve differential privacy and provide accurate query answers involve reconstructing a discrete data distribution from noisy measurements. However, this often requires exponentially increasing storage space as the dimensionality of the data grows. PRIVATE-PGM is a recent method that represents the data distribution using graphical models, which reduces complexity compared to traditional methods. It is particularly effective for sparse measurements, but struggles with dense measurements in high-dimensional data. To solve this limitation, we propose a principled approach that relaxes consistency constraints in the estimation objective. This approach can be applied to various existing private query answering algorithms, improving scalability or accuracy without compromising privacy.
