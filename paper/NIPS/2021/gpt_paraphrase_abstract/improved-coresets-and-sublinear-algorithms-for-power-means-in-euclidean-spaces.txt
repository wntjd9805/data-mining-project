This paper addresses the problem of finding high dimensional power means, which involves minimizing the sum of Euclidean distances raised to a given power for a set of input points. Various special cases of this problem are considered, such as the Fermat-Weber problem, mean or centroid calculation, and the Minimum Enclosing Ball problem. The focus is on solving these problems in the context of big data, with an emphasis on minimizing the number of samples or queries required. The paper presents sublinear algorithms that achieve a (1+Îµ)-approximation using a nearly optimal number of samples, as well as coresets that provide a small, weighted subset of points for approximating the cost of candidate points. The results improve upon previous bounds and generalize the findings to arbitrary power values.
