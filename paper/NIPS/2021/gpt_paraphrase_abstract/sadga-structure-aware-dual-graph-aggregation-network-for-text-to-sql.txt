The Text-to-SQL task has gained significant attention recently, as it involves translating natural language questions into SQL queries. One of the biggest challenges in this task is how to apply the trained model to unfamiliar database schemas, which is known as the cross-domain Text-to-SQL task. The key to solving this challenge lies in the generalizability of the encoding method for modeling the question and the database schema, as well as the question-schema linking method for mapping words in the question to tables/columns in the schema. To address these key issues, we propose a Structure-Aware Dual Graph Aggregation Network (SADGA) for cross-domain Text-to-SQL. SADGA utilizes a graph structure to create a unified encoding model for both the question and the schema. Additionally, we introduce a structure-aware aggregation method that learns the mapping between the question-graph and schema-graph. This aggregation method includes Global Graph Linking, Local Graph Linking, and Dual-Graph Aggregation Mechanism. We evaluate the performance of our proposal empirically and have achieved the 3rd place in the challenging Text-to-SQL benchmark Spider at the time of writing. The answer format only provides the abstraction.
