We introduce an algorithm called iterative causal discovery (ICD) that effectively recovers causal graphs in the presence of latent confounders and selection bias. ICD is based on the causal Markov and faithfulness assumptions and is capable of identifying the equivalence class of the underlying causal graph. The algorithm begins with a complete graph and utilizes a single iterative stage to refine the graph by identifying conditional independence (CI) between connected nodes. At each iteration, the size of the CI conditioning set is adjusted based on the distance on the graph from the tested nodes, resulting in an increased statistical power and improved stability. Empirical evidence demonstrates that ICD outperforms FCI, FCI+, and RFCI algorithms in terms of accuracy while requiring fewer CI tests. The code for ICD is available at https://github.com/IntelLabs/causality-lab.
