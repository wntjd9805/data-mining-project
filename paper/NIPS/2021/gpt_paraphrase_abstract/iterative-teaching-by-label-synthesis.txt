This paper explores the concept of iterative machine teaching, where a teacher provides examples to a learner one at a time. Unlike previous methods that require scanning the entire pool of examples and selecting teaching examples in each iteration, we introduce a label synthesis teaching framework. In this framework, the teacher randomly selects input examples and synthesizes appropriate labels for them. This approach eliminates the need for expensive example selection and can still achieve exponential teachability. We present several new teaching algorithms within this framework and provide empirical evidence of its effectiveness.
