This abstract presents the PettingZoo library and the Agent Environment Cycle (AEC) games model. PettingZoo is a Python library that offers a wide range of multi-agent environments, aiming to enhance research in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Similar to OpenAI's Gym library, PettingZoo aims to improve interchangeability, accessibility, and reproducibility in MARL work. While PettingZoo's API shares similarities with Gym, it stands out among MARL APIs due to its unique AEC games model. The abstract argues that existing game models used in MARL environments are inadequate and can lead to confusing bugs. In contrast, the AEC games model addresses these issues.
