Vanilla autoencoders often create manifolds that overfit noisy training data or have incorrect local connectivity and geometry. Regularization techniques, such as the denoising autoencoder, reduce overfitting, while graph-based methods utilizing neighborhood graphs mitigate local connectivity errors. However, neither approach effectively reduces both issues, and graph-based methods require extensive preprocessing and tuning. To address overfitting and local connectivity simultaneously, we propose the Neighborhood Reconstructing Autoencoder (NRAE). Unlike existing graph-based methods, NRAE combines neighborhood graph information with local quadratic approximations of the decoder function to create a new neighborhood reconstruction loss. Our approach is simple, easy to implement, scalable, and computationally efficient, only requiring the construction of the neighborhood graph as a preprocessing step. Extensive experiments on standard datasets show that NRAE significantly improves both overfitting and local connectivity in the learned manifold compared to existing methods.
