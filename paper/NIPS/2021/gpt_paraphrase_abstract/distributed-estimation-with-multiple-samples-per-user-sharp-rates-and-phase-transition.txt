We establish precise bounds for the problem of distributed estimation of discrete distributions with limited communication. In this problem, n users with m samples each can only broadcast a certain number of bits. Our main result provides a detailed characterization (with logarithmic factors) of the error rate based on m, the number of bits allowed for communication, the size of the domain, and the number of users under most scenarios of interest. Prior research focused on cases where each user only possessed one sample, but we demonstrate that as m increases, the error rate decreases by a factor of Ôm for small m. However, for large m, a significant change occurs: the impact of the communication constraint on the error rate shifts from 1/Ô2¸ to 1/Ô¸.
