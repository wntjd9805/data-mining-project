Low-rank Tucker and CP tensor decompositions are widely used in data analytics. However, the commonly used alternating least squares (ALS) method is expensive for large and sparse tensors. To address this issue, we propose a fast and precise sketched ALS algorithm for Tucker decomposition. This algorithm solves a series of sketched rank-constrained linear least squares subproblems. Theoretical upper bounds for sketch size are provided to achieve a relative error of O((cid:15)) for each subproblem using TensorSketch and leverage score sampling techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our ALS algorithm, combined with a new initialization scheme based on the randomized range finder, achieves decomposition accuracy comparable to the standard higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) algorithm. Additionally, our algorithm improves relative decomposition residual by up to 22.0% compared to the state-of-the-art sketched randomized algorithm for Tucker decomposition on various synthetic and real datasets. Furthermore, we utilize the Tucker-ALS algorithm to accelerate CP decomposition by employing randomized Tucker compression followed by CP decomposition of the Tucker core tensor. Experimental results reveal that our algorithm not only converges faster but also provides more accurate CP decompositions.
