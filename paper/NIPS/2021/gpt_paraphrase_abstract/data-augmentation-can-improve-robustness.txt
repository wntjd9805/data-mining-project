This paper focuses on reducing robust overfitting in adversarial training by using common data augmentation techniques. The authors demonstrate that when combined with model weight averaging, data augmentation can significantly improve robust accuracy, contrary to previous findings. They compare different data augmentation methods and find that spatial composition techniques work best for adversarial training. The approach is evaluated on CIFAR-10 against different norm-bounded perturbations, showing large improvements in robust accuracy compared to previous methods. The model achieves 60.07% robust accuracy without using external data. The approach also performs well on other architectures and datasets such as CIFAR-100, SVHN, and TINYIMAGENET.
