SIMILAR (Submodular Information Measures based actIve LeARning) is a new active learning framework that addresses limitations in existing methods. These limitations include dealing with imbalance or rare classes, out-of-distribution data, and redundancy. The framework utilizes submodular information measures as acquisition functions. SIMILAR not only works in standard active learning scenarios but also extends to realistic settings and acts as a comprehensive solution for active learning on large datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that SIMILAR outperforms existing algorithms by 5% to 18% for rare classes and 5% to 10% for out-of-distribution data on image classification tasks. SIMILAR can be accessed as part of the DISTIL toolkit.
