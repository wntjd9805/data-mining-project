Developing data-based heuristics and representations for biological sequences that accurately reflect their evolutionary distance is crucial for large-scale biological research. However, traditional machine learning methods that rely on continuous Euclidean spaces have struggled to handle the discrete combinatorial nature of the edit distance, which models evolution, as well as the hierarchical relationships found in real-world datasets. To address this, we introduce NeuroSEED, a versatile framework that embeds sequences in geometric vector spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using the hyperbolic space, which captures the hierarchical structure, by achieving a 22% reduction in embedding RMSE compared to other geometries. We then showcase the capabilities of NeuroSEED through supervised and unsupervised approaches applied to various bioinformatics tasks. Our methods outperform common baselines in terms of accuracy and/or runtime on real-world datasets. For instance, in hierarchical clustering, our pretrained and from-scratch methods achieve comparable quality to existing baselines while reducing runtime by 30x and 15x, respectively.
