Recent advancements in deep generative models have led to the development of multiple out-of-distribution (OOD) detection scores. This arises from the recognition that using likelihood thresholds for OOD detection is problematic. In this study, we present a novel OOD score based on the locally most powerful Bayesian test (LMPBT). The LMPBT is designed to optimize the probability of correct detection of OOD samples by maximizing the Bayes factor when compared to the evidence threshold. Specifically, the alternative hypothesis, which represents the OOD sample parameter, is specified to maximize the probability of surpassing the evidence threshold, provided that the alternative hypothesis parameter is within the vicinity of the null hypothesis parameter. We also introduce numerical strategies to enhance the efficiency and reliability of computing the LMPBT for practical applications in deep generative models. Evaluations performed on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the LMPBT in OOD detection compared to existing methods.
