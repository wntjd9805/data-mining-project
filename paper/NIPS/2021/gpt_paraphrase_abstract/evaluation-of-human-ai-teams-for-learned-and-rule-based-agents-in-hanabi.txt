Deep reinforcement learning has achieved impressive results in competitive games like Go and StarCraft. This study investigates whether similar techniques can be used to create a superior AI teammate for collaborative games between humans and machines. The researchers conducted a single-blind evaluation using the cooperative card game Hanabi, comparing rule-based and learning-based AI agents. They measured both objective team performance and subjective metrics such as perceived performance, teamwork, interpretability, trust, and overall preference for the AI teammate. Surprisingly, despite no significant difference in game score, humans consistently preferred the rule-based AI teammate (SmartBot) over the state-of-the-art learning-based AI teammate (Other-Play), as indicated by the subjective metrics. This finding suggests the importance of considering subjective measures in evaluating human-AI teaming, rather than solely focusing on objective task performance. It also has implications for future AI design and reinforcement learning benchmarking.
