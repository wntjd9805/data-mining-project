We propose new methods for speeding up sampling-based motion planning in robotics by training graph neural networks (GNNs) to perform path exploration and path smoothing. Our approach involves generating random geometric graphs (RGGs) from batch sampling and using the GNNs to predict collision-free edges for exploration and optimize paths. By capturing geometric patterns from RGGs and generalizing to unseen environments, our methods effectively reduce collision checking and improve planning efficiency in high-dimensional motion planning tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the significant benefits of our learned components.
