Bandit algorithms are being increasingly utilized in real-world sequential decision-making problems. As a result, there is a growing need to use the resulting datasets to answer scientific inquiries, such as determining the impact of different types of advertisements on purchase behavior or identifying the effectiveness of mobile health interventions in specific contexts. However, traditional statistical approaches fail to provide accurate confidence intervals when applied to data collected through bandit algorithms. While alternative methods have emerged for simple models like mean comparison, there is a lack of general approaches for conducting statistical inference using more complex models in the context of bandit algorithms. For instance, current methods are unable to provide valid inference for parameters in a logistic regression model with binary rewards. This study aims to address this gap by developing a theoretical framework that supports the use of M-estimators, including estimators based on empirical risk minimization and maximum likelihood, for data collected through adaptive algorithms like bandit algorithms. The authors demonstrate that by modifying M-estimators with specific adaptive weights, it is possible to construct asymptotically valid confidence regions for various inferential targets.
