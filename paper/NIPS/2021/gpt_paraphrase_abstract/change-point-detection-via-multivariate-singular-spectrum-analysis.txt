This study aims to develop a change point detection (CPD) algorithm for identifying significant and sudden changes in multivariate time series data. The algorithm combines a variant of singular spectrum analysis (SSA) with cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistics for sequential hypothesis testing. The underlying dynamics of the time series are modeled using a recently introduced spatio-temporal model in the multivariate SSA literature. The algorithm detects change points in an online manner using CUSUM statistics, adapting them from the independent observations setting to the dependent setting of multivariate time series under the spatio-temporal model. The algorithm achieves a desirable trade-off by detecting changes within a time delay of O(h) on average and avoiding false detections for at least exp(‚å¶(h)) time length on average when no change occurs. Empirical experiments on benchmark and synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs competitively or better than other state-of-the-art change point detection methods.
