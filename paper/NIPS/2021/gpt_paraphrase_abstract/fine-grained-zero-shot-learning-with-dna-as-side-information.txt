In this study, we explore the use of DNA as a form of side-information for fine-grained zero-shot learning in species classification. Manual annotation of visual attributes is expensive and impractical for a large number of classes, so we propose using DNA as a genetic marker to transfer discriminative information from seen to unseen classes. We develop a hierarchical Bayesian model that uses DNA information to establish a hierarchy in the image space and defines surrogate classes for unseen ones using local priors. Our experiments on the CUB dataset demonstrate that DNA can be a promising alternative to word vectors as side information, especially when robust word representations are not available. Additionally, on a newly compiled insect dataset utilizing DNA information from over a thousand species, our Bayesian approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
