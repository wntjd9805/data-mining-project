We examine linear and kernel classification in the streaming model. To enhance linear classification, we improve upon the algorithm presented in [1], which resolves the problem of a single point query on the optimal weight vector w∗ ∈ Rd using sublinear space. Initially, we propose an algorithm that solves the more challenging problem of a two-point query on w∗ using sublinear space. Additionally, we provide an algorithm that solves the related two heavy hitter problem on w∗, with sublinear space and running time. Finally, we present an algorithm that can deterministically solve the single point query problem on w∗, using sublinear space, which is an improvement over the algorithm in [1]. For kernel classification, if w∗ ∈ Rdp represents the optimal weight vector that classifies points in the stream based on their pth-degree polynomial kernel, we offer an algorithm that solves the two-point query problem on w∗ using poly( p log d) space. We also present an algorithm that solves the two heavy hitter problem using poly( p log d) space and running time. It is important to note that our space and running time are polynomial in p, making our algorithms suitable for high-degree polynomial kernels and the Gaussian kernel (approximated by the polynomial kernel with degree p = Θ(log T)). Furthermore, our algorithms for kernels are a specific instance of a broader algorithm we propose for low-rank tensor inputs. The format of the answer only includes the abstract.
