This paper presents recovery guarantees for phase retrieval with generative priors, using compressive phase retrieval and deep generative models. The study shows that with i.i.d. Gaussian measurements and an L-Lipschitz continuous generative model with bounded k-dimensional inputs, approximately O(k log L) samples are sufficient to ensure that any signal minimizing an amplitude-based empirical loss function is close to the true signal. Additionally, the paper demonstrates that roughly O(k log L) samples also ensure sufficient closeness between the underlying signal and any globally optimal solution to an optimization problem designed for spectral initialization. The results are extended to sparse phase retrieval, where O(s log n) samples are sufficient for a similar guarantee when the underlying signal is s-sparse and n-dimensional, matching an information-theoretic lower bound. Although these guarantees do not directly correspond to practical algorithms, the paper proposes a spectral initialization method based on the findings, which shows improved performance compared to existing methods in experiments for sparse phase retrieval.
