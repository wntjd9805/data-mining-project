Modeling group-level disparities in machine learning without assuming inherent differences between artificial groups of people is a challenging task. This paper proposes a model where agents possess a real-valued feature (e.g., credit score) and a binary label representing qualification (e.g., loan approval). Agents receive binary classification labels from a Bayes-optimal machine learning classifier and can update their qualification by imitating successful strategies within their isolated group. The study focuses on the disparity of qualification rates between different groups and how this disparity changes when Bayes-optimal classifiers are repeatedly retrained on the entire population. The replicator equation, derived from imitation processes, is used to model the evolving qualification rates of each subpopulation. The results demonstrate that differences in qualification rates between subpopulations can persist indefinitely due to uninformed classifier deployments, even when groups are identical except for initial qualification densities. The paper also examines the effects of fairness interventions and proposes a feedback control mechanism capable of permanently eliminating group-level qualification rate disparities. The limitations of the model and possible future research directions are discussed.
