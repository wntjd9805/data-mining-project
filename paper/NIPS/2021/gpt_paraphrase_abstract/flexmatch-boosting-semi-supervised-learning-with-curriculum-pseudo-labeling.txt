FixMatch, a recently proposed semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm, has achieved impressive results on SSL benchmarks. However, like other modern SSL algorithms, FixMatch uses a fixed threshold for all classes when selecting unlabeled data for training, ignoring the varying learning difficulties of different classes. To address this limitation, we introduce Curriculum Pseudo Labeling (CPL), a curriculum learning approach that leverages unlabeled data based on the model's learning status. CPL dynamically adjusts thresholds for different classes at each time step, allowing informative unlabeled data and their pseudo labels to pass through. CPL does not require additional parameters or computations. We integrate CPL into FixMatch, resulting in an improved algorithm called FlexMatch, which outperforms existing SSL methods on various benchmarks, particularly when labeled data is scarce or the task is challenging. For instance, FlexMatch achieves a 13.96% and 18.96% reduction in error rate compared to FixMatch on CIFAR-100 and STL-10 datasets, respectively, with only 4 labels per class. Additionally, CPL significantly accelerates convergence, with FlexMatch achieving better performance in just 1/5 of the training time required by FixMatch. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CPL can be easily applied to other SSL algorithms, leading to remarkable performance improvements.
