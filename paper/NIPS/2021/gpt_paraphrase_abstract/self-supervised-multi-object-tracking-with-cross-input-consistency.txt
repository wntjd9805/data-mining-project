This paper introduces a new approach for training a robust multi-object tracking (MOT) model using unlabeled video data. Previous studies have proposed self-supervised learning signals for single-object tracking, but these signals are not suitable for training RNN models necessary for accurate MOT. The authors propose a novel self-supervisory signal called cross-input consistency, where two distinct inputs are created for the same video sequence, with different information hidden in each input. Tracks are then computed independently on each input using an RNN model, and the model is trained to produce consistent tracks across the two inputs. The unsupervised method is evaluated on MOT17 and KITTI datasets and surprisingly outperforms four supervised methods published in the last 1-2 years.
