We address the problem of finding multiple related Gaussian directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that share a consistent causal order and have sparse unions of supports. In the context of multi-task learning, we propose a l1/l2-regularized maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for learning K linear structural equation models. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the joint estimator, which leverages data from related tasks, has a better sample complexity for recovering the causal order compared to separate estimations. Additionally, the joint estimator can recover non-identifiable DAGs by estimating them alongside identifiable DAGs. We also establish the consistency of union support recovery for the structures. To facilitate practical implementation, we formulate a continuous optimization problem with an iterative algorithm that approximates the optimizer, which is the same as the joint estimator. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our joint estimator and validate the theoretical analysis.
