This study focuses on developing a reliable method for multimodal regression, which involves integrating information from different sources to improve performance in various applications. Existing methods prioritize performance improvement but often neglect the confidence of predictions in different situations. In order to address this issue, the study proposes a new algorithm called Mixture of Normal-Inverse Gamma distributions (MoNIG), which effectively estimates uncertainty to enable adaptive integration of different modalities and produce trustworthy regression results. The MoNIG algorithm is capable of dynamically assessing uncertainty for each modality and is resilient to corrupted modalities. Additionally, it explicitly represents modality-specific and global uncertainties, known as epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties, respectively. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and trustworthiness of the proposed method in various multimodal regression tasks, such as temperature prediction for superconductivity, relative location prediction for CT slices, and multimodal sentiment analysis.
