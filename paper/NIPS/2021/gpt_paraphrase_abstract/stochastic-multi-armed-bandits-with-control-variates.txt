This study explores a new variation of the stochastic multi-armed bandits problem, which incorporates auxiliary information in the form of control variates to improve the estimation of arm rewards. In various real-world scenarios such as queuing and wireless networks, arm rewards are influenced by external factors. By utilizing historical data and the known mean values of these factors, we can employ control variates to generate more precise estimates of the arm rewards with reduced variance and tighter confidence bounds. We introduce an algorithm called UCB-CV, based on the upper confidence bound approach, and analyze its regret bounds in relation to the correlation between rewards and control variates assuming a multivariate normal distribution. Additionally, we extend UCB-CV to handle other distributions using resampling methods like Jackknifing and Splitting. Experimental results on synthetic problem instances confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
