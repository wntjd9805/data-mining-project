This study introduces a novel data-driven method for accurately locating an observer within an indoor environment using a 2D topological map. Existing techniques are limited in their accuracy due to their reliance on specific data modalities, such as camera-based systems. In contrast, our approach, called OT-Isomap, is modality-agnostic and addresses the localization problem by combining parametric manifold learning with optimal transportation. This framework enables the learning of a low-dimensional representation and correspondences with the topological map. To evaluate the algorithm's effectiveness, we apply it to various data modalities, including image sequences and radio frequency signals. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves precise localization accuracy at the decimeter level, regardless of the sensory input used.
