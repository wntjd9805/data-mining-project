Semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms have been successful in utilizing limited labeled data. However, these algorithms are computationally expensive, which can be a drawback for smaller companies and academic groups. Our insight is that training on a subset of unlabeled data instead of the entire dataset can lead to faster convergence and reduced computational costs. To address this, we introduce RETRIEVE1, a framework for efficient and robust SSL. RETRIEVE selects a coreset by solving an optimization problem that minimizes the labeled set loss. We demonstrate through experiments that existing SSL algorithms, such as VAT, Mean-Teacher, and FixMatch, combined with RETRIEVE, achieve faster training times and better performance when dealing with Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data and data imbalance. RETRIEVE offers a speedup of around 3× in traditional SSL settings and a speedup of 5× compared to state-of-the-art robust SSL algorithms in the presence of imbalance and OOD data. RETRIEVE is available as part of the CORDS toolkit.
