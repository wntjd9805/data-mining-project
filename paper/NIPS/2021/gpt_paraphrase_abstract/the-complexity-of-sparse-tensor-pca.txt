We investigate the problem of sparse tensor principal component analysis, which aims to recover a sparse unit vector from a given tensor. We propose a set of algorithms that can efficiently recover the sparse vector for various levels of sparsity. Our algorithms have time complexities that depend on the signal-to-noise ratio and the sparsity level. Our results also extend to the case of multiple sparse signals with disjoint supports, and they are independent of the number of spikes. Compared to existing algorithms, our approaches require lower noise ratios to recover the sparse vectors. Additionally, we analyze the trade-offs between signal-to-noise ratio and running time using a low-degree likelihood ratio. This analysis provides evidence for the lower bounds in both sparse PCA and tensor PCA. Overall, our findings demonstrate a complex trade-off between the number of samples, sparsity level, and tensor power in this general model.
