In our research, we focus on a specific type of computer vision scenarios where we can alter the design of objects that are being identified. To take advantage of this, we have created a framework that utilizes deep networks' ability to detect changes in input to create "robust objects." These objects are intentionally optimized to be accurately classified by the networks. By implementing our framework, we have achieved better results in various tests, including standard benchmarks, simulations in a robotics environment, and real-world experiments.
