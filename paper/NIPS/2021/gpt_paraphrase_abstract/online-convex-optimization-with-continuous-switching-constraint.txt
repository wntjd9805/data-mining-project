In various situations involving sequential decision making, changing a decision can result in additional costs, such as the wear-and-tear cost associated with changing the status of a server. To address this issue, we introduce the problem of online convex optimization with a continuous switching constraint. The objective is to minimize regret while staying within a given budget for overall switching costs. We examine the difficulty of the problem and establish lower bounds on the order of ⌦(pT ) and ⌦(min)} for different switching cost budgets. We achieve this by carefully designing an adaptive adversary that adjusts the loss function based on the cumulative switching cost incurred by the player. We then propose a simple gradient-based algorithm that achieves the optimal regret bound. Additionally, we demonstrate that for strongly convex functions, the regret bound can be improved to O(log T ) for a switching cost budget of ⌦(log T ), and O(minT / exp(S) + S, TT /S, T{) for a budget of O(log T ).
