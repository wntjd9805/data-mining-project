Humans have the ability to reason about intuitive physics in observed or partially observed environments, even with limited observations. This intuitive physical reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human common sense knowledge. One possible explanation for this ability is that humans quickly learn approximations to the laws of physics that govern the dynamics of the environment. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian-symbolic framework (BSP) for physical reasoning and learning that achieves similar levels of efficiency and accuracy as humans. BSP represents the environment as a generative model of entities, which interact with each other based on unknown force laws. Each entity is modeled as a random variable, and Bayesian inference is used to estimate their properties. BSP learns the unknown force laws through symbolic regression using a grammar of Newtonian physics. This learning process is performed iteratively using expectation-maximization, allowing BSP to simultaneously learn force laws and maintain uncertainty over entity properties. We demonstrate that BSP is more efficient than neural alternatives on synthetic datasets and can be applied to real-world scenarios. Additionally, we evaluate BSP's performance on tasks used to study human physical reasoning.
