We introduce ATISS, a new autoregressive transformer architecture that can automatically generate diverse and realistic indoor furniture layouts based on partial input. Unlike previous approaches that treat scene synthesis as sequence generation, our model generates rooms as unordered sets of objects, allowing for a wider range of applications beyond room layout synthesis. This includes interactive scene completion, partial room rearrangement, and object suggestions. By leveraging the permutation equivariance of the transformer, our model is able to handle partial scenes and is trained to be permutation-invariant. It is trained end-to-end as an autoregressive generative model using labeled 3D bounding boxes. Evaluations on the 3D-FRONT dataset demonstrate that our model consistently produces more realistic room layouts compared to existing methods, while also being simpler, faster, and having fewer parameters.
