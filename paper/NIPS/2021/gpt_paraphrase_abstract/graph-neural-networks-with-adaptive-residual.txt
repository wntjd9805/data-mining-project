Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in learning graph representations for various tasks. However, we have observed that while residual connections in GNNs enhance performance, they also increase vulnerability to abnormal node features. This is problematic as real-world graphs often contain abnormal features due to noise or adversarial manipulation. To address this issue, we analyze the reasons behind this vulnerability and propose a resilient GNN architecture. Our analysis leads us to develop AirGNN1, a novel GNN with an adaptive message passing scheme that is simple, efficient, and interpretable. Extensive experiments conducted under different abnormal feature scenarios validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.
