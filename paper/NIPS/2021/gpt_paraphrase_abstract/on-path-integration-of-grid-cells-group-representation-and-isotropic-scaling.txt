This study focuses on understanding how grid cells perform path integration calculations. The researchers analyze a representation model in which the 2D self-position is encoded as a higher dimensional vector, and self-motion is represented by a transformation of the vector. Two conditions are identified for the transformation: a group representation condition necessary for path integration, and an isotropic scaling condition that ensures locally conformal embedding. The linear transformation is explored in detail, revealing its algebraic and geometric structure as a matrix Lie group of rotation. The connection between the isotropic scaling condition and a special class of hexagon grid patterns is investigated. Additionally, the researchers develop an optimization-based approach to learn hexagon grid patterns that mimic the properties of grid cells in the rodent brain. The learned model demonstrates accurate long-distance path integration. The code for this study is available at https://github.com/ruiqigao/grid-cell-path.
