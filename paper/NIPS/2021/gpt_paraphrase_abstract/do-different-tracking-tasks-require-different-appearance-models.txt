Object tracking in videos is a widely studied problem in computer vision, but the increasing number of use cases and benchmarks has led to fragmentation in the literature. As a result, novel approaches are often specialized for specific setups. To investigate the necessity of this specialization, this work introduces UniTrack, a framework that addresses five different tracking tasks using a single and task-agnostic appearance model. This model can be learned in a supervised or self-supervised manner, and multiple "heads" handle individual tasks without requiring training. The authors demonstrate that most tracking tasks can be solved within this framework, and the same appearance model can achieve competitive results compared to specialized methods. Additionally, UniTrack allows for the analysis of appearance models obtained through recent self-supervised methods, expanding their evaluation and comparison to a wider range of important problems.
