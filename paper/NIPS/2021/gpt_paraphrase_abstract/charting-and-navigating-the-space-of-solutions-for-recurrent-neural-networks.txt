Recent studies have utilized Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to model the relationship between neural activity and behavior in animals. However, it has been assumed that these models provide universal solutions, which is being challenged by observations in neuroscience and machine learning. Animals can employ various strategies to approach a task, and training machine learning algorithms can result in underspecification. These findings suggest that each task has a range of possible solutions. This study aims to characterize the solution space for different tasks. Initially, a two-neuron network is examined to understand the connection between initial connectivity and final solutions. Next, three neuroscience-inspired tasks are explored, revealing a diverse set of solutions. Variability in neural activity and the ability to extrapolate are identified as sources of additional solution types. The study introduces a tool to derive the reduced dynamics of networks, enabling the classification of task solutions into a few types that can be partially predicted by neural features. These findings contribute to our understanding of the solution space and its applications in both machine learning and neuroscience.
