Individuals' opinions are influenced and shaped by their interactions with others, leading to social phenomena like disagreement and polarization becoming prevalent in daily life. The quantification and optimization of these concepts have garnered significant attention in recent research, particularly in data mining applications. While previous studies have focused on altering initial opinions or designing networks from scratch, this study explores the optimization problem of recommending new links to minimize polarization and disagreement in a social network. The objective function of this combinatorial optimization problem is found to be monotone but not submodular. To address this challenge, a simple greedy algorithm with a constant-factor approximation is proposed, providing a cubic running time solution. The algorithm's approximation guarantee is theoretically analyzed. Additionally, a fast algorithm with a computation complexity of O(mk^(-2)) is presented to overcome computational challenges for large networks. Extensive experiments on real datasets confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
