Estimating uncertainty for out-of-distribution (OOD) data is a significant challenge in deploying machine learning models in real-world scenarios. While there have been advancements in OOD detection for multi-class classification, OOD detection for multi-label classification is largely unexplored and relies on basic techniques. In this study, we introduce JointEnergy, a straightforward yet effective method that estimates OOD indicator scores by combining energy scores from multiple labels. We demonstrate that the JointEnergy approach can be mathematically interpreted from a joint likelihood perspective. Our experiments show consistent improvements over previous methods that solely rely on maximum-valued scores, as they fail to capture joint information from multiple labels. We evaluate the effectiveness of JointEnergy on three widely used multi-label classification benchmarks (MS-COCO, PASCAL-VOC, and NUS-WIDE). The results demonstrate that JointEnergy can reduce the false positive rate (FPR95) by up to 10.05% compared to the previous best baseline, establishing it as the state-of-the-art performance.
