We investigate the problem of estimating a rank-1 signal in the presence of noise that is rotationally invariant, a type of perturbation broader than Gaussian noise. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a natural method for estimation, and its performance has been extensively studied in high-dimensional scenarios. An alternative estimator called Approximate Message Passing (AMP) has recently been proposed to potentially enhance the accuracy of PCA. However, the current analysis of AMP requires an initialization that is both correlated with the signal and independent of the noise, which is often unrealistic in practical situations. In this study, we combine the two approaches and suggest initializing AMP with PCA. Our main outcome is a rigorous asymptotic characterization of the performance of this estimator. Both the AMP algorithm and its analysis differ from those derived in the Gaussian setting. Our AMP algorithm includes a specific term at each iteration to account for the PCA initialization, whereas in the Gaussian case, PCA initialization only affects the first iteration of AMP. We prove our result using a two-phase artificial AMP that approximates the PCA estimator first and then mimics the true AMP. Our numerical simulations demonstrate excellent agreement between AMP results and theoretical predictions, and they also suggest a promising future direction for achieving Bayes-optimal performance.
