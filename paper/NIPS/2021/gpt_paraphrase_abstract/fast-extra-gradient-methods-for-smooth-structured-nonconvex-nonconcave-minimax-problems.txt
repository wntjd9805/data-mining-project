This paper introduces a new method called fast extragradient (FEG) for solving modern minimax problems under a nonconvex-nonconcave setting. FEG is an extension of the extragradient (EG) method and incorporates an anchoring technique. It achieves a fast convergence rate of O(1/k2) on the squared gradient norm for smooth structured nonconvex-nonconcave problems. The paper also presents a backtracking line-search version of FEG, called FEG-A, for cases where problem parameters are unknown. Additionally, the paper includes a stochastic analysis of FEG. Overall, FEG offers an efficient solution for minimizing nonconvex-nonconcave problems.
