The abstract describes the development of a Dual-stream Network (DS-Net) that combines local and global pattern features for image classification. The DS-Net utilizes an Intra-scale Propagation module to process different resolutions and an Inter-Scale Alignment module to integrate information across features at dual scales. Additionally, a Dual-stream FPN (DS-FPN) is employed to enhance contextual information for dense predictions. The proposed DS-Net outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy on ImageNet-1k dataset and achieves state-of-the-art results for Vision Transformers and ResNets. In object detection and instance segmentation tasks, DS-Net-Small surpasses ResNet-50 in terms of mAP on MSCOCO 2017 dataset, demonstrating its potential as a versatile backbone for various vision tasks. The code for DS-Net will be made available soon.
