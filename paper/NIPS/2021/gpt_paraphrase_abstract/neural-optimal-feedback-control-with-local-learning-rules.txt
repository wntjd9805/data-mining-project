The challenge of motor control lies in understanding how the brain plans and executes movements despite delays and noise in sensory stimuli. Optimal Feedback Control (OFC) is a popular framework for addressing this issue. However, existing neural models of OFC have limitations, such as neglecting sensory feedback delay, requiring alternating training phases, and needing knowledge of noise covariance matrices and system dynamics. Additionally, these models often focus on Kalman filtering alone, without considering control. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new online algorithm that combines adaptive Kalman filtering with a model-free control approach. This algorithm is implemented in a biologically plausible neural network with local synaptic plasticity rules. The network can perform system identification and Kalman filtering without multiple update rules or knowledge of noise covariances. It can also estimate states with delayed sensory feedback using an internal model. Furthermore, it learns the control policy without requiring knowledge of dynamics, eliminating the need for weight transport. Our implementation of OFC effectively solves the credit assignment problem, enabling appropriate sensory-motor control in the presence of stimulus delay.
