This study focuses on the interdependence between nodes in graphs and its impact on improving class predictions. It discusses the use of approaches like Label Propagation (LP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in utilizing this interdependence. However, the exploration of uncertainty estimation for non-independent node-level predictions is limited. The researchers aim to address this gap by exploring three aspects of uncertainty quantification for node classification. Firstly, they derive three axioms that explicitly characterize the expected behavior of predictive uncertainty in homophilic attributed graphs. Secondly, they propose a new model called Graph Posterior Network (GPN), which performs Bayesian posterior updates for predictions on interdependent nodes. GPN is designed to adhere to the axioms proposed in the study. Lastly, the performance of GPN and several baseline models are extensively evaluated in the context of semi-supervised node classification tasks, including anomalous feature detection and detection of left-out classes. The experiments demonstrate that GPN outperforms existing approaches for uncertainty estimation.
