Time series forecasting is a commonly used technique in business intelligence for predicting stock market prices, sales, and analyzing data trends. Typically, these forecasts are based on aggregated macroscopic time series data. However, there is limited research on forecasting macroscopic time series by utilizing microscopic data.In this study, we assume that microscopic time series data follows unknown probabilistic distributions. We demonstrate that by identifying the underlying mixture components, we can improve the estimation of time series from each component due to reduced variance. This, in turn, enhances the estimation of macroscopic time series.Drawing inspiration from Seq2seq models and their variations, we propose MixSeq, an end-to-end mixture model for clustering microscopic time series. This model employs a family of Seq2seq models with different parameters. Through extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.Overall, our study highlights the importance of considering microscopic data for forecasting macroscopic time series and presents a novel approach that outperforms existing methods.
