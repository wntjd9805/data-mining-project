Causal structure learning is a critical issue in various domains. Learning causal structures involves conducting experiments on the system of interest. This study focuses on the less explored task of designing a batch of experiments that intervene on multiple variables simultaneously. Although these interventions may provide more valuable information compared to single-variable interventions, selecting them algorithmically is much more challenging due to the complex search space. This paper presents efficient algorithms that optimize different objective functions, which measure the informativeness of a budget-constrained batch of experiments. By establishing new submodularity properties for these objectives, the algorithms provide approximation guarantees. Empirical results show that our algorithms outperform random interventions and algorithms that only choose single-variable interventions.
