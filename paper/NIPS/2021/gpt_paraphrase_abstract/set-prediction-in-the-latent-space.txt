In set prediction tasks, the matching between predicted sets and ground truth sets is necessary for gradient signal propagation. Previous methods performed this matching in the original feature space, requiring predefined distance functions. We propose a new approach that learns the distance function by conducting the matching in the latent space obtained from encoding networks. This allows for the use of teacher forcing, which was not previously possible as matching in the feature space had to be computed after generating the entire output sequence. However, a simple implementation of latent set prediction may not converge due to permutation instability. To tackle this issue, we present sufficient conditions for permutation stability and develop an algorithm to enhance overall model convergence. Our method is evaluated on various set prediction tasks, such as image captioning and object detection, and proves to be effective. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/phizaz/latent-set-prediction.
