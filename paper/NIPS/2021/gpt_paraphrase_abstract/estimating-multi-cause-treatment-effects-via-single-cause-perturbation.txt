Most current methods for estimating the effect of a single cause in conditional average treatment effect estimation are not suitable for situations where multiple variables need to be intervened on simultaneously. This creates challenges in estimating the treatment effect for multiple causes due to confounding bias and data scarcity. To address this issue, we propose a novel two-step procedure called Single-cause Perturbation (SCP). SCP involves augmenting the observational dataset with estimated potential outcomes under single-cause interventions and then performing covariate adjustment to obtain the estimator. SCP is flexible in terms of the algorithm used in each step and is shown to be valid under standard assumptions in causal inference. Extensive experiments using synthetic and semi-synthetic data demonstrate the improved performance of SCP.
