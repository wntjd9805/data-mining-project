This article presents a framework for learning optimal strategies in matching markets that are organized in a multi-stage and decentralized manner. It addresses the uncertainty of participants' preferences using a nonparametric statistical approach and variational analysis. The proposed algorithm, based on the concepts of "lower uncertainty bound" and "calibrated decentralized matching," maximizes participants' expected payoff efficiently. The study reveals a trade-off between welfare and fairness determined by the level of uncertainty in acceptance. Participants strategically favor a low uncertainty level to reduce competition and increase their expected payoff. The research proves that participants can benefit more from multi-stage matching than single-stage matching. Simulations and an experiment using real data from college admissions support the theoretical predictions.
