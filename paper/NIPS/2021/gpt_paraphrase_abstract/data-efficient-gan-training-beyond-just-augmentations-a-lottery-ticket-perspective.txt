To overcome the challenge of training generative adversarial networks (GANs) with limited real image data, we propose a new approach inspired by the discovery of independently trainable and highly sparse subnetworks called "lottery tickets" in GANs. By identifying the lottery ticket from the original GAN using a small training set of real images and focusing on training that sparse subnetwork using the same set, we introduce a data-efficient GAN training framework. Our framework offers additional benefits to existing real image data augmentation methods and includes a new feature-level augmentation technique. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments on various GAN architectures and datasets. The code for our framework is available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/Ultra-Data-Efficient-GAN-Training.
