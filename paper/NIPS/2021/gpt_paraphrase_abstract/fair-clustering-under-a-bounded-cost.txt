Clustering is a key problem in unsupervised learning, involving the division of a dataset into clusters based on proximity in a metric space. Fair clustering is a recent variation that assigns a color to each point to represent its group membership and aims to achieve equal representation of colors within each cluster for group fairness. However, enforcing fairness increases the cost of the clustering objective, known as the "price of fairness," which can be unbounded. To address this, we propose treating an upper bound on the clustering objective as a constraint and maximizing equality of representation within this constraint. We explore three fairness objectives: group utilitarian, group egalitarian, and group leximin. We establish lower bounds on the approximation of utilitarian and egalitarian objectives and introduce algorithms with provable guarantees for these objectives. For the leximin objective, we present an effective heuristic algorithm. We also demonstrate the impossibility of achieving other natural fairness objectives. Finally, we provide experimental results on real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of our algorithms.
