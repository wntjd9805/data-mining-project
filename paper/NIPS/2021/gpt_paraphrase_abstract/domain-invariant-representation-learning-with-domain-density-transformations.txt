Domain generalization is the challenge of training a model on data from multiple source domains so that it can perform well on unseen target domains. Simply combining all the data from the source domains can lead to suboptimal performance because the model may learn domain-specific information that does not generalize well. To address this, a common approach is to learn domain-invariant information that can generalize across domains. In this paper, we propose a method that enforces the representation network to be invariant to all transformation functions between domains, resulting in a domain-invariant representation. We also utilize generative adversarial networks to learn these domain transformations in practice. Our method achieves competitive results on widely used datasets for the domain generalization problem, outperforming state-of-the-art models.
