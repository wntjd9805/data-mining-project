This paper presents a solution for estimating unknown intervention targets in a causal directed acyclic graph using observational and interventional data. The focus is on soft interventions in linear structural equation models. Existing methods for causal structure learning either rely on known intervention targets or use hypothesis testing to discover unknown targets, which limits their scalability and sample complexity. The proposed algorithm overcomes these limitations by consistently identifying all intervention targets. It does so by estimating intervention sites based on the difference between precision matrices associated with observational and interventional datasets, through repeated estimation in different subsets of variables. The algorithm can also update an observational Markov equivalence class to an interventional Markov equivalence class. Analytical proofs are provided for consistency, Markov equivalency, and sample complexity. Simulation results on real and synthetic data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for scalable causal structure recovery.
