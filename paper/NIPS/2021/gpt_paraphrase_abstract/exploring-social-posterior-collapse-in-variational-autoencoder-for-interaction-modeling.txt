This study focuses on multi-agent behavior modeling and trajectory forecasting for autonomous agents in interactive scenarios. The use of Variational Autoencoder (VAE) has become popular in multi-agent interaction modeling to generate diverse behavior and learn a low-dimensional representation. However, the existing literature lacks discussion on whether VAE-based models can effectively encode interaction into their latent space. This work identifies a problem known as social posterior collapse in one formulation of VAEs in multi-agent modeling, where the model tends to ignore historical social context when predicting an agent's future trajectory. This issue leads to significant prediction errors and poor generalization performance. The researchers analyze the underlying reasons for this phenomenon and propose several solutions. The proposed framework includes a novel sparse graph attention message-passing (sparse-GAMP) layer, which helps detect social posterior collapse. Experimental results on real-world datasets confirm the occurrence of social posterior collapse and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed measures in mitigating this issue. The model achieves improved generalization performance when historical social context is informative for prediction.
