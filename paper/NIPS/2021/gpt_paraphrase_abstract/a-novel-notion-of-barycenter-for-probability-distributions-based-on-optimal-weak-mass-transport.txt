We introduce weak barycenters of probability distributions using optimal weak transport of mass. We analyze this concept and its interpretation in relation to convex ordering of probability measures. Instead of geometrically averaging the input distributions like classic optimal transport does, weak barycenters extract common geometric information shared by all distributions through a latent random variable. We present iterative and stochastic algorithms to compute weak barycenters for finite and arbitrary populations of distributions, respectively. Our stochastic algorithm is suitable for streaming settings. We demonstrate the concept and computation of weak barycenters through synthetic and real-world data examples, comparing them to standard Wasserstein barycenters.
