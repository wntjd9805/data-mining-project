Deep equilibrium models have demonstrated competitive performance compared to traditional deep networks. Monotone operator equilibrium networks (monDEQ) offer additional theoretical guarantees while maintaining interesting performance. However, existing certification tools for classical deep networks cannot be directly applied to monDEQs due to a lack of appropriate tools. To address this issue, we propose a semialgebraic representation for ReLU based monDEQs. This representation allows us to approximate the input-output relationship using semidefinite programming (SDP). We apply this approach to network certification and develop SDP models for robustness certification, Lipschitz constant estimation, and ellipsoidal uncertainty propagation. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed models outperform existing methods for monDEQ certification. Additionally, our investigations indicate that monDEQs are more robust to L2 perturbations compared to Lâˆž perturbations.
