Geometric alignment is important in various applications such as machine learning, computer vision, and biomedical imaging. However, aligning domains with different topologies is a challenge that is often overlooked, leading to potential bias in subsequent analysis. To address this problem, we propose an unsupervised algorithm that detects changes in image topology. Our model, based on a conditional variational auto-encoder, identifies topological changes between two images during the registration process. It takes into account both spatial variations in the image and unexpected transformations. We validate our approach on two tasks and datasets: detecting topological changes in microscopy images of cells and unsupervised anomaly detection in brain imaging.
