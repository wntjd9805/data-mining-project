Structured distributions, which are used to learn latent probabilistic representations from observed data, face challenges in scaling due to their high computational and memory complexity. Common models like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars (PCFGs) have quadratic and cubic time and space requirements, respectively, based on the number of hidden states. This study presents a straightforward method to reduce the computational and memory complexity of various structured models. By treating the central inference step as a matrix-vector product and applying a low-rank constraint, the trade-off between model expressivity and speed can be achieved. Experimental results on neural parameterized structured models in language modeling, polyphonic music modeling, unsupervised grammar induction, and video modeling demonstrate that our approach maintains accuracy comparable to standard models for large state spaces while offering practical speed improvements.
