Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular in real-world scenarios, but their architecture design relies heavily on manual effort. To address this, researchers have shown interest in automated graph neural networks (AutoGNN) to achieve better performance. However, existing AutoGNN approaches have not effectively utilized link information in graphs, limiting their performance in tasks such as link prediction. In this paper, we propose AutoGEL, a novel AutoGNN approach that explicitly models link information. AutoGEL improves performance in tasks like node classification and graph classification by introducing a new search space and employing a robust differentiable search algorithm. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoGEL in various tasks.
