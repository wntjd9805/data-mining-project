This study introduces a method for 3D pose transfer, which involves transferring the pose of a source mesh to a target mesh while preserving the target mesh's identity. Previous approaches either relied on key point annotations for accurate correspondence or neglected shape correspondence altogether, resulting in limited generation quality. The proposed method utilizes a correspondence-refinement network to establish correspondence between the source and target meshes by solving an optimal transport problem. The source mesh is then warped based on this correspondence, resulting in a coarse warped mesh. To improve the quality of the warped mesh, an Elastic Instance Normalization technique is introduced. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach effectively transfers poses from source to target meshes and generates superior results compared to existing methods.
