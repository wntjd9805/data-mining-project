This paper introduces a new approach called MosaicKD for out-of-domain knowledge distillation (OOD-KD), which aims to conduct knowledge transfer using only readily available OOD data. The key insight behind MosaicKD is that samples from different domains may have common local patterns, which can be re-assembled to approximate in-domain data and reduce domain discrepancy. MosaicKD involves a four-player min-max game, where a generator, discriminator, student network, and pre-trained teacher are collectively trained in an adversarial manner. The effectiveness of MosaicKD is demonstrated through experiments on classification and semantic segmentation tasks, showing superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods on OOD data. The code for MosaicKD is available at https://github.com/zju-vipa/MosaicKD.
