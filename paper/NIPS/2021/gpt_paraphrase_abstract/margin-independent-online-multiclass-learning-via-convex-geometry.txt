The problem of multi-class classification is examined in this study, focusing on assigning labels to a series of adversarially selected queries in real-time. Instead of aiming to minimize the rate of misclassification, the goal is to minimize the overall distance between each query and the corresponding region representing its correct label. If the true labels are determined using a nearest neighbor approach, where the label of a point is determined by its proximity to one of k centers in Euclidean distance, it is demonstrated that a loss can be achieved that is not dependent on the total number of queries. Additionally, it is shown that learning general convex sets results in a nearly linear loss per query. These findings are based on previous regret guarantees for the contextual search problem in geometry. Furthermore, a novel reduction technique from multiclass to binary classification is introduced, which may be of independent interest.
