Deep neural networks (DNNs) often make more errors when training on classes with significantly fewer samples compared to others. This class imbalance is common in clinical applications, where accurately identifying critical cases (such as cancer) is crucial. However, existing methods for handling class imbalance do not effectively address this issue. In this study, we propose a novel approach to improve prediction accuracy by reducing false positive rates (FPRs) at high true positive rates (TPRs), particularly for critical class samples. We formulate the training of a DNN for binary classification as a constrained optimization problem and introduce a new constraint that prioritizes FPR reduction at high TPRs, resulting in maximal area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We solve this optimization problem using an Augmented Lagrangian method (ALM). Additionally, we propose two extensions of the constraint for multi-class classification problems. Experimental results on medical imaging datasets and CIFAR10/CIFAR100 datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines by achieving higher accuracy on critical classes while reducing misclassification rates for non-critical class samples.
