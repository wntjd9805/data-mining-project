State-of-the-art methods in partial multi-label learning (PML) address ambiguities by directly identifying ground-truth labels. However, it raises the question of whether these labels can be accurately identified and how to find them. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Mutual Information Label Identification for Partial Multi-Label Learning (MILI-PML). Unlike previous methods that rely on heuristic strategies, MILI-PML is based on a clear probabilistic formulation and can be interpreted theoretically using mutual information. Additionally, it takes into account the relevance between features and labels. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that MILI-PML outperforms existing methods.
