Object detection has made significant progress but requires large amounts of fully annotated data, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this, we propose object detection with mixed supervision, which leverages weak annotations and full annotations of existing object categories. Previous research in mixed supervision has focused on learning class-agnostic objectness from fully annotated categories and transferring it to weak annotations for novel categories. In this paper, we go a step further by transferring mask prior and semantic similarity to bridge the gap between base and novel categories. We learn the ability to use mask prior for object detection from base categories and transfer it to novel categories. Additionally, we transfer the semantic similarity knowledge from base categories to enhance the quality of pseudo full annotations for novel categories. Our method outperforms existing approaches on three benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/bcmi/TraMaS-Weak-Shot-Object-Detection.
