Accurately propagating the gradient through categorical variables is a difficult task encountered in various domains, such as training models with discrete latent variables. In this study, we propose CARMS, an unbiased estimator for categorical random variables. CARMS uses multiple mutually negatively correlated samples to avoid duplicates and reduce variance, while maintaining unbiasedness through importance sampling. CARMS extends the ARMS antithetic estimator for binary variables and LOORF/VarGrad, the leave-one-out REINFORCE estimator. We assess CARMS on benchmark datasets for generative modeling and structured output prediction tasks, and find it to outperform other methods, including a strong self-control baseline. The code for CARMS is publicly available.
