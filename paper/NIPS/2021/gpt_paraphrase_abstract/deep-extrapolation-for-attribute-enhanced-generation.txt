Generating samples that possess attributes beyond the training distribution is a difficult task for deep neural networks. In this study, we introduce a novel task of attribute extrapolation in sequence generation, specifically focusing on natural language and proteins. To address this challenge, we propose GENhance, a generative framework that leverages a learned latent space to enhance attributes. We train GENhance on movie reviews and a dataset of computed protein stability, enabling it to generate highly positive text reviews and stable protein sequences even without exposure to similar data during training. In order to contribute to the research on generative modeling extrapolation and data-driven design in biology and chemistry, we provide our benchmark tasks and models on a public repository.
