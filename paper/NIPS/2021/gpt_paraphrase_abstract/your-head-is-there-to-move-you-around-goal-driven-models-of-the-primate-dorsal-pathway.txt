The dorsal visual pathway in the mammalian brain contains neurons that are selective for motion stimuli. These neurons become more complex as they progress along the pathway, similar to the ventral visual pathway. While artificial neural networks (ANNs) have successfully characterized the ventral pathway, there are currently no comparable models for the dorsal stream. This study proposes that the properties of dorsal stream neurons can be explained by the need for an organism to orient itself during self-motion. To test this hypothesis, a 3D ResNet was trained to predict an agent's self-motion parameters based on visual stimuli in a simulated environment. The network's responses aligned well with the selectivity of neurons in the dorsal visual stream of non-human primates. In contrast, ANNs trained on action recognition datasets could not explain dorsal stream responses, despite being trained on videos with moving objects. These findings suggest that an ecologically relevant learning objective can account for the properties of the dorsal stream in the primate brain.
