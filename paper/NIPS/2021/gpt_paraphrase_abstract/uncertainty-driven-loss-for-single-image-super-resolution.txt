The traditional approach to single image super-resolution (SISR) treats all pixels equally, disregarding the varying importance of texture and edge areas compared to smooth areas. This paper presents a new adaptive weighted loss for SISR that focuses on challenging situations, such as textured and edge pixels with high uncertainty. By incorporating variance estimation on a pixel-by-pixel basis, the model is able to simultaneously learn the high-resolution image and its corresponding uncertainty. This uncertainty estimation allows for the incorporation of conventional wisdom, such as sparsity prior, to regularize SISR solutions. The proposed uncertainty-driven loss achieves better results than traditional loss functions across various network architectures, as demonstrated in experiments on three popular SISR networks. The proposed method does not require additional computation during testing. The code for this method is available at https://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/wsdong/Projects/UDL-SR.htm.
