EditGAN is a new method for high-quality, detailed image editing using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Unlike other GAN-based editing methods, EditGAN does not require large datasets or high-level control. Instead, it focuses on precise editing by modifying specific parts of an image through detailed segmentation masks. By embedding images into the GAN's latent space and optimizing the conditional latent code according to the segmentation edit, EditGAN effectively modifies the image. To streamline the optimization process, EditGAN identifies "editing vectors" in the latent space that can be applied to other images in real-time. Experimental results show that EditGAN allows for unprecedented level of detail and freedom in image manipulation while maintaining image quality. It can also combine multiple edits and perform plausible edits beyond its training data. EditGAN outperforms previous editing methods on standard benchmarks and is scalable for editing tasks.
