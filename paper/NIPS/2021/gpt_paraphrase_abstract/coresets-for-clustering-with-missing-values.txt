We present a novel method for creating coresets for clustering points in Rd with multiple missing values. Previous techniques only allowed for one missing coordinate. The challenge lies in the fact that clustering objective functions, such as k-MEANS, can only be evaluated on the available coordinates, which vary across points. Our coreset approximates the clustering objective for every possible center set and has a size of O(min(j,k))((cid:15)-1d log n)2, where n is the number of data points, d is the dimension, and j is the maximum number of missing coordinates per data point. We have also developed an efficient algorithm for constructing these coresets in near-linear time, improving upon a recent quadratic-time PTAS for k-MEANS with missing values. Our coreset construction method, based on importance sampling, is easy to implement and has been validated on various real datasets. It offers a flexible tradeoff between coreset size and accuracy, outperforming the uniform-sampling baseline. Additionally, it significantly speeds up a Lloyd's-style heuristic for k-MEANS with missing values.
