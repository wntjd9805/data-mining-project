The joint probabilities of potential outcomes are essential for causal inference. Identifying these probabilities allows us to determine causal risk, but the reverse is not true. Additionally, these probabilities help us assess concepts like necessity and sufficiency in successful explanations. However, identifying joint probabilities requires certain assumptions, such as monotonicity, independence between potential outcomes, gain equality, and specific functional relationships. This paper proposes two new identification conditions that do not rely on these assumptions. It also introduces a statistical estimation method based on the augmented Lagrangian method to solve the estimation problem of joint probabilities. The proposed method is shown to be asymptotically normal. The proofs, details on the estimation method, numerical experiments, and a case study are provided in the supplementary material.
