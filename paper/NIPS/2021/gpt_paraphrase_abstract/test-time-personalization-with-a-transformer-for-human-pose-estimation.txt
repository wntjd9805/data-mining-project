We present a method to customize a 2D human pose estimator for test images without manual annotations. Although there have been advancements in human pose estimation, it remains difficult for models to generalize to new environments and individuals. Instead of using a fixed model for all test cases, we adapt our pose estimator during testing to utilize individual-specific information. By training our model on diverse data with supervised and self-supervised pose estimation objectives, we establish a transformation between self-supervised and supervised keypoints using a Transformer model. During testing, we fine-tune and personalize our model using the self-supervised objective, and improve the pose estimation by transforming the updated self-supervised keypoints. Through experiments on various datasets, we demonstrate significant improvements in pose estimation with our self-supervised personalization.
