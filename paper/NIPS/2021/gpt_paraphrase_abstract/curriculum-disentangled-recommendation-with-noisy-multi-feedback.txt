Learning disentangled representations from multi-feedback data is crucial for improving the accuracy and explainability of recommendation algorithms. However, this is a challenging task due to the complexity and noise present in the multi-feedback data. Existing recommendation models only focus on positive feedback and fail to address these challenges. To overcome this, we propose the Curriculum Disentangled Recommendation (CDR) model, which efficiently learns disentangled representations from complex and noisy multi-feedback. Our model incorporates a co-filtering dynamic routing mechanism to capture complex relations among different feedback types and user intentions, while also denoising the representations at the feature level. Additionally, we introduce an adjustable self-evaluating curriculum to assess sample difficulties and conduct denoising at the label level by disregarding useless information. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our CDR model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy.
