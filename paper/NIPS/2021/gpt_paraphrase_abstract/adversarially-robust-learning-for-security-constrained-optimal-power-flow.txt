The ML community has shown growing interest in adversarially robust learning and implicit layers, but their connection has been rarely explored. This study combines these two areas to address the issue of N-k security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) in electrical grids. N-k SCOPF is crucial for scheduling power generation to withstand k simultaneous equipment outages. Inspired by adversarially robust training methods, we approach N-k SCOPF as a minimax optimization problem, treating power generation settings as adjustable parameters and equipment outages as attacks. We utilize gradient-based techniques to solve this problem and differentiate the loss function through the implicit function theorem. Our framework effectively solves N-3 SCOPF, which was previously considered computationally expensive due to its dependence on the number of potential outages.
