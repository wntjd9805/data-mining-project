This paper presents a novel method, called HOLOPROT, for constructing a multi-scale graph of proteins that connects their surface, structure, and sequence. The graph encoder learns a multi-scale representation by integrating the encoding from lower levels with the graph at each level. The learned representation is tested on ligand binding affinity and protein function prediction tasks, outperforming previous methods on most dataset splits for regression and achieving comparable performance to top-performing models for classification while using significantly fewer parameters. To improve memory efficiency, the protein surface is segmented into molecular superpixels, which can be substituted with little to no performance loss.
