Precisely annotating objects with multiple labels is expensive and a major obstacle in real-world multi-label classification tasks. However, determining the relative order of label pairs is less time-consuming than collecting exact labels. Although the supervised information of pairwise relevance ordering is not as informative as exact labels, effectively learning with this weak supervision is a significant challenge. This paper introduces a new learning framework called multi-label learning with pairwise relevance ordering (PRO) to address this problem. The paper demonstrates that the unbiased estimator of classification risk can be derived from PRO examples using a cost-sensitive loss. The paper also provides an estimation error bound for the proposed estimator and proves its consistency with the commonly used ranking loss. Empirical studies on various datasets and metrics confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.
