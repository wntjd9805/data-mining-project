We present a new framework for predicting the 3D motion trajectories of multiple individuals. Our approach considers the influence of other people on an individual's actions and behaviors. Instead of predicting each person's trajectory independently, we propose a Multi-Range Transformers model that consists of a local-range encoder for individual motion and a global-range encoder for social interactions. The Transformer decoder predicts the trajectory for each person by attending to both local and global-range features. Our model outperforms existing methods in long-term 3D motion prediction and produces diverse social interactions. Notably, our model can even predict the motion of 15 individuals simultaneously by automatically grouping them into different interaction groups.
