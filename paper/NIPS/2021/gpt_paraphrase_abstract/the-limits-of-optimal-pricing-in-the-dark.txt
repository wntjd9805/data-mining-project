In the digital market, a common challenge is how a seller can learn the best pricing decisions based on a buyer's past purchases. However, buyers have incentives to manipulate their responses to benefit themselves. To understand the extent of a seller's learning in this situation, we examine a strategy where the buyer commits to imitating a different value function before the pricing game begins. We determine the optimal imitative value function for the buyer and analyze the resulting revenue and surplus for both the buyer and seller. Our findings provide insights into equilibrium outcomes, such as sellers with concave production costs earning minimal revenue while those with convex costs earning revenue proportional to the Bregman divergence of their cost function. Additionally, we show that more powerful pricing schemes may not necessarily increase the seller's revenue and could be detrimental. These results offer guidance for buyers to manipulate learning algorithms and highlight the limitations of sellers when pricing without complete information.
