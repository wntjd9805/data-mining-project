We propose a 3D generative model for structure-based drug design, aiming to generate molecules that bind to specific protein binding sites. Existing methods in deep generative models for drug design are limited by the lack of spatial information, hindering their application in structure-based design tasks. Our model addresses this limitation by estimating the probability density of atoms' occurrences in 3D space given a designated binding site. We introduce an auto-regressive sampling scheme to sequentially sample atoms from the learned distribution until no more atoms can be added. This approach allows our model to generate diverse and valid 3D molecules, applicable to various structure-based molecular design tasks. Experimental results show that molecules generated by our model exhibit high binding affinity to specific targets and favorable drug properties, even without explicit optimization for these properties.
