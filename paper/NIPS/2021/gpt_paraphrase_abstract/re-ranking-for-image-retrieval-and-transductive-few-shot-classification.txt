Current approaches in image retrieval and few-shot classification focus on improving feature representation. However, it is also effective to address the distance or similarity measure between images. In this study, we explore the concept of re-ranking the top-k retrieved images in image retrieval and extend it to transductive few-shot learning. We propose a meta-learning method to update the re-ranking process, aiming to converge the similarity graph to the target graph defined by image labels. Our re-ranking module takes an initial similarity graph, generated by a pre-trained feature extractor, and predicts an enhanced similarity graph by leveraging the relationships among the involved images. We demonstrate that our re-ranking approach can be used with unseen images and can enhance existing methods in image retrieval and few-shot learning. Our approach can be used independently or in combination with traditional re-ranking methods, leading to consistent improvements on various benchmarks for image retrieval and transductive few-shot classification.
