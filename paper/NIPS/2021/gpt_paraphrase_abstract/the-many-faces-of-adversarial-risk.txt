The abstract discusses the concept of adversarial risk in classifying data that has been intentionally perturbed. It highlights the existence of multiple definitions of adversarial risk in the literature, some of which lack mathematical rigor and vary in subtle ways. The paper aims to revisit and rigorously define these concepts while examining their similarities and differences. The authors employ tools from optimal transport, robust statistics, functional analysis, and game theory. Their contributions include generalizing Strassen's theorem to the unbalanced optimal transport context, demonstrating the equivalence between adversarial robustness and robust hypothesis testing using ∞-Wasserstein uncertainty sets, proving the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium in the game between the adversary and the algorithm, and characterizing adversarial risk through the minimum Bayes error between distributions from the ∞-Wasserstein uncertainty sets. These results expand and deepen the connections between optimal transport and adversarial robustness and also establish new connections to Choquet capacities and game theory.
