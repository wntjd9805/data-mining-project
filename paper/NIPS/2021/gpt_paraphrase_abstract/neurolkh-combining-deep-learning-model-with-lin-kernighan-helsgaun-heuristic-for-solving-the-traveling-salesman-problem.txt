We introduce NeuroLKH, a new algorithm that merges deep learning with the traditional heuristic Lin-Kernighan-Helsgaun (LKH) to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem. The algorithm utilizes a Sparse Graph Network (SGN) trained with supervised and unsupervised learning to improve LKH's performance. By using the SGN's output, NeuroLKH generates an edge candidate set and transforms edge distances to guide LKH's search process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NeuroLKH outperforms LKH and performs well on larger problem sizes. Additionally, NeuroLKH can be applied to other routing problems like Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), Pickup and Delivery Problem (PDP), and CVRP with Time Windows (CVRPTW).
