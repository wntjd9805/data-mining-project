We investigate a type of classification problems, such as the bank loan problem, where a lender determines whether to grant a loan or not. The lender's decision-making is based on limited information, as they only observe loan repayment if the loan is actually issued. This creates a situation where the lender's algorithm can become trapped in a self-fulfilling model, resulting in never correcting false negatives and accumulating infinite regret. This issue can be resolved in linear models by incorporating optimism into the predictions, but there are limited methods available for deep neural networks in function approximation cases. To address this, we introduce Pseudo-Label Optimism (PLOT), a simple approach that can be applied to DNNs. PLOT involves adding an optimistic label to the subset of decision points, training the model on all available data (including these points with their optimistic labels), and then using the resulting optimistic model for decision making. PLOT delivers competitive performance on three challenging benchmark problems with minimal hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we demonstrate that PLOT guarantees a logarithmic regret when certain conditions are met.
