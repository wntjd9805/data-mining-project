We often encounter uncertainty in real-world decision-making systems, which can be resolved through observational data. This leads to combinatorial optimization problems where the objective function is unknown and needs to be determined using empirical evidence. Instead of relying on a learning-and-optimization strategy, we propose a regression approach that aims to infer high-quality optimization solutions from input-solution pairs without needing to learn the objective function. Our main contribution is a universal solver capable of handling abstract stochastic combinatorial optimization problems. We present a learning-error analysis using a new margin-based analysis under the PAC-Bayesian framework to establish the foundations of our approach. Through empirical studies, we validate our design using proof-of-concept experiments and compare it with other potentially applicable methods. Overall, our experiments demonstrate highly encouraging results for various classic combinatorial problems on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
