Logistic bandits, which are commonly used in problems with binary rewards, have been extensively studied. However, existing works have not addressed practical situations where the number of possible outcomes is greater than two. This paper focuses on this extension and introduces the use of multinomial logit (MNL) to model the probability of each outcome. The goal is to maximize expected revenue, and the paper presents MNL-UCB, an upper confidence bound (UCB)-based algorithm, that achieves low regret. Theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations.
