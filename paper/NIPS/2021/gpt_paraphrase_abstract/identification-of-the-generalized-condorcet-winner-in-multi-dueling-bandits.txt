This paper focuses on the challenge of identifying the best arm in multi-armed bandits while minimizing the sample complexity. In the multi-dueling variant, where feedback is given as a winning arm from a set of chosen ones, the generalized Condorcet winner (GCW) is considered the best arm. The GCW is defined as the arm with the highest probability of being the winner in every subset containing it. The authors derive lower bounds on the sample complexity for identifying the GCW, providing new insights for the case of dueling bandits. They propose the Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz tournament (DKWT) algorithm, which is proven to be almost optimal. Through numerical study, the authors demonstrate that DKWT outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms, even in the case of dueling bandits or when assuming a Plackett-Luce feedback mechanism.
