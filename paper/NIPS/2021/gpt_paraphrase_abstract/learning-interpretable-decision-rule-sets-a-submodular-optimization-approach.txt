This paper explores the use of submodular optimization techniques for learning rule sets, which are logical models used for decision-making. The objective is to select a subset of rules that form an accurate and interpretable rule set. To address the challenge of dealing with a large number of possible rules, the problem is framed as a subset selection task. A submodular objective function is employed, which allows for the use of submodular optimization techniques. To further simplify the problem, the search for a rule is transformed into another subset selection task that focuses on selecting a subset of features. The proposed approach is shown to be simple and scalable, with potential for further improvement through research on submodular optimization. Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the method.
