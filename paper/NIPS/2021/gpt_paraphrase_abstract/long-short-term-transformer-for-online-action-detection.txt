We introduce LSTR, a temporal modeling algorithm called Long Short-term TRansformer, for online action detection. LSTR utilizes both long- and short-term memory mechanisms to effectively model extended sequence data. It consists of an encoder that incorporates coarse-scale historical information from a large temporal window (e.g., up to 8 minutes) and a decoder that focuses on a short time window (e.g., 8 seconds) to capture fine-scale characteristics. Our approach requires fewer heuristics compared to previous methods and has been validated through extensive empirical analysis. LSTR outperforms existing techniques on three widely-used online action detection benchmarks: THUMOSâ€™14, TVSeries, and HACS Segment. The code for LSTR is available at: https://xumingze0308.github.io/projects/lstr.
