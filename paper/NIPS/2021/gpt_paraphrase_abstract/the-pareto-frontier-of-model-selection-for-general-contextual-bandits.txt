Recent advancements in model selection have prompted inquiries into the limitations of these techniques. One specific area of interest is the selection of models for general contextual bandits with nested policy classes, which has become a prominent open problem in COLT2020. The problem revolves around determining if it is feasible to simultaneously achieve optimal guarantees for a single algorithm across all policies within a nested sequence of policy classes, or if there exists a trade-off between complexity and performance. Regrettably, our findings indicate that achieving the desired results is unattainable in the purely stochastic regime. We present a Pareto frontier that matches upper and lower bounds up to logarithmic factors, demonstrating that an increase in the complexity term, independent of T, is unavoidable for general policy classes. Additionally, we address a COLT2016 open problem related to second-order bounds in full-information games.
