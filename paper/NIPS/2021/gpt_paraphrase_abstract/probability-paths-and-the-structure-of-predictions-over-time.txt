We present a Bayesian framework called the Gaussian latent information martingale (GLIM) for modeling dynamic predictions over time. This framework is applicable to various fields such as weather forecasts, political prognostications, and financial projections. GLIM captures the evolving nature of probability estimates by considering a collection of probability paths. It incorporates a latent process of information flow inferred from historical data to update predictions over time. Unlike general time series analysis methods, GLIM preserves important properties of probability paths and accurately quantifies future uncertainties. We demonstrate the superiority of GLIM over three popular baseline methods through three different metrics. By revealing the dynamic structure of predictions, our framework aims to assist decision-makers in making more informed choices.
