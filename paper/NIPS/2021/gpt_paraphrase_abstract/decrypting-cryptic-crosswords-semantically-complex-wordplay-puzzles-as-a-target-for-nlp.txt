Cryptic crosswords, a popular type of crossword puzzle in the UK, present a unique opportunity for advancing natural language processing (NLP) systems that can understand complex and compositional language. These puzzles consist of clues that appear as fluent natural language but are intentionally designed to be challenging by combining a definition with a wordplay cipher that requires character-level manipulations. Solving cryptic crosswords requires a combination of linguistic, world, and domain knowledge, and expert humans use their creative intelligence to tackle them.This paper contributes two main things. Firstly, it introduces a dataset of cryptic clues that serves as a new and difficult benchmark for NLP systems aiming to process compositional language in a more creative and human-like manner. The paper demonstrates that existing non-neural approaches and a state-of-the-art neural language model, T5, do not achieve satisfactory performance on this dataset. As a result, the second contribution of the paper is a novel curriculum approach. The proposed approach involves fine-tuning the model on related tasks, such as unscrambling words, before tackling the cryptic crossword clues. Additionally, the paper introduces a challenging data split, examines the capabilities of subword-tokenized models in handling meta-linguistic aspects, and investigates the systematicity of the model by perturbing the wordplay part of the clues. The results show that T5 exhibits behavior partially consistent with human solving strategies.Despite the improvements achieved through the curriculum approach, the best-performing model still falls short of human-level performance in generalization. This indicates that cryptic crosswords remain a challenging task for NLP systems and offer potential for future innovation.
