Recent advancements in implicit neural representations have shown significant potential in solving partial differential equations. These representations differ from traditional methods as they utilize parameterized neural networks to define mesh-free signals that are detailed, continuous, and differentiable. This study introduces a novel machine learning approach for topology optimization, which involves solving complex inverse problems with high-dimensional parameter spaces and nonlinear objective landscapes. To effectively apply neural representations in mesh-free topology optimization, we employ multilayer perceptrons to parameterize both density and displacement fields. Our experiments demonstrate that our method is highly competitive in minimizing structural compliance objectives, while also allowing for self-supervised learning of continuous solution spaces for topology optimization problems.
