We present multiple methods to determine the upper limit of the optimal value in the constrained most probable explanation (CMPE) problem. This problem involves finding the best assignment of values to discrete random variables based on two probabilistic graphical models, while ensuring that the probability of the assignment is maximized according to one model and bounded by a given number for the other model. Previous research has demonstrated that CMPE is a versatile problem with various applications and special cases. However, it is challenging to solve due to its complexity and dense global constraint. Our approach involves simplifying the problem through Lagrange relaxation and decomposition, which leads to either a knapsack problem or the unconstrained most probable explanation (MPE) problem. We solve these problems using specialized knapsack algorithms and mini-buckets based upper bounding schemes. We assess the effectiveness of our proposed scheme by evaluating the quality of the bounds and the computation time required on different benchmark graphical models. Additionally, we demonstrate how it can be used to find heuristic, nearly optimal feasible solutions in a practical scenario involving robust estimation and adversarial attacks on classifiers.
