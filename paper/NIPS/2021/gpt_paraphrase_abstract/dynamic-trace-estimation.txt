We investigate the problem of estimating the trace of a dynamically changing matrix using as few matrix-vector multiplications as possible. We propose a practical algorithm that outperforms the standard solution of employing Hutchinson's stochastic trace estimator. Our algorithm achieves a quadratic improvement in complexity in a natural setting. We also present an enhanced algorithm, assuming slightly stronger assumptions on the dynamic matrix. Empirical results demonstrate the computational advantages of our approach in various machine learning and network science applications, including tracking spectral density moments, triangle counting, and estimating connectivity in a changing graph.
