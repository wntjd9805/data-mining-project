The Probabilistic Watershed is a semi-supervised learning algorithm for undirected graphs that calculates the probability of sampling a forest connecting a labeled node with each considered node. We introduce the Directed Probabilistic Watershed, an extension for directed graphs. By utilizing the Matrix Tree Theorem, we define a probability distribution over all incoming directed forests rooted at the labeled nodes. This is equivalent to the Directed Random Walker in the undirected case. In the limit of infinitely low temperature, the labeling of the Directed Probabilistic Watershed matches the labeling induced by the incoming directed forest with minimum cost. We also compare the performance of our method with other semi-supervised segmentation methods for directed graphs.
