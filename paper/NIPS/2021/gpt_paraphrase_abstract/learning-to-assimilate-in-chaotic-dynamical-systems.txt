Simulation-based forecasting in chaotic systems relies heavily on accurate estimates of the system state at the start of the forecast. Data assimilation methods combine noisy observations and numerical models to infer these initial conditions and improve estimation accuracy. In this study, we propose a framework called amortized assimilation, which learns to assimilate in dynamical systems using sequences of noisy observations without relying on ground truth data. By applying self-supervised denoising techniques and differentiable simulation, we extend the framework to the dynamical systems setting. Experimental results on various benchmark systems demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our approach compared to commonly used data assimilation methods.
