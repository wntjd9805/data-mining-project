We study the use of streaming-based active learning for binary classification when facing unknown adversarial label corruptions. In this scenario, the adversary has the power to corrupt the labels before the learner observes a sample. We find that in a situation where the corruption is not severe (including cases where there is mis-specification), the classical RobustCAL framework can achieve similar label complexity guarantees as in a non-corrupted setting by slightly adjusting the hypothesis elimination threshold. However, this algorithm may fail in more general corruption settings. To address this limitation, we propose a new algorithm that is proven to be correct without assuming the presence of corruptions. This algorithm achieves the minimax label complexity in non-corrupted settings (as achieved by RobustCAL) and requires only a relatively small number of additional labels in the corrupted setting to achieve the target accuracy. The additional labels required depend on the total number of corruptions and the total number of unlabeled samples.
