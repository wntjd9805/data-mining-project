We propose a new approach called DiscoGraph to improve the trade-off between performance and bandwidth in multi-agent perception. DiscoGraph is a collaboration graph that models trainable, pose-aware, and adaptive collaboration among agents. Our approach has two main innovations. Firstly, we use a teacher-student framework to train DiscoGraph using knowledge distillation. The teacher model collaborates early on with holistic-view inputs, while the student model collaborates at an intermediate stage with single-view inputs. We train DiscoGraph by ensuring that the post-collaboration feature maps in the student model match those in the teacher model. Secondly, we introduce a matrix-valued edge weight in DiscoGraph, where each element represents the inter-agent attention at a specific spatial region. This allows agents to highlight informative regions adaptively. During inference, we only use the student model, called DiscoNet. Thanks to the teacher-student framework, multiple agents using DiscoNet can approach the performance of a hypothetical teacher model with a holistic view. We validate our approach on a large-scale multi-agent perception dataset and show that DiscoNet achieves a better performance-bandwidth trade-off and provides a more straightforward design rationale compared to existing collaborative perception methods. Our code is available on GitHub.
