A structural equation model (SEM) is a useful tool for understanding causal relationships represented by a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Recent advancements have made it possible to estimate DAGs accurately from observational data using maximum-likelihood point estimation. However, in practical scenarios where the true DAG is non-identifiable or the dataset is limited, a single point estimate may not capture the uncertainty in inferring the underlying graph. To address this, we propose Bayesian Causal Discovery Nets (BCD Nets), a variational inference framework that estimates a distribution over DAGs for a linear-Gaussian SEM. Developing a full Bayesian posterior over DAGs is challenging due to the discrete and combinatorial nature of graphs. We tackle this challenge by exploring key design choices for scalable variational inference, including an expressive variational family for parametrizing DAGs, a continuous relaxation technique for efficient stochastic optimization, and suitable priors for latent variables. Our experiments on real and synthetic data demonstrate that BCD Nets outperform maximum-likelihood methods in low data regimes, as measured by standard causal discovery metrics like structural Hamming distance.
