Neural networks have been successful in various applications, but their decision-making processes are often difficult to understand. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning model called VOTEN that aims to explain the decision-making processes of neural networks. Instead of relying on complex combinations of features, VOTEN uses a hierarchical voting strategy to model expressive single-valued voting functions between latent concepts, resulting in a highly effective model. We analyze the components of VOTEN and compare it to the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), the basic structure of deep neural networks, showing the advantages of VOTEN. We also develop efficient algorithms to make the decision processes of VOTEN explicit, improving its usability. Experimental results on real-world datasets confirm the performance and explainability of VOTEN.
