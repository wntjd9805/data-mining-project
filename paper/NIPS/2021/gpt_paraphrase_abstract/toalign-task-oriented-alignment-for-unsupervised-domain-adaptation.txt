Unsupervised domain adaptive classification aims to improve classification performance on unlabeled target domains. Many existing approaches address the issue of domain shift by aligning the source and target domains in the feature space. However, these approaches often align features as a whole without considering the explicit alignment of domains to serve the classification task effectively. This often leads to suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose an effective method called Task-oriented Alignment (ToAlign) for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA). We explore which features should be aligned across domains and suggest proactively aligning domains to serve the classification task by decomposing and aligning features based on prior knowledge obtained from the classification task itself. Specifically, we decompose a feature in the source domain into a task-related/discriminative feature that should be aligned and a task-irrelevant feature that should be ignored. We base this decomposition on classification meta-knowledge. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks, such as Offce-Home, Visda-2017, and DomainNet, demonstrate the effectiveness of ToAlign in achieving state-of-the-art performance. The code for ToAlign is publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/UDA.
