This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the convergence rates of plug-in estimators for optimal transport maps between two probability distributions. The estimators are defined using barycentric projections and are commonly used in computational optimal transport. The main contribution of this research is a new stability estimate for barycentric projections, which allows for the analysis of general plug-in estimators with minimal smoothness assumptions. The stability estimate is applied to discrete-discrete and semi-discrete estimators, as well as kernel smoothed and wavelet based estimators, to demonstrate improved convergence rates and reduced curse of dimensionality. The analysis also extends to plug-in estimators of the Wasserstein distance between the probability distributions, complementing recent findings. Additionally, the results are applicable to obtaining convergence rates for Wasserstein barycenter and asymptotic detection thresholds for optimal-transport based tests of independence.
