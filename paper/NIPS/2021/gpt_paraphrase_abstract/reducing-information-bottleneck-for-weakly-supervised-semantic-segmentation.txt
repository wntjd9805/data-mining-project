Weakly supervised semantic segmentation is a technique that uses class labels to identify and localize objects in an image. However, classifiers trained on such labels tend to focus only on a small discriminative region of the target object. We explain this phenomenon using the information bottleneck principle, which suggests that the final layer of a deep neural network, activated by the sigmoid or softmax activation functions, restricts the flow of information, resulting in only a subset of relevant information being passed on to the output.  To support this argument, we conduct a simulated experiment and find that removing the last activation function helps reduce the information bottleneck. Additionally, we propose a new pooling method that encourages the transmission of information from non-discriminative regions to improve classification. Our experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets show that this simple modification significantly enhances the quality of localization maps, surpassing the current state-of-the-art performance in weakly supervised semantic segmentation.
