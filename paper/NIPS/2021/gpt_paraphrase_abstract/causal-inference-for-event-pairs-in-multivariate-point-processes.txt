The abstract discusses the study of causal inference and discovery from observational data, which has primarily focused on independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data. The paper introduces a formalization for causal inference in multivariate recurrent event streams by extending Rubin's framework for the average treatment effect (ATE) and propensity scores to multivariate point processes. A multivariate point process represents data with asynchronous and irregularly spaced occurrences of different types of events over a common timeline. The authors provide theoretical justification for their point process causal framework and explain how to obtain unbiased estimates of the proposed measure. They also conduct experiments using synthetic and real-world event datasets, demonstrating that their causal inference framework outperforms baseline pairwise causal association scores.
