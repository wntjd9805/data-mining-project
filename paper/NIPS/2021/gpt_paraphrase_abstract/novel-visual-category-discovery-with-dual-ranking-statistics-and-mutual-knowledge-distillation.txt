This paper addresses the problem of discovering new visual categories by grouping unlabeled images from new classes into semantic partitions. Unlike traditional semi-supervised learning, we propose a two-branch learning framework that considers both local part-level information and overall characteristics. To transfer knowledge from labeled to unlabeled data, we utilize dual ranking statistics on both branches to generate pseudo labels for training. Additionally, we introduce a mutual knowledge distillation method to promote agreement between the two branches and enable the discovery of new categories using both global and local features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks for generic object classification and fine-grained visual recognition.
