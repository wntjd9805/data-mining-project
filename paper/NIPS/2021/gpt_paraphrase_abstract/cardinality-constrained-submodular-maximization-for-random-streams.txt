We address the problem of maximizing submodular functions in single-pass streaming and secretaries-with-shortlists models, with random arrival order. Agrawal, Shadravan, and Stein proposed an approximation algorithm for cardinality constrained monotone functions using linear memory. However, their algorithm has an exponential dependence on ε, making it impractical. We simplify their algorithm and analysis, resulting in a significant improvement in the ε-dependence (O(k/ε) memory). We also extend these techniques to provide a simple approximation for non-monotone functions in O(k/ε) memory. Additionally, we establish a hardness barrier for single-pass algorithms in randomly ordered streams for the monotone case. Finally, we demonstrate that our algorithms are easy to implement and perform well on real-world datasets.
