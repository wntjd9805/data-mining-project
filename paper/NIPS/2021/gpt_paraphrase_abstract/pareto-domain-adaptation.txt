Domain adaptation (DA) aims to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain with a different distribution. DA methods typically use a source classification objective and a domain alignment objective to facilitate knowledge transfer. However, the linear combination of these objectives may lead to conflicts due to domain shift, resulting in restricted solutions. In this study, we propose a Pareto Domain Adaptation (ParetoDA) approach that optimizes all training objectives cooperatively. We introduce a surrogate loss that mimics target classification to achieve desirable solutions on the target domain. Additionally, we propose a target-prediction refining mechanism that utilizes domain labels through Bayes' theorem to improve target-prediction accuracy. To guide the optimization towards the optimal solution on the target domain, we employ a dynamic preference mechanism based on the gradient of the surrogate loss on a held-out unlabeled target dataset. Theoretical analyses indicate that the held-out data can guide the optimization without overfitting. Experimental results on image classification and semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ParetoDA. Our code is available at https://github.com/BIT-DA/ParetoDA.
