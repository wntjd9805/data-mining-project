Recognizing fine-grained categories is a difficult task due to the subtle differences among subordinate categories, which requires a large amount of annotated samples. To address this data scarcity issue, we propose a method called SimTrans for weak-shot learning, which involves learning novel categories from web data with the support of a clean set of base categories. SimTrans transfers pairwise semantic similarity from the base categories to the novel categories. We train a similarity net on clean data and then use the transferred similarity to denoise the web training data using effective strategies. Additionally, we apply adversarial loss on the similarity net to improve the transferability of similarity. Our weak-shot setting and SimTrans method are validated through comprehensive experiments.
