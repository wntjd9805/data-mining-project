The abstract discusses the controversies and inconsistencies surrounding the identification of "winning tickets" in literature. The authors propose a new definition of the lottery ticket hypothesis and conduct extensive experiments to determine if winning tickets exist across different deep neural network architectures and applications. They analyze the correlations between winning tickets and various factors, such as training hyperparameters and architecture characteristics. The authors identify key factors that influence the identification of winning tickets and provide guidelines for parameter settings. Their research aims to advance the understanding of the lottery ticket hypothesis. The authors also provide a link to their publicly available code repository.
