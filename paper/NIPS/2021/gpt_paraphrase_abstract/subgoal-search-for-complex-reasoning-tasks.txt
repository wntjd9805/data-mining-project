We propose a method called Subgoal Search (kSubS) that emulates the human mental process of solving complex reasoning tasks by transitioning from one related idea to another. The key component of kSubS is a learned subgoal generator that produces achievable subgoals that bring us closer to the solution. By using subgoals, we reduce the search space and create a high-level search graph that facilitates efficient planning. Our implementation of kSubS incorporates a transformer-based subgoal module within the classical best-first search framework. Surprisingly, a simple approach of generating subgoals for multiple steps ahead proves to be highly efficient in three challenging domains: Sokoban and the Rubik's Cube puzzle games, as well as the inequality proving benchmark INT. kSubS achieves impressive results, including state-of-the-art performance on INT, while operating within reasonable computational constraints.
