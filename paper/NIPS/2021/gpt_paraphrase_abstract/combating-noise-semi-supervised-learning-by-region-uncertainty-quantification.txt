Semi-supervised learning is a technique used to improve performance by utilizing unlabeled data. While previous research has mainly focused on image classification, this paper explores semi-supervised learning for object detection, which requires more effort to collect labeled data. The current methods used in this area often struggle with noisy regions generated by pseudo labels. To address this issue, the authors propose a noise-resistant semi-supervised learning approach that quantifies the uncertainty of these regions. The authors examine the negative impact of different types of noise associated with pseudo labels and then suggest quantifying region uncertainty by identifying the properties of regions that are resistant to noise at varying strengths. By incorporating uncertainty into the training process and encouraging multi-peak probability distribution output, the proposed method achieves noise-resistant learning. Experimental results on both PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate the impressive performance of this approach.
