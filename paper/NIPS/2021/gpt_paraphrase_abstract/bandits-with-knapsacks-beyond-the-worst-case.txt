Bandits with Knapsacks (BwK) is a model for multi-armed bandits with supply constraints. Although the worst-case regret bounds for BwK are well-known, this study goes beyond worst-case scenarios. Firstly, it provides upper and lower bounds that fully characterize logarithmic, instance-dependent regret rates. Secondly, it examines "simple regret" in BwK, which measures an algorithm's performance in a particular round, and proves that it is generally small except for a few rounds. Lastly, a general "reduction" from BwK to other bandit problems is introduced, leveraging existing helpful structures, and applied to combinatorial semi-bandits, linear contextual bandits, and multinomial-logit bandits. These findings extend upon the BwK algorithm by Agrawal and Devanur [3], offering new analyses.
