We develop a novel model for predicting the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using a combination of differential equations (DEs) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. DEs offer a way to capture some of the relationships between factors relevant to AD, but not all. To account for the missing relationships, we introduce general criteria based on brain function, such as maximizing cognition and minimizing the cost of supporting cognition. By employing RL, we optimize an objective function that embodies these criteria and extract the missing relationships. Our model, which includes DEs as a simulator and a trained RL agent, successfully predicts individualized 10-year AD progression using baseline features from both synthetic and real data. In fact, our model performs as well as, if not better than, current learning-based models in predicting cognition trajectories over a 10-year period. Furthermore, our interpretable model reveals and provides insights into the "recovery/compensatory" processes that mitigate the impact of AD, despite not being explicitly programmed into the model. This framework, combining DEs and RL, can be applied not only to AD but also to other neurological disorders, making it widely applicable and valuable for understanding these conditions.
