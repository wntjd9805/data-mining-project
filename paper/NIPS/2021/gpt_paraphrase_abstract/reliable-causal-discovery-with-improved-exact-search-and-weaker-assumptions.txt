Many causal discovery methods rely on the faithfulness assumption to ensure accuracy. However, this assumption can be violated in various ways, resulting in suboptimal solutions. Although there have been attempts to weaken this assumption in Bayesian network structure learning, such methods struggle to handle large graphs. This study aims to enhance the scalability of exact score-based methods in the linear Gaussian setting. The authors introduce a super-structure estimation method based on the support of inverse covariance matrix, which requires weaker assumptions than faithfulness. This method is used to limit the search space of exact search. Additionally, a local search strategy is proposed, where exact search is performed on the clusters formed by each variable and its neighbors within two hops in the super-structure. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to handle hundreds of nodes accurately.
