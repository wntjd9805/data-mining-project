Graph embedding is a technique used in graph analysis and machine learning applications to represent graphs in a vector-space format. Many graph embedding methods rely on random walks to sample context nodes. However, random walks can introduce bias in the sampling process due to the structural characteristics of the graphs. One major source of bias is the degree of each node, where nodes with higher degrees are more likely to be sampled. The implications of such biases are not well understood, especially in the context of graph representation learning. This study explores the impact of bias in random walks on graph embedding and introduces a new method called residual2vec. This method aims to debias structural biases in graphs by utilizing random graphs. The authors demonstrate that this debiasing approach not only enhances link prediction and clustering performance but also allows for the explicit modeling of important structural properties in graph embedding.
