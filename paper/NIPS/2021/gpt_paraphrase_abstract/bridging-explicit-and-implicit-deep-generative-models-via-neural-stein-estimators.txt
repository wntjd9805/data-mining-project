Two types of deep generative models, explicit and implicit, have limitations when used individually. To overcome these limitations, we propose a joint training framework that combines an explicit density estimator and an implicit sample generator using Stein discrepancy. Our method introduces mutual regularization and stabilizes training dynamics. Empirical results show that our approach improves the accuracy of the density estimator and produces higher-quality samples compared to training a single model. Our method also performs well with contaminated or limited training samples.
