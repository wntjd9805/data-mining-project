This study examines a selection problem in which applicants apply for a limited number of positions sequentially. A decision maker uses a pre-trained supervised learning model to accept or reject applicants until all positions are filled. The paper questions the applicability of fairness notions commonly used in classification problems to this sequential selection context. It demonstrates that even with a fair pre-trained model, the selection outcomes can still exhibit bias against certain demographic groups. This finding suggests that the fairness notions employed in classification problems are unsuitable for selection problems with limited positions. To address this, a new fairness notion called "Equal Selection (ES)" is introduced, specifically tailored for sequential selection problems. Additionally, a post-processing approach is proposed to ensure compliance with the ES fairness notion. The study also considers a scenario where applicants have privacy concerns, and the decision maker only has access to noisy versions of sensitive attributes. It shows that perfect ES fairness can still be achieved under certain conditions in this privacy-concerned setting.
