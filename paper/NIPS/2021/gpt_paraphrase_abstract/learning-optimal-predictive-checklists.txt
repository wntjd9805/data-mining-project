This paper introduces a technique to develop checklists for clinical decision support. The checklists are represented as linear classifiers with binary features and unit weights, and are learned from data using an integer programming problem. The method allows customization of checklists to adhere to various constraints, such as group fairness and binarization of real-valued features during training. The approach is paired with techniques to accelerate training and minimize the optimality gap. The method's performance is evaluated on seven clinical classification problems and is demonstrated by training a concise checklist for PTSD screening. The results indicate that the approach can generate effective checklists that can be easily tailored to meet specific constraints.
