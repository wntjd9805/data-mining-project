Matrix trace estimation is a common task in machine learning and has traditionally been done using Hutchinson's method. However, this method requires a large number of matrix-vector product queries to get an accurate approximation. Recently, a new algorithm called Hutch++ was proposed, which reduces the number of queries needed and has a constant probability of success. However, in certain scenarios, Hutch++ has a higher query complexity. Non-adaptive methods, which are important for sketching algorithms, offer advantages such as parallelization and low-memory streaming. In this study, we bridge the gap between adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms, showing that non-adaptive algorithms can achieve a better query complexity. We also prove that no further improvement is possible by any non-adaptive algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate that our sketch outperforms both Hutch++ and Hutchinson's method.
