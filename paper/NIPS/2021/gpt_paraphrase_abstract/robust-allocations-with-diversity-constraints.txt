We examine the problem of allocating divisible items among multiple agents, particularly in situations where agents can impose diversity constraints on the items they receive. This is relevant in scenarios where the items represent user ad slots or task workers with attributes like race and gender, and the goal is to achieve demographic parity. Our focus is on determining whether the introduction of diversity constraints by one agent significantly impacts the allocation of other agents. If it does, the agents who do not benefit from diversity bear a disproportionate cost. We establish two criteria for robustness: no negative externality (other agents are not harmed) and monotonicity (the agent enforcing the constraint does not experience a significant increase in value). We prove that the Nash Welfare rule, which maximizes the product of agent values, is uniquely robust when diversity constraints are present, while most other allocation rules fail. We also demonstrate that the guarantees provided by Nash Welfare are nearly optimal within a widely studied class of allocation rules. Finally, we conduct a simulation using real-world data on ad allocations to confirm that the gap between Nash Welfare and other rules persists in practical settings.
