Dental forensic identification is a crucial task in criminal investigations and mass disasters. Despite the prevalence of dental imaging, there is currently no widely accepted automated solution for this labor-intensive process. This study introduces a pioneering approach using deep learning and panoramic radiographs for dental forensic identification. A comprehensive benchmark is constructed to accurately reflect the challenges of the task. The proposed method, called FoID, incorporates clinical-inspired attention localization, domain-specific augmentations for instance discriminative learning, and a transformer-based self-attention mechanism to determine the relative importance of attentions. Results show that FoID outperforms traditional approaches by at least 22.98% in Rank-1 accuracy and outperforms strong CNN baselines by at least 10.50% in mean Average Precision. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component of FoID. This work represents a first step towards developing an automated system for forensic identification in large-scale multi-site databases. Additionally, the techniques proposed in this study, such as the self-attention mechanism, may have significance for other identification tasks such as pedestrian re-identification.
