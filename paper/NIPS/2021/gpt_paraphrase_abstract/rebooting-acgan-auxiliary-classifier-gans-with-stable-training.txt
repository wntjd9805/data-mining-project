The abstract discusses the challenges of training the auxiliary classifier generative adversarial network (ACGAN) due to the increasing number of classes in the dataset and the lack of diversity in the generated samples. The paper proposes two solutions for these issues. Firstly, they address the problem of gradient exploding in the classifier during early training by projecting input vectors onto a unit hypersphere. Secondly, they introduce the Data-to-Data Cross-Entropy loss (D2D-CE) to utilize relational information in the class-labeled dataset. Based on these solutions, they present the Rebooted Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (ReACGAN). The experimental results demonstrate that ReACGAN achieves superior generation results on various datasets. The paper also highlights the benefits of differentiable augmentations and the compatibility of D2D-CE with the StyleGAN2 architecture. The model weights and software package for implementing cGANs and reproducing the experiments are available at a specified GitHub repository.
