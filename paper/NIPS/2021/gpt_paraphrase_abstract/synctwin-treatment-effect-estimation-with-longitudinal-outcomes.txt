Many medical studies use electronic health records (EHR) to estimate the effects of treatments on patients. However, existing methods often overlook the temporal structure of outcomes, focusing solely on adjusting for patient covariates. To address this issue, this paper introduces a new method called SyncTwin. SyncTwin learns a patient-specific representation from pre-treatment observations and uses it to predict counterfactual outcomes for a target patient. By comparing observed and synthetic pre-treatment outcomes, the reliability of the estimated treatment effect can be assessed. Medical experts can interpret the estimate by examining the individuals that contribute most to the synthetic twin. In a real-data experiment, SyncTwin accurately reproduced the findings of a randomized controlled clinical trial using observational data, demonstrating its usefulness in real-world EHR analysis.
