Identifying an effective model of a dynamical system from sensory data and using it for future state prediction and control is challenging. Recent data-driven algorithms based on Koopman theory show promise in addressing this problem, but they typically do not update the model once it has been identified from a small set of observations. This limitation hinders long-term prediction and control for realistic systems, such as robotics or fluid mechanics. This paper presents a new method for learning a linear dynamics embedding of the state space from sensory data. Unlike previous approaches, the proposed method allows for online updates of the dynamics model, enabling its application to systems with nonlinear dynamics in the original configuration space. Empirical evaluations on various classical dynamical systems and sensory modalities demonstrate the approach's strong performance in long-term prediction and control.
