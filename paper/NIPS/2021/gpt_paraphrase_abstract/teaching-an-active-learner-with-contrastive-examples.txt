This study focuses on the problem of active learning, where a learner is assisted by a helpful teacher. The interaction protocol involves the learner proposing a query for the label of an instance, and the teacher providing the label along with explanatory information in the form of a contrastive example. The goal is to design a teaching algorithm that can provide an informative sequence of contrastive examples to accelerate the learning process. The algorithm's choices depend on the history of interactions, making it a challenging sequence optimization problem. The study presents an efficient teaching algorithm that adaptively selects contrastive examples and provides strong performance guarantees based on problem-dependent parameters. It also demonstrates that the proposed teaching algorithm has strong approximation guarantees for specific types of active learners. The effectiveness of the teaching framework is illustrated through numerical case studies.
