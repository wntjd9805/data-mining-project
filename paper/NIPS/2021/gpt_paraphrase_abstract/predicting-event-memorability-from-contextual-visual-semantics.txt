The challenge of predicting how well an event will be remembered is important for both memory research and artificial intelligence. This study investigates the factors that influence event memorability, including the event context and visual attributes of image cues. The researchers conducted a large-scale experiment with older participants over a period of three months, testing their memory of life events using a cued recall process. They created a unique dataset called R3, which contains detailed information about event context and visual features. Additionally, they developed a contextual event memory network (CEMNet) that uses multi-modal input to predict event memorability, surpassing other benchmarks. These findings contribute to a better understanding of episodic event memory and offer a new approach for predicting human episodic memory. The source code for the study is available on GitHub.
