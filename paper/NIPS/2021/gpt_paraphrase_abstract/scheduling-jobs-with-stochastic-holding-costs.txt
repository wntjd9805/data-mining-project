This paper presents a learning and scheduling algorithm that aims to minimize the expected cumulative holding cost of jobs, even when the statistical parameters determining their individual holding costs are unknown. The algorithm operates by processing jobs in each time slot and observing the realized random holding costs of the remaining jobs. It is a modified version of the cÂµ rule for scheduling, starting with a learning phase and transitioning to nonpreemptive scheduling once enough data about individual jobs is gathered. The algorithm is designed to handle instances with varying job parameters and achieves performance guarantees close to optimal. The algorithm's performance is measured by its regret, which compares it to the minimum cost achievable when the statistical parameters are fully known. Upper bounds on the regret are proven, along with a nearly matching lower bound. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the algorithm and validate the tightness of the theoretical regret analysis.
