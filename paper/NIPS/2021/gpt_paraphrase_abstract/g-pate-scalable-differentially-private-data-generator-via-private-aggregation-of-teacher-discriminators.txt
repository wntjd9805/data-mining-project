We present G-PATE, a novel privacy-preserving data generative model based on the PATE framework. Our approach combines generative adversarial nets and private aggregation to ensure strong privacy guarantees while maintaining high generated data utility. Compared to existing methods, G-PATE improves privacy budget utilization by training a student data generator with an ensemble of teacher discriminators and employing a private gradient aggregation mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of G-PATE through theoretical proofs and extensive experiments, showing its ability to generate high-dimensional image data with high data utility under limited privacy budgets.
