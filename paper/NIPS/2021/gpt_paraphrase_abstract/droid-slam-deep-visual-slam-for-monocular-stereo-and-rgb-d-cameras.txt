Introducing DROID-SLAM, a novel SLAM system that utilizes deep learning. DROID-SLAM incorporates repetitive updates of camera pose and pixelwise depth using a Dense Bundle Adjustment layer. This system demonstrates high accuracy, surpassing previous methods, and exhibits robustness by experiencing significantly fewer catastrophic failures. Despite being trained on monocular video, DROID-SLAM can utilize stereo or RGB-D video during testing to enhance its performance. Our open source code for DROID-SLAM is available at https://github.com/princeton-vl/DROID-SLAM.
