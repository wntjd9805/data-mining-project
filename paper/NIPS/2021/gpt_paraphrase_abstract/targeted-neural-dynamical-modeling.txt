Latent dynamics models have become valuable tools for analyzing neural population activity. Incorporating simultaneously measured behavior into these models has been a recent focus to better understand the sources of neural variability. However, current approaches have limitations in capturing the underlying neural dynamics and linking them to observed behavior. To address this, we propose Targeted Neural Dynamical Modeling (TNDM), a nonlinear state-space model that jointly considers neural activity and external behavioral variables. TNDM separates neural dynamics into relevant and irrelevant components, using the relevant dynamics to reconstruct behavior and both sets of dynamics to reconstruct neural activity without time lag. We implement TNDM as a sequential variational autoencoder and evaluate its performance on simulated and real recordings from a monkey's premotor and motor cortex during a reaching task. Our results demonstrate that TNDM learns predictive low-dimensional latent dynamics while maintaining a good fit to the neural data. This work will be presented at the 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021).
