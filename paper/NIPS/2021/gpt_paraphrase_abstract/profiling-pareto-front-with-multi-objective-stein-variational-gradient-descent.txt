This study addresses the challenge of finding diverse and representative Pareto solutions in multi-objective optimization. The authors propose a novel algorithm that utilizes Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) to profile the Pareto front. They also present a counterpart using Langevin dynamics. Both methods update a set of points in parallel, pushing them towards the Pareto front through multiple gradient descent iterations. The algorithms promote diversity among the particles using repulsive forces in SVGD or diffusion noise in Langevin dynamics. Unlike existing gradient-based methods that rely on predefined preference functions, the proposed approach is effective in high-dimensional problems and yields evenly distributed, diverse solutions on the Pareto front. The convergence to the Pareto front is theoretically guaranteed. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the SVGD algorithm over existing gradient-based algorithms.
