The lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH) is a framework that suggests using a sparse subnetwork instead of a full deep learning model to reduce training and inference costs without sacrificing performance. However, finding the sparse mask of the winning ticket is costly and makes it valuable, necessitating copyright protection. We propose a method to verify the ownership of the winning ticket by leveraging sparse topological information and developing graph-based signatures. Our method can work in both white-box and black-box verification scenarios and has been demonstrated to be effective in diverse models on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/VITA-Group/NO-stealing-LTH.
