We assess the resilience of a trained network to uncertainties in input using a stochastic simulation inspired by Statistical Reliability Engineering. Our approach involves conducting a statistical hypothesis test to determine if the network is locally robust, based on the estimated probability of failure being below a critical threshold. We employ Importance Splitting simulation to generate samples of rare events and provide theoretical guarantees that are not reliant on sample size. Our experiments on large-scale networks demonstrate the efficiency of our method, requiring only a small number of network function calls.
