This paper explores the concept of compositional communication, which involves representing complex signals as combinations of simpler subparts. The authors argue that in order to develop compositional communication, it is necessary to have inductive biases in both the training framework and the data. They also demonstrate that compositionality naturally emerges in signaling games, where agents communicate over a noisy channel. Through experiments, the authors confirm that varying levels of noise, dependent on the model and data, promote compositionality. They further conduct a comprehensive analysis of this relationship using compositionality metrics such as topographical similarity, conflict count, and context independence.
