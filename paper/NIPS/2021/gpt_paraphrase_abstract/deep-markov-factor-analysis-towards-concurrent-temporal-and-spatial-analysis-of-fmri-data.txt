Factor analysis methods have been widely employed in neuroimaging to convert complex imaging data into simpler and more understandable representations. However, these methods often overlook the intricate and nonlinear temporal dynamics of neural processes when analyzing the imaging data. In this study, we introduce a novel approach called deep Markov factor analysis (DMFA), which utilizes the Markov property in a chain of low dimensional temporal embeddings and incorporates spatial inductive assumptions through neural networks. This enables the capture of temporal dynamics in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and addresses their high spatial dimensionality. By incorporating a discrete latent variable, DMFA is able to cluster fMRI data in its low dimensional temporal embedding, taking into account variations in subjects and cognitive states. Consequently, DMFA allows for the validation of various neuroscientific hypotheses driven by fMRI data. Experimental results on both synthetic and real fMRI data demonstrate the efficacy of DMFA in identifying interpretable clusters and capturing nonlinear temporal dependencies in these high dimensional imaging data.
