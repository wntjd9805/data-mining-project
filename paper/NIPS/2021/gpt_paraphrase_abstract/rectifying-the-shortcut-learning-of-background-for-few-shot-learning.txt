The category gap in Few-Shot Learning (FSL) hinders its success. This study identifies image background as a useful but limited knowledge for in-class classification in FSL. A new framework called COSOC is proposed to address this issue by extracting foreground objects in images during training and evaluation without additional guidance. Extensive experiments on inductive FSL tasks validate the effectiveness of our methods.
