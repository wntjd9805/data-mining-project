This paper introduces a deep learning approach to remove defocus blur from images. It proposes a Gaussian kernel mixture (GKM) model to accurately represent spatially variant defocus blur kernels. A deep neural network called GKMNet is developed using the GKM model, utilizing a scale-recurrent attention module for estimating mixing coefficients. The experiments demonstrate that GKMNet outperforms existing methods in terms of both performance and efficiency, making it a promising solution for defocus deblurring.
