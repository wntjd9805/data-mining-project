Recent advancements in computationally efficient non-myopic Bayesian optimization have resulted in better query efficiency compared to traditional myopic methods such as expected improvement. These advancements have primarily been limited to unconstrained Bayesian optimization (BO) methods, except for a few exceptions that require heavy computation. For example, an existing multi-step lookahead constrained BO method relies on computationally expensive and unreliable brute-force derivative-free optimization of a Monte Carlo rollout acquisition function.Methods that utilize the reparameterization trick for more efficient derivative-based optimization of non-myopic acquisition functions in the unconstrained scenario, like sample average approximation and infinitesimal perturbation analysis, do not extend well to constrained problems due to the introduction of discontinuities in the sampled acquisition function surface caused by constraints. Additionally, it is argued that being non-myopic is even more crucial in constrained problems because myopic methods tend to avoid sampling the boundary between feasible and infeasible regions, thereby slowing down the discovery of optimal solutions with tight constraints.To address these issues, this paper proposes a computationally efficient two-step lookahead constrained Bayesian optimization acquisition function (2-OPT-C) that can be used in both sequential and batch settings. To enable fast optimization of the acquisition function, a novel likelihood-ratio-based unbiased estimator of the gradient of the two-step optimal acquisition function is developed, which does not rely on the reparameterization trick. Numerical experiments demonstrate that 2-OPT-C typically improves query efficiency by at least 2 times compared to previous methods, and in some cases, it can achieve improvements of 10 times or more.
