Despite the impressive performance of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in generating realistic samples, they often struggle to produce high-quality samples for less common groups. Several techniques have been developed to enhance the quality of generated samples, but they often sacrifice diversity. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method to identify and prioritize underrepresented samples during GAN training. By analyzing the statistical differences between the data distribution and the model distribution for each sample, we can identify underrepresented samples with high discrepancy or variability. We then emphasize these samples during training to promote diversity without compromising overall quality. Our experimental results show that this method significantly improves GAN performance on various datasets, particularly in generating high-quality and diverse samples for minor groups.
