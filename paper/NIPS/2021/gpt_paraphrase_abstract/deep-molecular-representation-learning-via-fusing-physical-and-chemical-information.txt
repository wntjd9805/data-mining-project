PhysChem is a new neural architecture that combines physical and chemical information to learn molecular representations. It consists of two networks, PhysNet and ChemNet, which specialize in simulating molecular dynamics and learning chemical properties respectively. These networks work together by providing expertise to each other. PhysChem has achieved impressive results on MoleculeNet, a benchmark for molecular machine learning, and has also been successful in analyzing datasets related to SARS-CoV-2.
