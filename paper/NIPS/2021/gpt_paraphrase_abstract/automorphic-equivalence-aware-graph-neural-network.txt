Existing graph neural networks (GNNs) do not effectively capture the automorphic equivalence of nodes in a graph, which is crucial in various scientific domains such as computational biology and social network analysis. In order to address this limitation, we propose a localized variant called ego-centered automorphic equivalence (Ego-AE) and introduce GRAPE, a novel GNN that incorporates learnable AE-aware aggregators to explicitly distinguish the Ego-AE of each node's neighbors using different subgraph templates. To overcome the challenge of designing subgraph templates, we employ a genetic algorithm to automatically search for them in graph data. Additionally, we provide theoretical evidence of the expressive power of GRAPE in generating distinct node representations based on different Ego-AE features, thereby filling a fundamental gap in existing GNN variants. We validate our model on eight real-world graph datasets, including social networks, e-commerce co-purchase networks, and citation networks, demonstrating consistent superior performance compared to existing GNNs. The source code for GRAPE is publicly available at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/GRAPE.
