Modeling interactions is crucial for understanding complex dynamical systems, particularly systems of objects that interact with each other in a nonlinear and time-dependent manner. Many of these systems can be represented as geometric graphs, where nodes represent objects positioned in Euclidean space according to a global coordinate system, such as vehicles in a traffic scenario. Despite the arbitrary choice of coordinate system, the dynamics of these systems remain invariant to rotations and translations, known as Galilean invariance. Neglecting these invariances can lead to poor generalization. To address this, we propose using local coordinate frames for each node-object in the geometric graph, which induces roto-translation invariance. This approach also enables the definition of anisotropic filtering in graph neural networks. We conducted experiments in various scenarios, including traffic scenes, 3D motion capture, and colliding particles, and our proposed method consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art.
