In complex systems, we often observe the emergence of complex global behavior from interactions between individual agents, who have limited information about the overall system. This phenomenon has motivated the development of artificial intelligence algorithms in areas like swarm optimization and cellular automata. Inspired by the collective behavior seen in complex cellular systems, we have created systems where each sensory input is processed by separate neural networks that have no fixed relationship with each other. Through training and communication via an attention mechanism, these sensory networks can integrate local information and produce a coherent global policy. Interestingly, these systems can still perform their tasks even if the order of inputs is randomly changed multiple times during a session. These permutation invariant systems also demonstrate robustness and generalization properties that have broad applications.
