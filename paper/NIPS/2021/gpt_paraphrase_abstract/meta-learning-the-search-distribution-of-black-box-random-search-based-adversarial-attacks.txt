Recent advancements in black-box robustness evaluation have seen adversarial attacks based on randomized search schemes achieve impressive results. However, our study reveals that the efficiency of these attacks in different query budget scenarios relies heavily on manual design and heuristic tuning of the proposal distributions. To address this issue, we propose adapting the proposal distribution online based on information gathered during the attack. We specifically focus on Square Attack, a leading score-based black-box attack, and demonstrate how its performance can be enhanced by utilizing a learned controller to adjust the proposal distribution parameters dynamically during the attack. Through gradient-based end-to-end training on a CIFAR10 model with white box access, we train the controller. Our results consistently show that incorporating the learned controller into the attack significantly improves its estimation of black-box robustness across various query regimes, with improvements of up to 20% observed for a wide range of different models with black-box access. Moreover, we validate that the learned adaptation principle successfully transfers to other data distributions such as CIFAR100 or ImageNet, as well as to the targeted attack setting.
