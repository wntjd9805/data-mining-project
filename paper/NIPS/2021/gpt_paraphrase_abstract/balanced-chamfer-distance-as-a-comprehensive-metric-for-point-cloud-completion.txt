Chamfer Distance (CD) and Earth Moverâ€™s Distance (EMD) are widely used metrics for measuring the similarity between two sets of points. However, CD does not consider differences in local density, while EMD focuses too much on global distribution and overlooks detailed structures. Moreover, their unbounded value range is heavily affected by outliers, leading to inconsistent evaluations. To address these issues, we propose a new similarity measure called Density-aware Chamfer Distance (DCD). DCD overcomes the limitations of CD and EMD by detecting density disparities, emphasizing detailed structures, and being computationally efficient. Its bounded value range ensures a more stable and reasonable evaluation. We apply DCD to evaluate point cloud completion, where it captures both overall structure and local geometric details, providing a more reliable evaluation compared to CD and EMD. DCD also outperforms CD when used as a training loss. Additionally, we introduce a point discriminator module that improves results under DCD and achieves competitive performance for CD and EMD. Our work aims to enhance point cloud similarity evaluation. The code for DCD is available at https://github.com/wutong16/Density_aware_Chamfer_Distance.
