The problem of finding the minimum feedback arc set on tournaments (MFAST) is a well-known NP-hard problem. In this study, we focus on important classes of tournaments that are commonly used in the problem of learning to rank from pairwise comparisons. These classes are derived from preference matrices that can result in cyclic preference relations. To understand the structural properties of these classes, we introduce the concept of Tournament Dimension, which quantifies the size of forbidden configurations for rank r tournament classes. We present a polynomial-time algorithm called Rank2Rank that solves the MFAST problem for the rank 2 tournament class. This algorithm relies on a geometric characterization and an explicit construction of a forbidden configuration for this class. Building on our understanding of the rank-2 tournament class, we propose a flexible pairwise preference model called the local-global model, which encompasses widely-used preference models. We develop an algorithm called BlockRank2Rank that solves the MFAST problem for the associated Block-Rank 2 tournament class. As an application, we explore the problem of learning to rank from pairwise comparisons using the local-global preference model. We propose a pairwise ranking algorithm called PairwiseBlockRank and provide sample complexity bounds for learning a good ranking. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.
