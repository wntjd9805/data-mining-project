Error correction methods have been used to improve the accuracy of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. However, existing techniques that use a sequence-to-sequence model for correction suffer from high latency and are not suitable for online ASR services. To address this issue, we propose FastCorrect, a novel non-autoregressive (NAR) error correction model based on edit alignment. FastCorrect aligns each token in an ASR output sentence with the corresponding tokens in the ground-truth sentence based on the edit distance between them. It then uses this alignment information to train a length predictor and adjust the source tokens to match the length of the target sentence for parallel generation. During inference, the predicted token number from the length predictor is used to adjust the source tokens for target sequence generation. Experimental results on the AISHELL-1 and an internal ASR dataset demonstrate that FastCorrect significantly speeds up inference (6-9 times faster) while maintaining accuracy (8-14% WER reduction) compared to autoregressive correction models. Furthermore, FastCorrect outperforms popular NAR models used in neural machine translation and text edition by a large margin.
