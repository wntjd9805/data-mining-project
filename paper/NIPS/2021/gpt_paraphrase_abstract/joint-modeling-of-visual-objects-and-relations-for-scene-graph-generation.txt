This paper presents a novel approach for generating scene graphs, which involves recognizing objects and their relationships in an image. Existing methods typically recognize objects and predict their relationships independently, disregarding the dependencies between objects and their relations. In contrast, our proposed approach captures these dependencies by using a unified conditional random field (CRF) to model the joint distribution of objects and their relations. We design potential functions that enable relational reasoning based on knowledge graph embedding methods. Additionally, we introduce an efficient algorithm for inference using mean-field variational inference, which incorporates relational reasoning after independently predicting objects and relations. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach in tasks such as relationship retrieval and zero-shot relationship retrieval.
