Many applications in industry and security rely on a set of sensors to detect sudden changes in behavior patterns over time. These changes usually occur locally, making only a small group of sensors useful for providing information. Monitoring all sensors continuously can be costly due to limited resources, which has led to the development of the bandit quickest changepoint detection problem. In this problem, sensing actions or sensors are chosen sequentially, and only measurements corresponding to the chosen actions are observed. We establish a lower bound on the time it takes to detect a change for a specific class of probability distributions using information theory. Additionally, we propose an online sensing scheme that efficiently balances the exploration of different sensing options with the exploitation of querying informative actions. We calculate the expected delay for this scheme and demonstrate its optimality by showing that it matches our lower bounds at low false alarm rates. Finally, we conduct experiments using synthetic and real datasets to showcase the effectiveness of our proposed method.
