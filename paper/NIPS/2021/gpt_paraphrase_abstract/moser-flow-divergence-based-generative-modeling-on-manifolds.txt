We aim to develop generative models for complex geometries represented by manifolds, such as spheres and tori. Existing generative models are limited to specific geometries and have high computational costs. We propose Moser Flow (MF), a new type of generative model that belongs to the continuous normalizing flows (CNF) family. MF utilizes a change-of-variable formula to create a CNF, but unlike other CNF methods, the model's density is parameterized as the difference between the prior density and the divergence of a neural network (NN). The divergence is a linear differential operator that can be easily approximated and calculated on manifolds. Therefore, MF does not require the use of an ODE solver during training, distinguishing it from other CNFs. Additionally, representing the model density as the divergence of a NN instead of solving an ODE simplifies the learning of high-quality densities. Theoretically, we prove that MF can approximate any density under suitable assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate the first application of flow models for sampling from curved surfaces, achieving notable improvements in density estimation, sample quality, and training complexity compared to existing CNFs on challenging synthetic geometries and real-world benchmarks from earth and climate sciences.
