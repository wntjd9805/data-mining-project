We investigate the learning of vector-valued nonlinear dynamical systems, where the system is described by Xt+1 = φ(A∗Xt) + ηt. The objective is to estimate the matrix A∗ using a single trajectory of dependent or correlated samples. Previous research has mainly focused on linear systems with the identity link function, but our work extends to nonlinear systems without the assumption of mixing. We present an offline algorithm that can learn nonlinear systems without the mixing assumption and improve upon the sample complexity of existing results for mixing systems. Additionally, we propose a streaming algorithm called SGD-RER for the one-pass setting, achieving the same sample complexity as our offline algorithm for mixing systems. We demonstrate the necessity of the expansivity assumption by showing that even for the easily learnable ReLU link function, any method would require exponentially many samples. Our simulations highlight the sub-optimality of a naive application of SGD and emphasize the importance of specialized methods for correlated data in outperforming standard SGD-based approaches.
