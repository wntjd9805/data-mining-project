We propose a method called Adversarial Teacher-Student Representation Learning for domain generalization (DG). Our approach aims to extract and utilize information that can generalize well to unseen target domains by generating and exploring out-of-source data distributions. Our framework combines knowledge-distillation based representation learning with novel-domain data augmentation in an adversarial learning manner. The teacher network is updated to derive domain-generalizable representations, while data synthesis generates plausible out-of-source distributions. Extensive image classification experiments on benchmark datasets in both single and multiple source DG settings demonstrate that our model has strong generalization ability and outperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.
