We present a novel method for learning end-to-end reconstruction operators using unpaired training data for challenging inverse problems. Our approach combines a traditional variational framework with iterative unrolling to minimize distortion in the measurement space and the Wasserstein-1 distance between the reconstruction and ground-truth distributions. The regularizer is parameterized by a deep neural network and learned simultaneously with the unrolled reconstruction operator. By initializing the variational problem with the output of the reconstruction network and solving iteratively, our method achieves faster convergence compared to traditional variational methods. Our approach combines the efficiency of end-to-end unrolled reconstruction with the robustness and noise-stability of the variational setting. Additionally, we demonstrate the superiority of our method in image reconstruction for X-ray computed tomography (CT) compared to unsupervised methods, and it either outperforms or matches the performance of state-of-the-art supervised data-driven reconstruction approaches.
