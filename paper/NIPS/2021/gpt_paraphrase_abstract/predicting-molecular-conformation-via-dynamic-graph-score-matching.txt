Recently, machine learning approaches have shown promising results in predicting stable 3D conformations from 2D molecular graphs. However, these approaches often overlook the long-range interactions between non-bonded atoms, which are crucial for accurately determining molecular conformations. In this paper, we introduce a new approach called Dynamic Graph Score Matching (DGSM) that addresses this limitation. DGSM dynamically constructs graph structures between atoms based on their spatial proximity during both training and inference, allowing for modeling of both local and long-range interactions. The DGSM estimates the gradient fields of atomic coordinates using score matching methods. The entire framework can be efficiently trained end-to-end. Experimental results demonstrate that DGSM outperforms existing methods and can generate conformations for a wider range of systems, including proteins and multi-molecular complexes.
