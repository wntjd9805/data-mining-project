Von Neumann's minmax theorem is a fundamental result in game theory, stating that zero-sum games have a unique equilibrium solution. Classical learning results have built upon this theorem to show that online no-regret dynamics eventually reach an equilibrium in zero-sum games. Recent research has focused on understanding the day-to-day behavior of these dynamics, revealing that many online learning strategies are cyclic and Poincaré recurrent in zero-sum games. We examine the robustness of these behaviors in periodic zero-sum games with a time-invariant equilibrium. This model captures repeated competitions influenced by external factors like time-of-day effects, weekly trends, and seasonality. Surprisingly, time-average convergence may fail in these settings, despite the fixed equilibrium. However, our novel analysis methods demonstrate that Poincaré recurrence remains valid even in these complex, non-autonomous dynamical systems.
