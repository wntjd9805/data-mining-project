This abstract presents a theoretical analysis of the learning performance of (cid:96)1-regularized linear regression ((cid:96)1-LinR) for Ising model selection. The replica method from statistical mechanics is used to analyze the typical performance of (cid:96)1-LinR on random regular graphs in the paramagnetic phase. The study finds that despite model misspecification, (cid:96)1-LinR is consistent with model selection and has a similar sample complexity as (cid:96)1-regularized logistic regression ((cid:96)1-LogR) with a sample complexity of M = O (log N), where N is the number of variables in the Ising model. The paper also introduces an efficient method to predict the non-asymptotic behavior of (cid:96)1-LinR for moderate M and N, such as precision and recall. Simulations demonstrate a good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results, even for graphs with many loops. The method presented in the paper can be applied to characterize the learning performances of other (cid:96)1-regularized M-estimators, including (cid:96)1-LogR and interaction screening.
