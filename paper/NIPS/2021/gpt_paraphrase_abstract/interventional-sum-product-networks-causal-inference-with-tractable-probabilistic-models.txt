Probabilistic models are commonly used to study causality, but the difficulty of making inferences limits their usefulness. To make causal models more manageable, we explore the idea of using sum-product networks (SPNs) with gate functions, such as neural networks, to learn interventional distributions. By inputting a causal graph with interventions, the gate function can predict the parameters of the SPN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these interventional SPNs through a personal health-themed structural causal model and compare them to other methods in both generative and causal modeling. Our evaluation shows that interventional SPNs are both expressive and capable of capturing causal relationships.
