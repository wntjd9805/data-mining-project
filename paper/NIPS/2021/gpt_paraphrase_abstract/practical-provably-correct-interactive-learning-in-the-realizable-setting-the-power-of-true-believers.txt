We propose a general framework for interactive learning, covering various problems like best arm identification and active classification. We acknowledge that agnostic algorithms are not optimal in the realizable setting, so we develop new computationally efficient algorithms that match the minimax lower bound with logarithmic factors. These algorithms can handle different function classes and have sample complexities quantified by well-known quantities like teaching dimension and haystack dimension. Unlike other combinatorial algorithms, our approach is computationally efficient as it samples from the version space using Monte Carlo "hit-and-run" algorithms. Our approach is simple and consists of two greedy algorithms. Additionally, our algorithms can effectively utilize prior knowledge. Empirically, we show that our algorithms are competitive with Gaussian process UCB methods.
