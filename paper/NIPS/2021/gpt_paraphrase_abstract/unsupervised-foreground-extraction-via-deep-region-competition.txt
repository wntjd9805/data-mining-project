We introduce Deep Region Competition (DRC), an algorithm that automatically extracts foreground objects from images. Foreground extraction involves identifying and separating objects from the background, which is a specific type of image segmentation. In this study, we combine energy-based prior knowledge with generative image modeling using a Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach. We also incorporate learned pixel re-assignment to capture the patterns in background regions. By using Expectation-Maximization (EM), we can naturally find the partition between foreground and background. Our method effectively utilizes the interaction between the mixture components during the partitioning process, which is similar to region competition, a well-known method for image segmentation. Experimental results show that DRC performs better than previous methods on complex real-world data and challenging scenes with multiple objects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DRC has the potential to generalize to new foreground objects, even those not seen during training.
