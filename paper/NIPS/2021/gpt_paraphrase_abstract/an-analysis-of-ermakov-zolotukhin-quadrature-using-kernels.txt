We examine a quadrature method developed by Ermakov and Zolotukhin in the 1960s using kernel methods. This quadrature rule utilizes a determinantal point process to determine the nodes, while the weights are determined through a linear system, similar to optimal kernel quadrature. In our research, we establish the relationship between these two types of quadrature and derive a practical formula for calculating the expected value of the squared worst-case integration error on the unit ball of an RKHS (reproducing kernel Hilbert space) using the former quadrature. This formula incorporates the eigenvalues of the corresponding kernel and allows for an improvement in the existing theoretical guarantees of optimal kernel quadrature with determinantal point processes.
