The success of graph neural networks (GNNs) in graph classification is closely tied to the Weisfeiler-Lehman algorithm. Both GNNs and the 1-WL algorithm utilize the aggregation of neighboring node features to create a node representation that encodes a rooted subtree around a central node. However, rooted subtrees have limited expressive power in representing non-tree graphs. To address this limitation, we propose Nested Graph Neural Networks (NGNNs) which represent graphs with rooted subgraphs instead of subtrees. This allows for the representation of identical subgraphs, rather than subtrees, in similar graphs. NGNN achieves this by extracting local subgraphs around each node and applying a base GNN to learn a subgraph representation. The overall graph representation is obtained by pooling these subgraph representations. We present a theoretical analysis that demonstrates the superiority of NGNN over 1-WL, as NGNN can discriminate almost all r-regular graphs while 1-WL fails. Additionally, NGNN introduces only a constant-factor increase in time complexity compared to standard GNNs. NGNN is a flexible framework that can be combined with different base GNNs and consistently improves performance on benchmark datasets.
