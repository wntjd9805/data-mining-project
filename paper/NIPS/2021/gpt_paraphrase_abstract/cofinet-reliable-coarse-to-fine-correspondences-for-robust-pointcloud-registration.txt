We investigate the task of finding connections between two sets of point clouds for registration purposes. Existing methods rely on matching sparse keypoints identified from dense points, but ensuring their consistency is challenging. To address this problem, we propose CoFiNet, a Coarse-to-Fine Network that extracts hierarchical correspondences without the need for keypoint detection. Our model first matches down-sampled nodes based on a weighting scheme, reducing the search space for subsequent stages. Then, the node proposals are expanded to patches consisting of groups of points and associated descriptors. Point correspondences are refined using a density-adaptive matching module capable of handling varying point density. CoFiNet outperforms existing methods on both indoor and outdoor benchmarks, particularly on the 3DLoMatch dataset with limited overlap. It achieves a Registration Recall improvement of at least 5% while using fewer parameters.
