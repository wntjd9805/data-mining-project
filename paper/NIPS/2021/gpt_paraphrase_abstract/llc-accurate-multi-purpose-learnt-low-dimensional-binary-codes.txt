We present a new method called Learning Low-dimensional binary Codes (LLC) for encoding instances and classes without the need for additional information. Our method achieves highly efficient compression of high-dimensional neural representations to low-dimensional binary codes, with codes as short as 20 bits for ImageNet-1K. Despite their compact size, the codes maintain optimal classification accuracy for ResNet50 on ImageNet-1K. We demonstrate that these codes capture important features in the data and can be used for tasks such as image retrieval and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. In image retrieval, our codes outperform a 16-bit HashNet using only 10 bits and are as accurate as 10-dimensional real representations. Additionally, our codes achieve OOD detection accuracy without any fine-tuning, outperforming a baseline method that requires approximately 3000 samples. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/RAIVNLab/LLC.
