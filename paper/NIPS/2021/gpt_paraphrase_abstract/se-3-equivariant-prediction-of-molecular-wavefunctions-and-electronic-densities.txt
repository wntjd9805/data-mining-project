Machine learning has revolutionized the prediction of quantum chemical properties, allowing for accurate and efficient calculations without the need for computationally expensive ab initio methods. Recent advancements have focused on learning the electronic wavefunction, which is a fundamental quantity in atomistic systems. However, predicting wavefunctions is challenging due to their non-trivial transformations under molecular rotations. To address this issue, we introduce SE(3)-equivariant operations and building blocks for deep learning architectures, which enable the reconstruction of wavefunctions with unprecedented accuracy. Our model achieves significant speedups compared to ab initio methods and reduces prediction errors compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches. This level of accuracy enables the direct derivation of properties such as energies and forces from the wavefunction, offering a more efficient and comprehensive approach. Furthermore, our approach can be applied to transfer learning, where models trained on low accuracy wavefunctions can correct for electronic interactions at a higher level of theory. These machine-learned wavefunction surrogates pave the way for novel semi-empirical methods that provide electronic resolution while reducing computational costs. Additionally, the predicted wavefunctions can be used as initial guesses in conventional ab initio methods, leading to faster convergence without sacrificing accuracy or robustness. Although our focus is on physics applications, the proposed equivariant framework for deep learning on point clouds shows promise in other fields such as computer vision and graphics.
