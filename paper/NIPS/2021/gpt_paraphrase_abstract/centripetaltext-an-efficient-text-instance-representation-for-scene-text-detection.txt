The challenge of detecting scene text is difficult due to the varying shapes, orientations, and sizes of the text. Existing methods for representing irregular text instances are complex and not robust. In this paper, we propose a new method called CentripetalText (CT) that breaks down text instances into text kernels and centripetal shifts. This allows for pixel aggregation and accurate prediction within a range. Our method guarantees high detection accuracy and fast inference speed. We also introduce CentripetalText Proposal Network (CPN) as a more accurate proposal generation module. Our experiments show that our method outperforms existing methods in scene text detection and recognition tasks.
