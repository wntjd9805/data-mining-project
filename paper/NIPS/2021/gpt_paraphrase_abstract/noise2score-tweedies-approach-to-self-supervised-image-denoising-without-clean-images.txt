In recent research, there has been a focus on training deep networks to denoise images without a clean reference. However, existing approaches such as Noise2Noise, Noise2Void, and SURE differ from each other and lack a coherent mathematical structure. To address this, we propose a new approach called Noise2Score, which identifies a missing link to unify these different approaches. Our approach demonstrates that image denoising without clean images can be achieved by finding the mode of the posterior distribution, and Tweedie's formula provides a solution through the score function (gradient of loglikelihood). We utilize the amortized residual denoising autoencoder to estimate the score function from noisy images, similar to Noise2Noise or Noise2Void. Our Noise2Score approach is versatile, as the same network training can be used for removing noise from images corrupted by any exponential family distributions and noise parameters. Through extensive experiments with Gaussian, Poisson, and Gamma noises, we show that Noise2Score outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising methods on benchmark datasets such as (C)BSD68, Set12, and Kodak.
