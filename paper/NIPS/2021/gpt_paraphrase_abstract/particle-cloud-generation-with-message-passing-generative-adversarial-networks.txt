Jets, which are collections of correlated particles produced in particle collisions, are important in high energy physics. Generative adversarial networks (GANs), a type of machine learning model, have the potential to speed up simulations of jets at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. However, there are currently no generative models applied to jet datasets represented as sets of particles in momentum-space. This study introduces a new dataset called JetNet and applies existing GANs designed for point clouds to it. The effectiveness of the models is evaluated using various metrics. It is found that existing GANs are not suitable for physics applications, so a new message passing GAN (MPGAN) is developed. MPGAN outperforms existing models on multiple metrics and shows promise for use in high energy physics. The authors propose JetNet as a dataset for the machine learning community to experiment with and set MPGAN as a benchmark for future generative models. To promote research and improve accessibility in this area, the JETNETPython package, an open-source tool with interfaces for particle cloud datasets, evaluation and loss metrics, and other machine learning tools for high energy physics development, is released.
