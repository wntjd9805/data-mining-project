Efforts have been made to create decision support tools for improving patient care. However, there is a lack of understanding about the factors that drive real-world clinical decisions in complex medical scenarios. This has led to a gap between these tools and their practical applications. It is crucial to focus on understanding clinical decision-making in order to improve current practices and facilitate effective human-machine interactions, especially in high-stakes situations with limited resources. We use organ transplantation as a case study and establish the requirements for methods that can enhance our understanding of clinical decision-making. Existing machine learning methods are insufficient to meet these requirements. To address this, we propose a new data-driven framework called iTransplant, which learns the factors influencing organ offer decisions directly from clinical data. Through experiments on liver transplantation data, we demonstrate that iTransplant can be used to identify the most important criteria for organ offer acceptance, determine patient-specific organ preferences, and explore variations in transplantation practices across different centers. The insights gained from iTransplant can inform the development of future decision support tools.
