Vision classification models often struggle with poor calibration when faced with shifts in data distribution. This paper presents a geometric solution to this problem by introducing Geometric Sensitivity Decomposition (GSD). GSD breaks down the norm of a sample feature embedding and the angular similarity to a target classifier into two components: instance-dependent and instance-independent. The instance-dependent component captures sensitive information about input changes, while the instance-independent component minimizes loss on the training dataset. Building upon this decomposition, a simple extension to current softmax-linear models is derived, which enables the disentanglement of these two components during training. Experimental results on various vision models demonstrate that the disentangled model outperforms other calibration methods in handling out-of-distribution (OOD) data and corruption, with significantly less complexity. In fact, the proposed method achieves a 30.8% relative improvement in Expected Calibration Error on corrupted CIFAR100, surpassing the current state of the art.
