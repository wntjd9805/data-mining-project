The CROWN method is an efficient neural network verifier that accelerates the verification process. However, it struggles to handle neuron split constraints, resulting in loose bounds and decreased efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a new method called α-CROWN, which fully encodes neuron splits using optimizable parameters. When optimized in intermediate layers, α-CROWN produces better bounds than traditional linear programming (LP) verifiers while maintaining the efficiency of the CROWN method on GPUs. When applied to robustness verification benchmarks, α-CROWN with branch-and-bound (BaB) is significantly faster than LP-based BaB methods and outperforms existing approaches. Additionally, α-CROWN can be used for efficient incomplete verification by terminating BaB early. Our method consistently achieves higher verified accuracy compared to other incomplete verifiers, including those based on convex barrier breaking techniques. Moreover, α-CROWN achieves higher verified accuracy with significantly less verification time compared to costly semidefinite programming (SDP) based verifiers. Our algorithm powered the α-CROWN verifier, which was the top-performing tool in VNN-COMP 2021. The code for our method is available at http://PaperCode.cc/BetaCROWN.
