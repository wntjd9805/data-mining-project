Recent studies on image restoration problems have achieved great success using deep neural networks. However, these studies handle the related parameters, such as scale factor, noise level, and quality factor, in an unsophisticated manner. Previous approaches either treat different parameter levels as independent tasks or ignore the parameter altogether. Both approaches have limitations in terms of efficiency and performance. To address this, we propose a novel system called functional neural network (FuncNet) that can solve a parametric image restoration problem using a single model. Unlike a regular neural network, FuncNet treats the parameter as a function rather than a variable, making it efficient and effective. We apply FuncNet to super-resolution, image denoising, and JPEG deblocking tasks and our experimental results demonstrate its superiority over existing methods in all three areas.
