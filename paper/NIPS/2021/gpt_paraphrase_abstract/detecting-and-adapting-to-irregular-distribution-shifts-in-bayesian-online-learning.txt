We address the challenge of online learning when there are unknown shifts in the data distribution, both in terms of rate and intensity. We propose a novel Bayesian online inference method that combines change point detection, switching dynamical systems, and Bayesian online learning. By incorporating a binary 'change variable', we develop an informative prior that allows the model to adapt to detected changes by tempering the influence of past updates. Additionally, our method employs beam search to track multiple change-point hypotheses and retrospectively selects the most likely one. This approach is applicable to various learning scenarios, including supervised and unsupervised settings, and is effective in handling concept drifts or covariate drifts. Our method outperforms existing Bayesian online learning approaches.
