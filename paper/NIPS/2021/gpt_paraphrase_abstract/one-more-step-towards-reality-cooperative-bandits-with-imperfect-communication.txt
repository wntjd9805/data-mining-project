This paper explores the cooperative bandit problem in real-world distributed settings where communication is often over stochastic networks with corruptions and delays. The study focuses on three communication scenarios: message-passing over stochastic time-varying networks, instantaneous reward-sharing over a network with random delays, and message-passing with adversarially corrupted rewards. Decentralized algorithms are proposed for each scenario, achieving competitive performance and near-optimal guarantees on group regret. Additionally, an improved delayed-update algorithm is presented for the perfect communication setting, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods on different network topologies. Tight network-dependent minimax lower bounds on group regret are also provided. The proposed algorithms are practical to implement and demonstrate competitive empirical performance.
