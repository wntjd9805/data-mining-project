We examine elections with two alternatives where voters' preferences are influenced by an unobservable state variable. Each voter receives a correlated private signal related to the state variable. Voters can either be contingent, with preferences varying across states, or predetermined, with consistent preferences across all states. Even if all voters are contingent, voting based on private information may not result in the adoption of the universally preferred alternative due to systematic signal biases. To address this, we propose a simple mechanism that collects and combines private signals from voters to determine the majority-favored alternative. In this mechanism, voters truthfully report their signals, leading to a strong Bayes Nash equilibrium where no coalition of voters can deviate and achieve a better outcome.
