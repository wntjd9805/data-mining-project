This paper explores the use of neural networks to solve high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, it focuses on second-order elliptic PDEs in d dimensions and analyzes their solutions in a function space called the Barron space. By making certain assumptions about the coefficients and source term of the PDE, the paper proves that the solution can be closely approximated by a Barron function in terms of the H1 norm. Additionally, the paper establishes explicit bounds for the Barron norm of this approximate solution, which depend polynomially on the dimension of the PDE. These complexity estimates allow for the approximation of the PDE solution on any bounded domain using a two-layer neural network, with a convergence rate determined by the dimension of the PDE.
