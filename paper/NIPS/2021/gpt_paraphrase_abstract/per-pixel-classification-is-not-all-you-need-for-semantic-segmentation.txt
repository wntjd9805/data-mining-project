Most current methods tackle semantic segmentation by classifying each pixel individually and handle instance-level segmentation separately using mask classification. However, our insight is that mask classification can be used to solve both semantic and instance-level segmentation tasks using the same model, loss, and training procedure. To support this, we propose MaskFormer, a straightforward mask classification model that predicts binary masks associated with a global class label prediction. This mask classification-based approach simplifies the effective methods for semantic and panoptic segmentation tasks and delivers impressive empirical results. Notably, MaskFormer outperforms per-pixel classification baselines, especially when dealing with a large number of classes. Our mask classification-based method also surpasses the current state-of-the-art models in semantic (55.6 mIoU on ADE20K) and panoptic segmentation (52.7 PQ on COCO).
