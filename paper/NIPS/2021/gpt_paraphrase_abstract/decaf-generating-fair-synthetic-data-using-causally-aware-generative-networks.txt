We propose DECAF, a GAN-based fair synthetic data generator for tabular data, to address the issue of unfair biases in machine learning models. Instead of directly using fair learning algorithms, we focus on generating fair synthetic data from unfair data while preserving the underlying data-generating process (DGP). DECAF incorporates the DGP as a structural causal model in the generator's input layers, allowing each variable to be reconstructed based on its causal parents. This enables inference-time debiasing by selectively removing biased edges to meet user-defined fairness requirements. DECAF is flexible and compatible with various fairness definitions. Experimental results demonstrate that DECAF effectively eliminates undesired bias and generates high-quality synthetic data, distinguishing it from existing methods. The generator's convergence and the fairness of downstream models are also theoretically guaranteed.
