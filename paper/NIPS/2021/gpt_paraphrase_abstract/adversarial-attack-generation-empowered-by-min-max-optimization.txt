Adversarial training (AT) is a powerful technique for enhancing adversarial robustness by minimizing the worst-case adversarial loss. However, the broader application of min-max optimization in the adversarial context has not been thoroughly investigated. This paper introduces a general framework for min-max optimization across multiple domains, which can be utilized to improve various types of adversarial attacks. By incorporating domain weights that are maximized over the probability simplex of the domain set, the worst-case attack loss can be minimized. The proposed framework is demonstrated in three attack scenarios: attacking model ensembles, creating universal perturbations for multiple inputs, and devising attacks resilient to data transformations. Extensive experiments show that this approach significantly outperforms existing heuristic strategies and state-of-the-art defense methods in terms of attack effectiveness and robustness. Furthermore, the self-adjusted domain weights obtained from the min-max framework can serve as a comprehensive tool for assessing the difficulty level of attacks across domains.
