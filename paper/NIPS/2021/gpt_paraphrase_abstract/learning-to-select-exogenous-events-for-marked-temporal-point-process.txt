Marked temporal point processes (MTPPs) are a valuable tool for modeling applications that involve discrete events occurring in continuous time. These events can be categorized as either endogenous (resulting from previous events) or exogenous (resulting from external factors). However, in practice, events are often unlabeled. In this paper, our objective is to identify the set of exogenous events from a set of unlabeled events. We formulate the parameter estimation and event set selection problems, proving that the latter is NP hard. We also demonstrate that the objective function is a monotone and Î±-submodular set function, allowing us to use a stochastic greedy algorithm with an approximation guarantee. Our experiments with synthetic and real data show that our method outperforms existing approaches based on endogenous and exogenous MTPPs.
