Cellular automata (CA) are computational models that exhibit complex dynamics through local cell interactions on a regular lattice. This study focuses on a generalized version of CA called graph cellular automata (GCA), which replaces the lattice structure with an arbitrary graph. Previous work utilized convolutional neural networks to learn transition rules for conventional CA, and this research employs graph neural networks to learn various transition rules for GCA. A general-purpose architecture is presented, capable of learning any GCA with a finite and discrete state space. The approach is tested on three tasks: 1) learning the transition rule of a GCA on a Voronoi tessellation; 2) imitating the behavior of a group of flocking agents; and 3) learning a rule for convergence to a desired target state.
