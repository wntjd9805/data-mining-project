The reconstruction of multiple interacting humans in three dimensions from a single image is important for understanding scenes. Current methods either focus on individual people, ignoring context, or attempt to reconstruct people together but struggle with interactions when people are close. This study introduces REMIPS, a model for reconstructing multiple interacting people in 3D using weak supervision. REMIPS utilizes a transformer network that combines person tokens with image feature patches. A unified model for self- and interpenetration-collisions is introduced based on mesh approximation. Self-supervised losses are used for flexibility and generalization, and self-contact and interaction-contact losses are incorporated into the learning process. REMIPS achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks, even without 3D supervision. Visual results demonstrate plausible reconstructions of pose and shape, particularly in challenging, real-world images with interacting people.
