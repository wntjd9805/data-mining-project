Estimating mean values while ensuring differential privacy is a crucial problem. However, existing worst-case optimal mechanisms fail to provide practical utility guarantees when the global sensitivity is high. To address this issue, researchers have proposed heuristic approaches to minimize errors on real-world data that do not resemble the worst-case scenario. This paper presents a principled approach that achieves instance-optimal performance. The proposed mechanism is not only theoretically optimal but also simple, practical, and adaptable to different data characteristics without requiring parameter adjustments. Moreover, it can be easily extended to the local and shuffle models.
