The CSGM framework has been effective in solving inverse problems using deep generative priors. However, its success has been limited to specific datasets and it performs poorly on out-of-distribution samples. This paper demonstrates the first successful application of the CSGM framework on clinical MRI data. By training a generative prior on brain scans from the fastMRI dataset, the authors show that posterior sampling using Langevin dynamics produces high-quality reconstructions. Additionally, experiments and theory confirm that posterior sampling remains robust even when the ground-truth distribution and measurement process change.
