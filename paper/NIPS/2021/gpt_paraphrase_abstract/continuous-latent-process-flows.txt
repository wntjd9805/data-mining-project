Many disciplines deal with partial observations of continuous time-series dynamics at arbitrary time stamps. It is promising and practical to fit this type of data using statistical models with continuous dynamics, as it allows for generating continuous trajectories and performing inference on previously unseen time stamps. However, existing models in this area still face challenges in terms of their representation power and the quality of their approximations. In this study, we address these challenges with continuous latent process flows (CLPF), which decodes continuous latent processes into observable processes using a time-dependent normalizing flow driven by a stochastic differential equation. We optimize our model using maximum likelihood and propose a novel piecewise construction of a variational posterior process, deriving the corresponding variational lower bound using importance weighting of trajectories. Our ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of our contributions, and comparisons to state-of-the-art baselines highlight our model's favorable performance on both synthetic and real-world data.
