Multi-hop reasoning is important for natural language processing (NLP) models that rely on large amounts of data to demonstrate broad knowledge. However, there are several challenges that arise when retrieving evidence passages in multi-hop models. These challenges include dealing with a large search space, representing complex queries, and determining the best order in which to hop between training passages. To address these issues, we present Baleen, a system that improves the accuracy of multi-hop retrieval by learning from weak training signals. We propose condensed retrieval, which summarizes retrieved passages after each hop to reduce the search space. We also introduce a focused late interaction retriever that allows different parts of a query to match relevant passages. Additionally, we devise a weak-supervision strategy called latent hop ordering, where the trained retriever selects the sequence of hops. Baleen achieves state-of-the-art performance in two-hop question answering and many-hop claim verification tasks.
