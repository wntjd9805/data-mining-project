The use of silicon-photonics-based optical neural networks (ONNs) has the potential to revolutionize efficient AI due to their compatibility with CMOS technology, flexibility, low latency, and energy efficiency. However, implementing in-situ training on programmable photonic chips poses challenges in terms of scalability, efficiency, and on-chip implementability. To address these issues, we propose a closed-loop ONN on-chip learning framework called L2ight. L2ight follows a three-stage learning flow that calibrates photonic circuit states, maps photonic cores, and incorporates a subspace learning procedure for in-situ gradient evaluation and fast adaptation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that L2ight outperforms previous ONN training protocols in terms of scalability and efficiency, achieving 3-order-of-magnitude higher scalability and over 30Ã— better efficiency. This framework represents the first scalable on-chip learning solution for self-learnable photonic neural chips, pushing the field from intractable to scalable and efficient. Additionally, L2ight provides insights for hardware-restricted unitary subspace optimization and efficient sparse training. Our framework is open-source and available at the provided link.
