Cooperative pedagogy, which involves adaptive interaction between teachers and students, is effective in maximizing communication efficiency in human education. The teacher adjusts her teaching approach to suit different students, and the student becomes better at understanding the teacher's intentions over time. While the benefits of integrating this pedagogy into machine concept learning have been demonstrated in discrete spaces, its potential for improving machine parameter learning has not been thoroughly explored. In this study, we propose a teacher-aware learner that incorporates the cooperative intentions of the teacher into the likelihood function. Our approach, called iterative teacher-aware learning (ITAL), is proven to result in both local and global improvements. We validate our algorithms through extensive experiments on various tasks using synthetic and real data, including regression, classification, and inverse reinforcement learning. Additionally, we demonstrate the advantages of modeling teacher-awareness when agents learn from human teachers.
