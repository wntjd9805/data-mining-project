This abstract discusses the task of learning latent community structure from multiple correlated networks. The focus is on learning the correspondence between vertices in two edge-correlated stochastic block models, specifically in cases where the average degree is logarithmic in the number of vertices. The abstract presents the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery, which determines whether it is possible to accurately identify the correspondence. Above the threshold, there is an estimator that can output the true correspondence with a high probability, while below the threshold, no estimator can accurately recover the correspondence. The abstract also highlights the application of these results in exactly recovering latent communities using multiple correlated graphs, even in parameter regimes where it would be information-theoretically impossible to do so using only a single graph.
