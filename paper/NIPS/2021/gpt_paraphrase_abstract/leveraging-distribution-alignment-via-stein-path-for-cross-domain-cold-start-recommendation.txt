This study focuses on the Cross-Domain Cold-Start Recommendation (CDCSR) problem, which aims to improve recommendation performance in a target domain with limited data by leveraging information from a source domain with more data. Existing approaches have not efficiently addressed the issue of reducing the discrepancy between latent embeddings across domains, resulting in model degradation. To tackle this problem, the authors propose DisAlign, a cross-domain recommendation framework that utilizes both rating and auxiliary representations from the source domain to enhance recommendation performance in the target domain. They introduce Stein path alignment, a method for aligning latent embedding distributions across domains, and its improved version, proxy Stein path, which reduces operation consumption and improves efficiency. Empirical studies on Douban and Amazon datasets demonstrate that DisAlign outperforms existing models in the CDCSR setting.
