In active sequential hypothesis testing (ASHT), the goal is to identify the true hypothesis from a known set using the fewest number of actions. This problem is particularly relevant in cases where there are a large number of hypotheses or actions, such as genomics-based cancer detection. We propose efficient algorithms that guarantee approximation for ASHT, regardless of the number of actions, and demonstrate their superiority through numerical evaluations using synthetic and real-world DNA mutation data.
