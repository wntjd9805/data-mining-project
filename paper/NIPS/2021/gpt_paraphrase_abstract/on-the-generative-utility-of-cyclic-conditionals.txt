We investigate the possibility of modeling a joint distribution p(x, z) using two conditional models p(x|z) and q(z|x) that form a cycle. Currently, deep generative models rely on an uninformative prior distribution p(z) to define the joint distribution, which can lead to issues like posterior collapse and manifold mismatch. To address this, we explore the compatibility and determinacy of p(x|z) and q(z|x) in representing a joint distribution. We develop a theory for operable equivalence criteria for compatibility and propose a generative modeling framework called CyGen that utilizes only the two cyclic conditional models. We also develop methods to ensure compatibility and determinacy and to fit and generate data using the conditional models. By removing the prior constraint, CyGen demonstrates improved data fitting and captures more representative features, as demonstrated by synthetic and real-world experiments.
