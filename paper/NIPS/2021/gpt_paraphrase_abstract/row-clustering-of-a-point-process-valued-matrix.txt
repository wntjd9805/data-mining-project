The machine learning community is facing new challenges in analyzing structured point process data from different platforms. In order to cluster repeatedly observed marked point processes, we introduce a new mixture model called multi-level marked point processes. This model helps to identify potential variations in the observed data. Our approach involves studying a matrix consisting of marked log-Gaussian Cox processes and clustering the rows of this matrix. To estimate the model, we propose an efficient semi-parametric Expectation-Solution (ES) algorithm combined with functional principal component analysis (FPCA) of point processes. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through simulation studies and real data analyses.
