This paper introduces a new neural model for associative memories, which is based on a hierarchical generative network that receives external stimuli through sensory neurons. The model is trained using predictive coding, an error-based learning algorithm inspired by cortical information processing. The model's capabilities are tested through retrieval experiments on corrupted and incomplete data points. Results show that the new model outperforms popular associative memory models, such as autoencoders trained via backpropagation, and modern Hopfield networks, in terms of retrieval accuracy and robustness. Notably, the model achieves remarkable results on natural image datasets, such as ImageNet, even with only a small fraction of the original image pixels presented. This model closely mimics the behavior of the hippocampus as a memory index and generative model, providing a plausible framework for studying learning and memory retrieval in the brain.
