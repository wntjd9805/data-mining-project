We introduce a novel algorithm for optimizing an unknown function in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our algorithm, based on Gaussian processes, achieves order-optimal regret performance with a poly-logarithmic factor. This marks the first Gaussian process-based algorithm with such a guarantee. Our approach involves shrinking the search domain by iteratively pruning and refining tree-based regions, focusing on smaller high-performing regions of the function domain. We localize the search for these regions and guide it using iterative estimation of the optimal function value, ensuring both efficient learning and computational efficiency. Compared to existing GP-UCB algorithms, our proposed algorithm reduces computational complexity by a factor of O(T 2dâˆ’1), where T represents the time horizon and d represents the dimension of the function domain.
