Graph neural networks (GNNs) have been widely successful, but there is a lack of theoretical understanding regarding their generalization ability, particularly for node-level tasks where the data is not independent and identically-distributed (IID). Investigating the generalization performance is important for comprehending fundamental issues like fairness in GNN models and improving learning methods. This paper introduces a novel PAC-Bayesian analysis for GNNs in a non-IID semi-supervised learning scenario. Additionally, it examines the generalization performances on various subgroups of unlabeled nodes, enabling a theoretical examination of accuracy-disparity fairness in GNNs. By making reasonable assumptions, the study demonstrates that the GNN's performance on a specific subgroup can be influenced by the distance between the test subgroup and the training set, highlighting the need for careful selection of training nodes for fair learning. Experimental results on multiple GNN models and datasets validate the theoretical findings.
