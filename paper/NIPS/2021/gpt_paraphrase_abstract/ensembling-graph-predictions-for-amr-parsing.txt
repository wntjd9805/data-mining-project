This study focuses on the training of machine learning models to predict structured data, specifically graphs. While ensemble methods have been widely used in classification and regression tasks, there is a lack of research on applying ensemble techniques to graph prediction. To address this gap, the authors propose a heuristic algorithm to approximate the optimal solution for mining the largest graph supported by a collection of graph predictions. The proposed approach is validated through experiments on AMR parsing problems, where it is shown to outperform individual models in terms of accuracy on five benchmark datasets.
