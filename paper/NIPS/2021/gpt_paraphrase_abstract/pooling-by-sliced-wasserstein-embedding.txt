Learning representations from sets has become increasingly important in various applications such as point cloud processing, graph learning, image/video recognition, and object detection. We present a novel pooling mechanism that can aggregate a set of features into a fixed-dimensional representation. This mechanism interprets elements of a set as samples from a probability distribution and utilizes an end-to-end trainable Euclidean embedding for sliced-Wasserstein distance to effectively learn from set-structured data. Our proposed pooling method is evaluated on different types of set-structured data, including point-cloud, graph, and image classification tasks. The results show that our method outperforms existing approaches for set representation learning. The code for our method is publicly available at https://github.com/navid-naderi/PSWE.
