This paper addresses the challenge of data fusion problems, where researchers have access to multiple data sources that capture different variables. While existing approaches assume that the data is fixed, in reality, data acquisition is an ongoing process. The objective of this study is to efficiently estimate any functional aspect of a probabilistic model, such as a causal effect, by determining which data source to query at each time. The proposed framework, called online moment selection (OMS), incorporates structural assumptions in the form of moment conditions. The optimal action at each step depends on the moments that identify the desired functional aspect. The algorithms in OMS strike a balance between exploration and selecting the best action based on current moment estimates. Two selection strategies, explore-then-commit (OMS-ETC) and explore-then-greedy (OMS-ETG), are proposed and proven to achieve zero asymptotic regret measured by mean squared error (MSE). The application of this framework is demonstrated in the estimation of average treatment effects, where causal graphs define the structural assumptions and data sources may include subsets of mediators, confounders, and instrumental variables.
