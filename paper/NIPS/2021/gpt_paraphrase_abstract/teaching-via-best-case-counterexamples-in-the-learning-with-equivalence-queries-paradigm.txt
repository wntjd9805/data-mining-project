We examine the teaching dimension (TD), also known as sample complexity of teaching, in the learning-with-equivalence-queries (LwEQ) framework. In this framework, a learner poses equivalence queries to a teacher, who responds with a "yes" or "no" answer and provides a counterexample if applicable. Previous studies have focused on worst-case or random counterexamples, but this paper considers an optimal teacher who selects the best-case counterexamples for teaching the target hypothesis within a hypothesis class. We introduce LwEQ-TD, a measure of teaching complexity that captures the number of queries required by this optimal teacher. Our findings demonstrate that using best-case counterexamples can significantly reduce the number of queries compared to worst-case or random counterexamples, across various hypothesis classes. Additionally, we establish connections between LwEQ-TD and well-established notions of TD in the learning-from-samples paradigm.
