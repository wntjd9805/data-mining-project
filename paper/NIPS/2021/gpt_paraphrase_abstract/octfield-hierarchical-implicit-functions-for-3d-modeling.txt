Advancements in neural implicit representation have made it possible for large scenes to be efficiently represented. However, the existing method of dividing 3D space into regular subdivisions does not consider the sparsity of surface occupancy and varying levels of geometric details. This results in a significant increase in memory usage and computational cost. To address this issue, we introduce OctField, a learnable hierarchical implicit representation for 3D surfaces. OctField allows for precise encoding of complex surfaces while minimizing memory and computational requirements. Our approach utilizes an adaptive decomposition of 3D scenes using a hierarchical octree structure. This structure dynamically subdivides the 3D space based on surface occupancy and geometric richness. Since an octree is discrete and non-differentiable, we propose a novel hierarchical network that models the subdivision of octree cells as a probabilistic process. This network can encode and decode both the octree structure and surface geometry in a differentiable manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OctField in various shape modeling and reconstruction tasks, showcasing its superiority over alternative approaches.
