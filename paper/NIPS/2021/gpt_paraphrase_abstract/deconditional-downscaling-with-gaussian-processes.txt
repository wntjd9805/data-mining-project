Refining low-resolution spatial fields using high-resolution information, also known as statistical downscaling, is challenging due to the diversity of spatial datasets. However, by modeling low-resolution samples as aggregate conditional means of high-resolution samples based on a globally observed mediating variable, the recovery of the fine-grained field can be approached as a deconditioning problem. In this study, we propose a Bayesian approach to deconditioning that builds upon the initial reproducing kernel Hilbert space formulation. We extend this approach to a downscaling setup and develop an efficient estimator for multiresolution data. By treating conditional expectations as inter-domain features, we establish a posterior for the latent field as a solution to the deconditioning problem. Additionally, we demonstrate that this solution can be viewed as a two-staged vector-valued kernel ridge regressor with a minimax optimal convergence rate. Finally, we showcase the effectiveness of our method in both synthetic and real-world atmospheric field downscaling problems, highlighting significant improvements compared to existing methods.
