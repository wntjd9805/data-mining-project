The prevalence of graph-based data has led to the rapid development of graph neural networks (GNNs) and related machine learning algorithms. However, most research in this area focuses on undirected graphs, despite the existence of many datasets naturally represented as directed graphs. This paper introduces MagNet, a GNN specifically designed for directed graphs. MagNet is based on a complex Hermitian matrix called the magnetic Laplacian, which incorporates both the geometric structure and directional information of the graph. By adjusting a "charge" parameter, spectral information is tailored to capture variations among directed cycles. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MagNet in directed graph node classification and link prediction tasks, outperforming other methods in the majority of cases. The flexible principles underlying MagNet allow for its adaptation to other GNN architectures.
