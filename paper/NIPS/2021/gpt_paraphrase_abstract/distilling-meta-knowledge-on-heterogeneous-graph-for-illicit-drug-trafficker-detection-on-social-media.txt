The crime of drug trafficking has adapted to modern technologies, specifically social media platforms like Instagram, to market and sell illicit drugs. Detecting and disrupting these online drug trades requires new techniques. This paper presents a framework called MetaHG that automatically detects illicit drug traffickers on social media by addressing two key challenges. Firstly, MetaHG models both multi-modal content and relational structured information on social media, unlike previous works that only focus on post content analysis. Secondly, MetaHG uses meta-learning to overcome the need for large amounts of data for model training. The framework builds a heterogeneous graph to understand the drug trafficking ecosystem on social media and employs a relation-based graph convolutional neural network to learn user representations. Graph structure refinement is introduced to improve node representation learning. Additionally, a meta-learning algorithm is proposed for model optimization, and self-supervised and knowledge distillation modules are used to utilize unlabeled data for model improvement. Experimental results using real-world data from Instagram show that MetaHG outperforms existing methods.
