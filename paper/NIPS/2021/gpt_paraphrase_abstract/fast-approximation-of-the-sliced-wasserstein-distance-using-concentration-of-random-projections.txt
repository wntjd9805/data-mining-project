The Sliced-Wasserstein distance (SW) is gaining popularity in machine learning as a more efficient alternative to the Wasserstein distance. Traditionally, SW is approximated using Monte Carlo sampling. However, we propose a new approach based on the concentration of measure phenomenon. This allows us to approximate SW deterministically, without the need for random projections. Our method is accurate and easy to use, and we provide guarantees for its performance. We validate our approach on synthetic datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness in a generative modeling problem.
