Subsampling in hierarchical models is challenging for variational inference due to the increasing number of local latent variables with the dataset size. This poses a problem for inference at large scales. While using a variational family that matches the posterior structure is advantageous, optimization remains slow due to the vast number of local distributions. To address this, the paper proposes an amortized approach where shared parameters represent all local distributions simultaneously. This approach achieves similar accuracy to using a specific joint distribution (e.g., full-rank Gaussian), but is applicable to significantly larger datasets. Additionally, it offers a much faster alternative compared to using a structured variational distribution.
