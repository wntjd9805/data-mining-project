We present a novel framework called Structured Nonlinear Independent Component Analysis (SNICA) that allows for principled disentanglement. Our contribution is in expanding the identifiability theory of deep generative models to a wide range of structured models. While previous work focused on specific time-series models, our theorems demonstrate identifiability for more general temporal structures and models with complex structures like spatial dependencies. Importantly, we prove that identifiability holds even in the presence of unknown distribution noise. As an example of the framework's versatility, we introduce the first nonlinear ICA model for time-series that encompasses nonstationarity, autocorrelation, unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, hidden state modeling, and variational maximum-likelihood estimation and inference.
