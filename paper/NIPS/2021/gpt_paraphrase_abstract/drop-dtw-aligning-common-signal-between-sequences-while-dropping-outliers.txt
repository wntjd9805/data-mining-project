This study focuses on the problem of aligning sequences that contain outliers. The standard Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm can efficiently align sequences without outliers, but it fails to align sequences meaningfully when outliers are present. To address this issue, the researchers propose a new algorithm called Drop-DTW. Drop-DTW aligns the common parts of the sequences while automatically disregarding the outlier elements. The algorithm is implemented as a single dynamic program that is both efficient and differentiable. The researchers conducted experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of Drop-DTW as a similarity measure for sequence retrieval and as a training loss in various applications, including temporal step localization in instructional videos, representation learning from noisy videos, and cross-modal representation learning for audio-visual retrieval and localization. The experiments showed that Drop-DTW achieved state-of-the-art results in weakly- or unsupervised settings.
