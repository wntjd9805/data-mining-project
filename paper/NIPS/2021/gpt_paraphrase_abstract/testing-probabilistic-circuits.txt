Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are a useful tool for modeling probability distributions over combinatorial spaces. In machine learning and probabilistic programming, it is important to determine if the learned distributions using PCs are similar to the desired distribution. This paper introduces a method for testing the similarity of two PCs based on the total variation distance metric. The algorithm relies on counting and sampling queries commonly used in PCs. The authors present a polynomial-time probabilistic algorithm that can check the similarity of two PCs when they support approximate counting and sampling. The algorithm's effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on 475 PC benchmarks, where it correctly determines the similarity of all 475 PCs within 3600 seconds.
