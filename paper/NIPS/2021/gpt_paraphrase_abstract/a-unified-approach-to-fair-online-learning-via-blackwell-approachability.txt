We propose a framework for achieving fair online learning in situations where sensitive and non-sensitive contexts are involved. In this framework, there is a repeated game between the Player and Nature, where both make decisions based on the contexts. The Player can only access the non-sensitive context, while we consider two cases for Nature: one where Nature has access to the sensitive contexts and one where Nature is unaware of them. By adapting Blackwell's approachability theory to handle unknown distributions of contexts, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition for learning objectives to be compatible with fairness constraints. Specifically, we focus on (group-wise) no-regret and (group-wise) calibration objectives, along with the additional constraint of demographic parity. If the objective is not compatible with the constraint, our framework allows for determining the optimal trade-off between the two.
