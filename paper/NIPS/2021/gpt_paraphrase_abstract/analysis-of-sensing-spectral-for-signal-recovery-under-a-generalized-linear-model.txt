This paper examines a nonlinear inverse problem in signal processing, where the goal is to recover the signal of interest from nonlinearly transformed observations. The focus is on understanding how the properties of the sensing matrices impact the difficulty of signal recovery. The expectation propagation algorithm (EP) is used as a recovery method, and the spikiness of the spectrum of the sensing matrices is identified as an important measure. The impact of the spikiness on the EP performance depends on the specific nonlinear processing function. The paper introduces quantities based on this function to describe the influence of the spikiness on recovery. The findings show that in phase-retrieval problems, matrices with spikier spectrums are more suitable for EP, while in 1-bit compressed sensing problems, flatter spectrums offer better recoveries. These results generalize and unify existing comparisons between sub-Gaussian and orthogonal matrices and provide a foundation for designing optimal sensing systems.
