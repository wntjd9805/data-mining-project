This paper explores the impact of introducing reserve prices in auctions where bidders aim to maximize their value while adhering to spending constraints. Unlike traditional auction theory, which focuses on revenue improvement for the auctioneer, we show that reserve prices can also enhance total welfare. Our findings indicate that reserve prices are effective for different bidder types, without requiring bidder type information. We extend these results to various auction mechanisms and propose combining them with additive boosts to further improve auction outcomes. An empirical study using data from online advertising auctions confirms the effectiveness of these ideas.
