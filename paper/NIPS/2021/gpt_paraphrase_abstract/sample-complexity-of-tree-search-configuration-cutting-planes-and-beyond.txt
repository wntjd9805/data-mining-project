This paper examines the use of cutting-plane methods in integer programming and proposes sample complexity bounds for cut-selection in branch-and-cut algorithms. The authors provide guarantees on the number of samples needed to ensure that the size of the tree built by the algorithm is close to the expected size. They first focus on learning cutting planes from the Chv√°tal-Gomory cuts family and then extend the analysis to more sophisticated cut selection policies. Additionally, the paper introduces a general abstraction of tree search and provides sample complexity bounds for learning a good policy for building the search tree.
