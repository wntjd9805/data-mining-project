Neural responses are known to be variable, even under the same experimental conditions. Recent studies have shown that this variability can be predicted and influenced by sensory input and behavior, and it provides important information about the network dynamics and computations. However, current methods for studying neural variability are mainly focused on sensory coding in controlled laboratory settings, requiring repeated trials with consistent stimuli and behavioral factors. These methods often make assumptions about the form of variability or use data-inefficient approaches. In this study, we propose a new probabilistic model based on sparse Gaussian processes that overcomes these limitations. Our model can capture arbitrary spike count distributions and their dependence on observed and hidden factors. It uses scalable variational inference to efficiently infer the relationships between these factors and the spike count distributions. Unlike existing methods, our model does not require repeated trials and can accurately capture the joint spike count distributions influenced by different factors. It also provides insights into the underlying causes of statistical dependencies between neurons. We applied our model to recordings from head direction cells in mice, a non-sensory neural population, and found that variability in these cells does not follow a simple relationship with mean spike count as assumed in standard models. The modulation of this variability by external factors can be as strong as the modulation of mean firing rate, and slow low-dimensional factors explain the neural correlations. Our approach opens up new avenues for studying neural variability in naturalistic conditions, beyond the scope of sensory coding with repeatable stimuli.
