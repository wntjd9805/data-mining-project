Regularization is crucial in deep learning, improving generalization by preventing overfitting. Stochastic Depth (SD) is a noise-based regularization technique for Residual Neural Networks (ResNets) that has shown promising results. However, its theoretical aspects remain largely unexplored. This study presents a hybrid analysis using perturbation analysis and signal propagation to investigate the regularization effects of SD. Through this analysis, the study establishes guidelines for selecting appropriate survival rates for training with SD.
