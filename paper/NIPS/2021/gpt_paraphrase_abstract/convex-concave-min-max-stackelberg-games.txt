Min-max optimization problems, known as min-max games, have gained attention in machine learning due to their applicability. However, existing research has primarily focused on games with independent strategy sets, leaving games with dependent strategy sets, called min-max Stackelberg games, understudied. This study introduces two first-order methods that efficiently solve a wide range of convex-concave min-max Stackelberg games and demonstrate their polynomial time convergence. These methods can also be applied to convex robust optimization problems, which are variations of Wald's maximin model. Additionally, the computation of competitive equilibria in Fisher markets can be seen as a min-max Stackelberg game. The effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithms are demonstrated through experiments in computing competitive equilibria in Fisher markets with different utility structures. These experiments also highlight the impact of smoothness properties on the convergence rate of the algorithms, suggesting potential avenues for further research.
