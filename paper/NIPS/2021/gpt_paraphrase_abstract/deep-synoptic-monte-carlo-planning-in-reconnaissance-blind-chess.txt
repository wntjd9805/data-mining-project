This paper presents deep synoptic Monte Carlo planning (DSMCP) as a technique for handling large imperfect information games. The method involves creating a belief state using an unweighted particle filter and generating plans through playouts that begin with samples drawn from the belief state. To address uncertainty, the algorithm utilizes inference on "synopses," which are a new form of stochastic abstraction of information states. DSMCP serves as the foundation for the Penumbra program, which emerged as the winner of the official 2020 reconnaissance blind chess competition, surpassing 33 other programs. The paper also explores different variations of the algorithm that incorporate caution, paranoia, and a novel bandit algorithm. Additionally, it assesses the effectiveness of the synopsis features employed in Penumbra using per-bit saliency statistics.
