This study focuses on hierarchical clustering, which involves dividing a data set into smaller clusters. The cost function for hierarchical clustering introduced by Dasgupta is examined, and two polynomial-time approximation algorithms are presented. The first algorithm provides an approximation within a constant factor for graphs with high conductance, without the need for complex recursive routines. The second algorithm offers a similar approximation for a wide range of graphs with a defined cluster structure, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art algorithm that only applies to stochastic models. Empirical analysis on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to the previous one for graphs with a well-defined cluster structure.
