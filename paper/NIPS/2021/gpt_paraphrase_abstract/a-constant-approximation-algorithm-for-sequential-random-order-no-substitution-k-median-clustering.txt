We investigate the problem of k-median clustering in a sequential no-substitution scenario, where data points are observed one by one and selected as cluster centers immediately after observation without the possibility of substitution. Previous work has not provided an algorithm for this setting that achieves a constant approximation factor on the optimal cost, particularly under a random arrival order. Our algorithm addresses this gap and significantly improves upon previous approaches. Notably, it is the first constant approximation guarantee that does not require any structural assumptions about the input data. Additionally, our algorithm selects only a quasi-linear number of centers in relation to k. To achieve these results, we employ a careful cost estimation technique that avoids outliers, introduce a novel concept of linear bin division, and utilize a multiscale approach for center selection.
