We aim to provide a more realistic basis for comparing voting rules by examining the worst average-case satisfaction of voting axioms in semi-random models. Using the semi-random model from a previous study, we analyze the satisfaction of two well-known voting axioms: the Condorcet criterion and participation. Our findings demonstrate that the semi-random satisfaction of the Condorcet criterion can range from 1 to 1 - exp(-Θ(n)), Θ(n^-0.5), exp(-Θ(n)), or Θ(1) and 1 - Θ(1) simultaneously, depending on the number of alternatives and voters. Additionally, we determine that the semi-random satisfaction of participation is 1 - Θ(n^-0.5). These results address previous inquiries from Berg and Lepelley in 1994 and indicate that the Condorcet criterion is a more significant concern than participation in realistic models.
