OpenMatch is a novel approach to Open-set Semi-Supervised Learning (OSSL) that aims to address the issue of outliers in unlabeled data. While traditional SSL methods assume that labeled and unlabeled data share the same label space, OpenMatch recognizes that unlabeled data can contain categories not present in the labeled set, which can negatively impact SSL algorithms. To overcome this problem, OpenMatch combines FixMatch with novelty detection using one-vs-all (OVA) classifiers. These classifiers provide a confidence score for determining whether a sample is an inlier or an outlier. Additionally, OpenMatch introduces an open-set soft-consistency regularization loss, which improves the smoothness of the OVA classifiers and enhances outlier detection. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenMatch achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets and even surpasses a fully supervised model in detecting outliers in unlabeled data on CIFAR10.
