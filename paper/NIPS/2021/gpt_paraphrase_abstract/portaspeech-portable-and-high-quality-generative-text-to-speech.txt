PortaSpeech is a lightweight and portable text-to-speech model that aims to generate diverse and high-quality speech with natural details and rich prosody. The model combines a lightweight VAE with an enhanced prior and a flow-based post-net to accurately capture both prosody and mel-spectrogram details. To reduce the model size and memory footprint, the model introduces a grouped parameter sharing mechanism. Additionally, the model incorporates a linguistic encoder with mixture alignment to improve speech expressiveness and reduce dependency on fine-grained alignment between text and speech. Experimental results demonstrate that PortaSpeech outperforms other TTS models in terms of voice quality and prosody modeling, even when the model parameters are significantly reduced. The effectiveness of each design in PortaSpeech is supported by extensive ablation studies.
