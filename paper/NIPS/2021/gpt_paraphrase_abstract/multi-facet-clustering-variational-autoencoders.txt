This paper introduces Multi-Facet Clustering Variational Autoencoders (MFCVAE), a new type of variational autoencoders that can learn multiple clusterings simultaneously for high-dimensional data like images. The MFCVAE uses a ladder architecture and a Mixture-of-Gaussians prior for each latent variable to achieve stable performance. The paper presents novel theoretical results for optimizing the ELBO analytically and corrects earlier influential theoretical work. Experimental results on image benchmarks show that the MFCVAE effectively separates and clusters different aspects of the data in a disentangled manner. Additionally, the model exhibits compositionality in its latent space and enables controlled generation of samples.
