Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable results in predicting molecular properties. However, these networks heavily depend on atom positions, which are often unavailable or costly to acquire. To address this issue, we propose the use of synthetic coordinates that allow the utilization of advanced GNNs without requiring the actual molecular configuration. We introduce two types of synthetic coordinates: distance bounds, which provide an estimate of the possible molecular configurations, and graph-based distances using a personalized PageRank variant. To incorporate both distance and angular information, we present a technique to transform regular GNNs into directional message-passing neural networks (MPNNs). Through experiments on the ZINC benchmark, we demonstrate that this transformation reduces the error of a regular GNN by 55%. Moreover, by incorporating synthetic coordinates into the SMP and DimeNet++ models, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on the ZINC and coordinate-free QM9 datasets. Our implementation is publicly available.
