The task of single image reflection separation (SIRS) involves recovering transmission and reflection layers from a mixed observation. Existing deep learning solutions address this task individually without considering interaction between the two layers. This work proposes the "your trash is my treasure" (YTMT) strategy to construct dual-stream decomposition networks. The strategy enforces communication between the two streams by transferring deactivated information instead of discarding it. Ablation studies and experimental results on SIRS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of YTMT compared to other state-of-the-art alternatives. The implementation is simple and the code is publicly available.
