Privacy-protected microdata is often the desired outcome of a differentially private algorithm because it is convenient for downstream users. However, there is a trade-off between accuracy for the overall population ("sum query") and accuracy for its sub-populations ("point queries"). This trade-off can result in a degradation of accuracy by a logarithmic factor compared to differentially private systems that do not need to produce microdata. For example, without the microdata requirement, noisy answers can be provided for both the sum query and point queries with a guaranteed squared error of O(1/(cid:15)2). With the microdata requirement, one must choose between allowing an additional log2(d) factor for some point queries (where d is the number of point queries) or allowing an extra O(d2) factor for the sum query. We provide lower bounds for pure, approximate, and concentrated differential privacy and suggest strategies to mitigate this trade-off. Additionally, we offer a collection of benchmark datasets for public study of this issue.
