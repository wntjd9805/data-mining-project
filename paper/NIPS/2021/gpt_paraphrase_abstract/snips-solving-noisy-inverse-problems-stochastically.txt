We present a new stochastic algorithm called SNIPS, which samples from the posterior distribution of linear inverse problems with additive white Gaussian noise. Our approach combines ideas from Langevin dynamics and Newton's method, and utilizes a pre-trained MMSE Gaussian denoiser. By deriving the posterior score function using an SVD of the degradation operator, we develop an iterative algorithm for efficient sampling. The stochastic nature of our algorithm allows for multiple high-quality samples to be generated from the same noisy observation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in image deblurring, super-resolution, and compressive sensing tasks. The produced samples are sharp, detailed, and consistent with the given measurements, while their diversity reflects the inherent uncertainty of the inverse problem.
