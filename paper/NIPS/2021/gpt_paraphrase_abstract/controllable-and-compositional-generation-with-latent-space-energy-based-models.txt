Generating novel concept combinations is a significant challenge for deep generative models in real-world applications. This study proposes the use of energy-based models (EBMs) to handle compositional generation of attributes. To enable scalability for high-resolution image generation, an EBM is introduced in the latent space of a pre-trained generative model like StyleGAN. The study presents a new EBM formulation that represents the joint distribution of data and attributes, and demonstrates how sampling from it involves solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). By training an attribute classifier, controllable generation can be achieved with a pre-trained generator. The sampling process using ODEs is efficient and robust, making the method simple, fast to train, and efficient to sample. Experimental results indicate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in both conditional sampling and sequential editing. In compositional generation, the proposed method excels at generating unseen attribute combinations without prior training. Additionally, this work achieves compositionality in generating photo-realistic images of 1024x1024 resolution by combining energy functions with logical operators.
