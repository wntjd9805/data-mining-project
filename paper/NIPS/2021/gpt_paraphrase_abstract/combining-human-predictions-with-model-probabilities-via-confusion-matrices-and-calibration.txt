Machine learning models are increasingly being used to enhance human decision-making. When both the model and the human are not perfectly accurate in classification tasks, achieving high performance requires combining their predictions in a way that utilizes their strengths. This study introduces a set of algorithms that combine the probabilistic output of a model with the class-level output of a human. The research demonstrates that the accuracy of this combination model is influenced not only by the individual accuracies of the human and model, but also by the model's confidence. Empirical results from image classification experiments confirm that combining human and model predictions consistently yields higher accuracies compared to relying solely on the model or human. Additionally, the study shows that the combination method can be effectively estimated with as few as ten labeled data points.
