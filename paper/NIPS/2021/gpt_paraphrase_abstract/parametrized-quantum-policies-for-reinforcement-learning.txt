The concept of using parametrized quantum computations as hypothesis families in a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning system is gaining traction with the emergence of real-world quantum computing. These hybrid systems have demonstrated potential in supervised and generative learning, with recent studies proving their advantages in specific artificial tasks. However, in reinforcement learning, which is considered the most challenging, no successful proposal has been able to solve standard benchmarking tasks or show theoretical advantages over classical algorithms. This study presents a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning model that uses only a few qubits and effectively solves various standard benchmarking environments. Additionally, the study demonstrates and formally proves that parametrized quantum circuits can solve certain learning tasks that are intractable for classical models, including deep neural networks, based on the classical hardness of the discrete logarithm problem.
