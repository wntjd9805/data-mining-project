Collecting training data is a crucial and costly step in supervised learning. The quality and quantity of the data greatly affect the performance of the learned function. Since labeling data is more expensive than comparing two items, we suggest a method where human experts answer pairwise queries while the computer groups the items into classes. The classes can be labeled inexpensively at the end of the process. We consider two random models for the classes: one with a uniformly drawn set partition and another where each item selects its class independently based on a fixed distribution. In the first model, we identify algorithms that minimize the average number of queries needed to cluster the items and analyze their complexity. In the second model, we study a specific algorithm family, propose that they achieve the minimum average number of queries, and compare their performance to a random approach. We also offer solutions for handling errors or inconsistencies in the experts' responses.
