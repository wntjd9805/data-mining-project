Large-scale time series panels have become widespread in various domains, necessitating forecasting techniques that can effectively utilize all available data. Generating probabilistic predictions is a desirable feature in these techniques. In this study, we introduce Level Set Forecaster (LSF), a straightforward yet efficient method to convert a point estimator into a probabilistic one. By establishing a connection between our algorithm and random forests (RFs) and quantile regression forests (QRFs), we demonstrate the consistency of our approach under reasonable assumptions on the underlying point estimator. Additionally, we provide the first consistency results for QRFs under the CART-splitting criterion. Empirical experiments reveal that our approach, employing tree-based models as the point estimator, performs comparably to cutting-edge deep learning models in terms of forecasting accuracy.
