Bayesian Optimization is a method used for efficient black-box optimization, typically for problems with a small number of independent objectives. However, there is a need to optimize objectives that are defined over many correlated outcomes or tasks. This arises in scenarios such as optimizing the coverage of a cell tower network across multiple locations or balancing the performance of a robot in different environments. The Gaussian Process models commonly used for multi-task Bayesian Optimization do not scale well with the number of outcomes, limiting their usefulness. To address this, we have developed a technique that efficiently samples exact multi-task Gaussian Process models by leveraging the Kronecker structure in covariance matrices and Matheron's identity. This enables us to perform Bayesian Optimization using multi-task Gaussian Process models with tens of thousands of correlated outputs. Our approach significantly improves sample efficiency compared to existing methods that only model aggregate functions of the outcomes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique in various scientific and engineering applications, including optimizing interference patterns of an optical interferometer with over 65,000 outputs.
