One popular technique for understanding a black-box neural network is feature attribution, which involves determining the importance of input features for the network's predictions. Recently, the concept of predictive information has been introduced as a way to measure feature importance. However, this measure has only been applied to latent features within the network. In this study, we propose a method to identify input features with predictive information. Our method allows for detailed identification of the information carried by input features and is independent of network architecture. The key idea behind our approach is to create a bottleneck at the input level, which selectively allows only input features associated with predictive latent features to pass through. We evaluate our method against several feature attribution techniques using standard evaluation experiments. The source code for our method is publicly available.
