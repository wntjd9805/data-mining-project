We examine robust versions of the standard optimal transport, known as robust optimal transport, where the constraints on probability distributions are relaxed using Kullback-Leibler divergence. We demonstrate that Sinkhorn-based algorithms can estimate the optimal cost of robust optimal transport in (cid:101)O( n2ε ) time, where n represents the number of supports of the probability distributions and ε is the desired error. Additionally, we explore a fixed-support robust barycenter problem involving m discrete probability distributions with a maximum of n supports. We devise an approximate algorithm based on iterative Bregman projections (IBP) and find that for the specific case of m = 2, this algorithm can estimate the optimal barycenter value in (cid:101)O( mn2ε ) time, which is an improvement over the previous complexity of (cid:101)O( mn2ε2 ) for the IBP algorithm used to approximate the Wasserstein barycenter.
