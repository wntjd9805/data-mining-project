Learning an unknown n-qubit quantum state ρ is a fundamental challenge in quantum computing. Traditional quantum state tomography requires an exponential number of copies of ρ to estimate its entries. However, recent research has introduced several alternative learning models that require a linear number of copies of ρ to learn it approximately. These models include the PAC model, shadow tomography, differentially private learning, and online learning. In this paper, we establish a sequence of implications from differentially-private PAC learning to online learning and then to quantum stability. We extend previous work to the real-valued and quantum settings and introduce a robust quantum online learner, RSOA. Our results demonstrate equivalences between different learning models and provide applications in various areas such as shadow tomography and noisy quantum state learning.
