Missing data is a significant issue in machine learning. To address this, we propose a regularization scheme called MIRACLE which aims to maintain the causal structure of the data during imputation. MIRACLE refines the imputation process by simultaneously modeling the mechanism behind missingness and ensuring consistency with the causal structure. We conducted experiments on various datasets and found that MIRACLE consistently outperforms benchmark methods in all missingness scenarios.
