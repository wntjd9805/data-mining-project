Domain adaptive semantic segmentation aims to transfer knowledge learned from labeled source domain to unlabeled target domain. Recent methods have focused on translating source images to target-like images (latent domains) to bridge the domain gap and facilitate adaptation. However, these methods overlook explicitly modeling the knowledge transfer relationship across different domains. In contrast, our approach breaks the conventional "source-target" adaptation framework and constructs multiple adaptation pairs, such as "source-latent" and "latent-target," to leverage meta-knowledge learned from one pair to guide the adaptation of another pair within a meta-learning framework. We also extend our method to the practical scenario of open compound domain adaptation, where the target consists of multiple domains without domain labels. By introducing an additional "latent-latent" pair, we reduce the domain gap between the source and different latent domains, enabling effective adaptation on multiple target domains simultaneously. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both single target and multiple-target domain adaptation settings when evaluated on standard benchmarks.
