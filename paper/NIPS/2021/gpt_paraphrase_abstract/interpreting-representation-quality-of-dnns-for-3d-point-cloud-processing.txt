This study examines the effectiveness of knowledge representations in deep neural networks (DNNs) for processing 3D point clouds. The authors propose a method to assess the overall vulnerability of the models by analyzing their sensitivity to rotation, translation, scale, and local 3D structures. They also introduce metrics to evaluate the spatial smoothness of encoding 3D structures and the complexity of the DNN's representation. Through experiments, the researchers identify representation issues in traditional DNNs and demonstrate the benefits of adversarial training. The code will be made available upon acceptance of the paper.
