We propose MLRATE, a machine learning regression-adjusted treatment effect estimator, to address the issue of variance reduction in randomized controlled trials. MLRATE utilizes machine learning predictors of the outcome to decrease estimator variance. By employing cross-fitting to avoid overfitting biases, we establish its consistency and asymptotic normality under general conditions. MLRATE remains robust even when the machine learning predictions are poor. If the predictions are uncorrelated with the outcomes, the estimator performs no worse than the standard difference-in-means estimator. However, if the predictions are highly correlated with the outcomes, MLRATE achieves significant efficiency gains. In A/A tests conducted on 48 outcome metrics commonly monitored in Facebook experiments, MLRATE demonstrates over 70% lower variance compared to the simple difference-in-means estimator and about 19% lower variance than the common univariate procedure that only adjusts for pre-experiment outcome values.
