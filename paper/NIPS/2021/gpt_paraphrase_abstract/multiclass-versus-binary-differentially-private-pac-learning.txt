We have developed a method to convert multiclass differentially private PAC learning into binary private PAC learning. By applying this method to an existing binary private PAC learner, we have created a private multiclass learner that has improved sample complexity. Our new learner has a polynomial dependence on the multiclass Littlestone dimension and a poly-logarithmic dependence on the number of classes, resulting in a significant improvement over previous learners. We have also expanded on the concept of Î¨-dimension introduced by Ben-David et al. [5] in the online setting and explored its general properties.
