We propose DIB-R++, a hybrid differentiable renderer that combines rasterization and ray-tracing to predict intrinsic object properties from a single image. Unlike previous approaches that fail to account for non-Lambertian, specular reflections commonly observed in real-world scenarios, our renderer supports photorealistic effects by incorporating environmental lighting and spatially-varying material models. We efficiently approximate light transport through direct estimation or spherical basis functions. Compared to advanced physics-based renderers, DIB-R++ is highly performant due to its compact and expressive shading model, enabling integration with learning frameworks for geometry, reflectance, and lighting prediction without requiring ground-truth. Our experiments demonstrate superior material and lighting disentanglement compared to existing rasterization-based approaches and showcase applications such as material editing and relighting.
