This paper introduces a challenging real-world problem in power networks that can be effectively addressed using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The increasing emphasis on decarbonisation is straining power distribution networks, and active voltage control is seen as a promising solution to alleviate congestion and enhance voltage quality without requiring additional hardware investment. The presence of numerous controllable devices, such as rooftop photovoltaics (PVs) and static var compensators (SVCs), distributed across a wide geographic area makes MARL a natural choice for this problem. The paper formulates the active voltage control issue within the Dec-POMDP framework and establishes an open-source environment. The objective is to foster collaboration between the power and MARL communities and drive the adoption of MARL algorithms in real-world applications. Additionally, the paper examines the unique characteristics of active voltage control problems that pose challenges, such as interpretability, for existing MARL approaches, and suggests potential directions for future research.
