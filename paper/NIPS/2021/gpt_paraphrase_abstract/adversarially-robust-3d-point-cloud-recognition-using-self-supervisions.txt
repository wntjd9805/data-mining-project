This paper investigates the impact of different self-supervised learning tasks on the robustness of 3D deep learning models against adversarial attacks in applications like autonomous driving. The study focuses on three types of 3D architectures: MLP-based (PointNet), convolution-based (DGCNN), and transformer-based (PCT). The authors conducted extensive experiments and found that employing self-supervision techniques can greatly enhance the robustness of 3D point cloud recognition, surpassing the standard adversarial training approach. The analysis highlights the importance of local feature learning in limiting the propagation of adversarial perturbations, which explains the success of DGCNN and the jigsaw proxy task in improving 3D adversarial robustness.
