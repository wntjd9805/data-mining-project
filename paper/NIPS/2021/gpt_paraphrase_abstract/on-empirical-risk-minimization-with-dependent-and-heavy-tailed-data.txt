This study introduces risk bounds for Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) with dependent and heavy-tailed data-generating processes. The analysis expands on previous works that focused on ERM with heavy-tailed but independent and identically distributed observations, by considering the case of strictly stationary exponentially Î²-mixing data. The analysis involves controlling the multiplier process that arises from the interaction between the noise and function evaluations on inputs. This approach accommodates even polynomially heavy-tailed interactions, which encompasses a broader range of heavy-tailed models than what has been previously analyzed in learning theory literature. The study showcases the results by establishing convergence rates for the high-dimensional linear regression problem using dependent and heavy-tailed data.
