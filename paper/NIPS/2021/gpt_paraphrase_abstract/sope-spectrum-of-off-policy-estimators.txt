Many decision-making problems require evaluating a new policy using past data collected under a different policy. Trajectory based importance sampling (IS) is a common technique for unbiased estimation, but it suffers from high variance. State-action visitation distribution based importance sampling (SIS) has emerged as an alternative with lower variance, but it can lead to biased estimates due to challenges in estimating state-action distribution ratios. This paper introduces a new perspective on the bias-variance trade-off and presents a spectrum of estimators ranging from SIS to IS. Additionally, a spectrum for doubly-robust and weighted versions of these estimators is established. Empirical evidence demonstrates that estimators within this spectrum can effectively balance the bias and variance of IS and SIS, resulting in lower mean-squared error compared to both techniques.
