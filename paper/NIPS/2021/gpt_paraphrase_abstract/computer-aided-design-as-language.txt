Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software is widely used in manufacturing various objects, but it requires extensive training to master. One challenging aspect of CAD is creating precise 2D sketches for constructing 3D models. To address this, we propose a machine learning model that can automatically generate these sketches. This advancement could lead to the development of intelligent tools that assist engineers in creating better designs more efficiently. Our method combines a general-purpose language model with a standard data serialization protocol, allowing for greater control over the generation process. We also explore additional features to enhance the flexibility of our approach. Our experiments demonstrate that our model performs well in generating sketches, both unconditionally and through image-to-sketch translation.
