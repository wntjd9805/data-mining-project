This study focuses on hypergraphs, which are used to represent complex relationships between objects. The researchers introduce a new heat diffusion process specific to hypergraphs and utilize it to develop an algorithm that can effectively identify bipartite components in hypergraphs. The algorithm is proven to perform well theoretically and is compared to the existing state-of-the-art through extensive experimentation on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that the new algorithm consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art across various hypergraphs.
