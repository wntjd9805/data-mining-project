Latent variable models are commonly used in the analysis of neural population recordings to summarize the activity of large groups of neurons. However, existing methods either lack scalability or struggle with limited data. To address this, we have developed a scalable Bayesian version of Gaussian process factor analysis (bGPFA) that incorporates prior knowledge and encourages smoothness over time. We have also introduced a novel variational inference strategy that allows for the analysis of continuous recordings without trial structure. Applying bGPFA to primate motor and somatosensory cortices during a self-paced reaching task, we have discovered that neural activity progresses from an initial state to a preparatory state before movement onset, and the distance between these states predicts reaction times. bGPFA has also revealed slow timescales of several seconds that contain additional information about reaction time and potentially reflect task engagement fluctuations.
