Sharing forecasts of network timeseries data, such as cellular or electricity load patterns, can enhance various independent control applications like traffic scheduling and power generation. Currently, forecasts are created without considering the objective of downstream controllers, resulting in optimization solely for mean prediction error. However, these task-agnostic representations are often too large for transmission over a communication network and fail to emphasize important temporal features for collaborative control. This study proposes a solution to learn concise and highly-compressed forecasts that are co-designed with the objective of a modular controller. Through simulations using real cellular, Internet-of-Things (IoT), and electricity load data, we demonstrate that our approach can improve the performance of a model predictive controller by at least 25%, while transmitting only 20% of the data compared to the competing method. Additionally, we provide theoretical compression results for a networked version of the classical linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control problem.
