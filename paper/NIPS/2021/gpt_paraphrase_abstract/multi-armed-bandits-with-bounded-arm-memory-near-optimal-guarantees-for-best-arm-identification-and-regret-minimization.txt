We examine the Stochastic Multi-armed Bandit problem with bounded arm-memory. In this scenario, arms are received sequentially, and there is a limit to the number of arms that can be stored in memory at any given time. The decision-maker is only able to pull arms that are currently stored in memory. We approach the problem with two main objectives: 1) minimizing regret, and 2) identifying the best arm. In terms of regret minimization, we provide a solution that offers a nearly optimal guarantee, demonstrating a cumulative regret of at least Ω(T 2/3) on average for single-pass algorithms when the arm-memory size is (n − 1), where n represents the total number of arms. For best-arm identification, we present an (ε, δ)-PAC algorithm with an arm-memory size of O(log∗ n) and an optimal sample complexity of O(nδ).
