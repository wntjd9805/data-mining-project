We present an algorithm that maximizes a monotone, submodular function while satisfying a cardinality constraint on a set of size n. Our algorithm achieves the best known empirical performance and theoretical properties in terms of adaptivity, query complexity, and approximation ratio. With high probability, our algorithm has a query complexity of O(n), adaptivity of O(log(n)), and an approximation ratio close to 1 - 1/e. The algorithm consists of two components. The first component, LINEARSEQ, is a preprocessing algorithm that reduces the query complexity of other algorithms. We also show that a variant of LINEARSEQ has a smaller adaptive complexity than any previous algorithm. The second component is a parallelizable thresholding procedure called THRESHOLDSEQ. Our main algorithm outperforms the previous state-of-the-art algorithm, FAST, in terms of runtime, adaptive rounds, total queries, and objective values, based on an evaluation with six submodular objective functions.
