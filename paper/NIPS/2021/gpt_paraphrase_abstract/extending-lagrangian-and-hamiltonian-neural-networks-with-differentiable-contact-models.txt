In order to effectively learn dynamics from data, it is important to incorporate appropriate inductive bias. Previous research has focused on enforcing energy conservation in learned dynamics by incorporating Lagrangian or Hamiltonian dynamics into neural network architecture. However, these approaches are limited because they are based on differential equations, which cannot account for discontinuities in states that arise from contacts and collisions in physical systems like legged robots and robotic manipulators. This paper introduces a novel differentiable contact model that can accurately capture contact mechanics including frictionless/frictional and elastic/inelastic behavior. Additionally, this model can accommodate inequality constraints such as joint angle limits. By incorporating this contact model, the scope of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian neural networks is expanded to allow simultaneous learning of contact and system properties. The effectiveness of this framework is demonstrated through experiments on various challenging 2D and 3D physical systems with different coefficients of restitution and friction. The learned dynamics can be utilized as a differentiable physics simulator for optimization tasks that involve planning and control, enabling downstream gradient-based optimization.
