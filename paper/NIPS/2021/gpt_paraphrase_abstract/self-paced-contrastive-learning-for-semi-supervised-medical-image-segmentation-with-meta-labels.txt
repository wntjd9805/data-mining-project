Contrastive pre-training on unlabeled data has been proven to enhance recognition models' performance in tasks like image classification. However, in fields like medical imaging, acquiring unlabeled data is difficult and costly. This study focuses on medical image segmentation and introduces a method that utilizes meta-label annotations, such as the location of a 2D slice in a 3D MRI scan, which are readily available during the acquisition process. These meta-labels are used for pre-training the image encoder and in a semi-supervised learning step that utilizes a smaller set of annotated data. To further enhance the learning process and distinguish useful labels from noise, a self-paced learning strategy is proposed. Experimental results on five medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the performance of models trained on limited scans, surpasses previous contrastive and semi-supervised methods, and achieves comparable performance to models trained on the complete dataset.
