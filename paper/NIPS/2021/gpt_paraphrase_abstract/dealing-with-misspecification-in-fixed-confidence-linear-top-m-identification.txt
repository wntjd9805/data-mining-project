We examine the problem of identifying the m arms with the highest means while maintaining a fixed error rate (known as fixed-confidence Top-m identification) in misspecified linear bandit models. This problem is relevant in fields like medicine and recommendation systems, where linear models are commonly used despite data not always conforming to linearity. We establish a lower bound on the sample complexity of any algorithm that can achieve δ-correctness in the general Top-m identification problem, demonstrating the importance of understanding the deviation scale from linearity. We introduce a practical algorithm that adjusts to the level of misspecification and provide an upper bound on its sample complexity, confirming its adaptivity and matching the lower bound as δ approaches zero. We evaluate our algorithm using both synthetic and real-world data and find that it performs competitively compared to existing methods.
