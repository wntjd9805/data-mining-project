The in-memory algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) have been successful for fast high-recall search. However, they are costly when dealing with large databases. Therefore, there is a growing demand for hybrid ANNS solutions that use small memory and inexpensive solid-state drives (SSD). This study introduces a straightforward but effective memory-disk hybrid indexing and search system called SPANN, which follows the inverted index methodology. SPANN stores centroid points in memory and large posting lists on the disk, ensuring low latency and high recall by minimizing disk access and retrieving high-quality posting lists. In the index-building stage, a hierarchical balanced clustering algorithm is used to balance posting list length and augment the list by adding points from the corresponding clusters. In the search stage, a query-aware scheme is employed to dynamically prune unnecessary access to posting lists. Experimental results show that SPANN is twice as fast as the state-of-the-art ANNS solution DiskANN, achieving the same recall quality of 90% with the same memory cost in three billion-scale datasets. It can achieve recall rates of 90% at positions 1 and 10 in just around one millisecond, with only approximately 10% of the original memory cost.
