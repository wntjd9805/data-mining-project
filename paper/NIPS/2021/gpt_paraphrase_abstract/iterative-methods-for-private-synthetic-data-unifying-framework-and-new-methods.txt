We investigate the generation of private synthetic data for query release. Our objective is to create a protected version of a sensitive dataset that satisfies differential privacy and maintains the accuracy of statistical query responses. We propose a comprehensive algorithmic framework that unifies various iterative algorithms previously studied. Within this framework, we introduce two novel methods.The first method, called generative networks with the exponential mechanism (GEM), addresses computational limitations in existing algorithms like MWEM. GEM optimizes generative models, parameterized by neural networks, to efficiently capture diverse distributions and enable rapid gradient-based optimization.The second method, private entropy projection (PEP), can be seen as an enhanced version of MWEM that intelligently reuses previous query measurements to enhance accuracy. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that both GEM and PEP outperform existing algorithms.Furthermore, we show that GEM effectively incorporates prior information from publicly available data, overcoming the limitations of PMWPub, the current state-of-the-art method that also utilizes public data.
