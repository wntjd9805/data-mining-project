We investigate the problem of minimizing power consumption in systems with multiple power-saving states in an online setting. The objective is to select the most suitable power-saving state during idle periods, which have unknown durations, taking into account the energy consumption and wake-up costs associated with each state. To address this problem, we propose a novel online algorithm that incorporates learning and utilizes predicted idle period lengths, which may be imprecise. Our algorithm performs close to optimally when the predictions are accurate and adapts gracefully as the prediction error increases. It provides a worst-case guarantee that is nearly identical to the optimal classical online algorithm for this problem. A crucial aspect of our approach is a new algorithm for the online ski rental problem in the learning augmented setting, which exhibits strong correlation with the prediction error. We validate our theoretical findings through experiments.
