Accurate and reliable epidemic forecasting is a crucial issue for public health planning and disease prevention. However, existing epidemic forecasting models often neglect uncertainty quantification, leading to inaccurate predictions. Recent advancements in deep neural models for uncertainty-aware time-series forecasting have certain limitations, such as difficulties in specifying appropriate priors in Bayesian neural networks and the computational expense of methods like deep ensembling. To address these challenges, we propose the use of neural functional processes. Our approach, called EPIFNP, models epidemic time-series using a probabilistic generative process and directly captures the probability distribution of forecast values in a non-parametric manner. EPIFNP employs a dynamic stochastic correlation graph to model the correlations between sequences and incorporates various stochastic latent variables to capture functional uncertainty from different perspectives. Our experiments in real-time flu forecasting demonstrate that EPIFNP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy and calibration metrics, achieving improvements of up to 2.5 times in accuracy and 2.4 times in calibration. Additionally, EPIFNP allows for interpretable forecasts by learning the relationships between the current season and similar patterns in historical seasons. Beyond epidemic forecasting, EPIFNP is valuable for advancing uncertainty quantification in deep sequential models for predictive analytics.
