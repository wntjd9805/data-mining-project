Current methods for unsupervised object discovery (UOD) are not efficient enough for large datasets and often require compromises in performance. We present a new approach to UOD that treats it as a ranking problem, allowing us to leverage distributed methods for eigenvalue problems and link analysis. By utilizing self-supervised features, we also introduce the first fully unsupervised pipeline for UOD that is effective. Extensive experiments on COCO and OpenImages demonstrate that our Large-scale Object Discovery (LOD) approach is comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods for medium-scale datasets (up to 120K images), and outperforms other algorithms capable of scaling up to 1.7M images by over 37%. In the multi-object discovery setting, LOD achieves an average precision (AP) that is over 14% better than all other methods for datasets ranging from 20K to 1.7M images. Furthermore, utilizing self-supervised features allows our method to achieve state-of-the-art UOD performance on the OpenImages dataset. Figure 1 showcases sample UOD results obtained by LOD on the OpenImages dataset, with ground-truth boxes shown in yellow and predictions in red.
