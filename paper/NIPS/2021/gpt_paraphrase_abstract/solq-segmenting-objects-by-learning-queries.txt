This paper presents a comprehensive framework for instance segmentation called SOLQ. Inspired by DETR, our approach utilizes unified queries to segment objects. Each query represents an object and includes information about its class, location, and mask. These queries are trained to simultaneously perform classification, box regression, and mask encoding. During training, the mask vectors are supervised by compressing the raw spatial masks. During inference, the mask vectors can be easily transformed back into spatial masks. Experimental results demonstrate that SOLQ achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms existing methods. Additionally, the joint learning of unified query representation significantly enhances the detection performance of DETR. We hope that SOLQ can serve as a strong foundation for Transformer-based instance segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/megvii-research/SOLQ.
