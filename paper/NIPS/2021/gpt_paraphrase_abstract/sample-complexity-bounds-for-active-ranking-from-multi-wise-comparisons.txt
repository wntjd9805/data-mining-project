This study focuses on determining the number of comparisons required to actively rank a set of n items using multi-wise comparisons. Multi-wise comparisons involve comparing multiple items at once and obtaining feedback on either the best item or the order of the items. The research examines two ranking problems: selecting the top-k items and obtaining a full ranking. Unlike previous studies, this paper does not rely on any specific model or assumption and considers scenarios where each comparison has a probability of returning the correct result. The goal is to determine whether using multi-wise comparisons can reduce the sample complexity compared to pairwise comparisons. The findings show that, under the winner feedback setting, the sample complexity for top-k selection can be reduced by a factor of m, and for full ranking by a factor of log m. Under the full-ranking feedback setting, the sample complexity for top-k selection can be reduced by a factor of m, and for full ranking by a factor of m log m. Numerical simulations are also conducted to validate the theoretical results.
