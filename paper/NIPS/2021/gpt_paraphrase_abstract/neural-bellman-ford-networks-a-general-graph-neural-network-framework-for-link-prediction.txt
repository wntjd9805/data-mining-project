This paper introduces a novel approach to link prediction on graphs using a representation learning framework based on paths. The representation of a node pair is defined as the sum of all path representations between the nodes, with each path representation being the product of edge representations in the path. The proposed path formulation can be efficiently solved using a generalized Bellman-Ford algorithm. To enhance the path formulation, the authors propose the Neural Bellman-Ford Network (NBFNet), a graph neural network framework that solves the path formulation using learned operators. The NBFNet consists of three neural components: INDICATOR, MESSAGE, and AGGREGATE functions, which correspond to the boundary condition, multiplication operator, and summation operator respectively. The NBFNet can be applied to both homogeneous and multi-relational graphs in both transductive and inductive settings. Experimental results on different types of graphs demonstrate that the NBFNet outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results.
