Efforts to model distributions over manifolds in the natural sciences have been ongoing. Previous work has aimed to create machine learning models that can learn such distributions, but these models often fail to consider the symmetries inherent in the manifold. In this study, we establish the theoretical basis for learning symmetry-invariant distributions on any type of manifold using equivariant manifold flows. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach by successfully learning invariant SU(n) densities inspired by quantum field theory and by addressing bias in a meteor impact dataset.
