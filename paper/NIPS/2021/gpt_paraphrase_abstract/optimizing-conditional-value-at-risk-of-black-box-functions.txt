This paper introduces two Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms, namely CV-UCB and CV-TS, which aim to maximize the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of a black-box function. The algorithms are developed based on the principles of optimism in the face of uncertainty and Thompson sampling, respectively. The upper confidence bound of CVaR is derived for CV-UCB, and the no-regret guarantee is proven by establishing a connection between CVaR and value-at-risk (VaR). For CV-TS, bounding its Bayesian regret is challenging due to the lack of a tail expectation bound for the distribution of CVaR in the existing literature. The performance of both algorithms is evaluated through empirical experiments on synthetic benchmark functions and simulated real-world optimization problems.
