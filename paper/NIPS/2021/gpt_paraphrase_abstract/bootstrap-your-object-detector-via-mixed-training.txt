We present MixTraining, a novel training approach for object detection that enhances the performance of existing detectors without any additional cost. MixTraining improves data augmentation by incorporating augmentations of different strengths while excluding strong augmentations that may hinder training for certain samples. It also addresses localization noise and missing labels in human annotations by integrating pseudo boxes, which compensate for these errors. These capabilities are achieved through bootstrapping on the detector, enabling the prediction of training difficulty with strong augmentations and generating reliable pseudo boxes due to the neural network's resilience to labeling errors. MixTraining consistently enhances the performance of various detectors on the COCO dataset. For instance, Faster R-CNN with a ResNet-50 backbone achieves an improved mean average precision (mAP) of 44.0 compared to the original 41.7 mAP, while Cascade-RCNN with a Swin-Small backbone achieves an increased mAP of 52.8 compared to the initial 50.9 mAP.
