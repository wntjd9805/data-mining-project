Current methods for forecasting time-series using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) focus on providing point estimates, which are inadequate in critical domains where uncertainty estimates are also necessary. Existing approaches for quantifying uncertainty in RNN-based time-series forecasts have limitations such as requiring significant changes to the architecture, being computationally complex, difficult to calibrate, having high sample complexity, and lacking theoretical validity guarantees for the uncertainty intervals. In this study, we enhance the inductive conformal prediction framework for time-series forecasting and propose a lightweight procedure for estimating uncertainty to overcome these limitations. Our approach offers uncertainty intervals with theoretical guarantees on frequentist coverage for any multi-horizon predictor and dataset, without relying on extensive assumptions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our conformal forecasting framework by comparing it with existing methods on various synthetic and real-world datasets.
