Recent research on iterative voting has introduced the concept of the additive dynamic price of anarchy (ADPoA), which measures the difference in social welfare between truthful and worst-case equilibrium outcomes resulting from strategic manipulation. While previous studies have shown that iterative plurality returns alternatives with at most one less initial vote than the truthful winner, the impact on agents' welfare in equilibrium is not well understood. In this study, we separate agents' utility from their manipulation mechanism and calculate the ADPoA of iterative plurality in both worst-case and average-case scenarios. Our analysis reveals that the worst-case ADPoA increases linearly with the number of agents. However, to counteract this negative finding, we investigate the average-case ADPoA and find that equilibrium winners consistently have a significant welfare advantage over the truthful winner on average. This suggests that strategic manipulation has the potential to increase social welfare.
