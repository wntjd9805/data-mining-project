This paper introduces MobTCast, a context-aware network for predicting human mobility. The sparsity of mobility data makes it challenging to predict future place-of-interests (POIs). The proposed model incorporates four types of context: temporal, semantic, social, and geographical. A base mobility feature extractor is designed using the Transformer architecture, considering both the history POI sequence and semantic information. A self-attention module is used to model the influence of social context based on the user's social connections. Additionally, a location prediction branch is introduced as an auxiliary task to capture the geographical context and predict the next location. A consistency loss is designed to improve the performance of POI prediction by minimizing the geographical distance between the predicted POI and the predicted location. Experimental results demonstrate that MobTCast outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in predicting the next POI. This study emphasizes the importance of incorporating different types of context in next POI prediction.
