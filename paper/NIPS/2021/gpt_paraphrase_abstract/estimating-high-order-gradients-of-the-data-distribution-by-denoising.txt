Denoising score matching is a useful method for estimating the first order derivative of a data density in various applications. However, estimating higher order derivatives using automatic differentiation can be error-prone and computationally expensive in high dimensional scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a new approach to directly estimate high order derivatives from data samples. By interpreting denoising score matching as a variant of Tweedie's formula and leveraging higher order moments, we extend the method to estimate higher order derivatives. Our empirical results demonstrate that models trained with this approach can efficiently and accurately approximate second order derivatives compared to automatic differentiation. Additionally, we show that our models can also be used to quantify uncertainty in denoising and enhance the mixing speed of Langevin dynamics for sampling synthetic data and natural images.
