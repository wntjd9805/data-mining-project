We introduce Online Meta-Adaptive Control (OMAC), an online multi-task learning approach for adaptive nonlinear control. The objective is to control a nonlinear system facing adversarial disturbance and unknown environment-dependent nonlinear dynamics, assuming that the environment-dependent dynamics can be effectively captured using a shared representation. Our motivation comes from robot control, where a robotic system must quickly adapt to new environmental conditions. Our main focus is to combine online representation learning with established control theory methods to create a unified framework that provides both control-theoretic and learning-theoretic guarantees. We present different instantiations of our approach, resulting in the first non-asymptotic end-to-end convergence guarantee for multi-task nonlinear control. OMAC can also be integrated with deep representation learning. Experimental results demonstrate that OMAC outperforms traditional adaptive control approaches that do not incorporate shared representation learning in tasks such as inverted pendulum and 6-DoF drone control with varying wind conditions.
