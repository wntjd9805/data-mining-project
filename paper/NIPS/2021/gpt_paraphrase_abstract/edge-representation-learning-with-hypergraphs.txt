Graph neural networks have made significant progress in representing graph-structured data by focusing on node embedding and graph pooling. However, little attention has been given to accurately representing the edges of a graph, which are important for tasks such as graph reconstruction, generation, and classification. In this study, we propose a novel edge representation learning framework called Dual Hypergraph Transformation (DHT). This framework transforms edges into nodes of a hypergraph, allowing us to apply message-passing techniques for node representations to edges. By clustering or dropping edges, we obtain holistic graph-level edge representations. Our method outperforms existing graph representation learning methods in terms of graph representation and generation performance. Additionally, our edge representation learning and pooling method surpasses state-of-the-art graph pooling methods in graph classification due to its accurate edge representation and efficient message-passing.
