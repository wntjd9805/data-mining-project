We introduce a novel algorithm for solving the approximate near neighbor problem by combining classical group testing concepts with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH). Our approach transforms the near neighbor search problem into a group testing problem, where neighbors are labeled as "positives," non-neighbors as "negatives," and approximate membership queries as group tests. We implement this framework using distance-sensitive Bloom Filters to Identify Near-Neighbor Groups (FLINNG). We demonstrate that FLINNG achieves sub-linear query time and offers several practical advantages. Notably, FLINNG can be constructed in a single pass through the data, relies solely on efficient integer operations, and eliminates the need for distance calculations. We perform extensive experiments on large-scale high-dimensional search tasks, including genome search, URL similarity search, and embedding search using the YFCC100M dataset. In comparison to leading algorithms such as HNSW and FAISS, FLINNG achieves query speedups of up to 10 times, while requiring significantly less indexing time and memory.
