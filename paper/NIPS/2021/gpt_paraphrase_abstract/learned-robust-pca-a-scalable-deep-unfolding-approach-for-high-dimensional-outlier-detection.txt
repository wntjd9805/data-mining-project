We propose a new method called Learned Robust PCA (LRPCA) for detecting outliers in low-rank matrix reconstruction. LRPCA is a scalable and learnable non-convex approach that achieves high efficiency. Its parameters can be effectively learned through deep unfolding. We extend deep unfolding to infinite iterations using a novel feedforward-recurrent-mixed neural network model. We establish the recovery guarantee of LRPCA under mild assumptions for RPCA. Numerical experiments demonstrate that LRPCA outperforms state-of-the-art RPCA algorithms, such as ScaledGD and AltProj, on both synthetic datasets and real-world applications.
