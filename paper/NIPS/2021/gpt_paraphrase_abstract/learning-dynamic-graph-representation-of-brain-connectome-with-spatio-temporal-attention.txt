Functional connectivity (FC) in the brain can be measured using functional neuroimaging techniques to assess the level of correlation between different brain regions. Graph-based approaches have been used to analyze the brain connectome, which is the network formed by these connectivities. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained attention for learning the representation of the brain connectome. However, existing methods using GNNs often fail to incorporate the dynamic nature of the FC network, which changes over time. Some studies that have attempted to use dynamic FC as input for GNNs have reported reduced performance compared to static FC methods and lack temporal explainability. In this study, we introduce STAGIN, a method for learning dynamic graph representation of the brain connectome with spatio-temporal attention. STAGIN takes a temporal sequence of brain graphs as input and uses novel READOUT functions and a Transformer encoder to provide spatial and temporal explainability with attention. Our experiments on the HCP-Rest and HCP-Task datasets demonstrate the exceptional performance of our proposed method. Furthermore, the analysis of the spatio-temporal attention aligns with existing neuroscientific knowledge, validating our approach.
