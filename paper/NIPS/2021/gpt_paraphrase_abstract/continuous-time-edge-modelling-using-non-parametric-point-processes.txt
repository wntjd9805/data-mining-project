The mutually-exciting Hawkes process (ME-HP) is commonly used to model reciprocity in continuous-time edge data. However, current implementations of ME-HP have limitations in terms of flexibility and efficiency. The exogenous rate functions are typically constant and the endogenous rate functions are specified parametrically, which limits their adaptability. Additionally, inference methods for ME-HP often involve computationally expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. To overcome these limitations, we propose three non-parametric point process models for continuous-time edge modelling (CTEM). These models utilize sigmoidal Gaussian processes to generate intensity functions, offering greater flexibility than parametric forms. We employ a novel edge modelling construction and a fast variational inference method to implement the CTEM models. Extensive evaluations on real-world continuous-time edge data sets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed models.
