This study introduces LowRankGAN, a method that enables more precise control of image generation in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Unlike previous approaches that analyze statistical information from synthesized data, LowRankGAN uses low-rank factorization and the Jacobian matrix to relate the latent space to specific image regions. This approach has three notable advantages. Firstly, it provides a low-dimensional representation of attribute manifolds, improving the precision and controllability of image editing. Secondly, it yields a null space of attributes that only affects the outer region of interest, allowing for local image editing without spatial masks. Lastly, LowRankGAN can effectively analyze local regions from one image and generalize well to other images. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art GAN models demonstrate the effectiveness of LowRankGAN.
