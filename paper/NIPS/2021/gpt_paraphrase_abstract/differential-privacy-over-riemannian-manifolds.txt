We explore the issue of releasing a differentially private statistical summary on a Riemannian manifold. We propose a modified version of the Laplace or K-norm mechanism that incorporates intrinsic distances and volumes on the manifold. We focus on the case where the summary is the Fr√©chet mean of data on the manifold. Our mechanism is proven to be rate optimal and dependent solely on the manifold's dimension, rather than any ambient space. We emphasize the negative impact of disregarding the manifold structure on the utility of the sanitized summary. We provide two examples in statistics, namely the space of symmetric positive definite matrices for covariance matrices and the sphere for modeling discrete distributions, to demonstrate our framework.
