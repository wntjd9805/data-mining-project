Density estimation, or modeling distributions of covariates, is a fundamental challenge in unsupervised learning. However, current approaches mainly focus on the joint distribution, which is not very practical. A more useful problem is arbitrary conditional density estimation, which involves modeling any possible conditional distribution based on prior knowledge. We propose a new method called Arbitrary Conditioning with Energy (ACE) that can estimate the conditional distribution for all possible subsets of unobserved features, given the observed features. ACE avoids unnecessary bias and complexity by using an expressive energy function to specify densities and learning one-dimensional conditionals. This approach is simpler and more effective than previous methods, as demonstrated by its state-of-the-art performance in arbitrary conditional likelihood estimation and data imputation on standard benchmarks.
