The world generated an estimated 59ZB (5.9 Ã— 1013GB) of data in 2020, leading to significant costs in data storage and transmission. However, recent advancements in deep generative models have introduced neural compression algorithms, surpassing traditional codecs in compression ratio. Despite its limited bandwidth, neural compression lacks commercial interest, necessitating the development of efficient frameworks. This paper explores lossless compression using normalizing flows, known for their ability to achieve high compression ratios. The paper introduces iFlow, a novel method for efficient lossless compression. iFlow incorporates the Modular Scale Transform (MST) and a new family of numerically invertible flow transformations based on MST. Additionally, the paper introduces the UniformBase Conversion System (UBCS), a fast uniform-distribution codec integrated into iFlow for efficient compression. iFlow outperforms other high-performance schemes, achieving state-of-the-art compression ratios and being five times faster. Moreover, the techniques presented in this paper can accelerate coding time for various flow-based algorithms.
