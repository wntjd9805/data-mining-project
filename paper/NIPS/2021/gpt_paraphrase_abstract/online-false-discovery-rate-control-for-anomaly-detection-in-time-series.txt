This article introduces new guidelines for controlling the false discovery rate (FDRC) in online anomaly detection for time series data. Online FDRC rules enable the control of statistical test sequences. In anomaly detection, the null hypothesis assumes that an observation is normal, while the alternative hypothesis suggests it is anomalous. The proposed FDRC rules allow users to specify a minimum level of precision in unsupervised scenarios. These methods address limitations of previous FDRC rules in anomaly detection, especially in maintaining high power even when the alternative hypothesis is extremely rare (common in anomaly detection) and when the test statistics are serially dependent (common in time series data). The validity of these rules is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and experimental results.
