Many applications involve multi-type event data, where understanding the complex relationships and influences between events is crucial for discovering useful knowledge and predicting future events. However, existing methods either ignore or only partially consider these influences. Recent works have used recurrent neural networks to model event rates, but they often treat all temporal dependencies as a black-box, making it difficult to extract meaningful knowledge. Additionally, most methods assume a simplistic exponential decay of influence strength, which can miss important patterns in the strength variation.To address these limitations, we propose SPRITE, a Self-adaptable Point Process with nonparametric Time Decays. SPRITE can decouple the influences between pairs of events and capture various time decays of influence strengths. We represent each event type using an embedding and model the event influence as an unknown function of the embeddings and time span. Our approach can cover all possible time-decaying functions by using Gaussian process priors and Gauss-Legendre quadrature to estimate the integral in the construction. This flexibility allows us to estimate different types of time-decaying influences without imposing strict constraints or encountering learning difficulties.We develop an efficient stochastic variational learning algorithm using weight space augmentation of Gaussian processes. Through an ablation study and real-world applications, we demonstrate the advantages of our approach.
