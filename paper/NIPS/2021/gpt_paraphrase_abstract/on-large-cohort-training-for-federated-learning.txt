This study examines the impact of cohort size on the quality of learned models and training dynamics in federated learning. It addresses three key questions: the challenges of scaling federated learning to larger cohorts, the relationship between cohort sizes in federated learning and batch sizes in centralized learning, and the design of effective federated learning methods for larger cohorts. The study provides partial answers through extensive empirical evaluation, highlighting challenges such as generalization issues, diminishing returns, catastrophic training failures, and fairness concerns. These challenges are both analogous to large-batch training issues and unique to federated learning.
