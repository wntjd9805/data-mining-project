Spatial verification is an important technique for retrieving specific objects. It uses spatial information to accurately detect true positive images. However, existing methods for expanding and diffusing queries are not effective at propagating spatial information in a normal graph with scalar edge weights, resulting in low recall or precision. To address these issues, we propose a new framework based on hypergraphs that efficiently propagates spatial information during query time and accurately retrieves objects from the database. Additionally, we suggest using the structure information of the image graph through a community selection technique. This helps measure the accuracy of the initial search result and provides correct starting points for hypergraph propagation without requiring extensive spatial verification computations. Experimental results on ROxford and RParis datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing query expansion and diffusion methods.
