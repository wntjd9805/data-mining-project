Multipartite ranking is a fundamental task in machine learning, typically evaluated using the Area Under the receiver operating characteristics Curve (AUC). However, in certain scenarios, a low False Positive Rate (FPR) is more important than overall performance. To address this, we introduce a new metric called True Positive Rate (TPR) at a given FPR, denoted as TPR@FPR. Unfortunately, optimizing TPR@FPR directly faces two challenges: the objective function is not differentiable, making gradient backpropagation impossible, and the loss function cannot be expressed as a sum of independent instance-wise terms, making mini-batch optimization unfeasible. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework called Cross-Batch Approximation for Multipartite Ranking (CBA-MR) built on top of the deep learning framework. To address the first challenge, we introduce a differentiable surrogate optimization problem where instances with a short-term effect on FPR are assigned different weights based on the random walk hypothesis. To tackle the second challenge, we propose a fast ranking estimation method that replaces full-batch loss evaluation with a delayed update scheme using an embedding cache. We provide experimental results on four real-world benchmarks to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
