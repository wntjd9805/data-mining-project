We investigate the problem of fitting Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) to data in ReLU regression. This task is easily solvable when the data is accurate, but becomes computationally challenging when there is adversarial label noise. Our focus is on ReLU regression in the Massart noise model, where labels are generated based on a function but can be altered by an adversary with a probability of at most 1/2. We propose an efficient algorithm that achieves precise parameter recovery in this model, given mild anti-concentration assumptions on the distribution. These assumptions are necessary for information-theoretically possible exact recovery. Our algorithm outperforms `1 and `2 regression methods on both synthetic and real data.
