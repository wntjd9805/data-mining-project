We present a novel approach to the continual learning problem using dynamic programming and a two-player sequential game framework. One player maximizes the cost of lack of generalization, while the other player minimizes the cost of catastrophic forgetting. We establish that a stable balance point exists between the two players for each task, and this balance is maintained once achieved. Furthermore, we introduce balanced continual learning (BCL) as a method to achieve this balance, and our empirical results demonstrate that BCL performs comparably or better than current state-of-the-art approaches.
