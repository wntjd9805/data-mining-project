The Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) is a kernel-based statistic used to assess the dependence between two multivariate variables. However, it cannot be directly applied to cluster-correlated data, which is common in situations like family-based and longitudinal data. To address this, we propose a new HSIC-based independence test specifically designed for cluster-correlated data. Our test statistic is based on the empirical HSIC and we determine its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis of independence, considering sample correlation. Through simulation studies and real data analysis, we demonstrate that our approach effectively controls type I error and has higher statistical power compared to other methods when dealing with clustered data.
