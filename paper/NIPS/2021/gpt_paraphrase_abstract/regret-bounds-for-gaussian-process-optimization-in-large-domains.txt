This paper aims to analyze Gaussian-Process optimization in scenarios where the function domain is much larger than the number of feasible function evaluations, making it impossible to find the global optimum. It presents upper bounds on the suboptimality (Bayesian simple regret) of the solution obtained through optimization strategies related to widely used algorithms like expected improvement (EI) and upper confidence bound (UCB). These bounds shed light on the relationship between the number of evaluations, the size of the domain, and the optimality of the retrieved function value. The study demonstrates that even with a limited number of evaluations, it is possible to find significant function values that achieve a certain ratio with the optimal value.
