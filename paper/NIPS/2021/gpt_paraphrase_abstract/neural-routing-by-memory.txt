This study introduces a new approach to improve the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by utilizing parallel procedures and assigning similar intermediate features to specialized procedures. This approach alleviates the learning difficulty of each procedure and leads to better performance. The proposed method involves a routing-by-memory mechanism where parallel Procedural Units (PUs) are introduced in each stage of the network. Each PU consists of a memory head and a procedure, with the memory head maintaining a summary of a specific type of features. By searching for the closest memory for each intermediate feature and forwarding it to the corresponding procedure, different procedures are tailored to different features, resulting in improved performance. The proposed mechanism can be efficiently trained using a four-step training strategy. Experimental results demonstrate that this method enhances the accuracies of popular CNN architectures, such as VGGNet, ResNet, and EfficientNet, on various benchmark datasets without significantly increasing computational cost.
