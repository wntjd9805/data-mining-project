This paper introduces a novel approach called Sparse Steerable Convolution (SS-Conv) to overcome the computational limitations of steerable convolution in 3D semantic analysis. By leveraging sparse tensors, SS-Conv significantly speeds up the computation while maintaining the SE(3)-equivariance property. The authors propose a pipeline for accurate object pose estimation, which incorporates a Feature-Steering module to efficiently refine poses. Experimental results on various 3D object analysis tasks demonstrate the superiority of SS-Conv over existing methods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The code for SS-Conv is publicly available at https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/SS-Conv.
