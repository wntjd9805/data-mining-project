This paper focuses on studying the Combinatorial Pure Exploration problem with the Bottleneck reward function (CPE-B) in both the fixed-confidence (FC) and fixed-budget (FB) settings. CPE-B involves finding the optimal super arm with the maximum bottleneck value, which is the minimum expected reward of the base arms contained in the super arm. Existing studies on CPE cannot effectively address the challenges posed by CPE-B, so we develop new techniques to tackle them. In the FC setting, we propose novel algorithms that have optimal sample complexity for a wide range of instances and establish a lower bound to demonstrate their optimality. In the FB setting, we design an algorithm that achieves a state-of-the-art error probability guarantee and is efficient for fixed-budget path instances. Our experimental results validate the superior performance of our proposed algorithms compared to existing approaches on various instances.
