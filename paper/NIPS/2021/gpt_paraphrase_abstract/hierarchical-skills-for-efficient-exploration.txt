This study examines the balance between generality and specificity in skill design for reinforcement learning. While pre-training low-level skills can aid exploration, knowledge of the downstream task is necessary. Previous work in continuous control has not explicitly addressed the sensitivity of methods to this trade-off. To address this, the authors propose a hierarchical skill learning framework that acquires skills of varying complexity in an unsupervised manner. They also introduce a three-layered hierarchical learning algorithm to automatically balance between general and specific skills for different tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods for end-to-end hierarchical reinforcement learning and unsupervised skill discovery.
