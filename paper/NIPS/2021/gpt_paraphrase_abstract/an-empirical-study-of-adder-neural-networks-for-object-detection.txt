Adder neural networks (AdderNets) have shown impressive results in image classification by using only addition operations, which are more energy-efficient than traditional convolutional neural networks that rely on multiplications. This paper focuses on the application of AdderNets in object detection, which is crucial for real-world scenarios like autonomous driving and face detection where reducing energy consumption is a priority. The authors conduct an empirical study and find that the batch normalization statistics in the pre-trained adder backbone should not be frozen due to the relatively large feature variance of AdderNets. Additionally, they propose the inclusion of more shortcut connections in the neck part and introduce a new feature fusion architecture to address the issue of sparse features in adder layers. Through extensive experiments, the authors explore various design choices for adder detectors. The performance of the proposed Adder FCOS is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods on COCO and PASCAL VOC benchmarks. The results show that Adder FCOS achieves a 37.8% AP on the COCO validation set, demonstrating comparable performance to convolutional models while reducing energy consumption by approximately 1.4 times.
