Partition-based methods are commonly used in extreme multi-label classification (XMC) problems because they can handle large output spaces. However, current methods divide the label space into exclusive clusters, which is not ideal when labels have multiple meanings. This paper aims to address this issue by proposing a non-exclusive clustering approach that can disentangle multi-modal labels for XMC tasks. The authors formulate the label assignment problem as an optimization task to maximize precision rates. They introduce an efficient algorithm to form flexible and overlapping label clusters, and a method that optimizes both cluster assignments and model parameters for partition-based XMC. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach, achieving state-of-the-art results on four XMC benchmarks.
