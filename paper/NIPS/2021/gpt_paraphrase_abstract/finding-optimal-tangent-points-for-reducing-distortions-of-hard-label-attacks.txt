This paper introduces Tangent Attack (TA), a novel geometric-based approach for black-box adversarial attacks. The problem of high query complexity in hard-label attack settings, where only the top-1 predicted label is available, is addressed. TA identifies an optimal tangent point on a virtual hemisphere located on the decision boundary to minimize distortion in the attack. The method assumes a locally flat decision boundary and proves that reaching the decision boundary along the tangent line passing through the tangent point in each iteration can achieve the minimum distortion. To enhance robustness, a generalized method is proposed using a semi-ellipsoid to adapt to curved decision boundaries. The approach does not require pre-training and achieves low-magnitude distortion with a small number of queries, as demonstrated through extensive experiments on the ImageNet and CIFAR-10 datasets.
