We present a universal framework for creating regret minimization algorithms in the Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) model. By ensuring certain properties, our framework achieves minimax optimal regret. Our approach utilizes a novel technique called implicit finite-horizon approximation, which approximates the SSP model without explicit implementation. Using this framework, we introduce two new algorithms. The first algorithm is model-free and achieves minimax optimal regret with strictly positive costs, making it the first of its kind. The second algorithm is model-based and achieves minimax optimal regret even with zero-cost state-action pairs, matching the best result from a previous study. Notably, both algorithms have highly sparse updates, making them computationally efficient compared to existing algorithms. Additionally, both algorithms can be implemented without any parameter tuning.
