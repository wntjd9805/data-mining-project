We propose a new method called Conditional Score-based Diffusion models for Imputation (CSDI) for imputing missing values in time series data. This method utilizes score-based diffusion models that have shown superior performance in tasks like image generation and audio synthesis. Unlike existing approaches, CSDI explicitly trains a conditional diffusion model for imputation, allowing it to leverage correlations between observed values. On healthcare and environmental data, CSDI outperforms existing probabilistic imputation methods by 40-65% on performance metrics. Additionally, CSDI's deterministic imputation reduces error by 5-20% compared to state-of-the-art methods. CSDI can also be used for time series interpolation and probabilistic forecasting, where it performs competitively with existing methods. The code for CSDI is available at https://github.com/ermongroup/CSDI.
