We investigate the issue of active pure exploration in stochastic bandit environments, where the learner aims to provide a confident answer about the environment while minimizing the number of samples taken. By examining lower bounds on expected sample complexity, we identify the optimal proportion of arm draws that an Oracle algorithm would use. These proportions can inform the development of efficient learning algorithms, although their tractability depends on the environment's structural properties. We propose the Frank-Wolfe-based Sampling (FWS) algorithm, which matches the lower bounds for a broad range of pure exploration problems. FWS is computationally efficient, utilizing a single iteration of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm to determine the optimal proportion of arm draws. We apply FWS to various pure exploration tasks and find that it performs competitively against state-of-the-art algorithms.
