The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has opened up possibilities for personalized online education on home devices using machine teaching (MT) algorithms. This is particularly relevant during the COVID-19 pandemic when in-person education is not possible. However, iterative machine teaching (IMT), a popular and practical MT approach, is not feasible on IoT devices due to its inefficient and unscalable algorithms. IMT involves providing examples to learners based on their progress, but the current algorithms require traversing the entire training set in each iteration, which is computationally expensive. To address this issue, we propose a new teaching framework called Locality Sensitive Teaching (LST) that utilizes locality sensitive sampling. LST has a near-constant time complexity, significantly outperforming the existing baseline. It achieves speedups of up to 425.12x and energy savings of 99.76% compared to IMT, making it the first algorithm suitable for energy and time-efficient machine teaching on IoT devices. LST's efficiency and scalability make it applicable in real-world education scenarios.
