3D object detection is crucial in safety-critical robotics applications like autonomous driving, with a focus on the impact of detections on the ego-agent's behavior and safety. However, current detection metrics based on box Intersection-over-Union (IoU) do not consider the spatio-temporal relationship between objects and the ego-agent. To address this, we propose a new egocentric measure called Support Distance Error (SDE). Our analysis shows that SDE is limited by the coarse geometry of bounding boxes. To improve SDE, we suggest representing objects as amodal star-shaped polygons and introduce the StarPoly model for predicting such contours. Our experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that SDE better reflects the impact of detection quality on the ego-agent's safety compared to IoU, and the estimated contours from StarPoly consistently enhance egocentric detection quality over recent 3D object detectors.
