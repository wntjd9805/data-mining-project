Program synthesis from examples aims to find a computer program that matches a given set of input-output examples. While most learning-based approaches focus on finding a program that satisfies all examples simultaneously, our approach breaks the problem into two stages. First, we identify programs that satisfy individual examples, and then we leverage these per-example solutions to generate a program that satisfies all examples. To achieve this, we introduce the CrossAggregator neural network module, which utilizes a multi-head attention mechanism to combine the cues from the per-example solutions and synthesize a global solution. Our evaluation, conducted on programs of varying lengths and under different experimental settings, demonstrates that our technique significantly improves the success rate compared to PCCoder and other ablation baselines when given the same time budget.
