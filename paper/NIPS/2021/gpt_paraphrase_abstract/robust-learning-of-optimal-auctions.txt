We investigate the problem of learning the most profitable auctions for multiple bidders when the valuations provided by the bidders may be corrupted or perturbed. We establish strict upper bounds on the revenue attainable using corrupted distributions under a population model, considering both regular valuation distributions and those with a monotone hazard rate. We propose novel algorithms that can learn a mechanism with nearly optimal revenue for all "true distributions" that are close to the original distribution in Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, based solely on an "approximate distribution" of bidder valuations. These algorithms extend beyond previous research on bounded distributions and guarantee obtaining a fraction of the optimal revenue under the true distribution, with the fraction being 1 − O(α) when distributions are monotone hazard rate and 1 − O(α) when distributions are regular. We establish lower bounds that demonstrate these upper bounds cannot be improved. Additionally, we provide sample complexity upper bounds for learning an auction that is near-optimal for both monotone hazard rate and regular distributions.
