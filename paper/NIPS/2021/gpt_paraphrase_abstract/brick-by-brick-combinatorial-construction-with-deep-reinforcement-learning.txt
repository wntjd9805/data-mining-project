We present a new approach called combinatorial construction to solve problems in a combinatorial space that involve complex constraints and a large number of possible combinations. In this approach, a building agent uses LEGO bricks to sequentially assemble a target object, following fixed connection rules and avoiding brick overlaps. Instead of providing the agent with exact volumetric information, we give it incomplete knowledge in the form of 2D images of the target. This requires the agent to understand partial information and plan ahead to add bricks in the correct sequence. We use reinforcement learning to train the agent. However, the large action space and the presence of many invalid actions that would result in brick overlaps pose challenges. To address this, our model, Brick-by-Brick, incorporates an action validity prediction network to filter out invalid actions for an actor-critic network. Our experiments demonstrate that our method can successfully construct unseen objects based on a single image or multiple views of the target object.
