This study explores why modern neural-network-based graph generative models struggle to replicate common characteristics found in real-world networks, such as high triangle density. The focus is on edge independent random graph models, where each edge is added independently with a certain probability. This includes well-known models like Erdös-Rényi and stochastic block models, as well as newer models like NetGAN, variational graph autoencoders, and CELL. The researchers demonstrate that these edge independent models have inherent limitations in generating graphs with high triangle density and other subgraph densities, unless a bounded overlap condition is met to prevent them from simply memorizing a single graph. However, the study also presents a simple generative model that strikes a balance between overlap and accuracy, and performs comparably to more complex models in reconstructing various graph statistics.
