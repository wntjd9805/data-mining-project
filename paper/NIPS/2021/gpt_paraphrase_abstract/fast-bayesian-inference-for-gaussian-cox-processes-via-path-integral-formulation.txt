This paper presents a new Bayesian inference scheme for Gaussian Cox processes, a popular type of point process models. The proposed scheme utilizes a path integral formulation, which is easy to understand conceptually. Unlike other existing methods, our scheme does not require domain discretization and has a linear scalability with the number of observed events. It also has a lower complexity compared to state-of-the-art variational Bayesian schemes in terms of the number of inducing points. Furthermore, our scheme can be applied to various types of Gaussian Cox processes with different link functions. It particularly excels in the multi-dimensional input setting, where the number of inducing points is typically large. The effectiveness of our scheme is demonstrated through evaluations on both synthetic and real-world data, showing comparable predictive accuracy while being significantly faster than reference methods.
