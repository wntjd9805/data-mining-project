Transformer has become popular for solving vehicle routing problems (VRPs), but its positional encoding (PE) method is not effective for representing VRP solutions. This paper introduces a new approach called Dual-Aspect Collaborative Transformer (DACT) that separately learns embeddings for node and positional features, avoiding potential noise and incompatible correlations. Additionally, a novel cyclic positional encoding (CPE) method is used to capture the circularity and symmetry of VRP solutions. DACT is trained using Proximal Policy Optimization and a curriculum learning strategy for improved sample efficiency. DACT is applied to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) and outperforms existing Transformer-based models, demonstrating better generalization performance across different problem sizes.
