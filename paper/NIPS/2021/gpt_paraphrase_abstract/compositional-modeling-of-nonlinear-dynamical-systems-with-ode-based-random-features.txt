Effectively modeling highly nonlinear dynamical systems and accurately quantifying uncertainty is a difficult task that often requires problem-specific techniques. We propose a new approach to address this challenge by using compositions of physics-informed random features derived from ordinary differential equations. Our model architecture builds upon recent advancements in approximate inference for deep Gaussian processes, incorporating layer-wise weight-space approximations for incorporating random Fourier features and stochastic variational inference for approximate Bayesian inference. Our experiments demonstrate that our model successfully captures highly nonlinear behavior in real-world multivariate time series data. Additionally, we find that our approach performs comparably to several other probabilistic models on standard regression tasks.
