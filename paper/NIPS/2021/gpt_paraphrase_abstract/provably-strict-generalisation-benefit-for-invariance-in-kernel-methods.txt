Enforcing invariance is believed to improve generalisation, but its theoretical benefit has only recently been established. This study builds on previous work to demonstrate a significant generalisation benefit in kernel ridge regression when the target is invariant to a compact group. By enforcing invariance through feature averaging, the study finds that generalisation is determined by an effective dimension resulting from the interaction between the kernel and the group. Additionally, the study discovers that the group's action leads to an orthogonal decomposition of both the reproducing kernel Hilbert space and its kernel, which may have independent significance.
