We propose a solution to the issue of sequential prediction with expert advice in a non-stationary environment. Our solution guarantees long-term memory, as defined by Bousquet and Warmuth. By introducing a linear-time algorithm, we improve upon the current regret bounds. Our algorithm includes a relative entropy projection step, which offers advantages over previous weight-sharing methods. This is particularly beneficial when weight updates have implicit costs, such as in portfolio optimization. Additionally, we provide a linear-time algorithm to compute the projection step, which may be of separate significance.
