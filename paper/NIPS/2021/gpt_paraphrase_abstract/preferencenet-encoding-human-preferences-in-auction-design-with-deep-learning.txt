The design of optimal auctions is a problem that interests economists, game theorists, and computer scientists. Despite years of effort, there are still no known auction designs that are both strategyproof and revenue-maximizing, except in specific scenarios. However, recent advancements in deep learning have shown promise in approximating optimal auctions, surpassing strong baselines and recovering known solutions. Apart from maximizing revenue, auction mechanisms may also aim to incorporate socially desirable constraints like fair allocation or diversity. However, these notions lack standardization and universally accepted definitions. This paper introduces PreferenceNet, an extension of neural-network-based auction mechanisms that encode constraints using exemplars of desirable allocations, which can be provided by humans. Furthermore, a new metric is proposed to evaluate an auction's adherence to socially desirable constraints. The effectiveness of PreferenceNet is demonstrated by comparing it to current state-of-the-art neural-network-based auction designs. Human subject research validates the proposed approach's ability to capture real human preferences. The code for PreferenceNet is available on GitHub.
