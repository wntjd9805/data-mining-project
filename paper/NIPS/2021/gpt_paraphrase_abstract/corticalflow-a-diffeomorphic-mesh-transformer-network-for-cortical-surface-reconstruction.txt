We present CorticalFlow, a novel geometric deep-learning model that uses a 3-dimensional image to deform a reference template towards a specific object. To maintain the template mesh's topological properties, we train the model with diffeomorphic transformations. Our implementation of a flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) framework has a small GPU memory footprint and can generate surfaces with hundreds of thousands of vertices. We also introduce numeric conditions to improve the manifoldness of the predicted triangle mesh and reduce topological errors. CorticalFlow outperforms current state-of-the-art methods by producing superior surfaces in a fraction of the computation time. Furthermore, it ensures the generation of anatomically plausible surfaces, addressing a major limitation in clinical relevance for surface reconstruction methods.
