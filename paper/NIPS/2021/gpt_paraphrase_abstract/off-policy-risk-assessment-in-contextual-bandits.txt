This paper introduces a framework called Off-Policy Risk Assessment (OPRA) that allows practitioners to evaluate prospective policies using previously logged data. While most existing research focuses on expected reward, this framework considers a broad class of objectives called Lipschitz risk functionals, which includes conditional value-at-risk, variance, mean-variance, distorted risks, and CPT risks. OPRA estimates the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a target policy and generates plugin estimates for any Lipschitz risk, providing finite sample guarantees. The framework is instantiated with both importance sampling and doubly robust estimators. The paper also presents the first uniform concentration inequalities for CDF estimators in contextual bandits and error bounds on Lipschitz risk estimates, which converge at a rate of O(1/âˆšn).
