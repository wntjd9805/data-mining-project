We investigate Bayesian automated mechanism design in unstructured dynamic environments, where a principal repeatedly interacts with an agent and makes decisions based on the agent's report of the current state of the world. Both the principal and the agent have arbitrary and potentially different valuations for the actions taken, which may also depend on the actual state of the world. Additionally, the state of the world can change arbitrarily based on the principal's actions. The objective is to determine an optimal mechanism that maximizes the principal's utility in the presence of a self-interested agent. We propose an efficient algorithm for computing optimal mechanisms, with or without payments, under different individual-rationality constraints when the time horizon is constant. Our algorithm is based on a sophisticated linear program formulation that can be customized to accommodate various constraints. We also demonstrate that approximating the principal's optimal utility is difficult within a certain constant factor for environments with large time horizons. Moreover, we address a special case where the agent is myopic and provide a refined algorithm with linear time complexity. In our full paper, we prove that memoryless mechanisms, which are optimal in Markov decision processes without strategic behavior, are not suitable for our problem in terms of both optimality and computational tractability. Additionally, we present experimental results on synthetic dynamic environments with different characteristics, which serve as proof of concept for our algorithms and reveal interesting phenomena in dynamic mechanism design.
