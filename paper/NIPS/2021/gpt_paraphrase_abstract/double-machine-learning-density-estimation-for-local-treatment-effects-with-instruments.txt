In this study, we focus on estimating the density of the local treatment effect, which provides more information than just the average treatment effect. We propose two methods for estimating this density: kernel-smoothing and model-based approaches. The kernel-smoothing approach uses smooth kernel functions to estimate the density, while the model-based approach projects it onto a finite-dimensional density class. Both approaches utilize double/debiased machine learning-based estimators. We also examine the convergence rates of the estimators and demonstrate their robustness to biases in nuisance function estimation. We apply these methods to synthetic and real datasets, such as the 401(k) dataset.
