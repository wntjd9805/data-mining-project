We investigate solution techniques for convex-concave Saddle-Point Problems (SPPs) in centralized and decentralized network architectures. Assuming similarity in local functions across nodes, we establish lower complexity bounds for a wide range of algorithms addressing the SPP. For master/worker networks, we demonstrate that a given suboptimality level can be achieved in a certain number of communication rounds, which depends on the similarity of local functions, the strong convexity constant, and the network diameter. In decentralized mesh networks, the lower bound on communication complexity is determined by the eigengap of the gossip matrix used for neighbor communication. We propose algorithms that match these lower bounds for both types of networks, with only logarithmic deviations. We evaluate the effectiveness of these algorithms in a robust regression problem.
