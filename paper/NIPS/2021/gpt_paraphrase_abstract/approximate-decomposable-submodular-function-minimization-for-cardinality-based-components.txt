We present techniques for efficiently minimizing a sum of submodular functions with limited support, which is a specific case of general submodular function minimization. This problem is commonly encountered in machine learning applications. We focus on instances where the sum components are cardinality-based, meaning they depend solely on the size of the input set. This variant is widely used in practice, including energy functions in image segmentation and generalized hypergraph cut functions. To address this problem, we propose the first approximation algorithms that can be computed quickly by reducing it to a sparse graph cut problem. The sparsity of the graph can be adjusted to control the desired approximation factor. Our approach leverages the connection between sparse graph reduction techniques and piecewise linear approximations to concave functions. This technique significantly improves both theoretical runtimes and practical performance in various tasks such as image segmentation and hypergraph clustering.
