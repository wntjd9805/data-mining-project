Secure multi-party computation (MPC) enables private data to be used for computations, making it valuable for machine learning applications. However, the lack of software frameworks that cater to the needs of machine learning researchers and engineers has hindered the widespread adoption of secure MPC. To address this, we introduce CRYPTEN, a software framework that offers popular secure MPC primitives through abstractions commonly used in modern machine learning frameworks. Our paper outlines the design of CRYPTEN and evaluates its performance on various machine learning models. Our benchmarks demonstrate that CRYPTEN, with its GPU support and efficient communication between multiple parties, allows for secure evaluation of modern machine learning models under a semi-honest threat model. For instance, using CRYPTEN, two parties can securely predict phonemes in speech recordings faster than real-time using Wav2Letter. We believe that CRYPTEN will encourage the adoption of secure MPC within the machine learning community.
