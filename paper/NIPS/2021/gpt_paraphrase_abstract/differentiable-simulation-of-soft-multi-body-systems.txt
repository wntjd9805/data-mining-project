We introduce a method that allows for the simulation of soft articulated bodies in a differentiable manner. This approach enables the incorporation of differentiable physical dynamics into gradient-based pipelines. Our method involves the development of a matrix assembly algorithm and the establishment of a generalized dry friction model for soft continuum using a novel matrix splitting strategy. Furthermore, we present a differentiable control framework that can be applied to soft articulated bodies controlled by muscles, joint torques, or pneumatic tubes. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our approach leads to more stable and realistic simulations compared to other frameworks. Additionally, our method significantly speeds up the solution of system identification problems and facilitates efficient gradient-based learning of motion control with soft robots.
