Controllable text generation involves generating text with specific attributes and editing existing text to have desired attributes. Previous research has focused on these tasks separately, resulting in biased text generation. This paper proposes a principled causal perspective to address these issues, using a unified framework. By treating the tasks as interventional and counterfactual causal inference, the paper leverages causality tools to mitigate biases and enhance control. The framework is applied to a practical scenario where confounding factors are only observable in a small portion of the data. Experimental results demonstrate that the causal approach outperforms previous conditional models in terms of control accuracy and bias reduction.
