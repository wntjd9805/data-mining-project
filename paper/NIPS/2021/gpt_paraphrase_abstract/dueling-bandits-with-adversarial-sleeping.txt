We introduce a new problem called sleeping dueling bandits with stochastic preferences and adversarial availabilities (DB-SPAA). This problem arises in situations where the decision space changes over time, such as in retail store management, online shopping, restaurant recommendation, and search engine optimization. Surprisingly, the aspect of "sleeping" in dueling bandits has not been studied before. In this problem, the goal is to compete with the best option by sequentially gathering feedback on pairs of items. The challenge lies in the fact that the availability of items can change every round, making it difficult to find the best available item at each round. We establish a lower bound for DB-SPAA, indicating that it is more difficult than the classical multi-armed bandit problem. We propose two algorithms that have near-optimal performance guarantees and validate our results through empirical experiments.
