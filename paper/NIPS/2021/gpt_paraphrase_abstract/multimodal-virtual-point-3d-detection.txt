Current Lidar sensors used in autonomous vehicles are not as advanced as traditional color cameras in terms of resolution and cost. This can be problematic as Lidar sensors may not accurately detect far-away or small objects, which can pose driving hazards. On the other hand, RGB sensors can effectively detect these objects. In this study, we propose a method to combine RGB sensors with Lidar-based 3D recognition. Our approach utilizes 2D detections to generate dense 3D virtual points, which can be integrated into standard Lidar-based detectors. The resulting multi-modal detector is simple and effective. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly improves detection performance compared to existing fusion approaches.
