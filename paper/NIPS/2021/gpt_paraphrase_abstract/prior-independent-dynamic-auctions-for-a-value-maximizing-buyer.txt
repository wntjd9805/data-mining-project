We examine the design of dynamic auctions with production costs for a buyer who seeks to maximize value while considering return on investment. This is a growing trend due to the rise of automatic bidding algorithms in advertising platforms. Unlike a buyer who maximizes utility, a value-maximizing buyer aims to maximize total value within a ROI constraint. Our main finding is a dynamic mechanism with a regret of approximately O(T^(2/3)), where T represents the time horizon. This mechanism is compared to the first-best benchmark, which is the maximum revenue the seller can generate assuming all buyer values are publicly known.
