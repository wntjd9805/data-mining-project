This study focuses on public goods games, which examine the incentives for individuals to make contributions that benefit society as a whole. The goal is to maximize a desired property in these games. Existing algorithms for this problem are not optimal and cannot consider criteria other than social welfare. To address this, the researchers propose a method that directly utilizes the connection between equilibria and the Maximal Independent Set (mIS) structural property of graphs. They create a Markov Decision Process that generates an mIS and use a planning method to search for equilibria, outperforming existing approaches. Additionally, they develop a graph imitation learning technique that uses demonstrations to train a graph neural network policy, which quickly generalizes to new game instances. Evaluation results demonstrate that this policy performs at 99.5% of the planning method's level while being significantly faster to evaluate. The methods presented can be applied to various public goods games and other graph combinatorial optimization problems.
