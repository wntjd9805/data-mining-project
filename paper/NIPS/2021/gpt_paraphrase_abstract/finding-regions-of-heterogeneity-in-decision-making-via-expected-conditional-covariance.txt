Individuals often differ in their decision-making due to personal preferences and backgrounds. This study introduces an algorithm that identifies contexts with high disagreement among decision-makers. The algorithm approaches this as a causal inference problem, aiming to find a region where the choice of decision-maker significantly affects the decision outcome. By maximizing an empirical objective, the algorithm identifies this region and provides a generalization bound for its performance. In experiments, the algorithm accurately identifies the region of disagreement compared to other methods. Additionally, when applied to healthcare datasets, the algorithm uncovers variations that align with existing clinical knowledge.
