This study examines the issue of performing a series of optimal interventions in a dynamic causal system where the target variable and inputs change over time. This problem is relevant in various fields such as system biology and operational research. Dynamic Causal Bayesian Optimization (DCBO) combines concepts from sequential decision making, causal inference, and Gaussian process emulation. DCBO is particularly useful when all causal effects in a graph are time-varying. At each time step, DCBO identifies a locally optimal intervention by integrating observational and past intervention data collected from the system. The paper provides theoretical findings on transferring intervention information across time steps and introduces a dynamic causal Gaussian process (GP) model that quantifies uncertainty and determines optimal interventions in practical scenarios. The effectiveness of DCBO is demonstrated through its ability to identify optimal interventions more quickly than alternative approaches in various settings and applications.
