Compared to image classification models, there has been limited research on black-box adversarial attacks against video classification models. This is likely due to the additional challenges posed by the temporal dimension in estimating gradients. Query-efficient black-box attacks aim to maximize the probability of misclassifying the target video by effectively estimating gradients. In this study, we propose a novel iterative algorithm called GEO-TRAP (Geometric TRAnsformed Perturbations) to attack video classification models. GEO-TRAP utilizes geometric transformations to parameterize the temporal structure of the search space, reducing the search space for effective gradients. By searching for a small group of parameters that define these transformations, we achieve a structured search space. Surprisingly, our algorithm generates successful perturbations with significantly fewer queries. For instance, adversarial examples generated with GEO-TRAP require 73.55% fewer queries compared to the current state-of-the-art method for video adversarial attacks on the widely used Jester dataset. Overall, our algorithm exposes vulnerabilities in various video classification models and achieves new state-of-the-art results under black-box settings on two large datasets.
