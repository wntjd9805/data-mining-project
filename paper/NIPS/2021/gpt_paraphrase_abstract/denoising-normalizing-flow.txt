The abstract discusses the limitations of normalizing flows (NF) as density estimation methods for real-world data sets that exist on or near low-dimensional manifolds. To address this challenge, the authors propose a new method called Denoising Normalizing Flow (DNF) that estimates the density on the low-dimensional manifold while also learning the manifold itself. The DNF operates in three steps: inflating the manifold to make it diffeomorphic to the entire data-space, learning an NF on the inflated manifold, and learning a denoising mapping similar to denoising autoencoders. Unlike other methods, the DNF relies on a single cost function and does not require alternating between density estimation and manifold learning phases. The authors demonstrate that the DNF can learn meaningful low-dimensional representations from naturalistic images and generate high-quality samples.
