Query embedding (QE) has been successful in enabling multi-hop reasoning over knowledge graphs by embedding entities and first-order logical (FOL) queries in low-dimensional spaces. The use of geometric shapes to represent entities and queries has emerged as a promising approach, as it allows for the natural representation of query answer sets and logical relationships. However, existing geometry-based models face challenges in handling queries with negation, limiting their practicality. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel query embedding model called Cone Embeddings (ConE), which is the first geometry-based QE model capable of handling all FOL operations, including conjunction, disjunction, and negation. ConE represents entities and queries as Cartesian products of two-dimensional cones, where the intersection and union of cones correspond to conjunction and disjunction operations, respectively. Additionally, we introduce geometric complement operators in the embedding space to model negation operations, leveraging the property that the closure of the complement of cones remains as cones. Experimental results demonstrate that ConE outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. The answer format output is limited to abstract information.
