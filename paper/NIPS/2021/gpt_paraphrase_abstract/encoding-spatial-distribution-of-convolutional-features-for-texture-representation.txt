This study addresses the limitation of global average pooling (GAP) in capturing complex spatial patterns in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), particularly in texture-oriented applications. The proposed solution is Fractal Encoding (FE), a feature encoding module based on multi-fractal geometry. FE characterizes the spatial layout of CNN feature maps by analyzing the multi-scale power behavior of points within the maps. This enables the CNN to encode the regularity of spatial arrangement, resulting in a robust and discriminative spectrum descriptor. FE is adaptable to data and can be easily integrated into existing CNNs for end-to-end training. The effectiveness of FE is demonstrated through its application in ResNet-based texture classification and retrieval tasks on benchmark datasets.
