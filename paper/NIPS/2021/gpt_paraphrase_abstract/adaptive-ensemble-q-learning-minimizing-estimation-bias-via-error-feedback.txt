The ensemble method is a promising solution to address overestimation in Q-learning by using multiple function approximators. The accuracy of the estimation depends on the ensemble size, which is challenging to determine due to the changing nature of approximation errors during learning. To overcome this challenge, we propose upper and lower bounds on the estimation bias to guide the selection of the ensemble size. Based on these findings, we suggest combining the ensemble method with Model Identification Adaptive Control (MIAC) for effective ensemble size adaptation. We introduce Adaptive Ensemble Q-learning (AdaEQ), which consists of two key steps: (a) characterizing approximation errors to control the ensemble size and (b) adapting the ensemble size to minimize estimation bias. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdaEQ outperforms existing methods on the MuJoCo benchmark.
