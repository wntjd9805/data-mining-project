Ensemble-based methods that address dataset bias in classifiers have shown promise in reducing reliance on specific biases. These methods utilize a bias-only model to adjust the learning target. However, the importance of the bias-only model has not been adequately addressed in previous research. This paper focuses on the bias-only model and demonstrates that inaccurate uncertainty estimations from this model can negatively impact debiasing performance. Through empirical analysis, it is shown that existing bias-only models struggle to provide accurate uncertainty estimations. As a result, this paper proposes a three-stage ensemble-based debiasing framework that includes bias modeling, model calibration, and debiasing. Experimental results on NLI and fact verification tasks consistently demonstrate that this three-stage framework outperforms the traditional two-stage approach in terms of out-of-distribution accuracy.
