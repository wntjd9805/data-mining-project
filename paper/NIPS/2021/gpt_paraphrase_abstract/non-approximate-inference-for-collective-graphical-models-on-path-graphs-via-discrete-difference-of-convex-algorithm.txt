The importance of aggregated count data, derived from multiple individuals, is growing. The Collective Graphical Model (CGM) is a probabilistic method used for analyzing aggregated data. In CGM, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference of unobserved variables given observations is crucial. However, solving the MAP inference problem for general CGMs has been proven to be NP-hard. To overcome this, an approximate solution approach has been proposed but has two main drawbacks. Firstly, the accuracy of the solution decreases when count table values are small. Secondly, the output violates integrality constraints due to continuous relaxation. To address these issues, this paper suggests a new method for MAP inference for CGMs on path graphs, based on the Difference of Convex Algorithm (DCA). The proposed algorithm efficiently calculates important subroutines using minimum convex cost flow algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method produces higher quality solutions compared to the conventional approach.
