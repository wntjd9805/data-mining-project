This study addresses the challenge of effectively controlling and predicting dynamical systems that involve both continuous-time and discrete, event-triggered processes. Stochastic hybrid systems (SHSs), widely used in engineering, offer a framework for modeling such systems with discrete state jumps and multi-modal continuous-time flows, which may also be stochastic. However, there is currently no established method for explicitly learning the discrete events and multi-mode continuous dynamics of SHSs. To address this, the authors propose Neural Hybrid Automata (NHAs), a approach for learning SHS dynamics without prior knowledge of the number of modes and inter-modal transition dynamics. NHAs utilize normalizing flows, neural differential equations, and self-supervision to infer the dynamics. The effectiveness of NHAs is demonstrated through various tasks, including mode recovery and flow learning in systems with stochastic transitions, as well as end-to-end learning of hierarchical robot controllers.
