Machine Learning (ML) offers improved solutions for combinatorial optimization (CO) problems. One popular method involves using a neural network to analyze the parameters of a given CO problem and extract useful information to guide the search for optimal solutions. However, many practical CO problems are represented in matrix form, which current neural network models cannot handle. As a result, ML engineers have been unable to address these types of CO problems. This paper introduces Matrix Encoding Network (MatNet), which efficiently processes the parameters of complex CO problems represented in matrix format. By utilizing an end-to-end model based on MatNet, we successfully solve asymmetric traveling salesman (ATSP) and flexible flow shop (FFSP) problems, marking the earliest neural approach. Notably, for a specific class of FFSP, MatNet exhibits significantly superior empirical performance compared to any known methods, whether neural or not.
