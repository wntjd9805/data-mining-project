Normalizing flows are neural networks that can invertibly map data to a high-dimensional space while maintaining tractable change-of-volume terms. However, the data of interest often exist in a low-dimensional manifold within a higher-dimensional space, leading to a modeling mismatch. Injective flows attempt to address this issue by learning distributions on manifolds, but evaluating the volume-change term becomes more difficult. Current approaches either avoid computing this term or assume prior knowledge of the manifold. In this study, we propose two methods to calculate the gradient of the volume-change term, using automatic differentiation and numerical linear algebra techniques. Our approaches enable end-to-end nonlinear manifold learning and density estimation for data projected onto the manifold. We compare our methods with existing approaches and demonstrate superior performance in accurately learning manifolds and their corresponding distributions. Additionally, we show promising results in out-of-distribution detection. Our code is publicly available for reference.
