Machine learning has been successful in solving sequential decision-making problems through supervised prediction or reinforcement learning. However, these approaches may not be effective in data-constrained offline settings where optimal behavior cannot be assumed and alternative solutions may not exist. To address this, we propose a different approach that focuses on identifying "dead-ends" in a state space. Specifically, we investigate the condition of patients in the intensive care unit, where a "medical dead-end" indicates that the patient will not survive regardless of future treatments. We introduce the concept of "treatment security," which involves avoiding treatments that have a high chance of leading to dead-ends. We present a formal proof and formulate the problem as a reinforcement learning task. We develop three deep neural models for automated state construction, dead-end discovery, and confirmation. Our experiments using real clinical data of septic patients demonstrate the existence of dead-ends and highlight discrepancies between secure treatments and those actually administered.
