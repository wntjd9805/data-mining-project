We introduce a new model smoothing mechanism called "Spatial Ensemble" that works in parallel with the popular Temporal Moving Average (TMA) method. Spatial Ensemble randomly selects a small portion of the student model and replaces the corresponding section of the teacher model, creating a unified effect. This approach achieves comparable results to TMA and when combined with it, referred to as Spatial-Temporal Smoothing, it significantly improves student-teacher learning in various methods. For instance, using the self-supervised method BYOL, it improves top-1 accuracy on ImageNet by 0.9%, and with the semi-supervised approach FixMatch, it increases top-1 accuracy on CIFAR-10 by 6% when limited training labels are available.
