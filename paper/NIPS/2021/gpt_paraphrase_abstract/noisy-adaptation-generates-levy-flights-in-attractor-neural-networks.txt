Lévy flights are random walks where step sizes follow a power-law distribution, observed in animal foraging and human cognitive functions. However, the neural mechanism behind generating Lévy flights is not well understood. This study investigates how Lévy flights can be achieved in attractor neural networks. The researchers find that noisy neural adaptation, specifically spike frequency adaptation, can generate Lévy flights in continuous attractor neural networks. The strength of adaptation determines the network's motion, with lower strength resulting in local Brownian motion and higher strength causing long-jump motion. Noises in adaptation lead to intermittent switching between these motion modes, demonstrating Lévy flight characteristics. The study is extended to a general attractor neural network, showing that the model can explain Lévy flights observed during human memory retrieval. This research aims to provide insight into the neural mechanism for optimal information processing in the brain.
