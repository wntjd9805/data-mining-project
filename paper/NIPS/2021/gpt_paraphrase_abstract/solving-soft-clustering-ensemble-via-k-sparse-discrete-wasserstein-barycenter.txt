Clustering ensemble is a significant problem in ensemble learning. Although extensively studied, existing methods suffer from issues such as high computational complexity and understanding the consensus. This paper focuses on the soft clustering ensemble problem, where individual solutions are soft clusterings. By connecting it to the discrete Wasserstein barycenter problem, we propose sampling-based algorithms with guaranteed quality. We also analyze the consensus of our model systematically. Experimental evaluations are conducted to assess our algorithms.
