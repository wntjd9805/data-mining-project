In regression analysis, there are various ways to measure uncertainty. One popular method is using the full quantile function, which allows for easy interpretation and evaluation. By predicting the true conditional quantiles for each input at different quantile levels, we can effectively represent the underlying uncertainty. However, current quantile-based methods often focus on optimizing the pinball loss, which limits the range of applicable regression models and can result in poor conditional quantiles. In this study, we propose new quantile methods that overcome these limitations. Our methods can be applied to any regression model, strike a balance between calibration and sharpness, optimize for calibration of centered intervals, and produce more accurate conditional quantiles. We conducted thorough experiments, including a task involving uncertainty quantification in nuclear fusion, to evaluate the effectiveness of our methods.
