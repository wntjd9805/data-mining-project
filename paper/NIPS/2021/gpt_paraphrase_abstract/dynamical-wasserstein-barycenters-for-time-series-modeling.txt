We propose a model called DWB that can accurately estimate the system state and data-generating distributions of pure states in time series data. This model allows for gradual transitions between discrete states, unlike previous models that assume instant transitions. DWB assumes that each pure state follows a multivariate normal distribution and characterizes transitions using Wasserstein barycenter. The system state is represented by a weight vector that evolves over time through a random walk. Parameter learning is done using the Riemannian geometry of Gaussian distributions under the Wasserstein distance, leading to faster convergence. Experiments on human activity datasets demonstrate that our DWB model effectively learns the generating distribution of pure states and improves state estimation during transition periods compared to linear interpolation mixture models.
