We address the problem of optimizing a quadratic objective function to find a sparse matrix on the Stiefel manifold, which consists of matrices with orthogonal columns of unit length. This optimization problem arises in spectral relaxations of various combinatorial problems, including graph matching, clustering, and permutation synchronization. Existing solvers for these problems do not account for sparsity while maintaining global optimality guarantees. To fill this gap, we propose a modification of the Orthogonal Iteration algorithm that promotes sparsity. Our method ensures that the resulting Stiefel matrix is globally optimal and sparse. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the task of permutation synchronization, which is relevant in computer vision and computer graphics. Our method outperforms previous approaches in this domain.
