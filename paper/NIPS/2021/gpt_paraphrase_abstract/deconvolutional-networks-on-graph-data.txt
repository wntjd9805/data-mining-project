This paper addresses the problem of reconstructing an input graph signal from smoothed graph representations using Graph Convolutional Network (GCN). To solve this inverse problem, we propose a method called Graph Deconvolutional Network (GDN). GDN is designed by combining inverse filters in the spectral domain and de-noising layers in the wavelet domain to address the issue of high frequency amplification and noise amplification during the inverse operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through tasks such as graph feature imputation and graph structure generation.
