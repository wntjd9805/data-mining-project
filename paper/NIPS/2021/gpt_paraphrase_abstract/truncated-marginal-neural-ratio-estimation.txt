Parametric stochastic simulators are widely used in scientific research, often involving numerous input parameters and a complex likelihood function. Bayesian parameter inference in such scenarios can be challenging. In this study, we propose a novel neural simulation-based inference algorithm that offers both efficient simulation and rapid empirical posterior testability, a feature not found in other modern algorithms. Our approach improves simulation efficiency by estimating low-dimensional marginal posteriors instead of the joint posterior and by generating simulations targeted towards specific observations of interest through a truncated prior distribution. Additionally, our algorithm estimates a locally amortized posterior, allowing for efficient empirical tests to assess the robustness of the inference results. These tests are crucial for gaining trust in real-world applications where the true underlying information is inaccessible. We conduct experiments on a benchmark for simulation-based inference and two complex narrow posterior distributions, demonstrating the efficiency of our algorithm in simulating the underlying process and accurately estimating the marginal posteriors. The implementation of our algorithm is available on GitHub.
