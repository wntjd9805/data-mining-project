This study presents a novel generative model called E(n) Equivariant Normalizing Flows (E-NFs), which is capable of preserving Euclidean symmetries. E-NFs are constructed by integrating discriminative E(n) graph neural networks into a differential equation, resulting in an invertible equivariant function known as a continuous-time normalizing flow. The results of our experiments demonstrate that E-NFs outperform existing methods and baselines, such as DW4 and LJ13, in terms of log-likelihood for particle systems like QM9. Notably, E-NFs are the first flow model that can jointly generate both molecule features and their positions in 3D.
