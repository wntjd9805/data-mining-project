This study explores the problem of forecasting univariate time series. Most existing methods focus on analyzing raw time series data, using either traditional statistical approaches or newer neural network-based techniques. In this research, the authors investigate whether local topological properties, specifically persistent homology, can provide additional information for accurate forecasting. They introduce a method called topological attention, which allows for the examination of local topological features within a historical data timeframe. The proposed approach can be easily integrated into existing forecasting models and demonstrates excellent performance on the extensive M4 benchmark dataset containing diverse time series from various domains. Ablation experiments and comparisons with other forecasting methods in scenarios with limited training data support the advantage of incorporating local topological information through an attention mechanism.
