To enable artificial agents to learn and solve various complex tasks in visual environments without supervision, we propose the Latent Explorer Achiever (LEXA) agent. LEXA tackles the challenges of discovering new goals and reliably achieving them by learning a world model from image inputs. It then trains an explorer and an achiever policy using imagined rollouts. Unlike previous methods, LEXA's explorer plans to uncover unseen surprising states through foresight, which serves as diverse targets for the achiever to practice. LEXA surpasses previous unsupervised goal reaching approaches in terms of performance on existing benchmarks and a new challenging benchmark with 40 test tasks spanning robotic manipulation and locomotion domains. LEXA is also capable of achieving goals that involve interacting with multiple objects in sequence. Notably, LEXA can solve tasks specified as goal images without any additional learning after the unsupervised phase.
