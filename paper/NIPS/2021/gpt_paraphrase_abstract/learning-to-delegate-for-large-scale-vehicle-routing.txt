This article introduces a new approach to solving large-scale vehicle routing problems (VRPs) by combining learning and local search techniques. Previous methods have been effective for small VRPs but struggle with larger problems. The proposed method improves the solution iteratively by identifying and delegating subproblems to a subsolver. By leveraging spatial locality, a linear number of subproblems is considered at each step instead of an exponential number. Subproblem selection is treated as a regression problem and a Transformer model is trained on a generated training set. The new method outperforms existing VRP solvers by 10x to 100x in terms of speed while still achieving competitive solution quality for VRPs ranging from 500 to 3000 in size. Learned subproblem selection also offers a 1.5x to 2x speedup compared to heuristic or random selection. The results of this study apply to various VRP distributions, variants, and solvers.
