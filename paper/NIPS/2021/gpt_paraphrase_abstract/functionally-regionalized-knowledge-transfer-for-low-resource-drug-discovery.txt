In recent times, there has been a growing interest in using machine learning methods to speed up the process of drug discovery. Two important aspects of this process are virtual screening for identifying potential hits and ADMET prediction for optimizing lead compounds. However, a major challenge faced by machine learning approaches in these tasks is the limited availability of labeled compounds with activity or ADMET properties, which hampers the development of effective predictive models. This study aims to address this issue by leveraging knowledge from previous in-vivo experiments conducted by different laboratories and targeting various proteins. To handle the diversity of these experiments and capture their similarities, the authors propose a functional rationalized meta-learning algorithm called FRML for knowledge transfer. FRML constructs a predictive model using layers of neural sub-networks or functional regions. It shares an initialization for the model weights across all experiments, while adapting it to each experiment using a region localization network that selects relevant regions. This compositional approach enhances the model's ability to generalize to different and even unfamiliar tasks. Experimental results in virtual screening and ADMET prediction demonstrate the superiority of FRML over existing methods, particularly in terms of interpretability in assay relationships.
