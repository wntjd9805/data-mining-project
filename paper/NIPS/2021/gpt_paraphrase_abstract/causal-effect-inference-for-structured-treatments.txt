We propose a method to estimate conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) for structured treatments like graphs, images, and texts. Our method, called the generalized Robinson decomposition, addresses the weak condition on the effect by isolating the causal estimand, reducing regularization bias. It allows for the use of any learning models and has a quasi-oracle convergence guarantee under mild assumptions. Through experiments with small-world and molecular graphs, we show that our approach outperforms previous methods in CATE estimation.
