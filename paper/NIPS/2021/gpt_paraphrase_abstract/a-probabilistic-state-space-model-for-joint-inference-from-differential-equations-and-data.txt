Mechanistic models that use differential equations are crucial in applying machine learning to scientific fields. However, the process of inference in these models is computationally intensive due to the repeated solving of the differential equation. The challenge lies in integrating the numerical solver with standard inference techniques. Recent advancements in probabilistic numerics have introduced a new type of solver for ordinary differential equations, which allows the solution process to be framed in Bayesian filtering terms. We demonstrate that this approach enables seamless integration with latent force models within the differential equation itself. As a result, approximate Bayesian inference can be conducted on both the latent force and the ODE solution in a single pass of an extended Kalman filter/smoother, with linear complexity equivalent to computing a single ODE solution. We showcase the effectiveness and efficiency of this algorithm by training a non-parametric SIRD model on COVID-19 outbreak data.
