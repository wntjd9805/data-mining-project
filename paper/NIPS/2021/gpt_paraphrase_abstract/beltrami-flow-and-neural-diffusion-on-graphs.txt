We introduce a new type of graph neural networks that utilize the discretized Beltrami flow, a non-Euclidean diffusion PDE. Our model incorporates positional encodings based on the graph's topology to enhance node features, which are jointly evolved by the Beltrami flow. This allows for continuous feature learning and topology evolution. The proposed model outperforms existing graph neural networks and achieves top-notch results on various benchmarks.
