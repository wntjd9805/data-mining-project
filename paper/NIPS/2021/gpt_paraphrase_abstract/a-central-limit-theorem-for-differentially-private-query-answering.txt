Differential privacy is commonly used to privately answer numerical queries by adding noise to the answer vector. The optimal noise distribution for balancing privacy and accuracy, especially in high-dimensional cases, has been extensively studied. Previous research has successfully matched upper and lower bounds with constant factors. This paper takes a new approach to address this optimization question. We first demonstrate a central limit theorem phenomenon in the high-dimensional regime, proving that a mechanism is approximately Gaussian Differentially Private if the added noise meets certain conditions. Specifically, densities proportional to e^(-k|x|^p) satisfy these conditions. Using this perspective, we apply the Cramer-Rao inequality and establish an "uncertainty principle" result: the product of the privacy parameter and the squared loss of the mechanism is lower bounded by the dimension. Additionally, the Gaussian mechanism achieves the optimal privacy-accuracy trade-off among all such noises. Our findings are supported by numerical experiments.
