This paper presents a new approach called SSUL-M (Semantic Segmentation with Unknown Label with Memory) for addressing the challenges in class-incremental semantic segmentation (CISS). Previous CISS algorithms using knowledge distillation did not fully solve the issues of catastrophic forgetting, semantic drift of the background class, and multi-label prediction. To overcome these challenges, our method combines techniques tailored for semantic segmentation. We define unknown classes within the background class to aid in learning future classes, freeze the backbone network and past classifiers using binary cross-entropy loss and pseudo-labeling to prevent catastrophic forgetting, and utilize tiny exemplar memory to improve both plasticity and stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, outperforming recent state-of-the-art baselines on benchmark datasets. Ablation analyses support our contributions, and we discuss the differences between CISS and traditional class-incremental learning for classification.
