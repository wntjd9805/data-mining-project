Generative modeling has become a significant field in machine learning. While deep polynomial neural networks (PNNs) have shown impressive results in unsupervised image generation, they have not been successful in conditional generation tasks like super-resolution. This is because existing PNNs only focus on single-variable polynomial expansions and struggle with two-variable inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework called CoPE, which allows for polynomial expansion of two input variables and captures their auto- and cross-correlations. CoPE can also be easily extended to handle more than two input variables. We evaluate CoPE in various conditional generation tasks, including class-conditional generation, inverse problems, edges-to-image translation, image-to-image translation, and attribute-guided generation. The extensive evaluation shows that CoPE is effective in handling diverse conditional generation tasks. The source code of CoPE is available at https://github.com/grigorisg9gr/polynomial_nets_for_conditional_generation.
