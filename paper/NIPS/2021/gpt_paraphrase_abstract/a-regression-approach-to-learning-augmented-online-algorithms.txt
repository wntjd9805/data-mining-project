Learning-augmented online algorithms, a growing field, utilizes machine learning techniques to enhance the performance of online algorithms by predicting future input parameters. These parameters are typically real-valued functions, making regression techniques a natural choice for making these predictions. In this paper, we introduce and explore this approach within a general online search framework that encompasses various classic problems such as ski rental, bin packing, and minimum makespan scheduling. We provide nearly optimal bounds on the sample complexity of this regression problem and extend our findings to the agnostic setting. Our technical contribution lies in incorporating online optimization benchmarks into the design of the regression problem's loss function, deviating from the conventional use of off-the-shelf regression tools with standard statistical error bounds.
