We examine the reinforcement learning problem for discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) in a tabular setting. Our proposed algorithm, UCBVI-γ, is model-based and utilizes the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle and the Bernstein-type bonus. UCBVI-γ achieves a regret of (cid:101)O(cid:0)√SAT /(1 − γ)1.5(cid:1), where S represents the number of states, A represents the number of actions, γ is the discount factor, and T is the number of steps. We also create a class of challenging MDPs and demonstrate that for any algorithm, the expected regret is at least (cid:101)Ω(cid:0)√SAT /(1 − γ)1.5(cid:1). Our upper bound aligns with the minimax lower bound, with only logarithmic factors differing, indicating that UCBVI-γ is nearly minimax optimal for discounted MDPs.
