This paper explores the use of machine-learned predictions to create competitive algorithms for online conversion problems. The objective is to improve the competitive ratio when predictions are accurate and to ensure a worst-case competitive ratio regardless of prediction quality. We propose a class of online threshold-based algorithms (OTA) that unify the design of both integral and fractional conversion problems. By incorporating predictions into the OTA design, we strike a balance between consistency and robustness. Our experiments on Bitcoin conversion demonstrate the effectiveness of OTA.
