CVaR and VaR are widely used measures of tail risk in finance, insurance, and uncertain environments with heavy-tailed distributions. In this study, we apply the multi-armed bandit framework to identify the arm with the smallest CVaR, VaR, or a combination of CVaR and mean that represents the risk-return trade-off. Our main contribution is an optimal algorithm that works with general arms, including heavy-tailed distributions, and achieves the lower bound on the expected number of samples needed. The algorithm involves solving a non-convex optimization problem in the space of probability measures. Additionally, we develop new concentration inequalities for tail-risk measures that are valid at any time.
