Our aim is to assess the precision of a black-box classification model by examining its performance across various combinations of attributes that characterize multiple test data distributions. This is particularly relevant when machine learning models are used as a service, as different clients may have different interests within the data distribution. We propose a method called Attributed Accuracy Assay (AAA), which uses Gaussian Process (GP) to estimate the accuracy surface. Each combination of attributes, or "arm," is associated with a Beta density that represents the sampled accuracy of the service. We use the GP to smooth the parameters of the Beta density across related arms to address sparsity. However, standard GP methods do not effectively handle the heteroscedastic uncertainty in a sparsely populated and unevenly distributed attribute space. To overcome this, we introduce two enhancements: pooling sparse observations and regularizing the scale parameter of the Beta densities. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that AAA is effective in accurately estimating accuracy and efficiently exploring the attribute space.
