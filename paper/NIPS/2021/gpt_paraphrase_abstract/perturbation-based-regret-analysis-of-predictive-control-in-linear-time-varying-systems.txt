In this study, we investigate predictive control in a scenario where the dynamics are linear and subject to time variations, and the costs are also time-varying and well-conditioned. The controller is provided with precise predictions of future costs, dynamics, and disturbances at each time step. We demonstrate that by having a sufficiently large prediction window, predictive control achieves input-to-state stability and a dynamic regret of $, where _< 1 is a positive constant. This represents the first dynamic regret bound for the predictive control of linear time-varying systems. Moreover, we introduce a variation of predictive control that sets the first competitive bound for controlling linear time-varying systems, achieving a ratio of 1. Our novel proof framework relies on a perturbation bound that quantifies the impact of small changes to the system parameters on the optimal trajectory.
