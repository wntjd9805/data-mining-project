Normalizing flows are a promising tool for modeling probability distributions in physical systems. However, in addition to accurately approximating distributions and energies, applications in physics require smooth energies to calculate forces and higher-order derivatives. These densities are often defined on complex topologies, such as the space of internal coordinates for peptides and small proteins. In this study, we introduce a new type of smooth mixture transformations that work on both compact intervals and hypertori. These transformations have been difficult to train bidirectionally due to the need for root-finding methods. However, we demonstrate that parameter gradients and forces of the inverses can be computed from forward evaluations using the inverse function theorem. We highlight two advantages of these smooth flows: they allow training by force matching to simulation data and can be used as potentials in molecular dynamics simulations.
