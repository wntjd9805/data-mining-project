This paper presents a non-parametric approach to modeling complex datasets using a technique inspired by kernel density estimation. The proposed model, called instance-conditioned GAN (IC-GAN), partitions the data manifold into overlapping neighborhoods and learns the distribution around each datapoint. Experimental results on ImageNet and COCO-Stuff demonstrate that IC-GAN outperforms unconditional models and unsupervised data partitioning baselines. The study also shows that IC-GAN can easily transfer to unseen datasets by changing the conditioning instances, while still generating realistic images. Additionally, the authors extend IC-GAN to the class-conditional case and achieve semantically controllable generation and competitive quantitative results on ImageNet. The code and trained models to reproduce the reported results are provided in the GitHub repository.
