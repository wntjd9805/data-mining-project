Automated decision-making tools are increasingly being used to assess individuals for high-stakes opportunities. Previous research has examined how individuals strategically respond to these tools in order to receive favorable assessments. However, this research has mainly focused on short-term interactions. In this study, we investigate interactions that span multiple time-steps, where an individual's effort investment today can impact their future rewards as well as the rewards of the decision-making institution. We analyze the Stackelberg equilibrium of this game and develop new algorithms to compute it. Our findings reveal that linear assessment policies are as effective as monotonic assessment policies in this setting. We also provide polynomial-time algorithms for determining the optimal policies for both the decision-making institution and the individual, assuming certain conditions are met. Importantly, we show that with multiple rounds of interaction, the decision-making institution is better able to incentivize the individual to accumulate effort in the desired direction. This research addresses gaps in the existing literature on the societal impacts of automated decision-making by considering longer time horizons and the compounding nature of decisions over time.
