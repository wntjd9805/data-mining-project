This study addresses the problem of partial label learning (PLL), which involves training examples that have multiple candidate labels with only one being true. Existing PLL approaches assume that incorrect labels are randomly chosen, but this is not realistic as candidate labels are instance-dependent. This paper introduces instance-dependent PLL, where each example is associated with a latent label distribution that represents the degree to which each label describes the feature. The incorrect label with a high degree is more likely to be annotated as the candidate label. The proposed method recovers the label distribution through a label enhancement process and iteratively trains the predictive model using this information. The true posterior density of the latent label distribution is modeled using an inference model, and the label distributions generated from the variational posterior are used to train the predictive model. Experimental results on benchmark and real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. The source code is available at https://github.com/palm-ml/valen.
