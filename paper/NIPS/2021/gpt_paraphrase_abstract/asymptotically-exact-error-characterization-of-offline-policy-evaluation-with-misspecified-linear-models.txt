This study focuses on the problem of offline policy evaluation (OPE) using Markov decision processes (MDPs). OPE aims to estimate the effectiveness of decision-making policies based on static datasets. While there has been significant progress in understanding OPE under (approximate) realizability assumptions, which assume that the hypothetical models accurately represent the real environments, the understanding of OPE under unrealizability is lacking. Unrealizability is important in real-world applications. To address this gap, we analyze the behavior of a simple OPE method called the linear direct method (DM) under unrealizability. This analysis allows us to characterize the OPE error accurately in a doubly robust form. Additionally, we demonstrate the nonparametric consistency of the tile-coding estimators with mild assumptions.
