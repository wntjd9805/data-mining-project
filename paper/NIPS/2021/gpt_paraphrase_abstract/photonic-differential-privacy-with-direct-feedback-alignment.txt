Optical Processing Units (OPUs) are low-power photonic chips that have been previously used to train deep neural networks with Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA), an alternative to backpropagation. In this study, we show how the inherent noise of optical random projections can be utilized to create a differentially private DFA mechanism. This means that OPUs can be used to provide private training by design. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis of our privacy mechanism, examining how the noise from optical random projections affects the process and guarantees provable Differential Privacy. Moreover, through experiments, we demonstrate that our learning procedure achieves strong performance in accomplishing the desired task.
