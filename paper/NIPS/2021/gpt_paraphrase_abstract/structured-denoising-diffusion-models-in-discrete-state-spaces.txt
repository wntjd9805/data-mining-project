In this study, we propose Discrete Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (D3PMs) as generative models for discrete data. These models extend the multinomial diffusion model by incorporating different types of corruption processes. We explore corruption with transition matrices that resemble Gaussian kernels, matrices based on nearest neighbors, and matrices with absorbing states. By selecting an appropriate transition matrix, we are able to improve the performance of our models in generating images and text. Additionally, we introduce a new loss function that combines the variational lower bound with an auxiliary cross entropy loss. Our experiments demonstrate that our models achieve strong results in character-level text generation and perform well on large vocabularies. Furthermore, on the CIFAR-10 image dataset, our models approach the sample quality and surpass the log-likelihood of continuous-space DDPM models.
