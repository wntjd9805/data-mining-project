Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for drug design by generating molecules with desired properties. However, two main challenges exist. First, existing models struggle to produce realistic and acceptable molecules. Second, optimizing the docking scores, which estimate the protein-small molecule binding affinity, is a complex task due to the presence of local optima and non-smooth surfaces in molecular structure. To address these challenges, we propose a new RL framework called FREED (Fragment-based generative RL with Explorative Experience replay for Drug design). This framework generates pharmacochemically acceptable molecules with high docking scores by constraining the molecules to a realistic chemical space and effectively exploring it using a fragment-based generation method and error-prioritized experience replay (PER). Our model performs well on both de novo and scaffold-based schemes, outperforming existing methods and achieving state-of-the-art results in terms of docking scores. Ablation studies also demonstrate that our method, FREED(PE), significantly improves model performance.
