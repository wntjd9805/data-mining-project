This study focuses on the development of world models for text-based game environments. These environments involve interactive narratives where agents interact with the world using natural language. The goal is to create a world model that can predict changes in the environment caused by the agent's actions and generate appropriate natural language actions. This is achieved by representing the world as a knowledge graph and using a transformer-based multi-task architecture with a specific loss function. The effectiveness of our methodology is demonstrated through a zero-shot ablation study on previously unseen textual worlds, which outperforms existing techniques and highlights the importance of our contributions.
