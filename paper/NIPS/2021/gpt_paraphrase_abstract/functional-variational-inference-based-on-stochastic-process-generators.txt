We propose a new approach called Functional Variational Inference (FVI) for Bayesian modeling in the space of functions. FVI minimizes the divergence between the variational distribution and the posterior process in function space. To achieve this, we use a class of flexible distributions called Stochastic Process Generators (SPGs) as the functional variational family. These distributions are designed to allow efficient estimation of the functional Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) using analytic solutions and mini-batch sampling. FVI is applicable to stochastic process priors with access to random function samples. Our experiments demonstrate that FVI consistently outperforms weight-space and function space VI methods on various tasks, confirming the effectiveness of our approach.
