Our study presents a novel approach for approximating the distribution of maximum points of a random function, also known as the argmax distribution. This method has wide applications in the field of machine learning. Instead of directly sampling from the argmax distribution, we propose optimizing a set of centroid points to effectively approximate it using a simple objective function. The argmax centroid method aims to minimize a surrogate of Wasserstein distance between the true argmax distribution and the centroid approximation, given certain conditions. We validate the utility and efficacy of our method through its successful implementation in various real-world multi-task learning scenarios, such as few-shot image classification, personalized dialogue systems, and multi-target domain adaptation.
