We examine the problem of sampling the optimal transport coupling between two distributions. While it is difficult to learn or approximate such a map for large and high-dimensional datasets, we investigate the Sinkhorn problem, which offers a regularized version of optimal transport. We propose a novel framework for learning the Sinkhorn coupling using a score-based generative model. By utilizing Langevin Dynamics and a neural network parametrization, we can sample target data based on the regularized optimal coupling. We prove convergence of gradient descent in this formulation and demonstrate its effectiveness on various optimal transport tasks.
