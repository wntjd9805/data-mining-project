We propose a new method to enhance iterative solvers for rod dynamics using graph networks (GNs). Instead of end-to-end learning, our approach ensures long-term stability and improves the accuracy of solutions. It also enhances the runtime performance of traditional iterative solvers. We evaluate our method using position-based dynamics (PBD) and elastic rods, achieving generalization across various conditions and material properties. Additionally, our approach handles discontinuous effects like rod collisions and demonstrates scalability with complex 3D tree models.
