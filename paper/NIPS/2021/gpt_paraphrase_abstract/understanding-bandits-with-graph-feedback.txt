The bandit problem with graph feedback, introduced in a previous study, involves a directed graph G = (V, E) where V represents the bandit arms and triggering an arm allows observation of its neighboring arms. The focus of this research is to examine how the graph structure influences the min-max regret. To address this, we introduce the fractional weak domination number δ∗ and the k-packing independence number as measures of upper and lower bounds for regret, respectively. We establish a connection between these two measures and the linear program of the weakly dominating set and its dual, the fractional vertex packing set. By utilizing the strong duality theorem, we prove a regret upper bound O(α log |V|) where α represents the integrality gap of the dual linear program. Our bounds are tight up to a factor of (log |V|)^3 for graphs with bounded integrality gap, including trees and graphs with bounded degree. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for certain graph families, we can achieve optimal regret without the (log |V|)^3 factor.
