Graph neural networks are commonly used in fields like computer vision, computational biology, and chemistry to analyze graph-based data. However, deep graph networks do not always outperform shallow ones due to over-smoothing. To address this issue, we propose a family of architectures inspired by numerical methods for solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) on manifolds. Our networks exhibit similar behavior to PDEs and can be analyzed accordingly. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our PDE-motivated networks can effectively handle diverse problems from various fields, achieving comparable or better results than existing approaches.
