We present a new method for attribution using Sobol indices, which incorporates Sensitivity Analysis. This approach not only models the individual contributions of image regions but also captures higher-order interactions and their influence on a neural network's prediction. To handle high-dimensional image problems, we propose a technique that efficiently computes these indices using perturbation masks and effective estimators. Significantly, our method achieves favorable scores on standard benchmarks for vision and language models while greatly reducing computation time compared to other black-box methods. It even outperforms state-of-the-art white-box methods that require access to internal representations. The code for our method is freely available on GitHub: github.com/fel-thomas/Sobol-Attribution-Method.
