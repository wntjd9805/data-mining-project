Semi-supervised semantic segmentation often performs poorly on certain categories due to limited or imbalanced data. Existing approaches neglect this issue and treat all categories equally. This paper introduces a new framework called adaptive equalization learning (AEL) to address this problem. AEL dynamically balances the training of well and poorly performing categories using a confidence bank to track category-wise performance. AEL includes three strategies: adaptive data augmentation approaches, adaptive data sampling, and a re-weighting method to reduce training noise. Experimental results show that AEL outperforms existing methods on Cityscapes and Pascal VOC benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/hzhupku/SemiSeg-AEL.
