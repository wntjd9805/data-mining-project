This paper focuses on collaborative machine learning (CML) where agents work together for a common learning task. However, in realistic settings, agents may be unwilling to share data or model information without adequate rewards. To address this issue, the authors propose a novel cosine gradient Shapley value (CGSV) method to fairly evaluate the contribution of each agent's uploaded model parameter update/gradient. Based on this evaluation, they design a training-time gradient reward mechanism that ensures fairness by adjusting the quality of the reward to match the quality of the uploaded parameter update/gradient. The authors empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of this mechanism on various benchmark datasets in terms of fairness, predictive performance, and time overhead.
