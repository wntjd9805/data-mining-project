Medical report generation is a topic of interest in research, but it requires paired image-report data which is costly and time-consuming to create. To address this issue, we propose an unsupervised model called Knowledge Graph Auto-Encoder (KGAE). KGAE utilizes a pre-constructed knowledge graph as a shared latent space to connect the visual and textual domains. The knowledge-driven encoder and decoder in KGAE can be trained independently using sets of images and reports, making it unsupervised. Experimental results demonstrate that KGAE can generate accurate medical reports without relying on paired training data. Additionally, KGAE can also be used in semi-supervised and supervised settings with paired data, and it outperforms current state-of-the-art models when fine-tuned with image-report pairs.
