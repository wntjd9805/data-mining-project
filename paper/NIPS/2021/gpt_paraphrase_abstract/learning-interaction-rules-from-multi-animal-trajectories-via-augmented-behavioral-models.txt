We propose a new framework for extracting interaction rules of biological agents from movement sequences. While Granger causality is commonly used to analyze interactions, it ignores the generative process in animal behaviors and can lead to interpretational problems. Our framework combines theory-based behavioral models with data-driven models to learn Granger causality from multi-animal trajectories. We utilize neural networks to augment incomplete multi-agent behavioral models, with theory-guided regularization for reliable modeling. This approach allows for interpretable signs of Granger-causal effects over time. Experimental results show that our method outperforms various baselines on synthetic datasets and provides novel insights when applied to datasets of mice, flies, birds, and bats.
