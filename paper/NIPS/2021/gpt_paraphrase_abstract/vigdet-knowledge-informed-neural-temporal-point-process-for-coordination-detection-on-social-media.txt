The use of coordinated accounts on social media to spread misinformation and manipulate public opinion has increased in recent years. This calls for the development of an effective method to detect coordinated groups and combat misinformation. However, existing deep learning-based coordination detectors are limited by the lack of account activity on social media, preventing them from leveraging useful prior knowledge. On the other hand, detectors that incorporate prior knowledge have limited expressive power and poor performance. To address this, we propose a coordination detection framework that combines neural temporal point process with prior knowledge such as temporal logic or pre-defined filtering functions. By modeling the observed data from social media using neural temporal point process, we learn a Gibbs distribution of group assignment based on consistency with the account embedding space and the prior knowledge. To overcome the challenge of efficiently computing and sampling from this distribution, we introduce a theoretically guaranteed variational inference approach to learn a mean-field approximation. Our experimental results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to state-of-the-art models in both unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. Additionally, we apply our model to a dataset on COVID-19 Vaccine Tweets and find evidence of suspicious coordinated efforts to spread misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines.
