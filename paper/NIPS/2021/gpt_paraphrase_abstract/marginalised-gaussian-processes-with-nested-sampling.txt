This study introduces the use of nested sampling to marginalize kernel hyperparameters in Gaussian Process models. Gaussian Process models are flexible functions that are influenced by a kernel function. The objective of learning in these models is to optimize the kernel hyperparameters using the marginal likelihood. The proposed approach of using nested sampling is suitable for exploring complex, multi-modal distributions. The study compares this approach to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on time-series and two-dimensional regression tasks. The results show that accurately quantifying hyperparameter uncertainty significantly enhances the accuracy of prediction intervals.
