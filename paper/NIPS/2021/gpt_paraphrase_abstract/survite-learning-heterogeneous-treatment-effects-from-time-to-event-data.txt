We examine the problem of inferring different treatment effects using time-to-event data. While the estimation of treatment effects for binary or continuous outcomes and the prediction of survival outcomes have been extensively studied in machine learning literature, the combination of these two problems has received less attention, despite its practical relevance. Our main objective is to accurately estimate the effects of treatments on immediate risk and survival probabilities. We focus on learning treatment-specific conditional hazard functions in discrete time. This presents unique challenges due to various covariate shift issues that go beyond the well-studied confounding and censoring biases. We analyze these challenges theoretically using generalization bounds from domain adaptation and treatment effect estimation, and discuss their implications for model design. Based on these insights, we propose a novel deep learning approach for treatment-specific hazard estimation using balanced representations. We evaluate our method in different experimental settings and empirically demonstrate its superiority over baseline methods by addressing covariate shifts from multiple sources.
