The Recurrent Explicit Duration Switching Dynamical System (RED-SDS) is a flexible model designed to identify distinct regimes and switching behavior in complex time series. It incorporates both state-dependent and time-dependent switching dynamics. State-dependent switching is achieved through a recurrent state-to-switch connection, while explicit duration counts improve time-dependent switching. An efficient inference algorithm, combining posterior approximation and exact inference, is used to train the model. The training process maximizes a Monte Carlo lower bound of the marginal log-likelihood. Empirical results on various datasets demonstrate that RED-SDS outperforms existing methods in time series segmentation and forecasting.
