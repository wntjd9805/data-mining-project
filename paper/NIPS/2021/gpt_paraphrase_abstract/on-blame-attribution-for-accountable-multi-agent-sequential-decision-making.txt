This study examines blame attribution in cooperative multi-agent sequential decision making, specifically in the context of Multi-Agent Markov Decision Processes (MMDPs). Various blame attribution methods derived from cooperative game theory are analyzed, and desirable properties of blame attribution are formalized. The relationship between these properties and the studied methods is explored. Surprisingly, well-known methods like the Shapley value are found to lack performance incentives, while others like the Banzhaf index may over-blame agents. To address these issues, a novel blame attribution method is introduced that sacrifices explanatory power to achieve better alignment with desired properties. The study also considers uncertainty in agents' decision-making policies and validates the qualitative properties of the blame attribution methods through experimentation. The robustness of these methods to uncertainty is also analyzed.
