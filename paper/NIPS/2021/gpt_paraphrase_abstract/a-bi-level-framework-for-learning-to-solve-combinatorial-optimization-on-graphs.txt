Combinatorial Optimization (CO) is a challenging research field due to its NP-hard nature. While heuristic algorithms are commonly used to solve CO problems, they often sacrifice solution quality for speed. Recently, machine learning for combinatorial optimization (MLCO) has gained attention. However, existing MLCO methods treat CO as a single-level optimization, which is difficult to scale up and limited by the complexity of CO. To address this, we propose a hybrid approach that combines an upper-level learning method with a lower-level heuristic algorithm. This bi-level framework simplifies learning on hard CO problems and reduces the demand for model capacity. Experimental results on popular CO problems demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared to manually designed heuristics and single-level learning methods.
