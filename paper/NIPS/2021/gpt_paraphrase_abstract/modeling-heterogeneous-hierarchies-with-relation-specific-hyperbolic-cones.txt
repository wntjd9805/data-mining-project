Hierarchical relations are essential for organizing knowledge in a knowledge graph. Current models can only represent a single global hierarchy and fail to capture multiple heterogeneous hierarchies within a single knowledge graph. To address this limitation, we propose ConE (Cone Embedding), a model that can simultaneously represent multiple hierarchical and non-hierarchical relations in a knowledge graph. ConE uses hyperbolic cones to embed entities and represents relations as transformations between these cones. By employing cone containment constraints in different subspaces, ConE captures the multiple heterogeneous hierarchies. Experimental results demonstrate that ConE achieves state-of-the-art performance on hierarchical reasoning and knowledge graph completion tasks. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets, with Hits@1 of 45.3% on WN18RR and 16.1% on DDB14 (0.231 MRR). Additionally, ConE outperforms previous approaches by an average of 20% on three hierarchical datasets for hierarchical reasoning tasks.
