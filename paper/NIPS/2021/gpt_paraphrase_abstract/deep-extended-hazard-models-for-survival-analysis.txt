Survival analysis, which involves modeling right censored data, poses a challenge for deep neural networks. Although these networks perform well in supervised learning, their optimal application in survival analysis is still uncertain. This study aims to determine which assumptions of traditional survival models should be preserved and which can be made more flexible using neural networks' function-approximating capabilities. Instead of estimating the survival function like existing methods, we propose the Deep Extended Hazard (DeepEH) model as a versatile framework for deep survival analysis. DeepEH encompasses popular models like Deep Cox proportional hazard (DeepSurv) and Deep Accelerated Failure Time (DeepAFT), including the conventional Cox proportional hazards and accelerated failure time models as special cases. The proposed DeepEH model is theoretically supported through consistency and convergence rate analyses of the survival function estimator, highlighting the advantage of deep learning in identifying low-dimensional patterns within high-dimensional data. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms both statistical and deep learning methods in survival analysis.
