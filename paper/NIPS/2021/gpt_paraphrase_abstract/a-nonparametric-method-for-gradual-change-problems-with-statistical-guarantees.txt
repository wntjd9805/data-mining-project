The detection and localization of gradual changes in the distribution of time-ordered observations is often overlooked in existing literature, which primarily focuses on abrupt changes. However, abrupt changes are not applicable in certain practical scenarios. In this study, we present a versatile approach for detecting and localizing gradual changes without the need for a specific data generating model, a particular data type, or prior knowledge about the changing features of the distribution. Despite the relaxed assumptions, our method offers reliable theoretical guarantees for both detection and localization.
