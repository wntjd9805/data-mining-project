This paper introduces a new approach called Discriminator-Constrained Optimal Transport Network (DOTN) for unsupervised domain adaptation in speech enhancement. The aim of DOTN is to estimate clean references of noisy speech in a target domain by leveraging knowledge from a source domain. The domain shift between training and testing data poses a challenge for learning tasks in various fields. While there is existing literature on unsupervised domain adaptation for classification, methods for regression tasks are limited and often rely on additional input data information. The proposed DOTN method combines optimal transport theory with generative adversarial frameworks to accurately evaluate continuous labels in the target domain. Experimental results on two speech enhancement tasks demonstrate that our DOTN outperforms previous unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation frameworks by extending the classical optimal transport formulation.
