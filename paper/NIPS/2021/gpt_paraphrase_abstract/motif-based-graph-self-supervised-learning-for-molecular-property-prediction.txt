Data-driven methods for predicting molecular properties have gained significant attention in recent years. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown impressive success in molecular generation and prediction tasks. However, existing self-supervised pre-training frameworks for GNNs mainly focus on node-level or graph-level tasks, failing to capture important information in subgraphs or graph motifs. To address this limitation, we propose Motif-based Graph Self-supervised Learning (MGSSL). Our framework introduces a novel self-supervised motif generation approach for GNNs. We employ a molecule fragmentation method that utilizes a retrosynthesis-based algorithm and additional rules to control the size of the motif vocabulary. Additionally, we design a general motif-based generative pre-training framework where GNNs make topological and label predictions. This generative framework can be implemented in breadth-first or depth-first manners. Furthermore, we introduce multi-level self-supervised pre-training to consider the multi-scale information in molecular graphs. Our extensive experiments on various benchmark tasks demonstrate that our methods outperform state-of-the-art baselines.
