This study investigates the Benevolent Training Hypothesis (BTH), which suggests that the complexity of a deep neural network's (NN) learning function can be determined by its training dynamics. The analysis provides evidence for BTH by examining the NN's Lipschitz constant in different regions of the input space and its impact on the stochastic training procedure. The study finds that networks with higher complexity exhibit longer trajectories, greater variance, and tend to deviate further from their initial state, influenced by the Lipschitz constant near the training data. Additionally, the study demonstrates that NNs with a more stable training process for the first layer bias have limited complexity even in input space regions far from any training point. Furthermore, the study shows that steady training with Dropout leads to a generalization bound that is dependent on training and data, growing poly-logarithmically with the number of parameters. Overall, these findings support the notion that favorable training behavior can serve as a beneficial bias for effective generalization.
