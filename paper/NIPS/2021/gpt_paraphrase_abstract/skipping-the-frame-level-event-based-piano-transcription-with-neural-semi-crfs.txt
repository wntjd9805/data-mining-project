Most piano transcription systems focus on estimating pitch activity at each audio frame and use post-processing algorithms to determine note events. However, this approach does not align well with the desired outcome of the task, which is to specify note intervals as holistic events. In this study, we introduce a new formulation of piano transcription that directly predicts note events using Semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields (semi-CRF). This method produces scores for intervals instead of individual frames, eliminating the need for disjoint frame-level estimates. Experiments on the MAESTRO dataset show that our proposed model outperforms the current state-of-the-art in piano transcription. The semi-CRF output layer, although quadratic in complexity, is a simple, fast, and effective solution for event-based prediction. This approach may also have success in other areas that currently rely on frame-level estimates.
