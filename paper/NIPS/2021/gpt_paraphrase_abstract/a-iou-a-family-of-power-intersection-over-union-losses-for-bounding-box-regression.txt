The paper introduces a new family of loss functions called α-IoU losses for bounding box regression in computer vision. These losses are derived from the Intersection over Union (IoU) loss and include a power regularization term with a power parameter α. The authors analyze the properties of α-IoU losses, such as order preservingness and loss/gradient reweighting. Experimental results on various object detection benchmarks and models show that α-IoU losses outperform existing IoU-based losses, provide flexibility in achieving different levels of regression accuracy, and are more robust to small datasets and noisy bounding boxes.
