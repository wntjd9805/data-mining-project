Voting systems have various applications, but it is challenging to manually create suitable rules for each scenario. Therefore, there is a need to automatically discover voting rules for different situations. This study demonstrates that set-input neural network architectures, like Set Transformers, fully-connected graph networks, and DeepSets, are well-suited for learning voting rules. These models can accurately mimic existing voting rules and discover near-optimal rules that maximize social welfare functions. Additionally, the learned rules perform well in different voter utility distributions and election sizes not encountered during training.
