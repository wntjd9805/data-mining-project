We address the problem of estimating a linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical system from a single trajectory using streaming algorithms. While the offline setting for LTI system estimation has been extensively studied, the online setting has been neglected. Traditional streaming methods like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are not effective due to high correlation among streaming points. To tackle this, we propose a novel streaming algorithm called SGD with Reverse Experience Replay (SGD − RER), inspired by the experience replay (ER) technique in reinforcement learning. SGD − RER divides data into small buffers and applies SGD backwards on the data stored in these buffers. We demonstrate that this algorithm accurately deconstructs the dependency structure and achieves information theoretically optimal guarantees for both parameter error and prediction error. This makes SGD − RER the first optimal SGD-style algorithm for linear system identification with a first order oracle. Additionally, SGD − RER can be extended to other settings such as sparse LTI identification with known sparsity pattern and non-linear dynamical systems. Our work illustrates how understanding the dependency structure of data can help us design efficient algorithms that can "decorrelate" streaming samples.
