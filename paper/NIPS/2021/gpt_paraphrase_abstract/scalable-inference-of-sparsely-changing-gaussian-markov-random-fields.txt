We investigate the problem of inferring time-varying Gaussian Markov random fields (MRFs) that have sparse underlying graphical models and change sparsely over time. Many existing methods for inferring time-varying MRFs rely on regularized maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which often have weak statistical guarantees and require significant computational time. In contrast, we propose a new approach using constrained optimization problems to infer sparsely-changing Gaussian MRFs (GMRFs). Our optimization problem is based on exact `0 regularization and can be solved efficiently in near-linear time and memory. Additionally, our proposed estimator has a provably small estimation error. We provide strong statistical guarantees in high-dimensional scenarios, demonstrating that these problems can be learned with only one sample per time period. In practice, our method is highly efficient, capable of accurately estimating sparsely-changing GMRFs with over 500 million variables in under an hour.
