This paper presents the nonparametric Volterra kernels model (NVKM), a method for learning non-linear operators using Gaussian processes (GPs) and the Volterra series. The NVKM is effective for single and multiple output regression when the input function is unknown and has a GP prior. It can also be used for Bayesian system identification when the input function is observed. The NVKM utilizes efficient sampling techniques from GPs to map process realizations through the Volterra series, avoiding numerical integration and Gaussian approximations. This allows for scalability through doubly stochastic variational inference. The model's performance is demonstrated on standard benchmarks for multiple output regression and system identification.
