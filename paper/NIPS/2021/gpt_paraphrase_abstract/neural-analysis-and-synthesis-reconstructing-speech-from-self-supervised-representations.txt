We introduce a framework called NANSY that can alter the voice, pitch, and speed of any speech signal. Previous methods have struggled with maintaining reconstruction quality when using information bottleneck techniques for controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose a new training strategy based on information perturbation. By perturbing the information in the original input signal, synthesis networks can selectively choose the necessary attributes to reconstruct the input signal. NANSY does not require bottleneck structures, resulting in both high reconstruction quality and controllability. Additionally, NANSY does not rely on labeled speech data, instead utilizing a new set of analysis features for self-supervised training. This allows NANSY to easily extend to a multilingual setting by training with a multilingual dataset. Experimental results demonstrate NANSY's significant improvements in various applications, including zero-shot voice conversion, pitch shift, and time-scale modification.
