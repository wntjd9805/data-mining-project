Clustering is an important aspect of unsupervised learning, particularly in the online setting. This paper focuses on the facility location problem and explores its application in the presence of multiple machine-learned advice. The researchers propose an algorithm that offers verifiable performance guarantees. If the advice provided is accurate, the algorithm surpasses existing online algorithms for the problem. However, even if the advice is flawed, the algorithm still performs at the same level as these existing methods. The study includes both theoretical analysis and practical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness.
