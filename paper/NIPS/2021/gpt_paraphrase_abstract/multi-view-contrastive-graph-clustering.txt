With the rapid expansion of information technology, multi-view graph data has become increasingly prevalent and valuable. Existing techniques for clustering multi-view data primarily focus on either multiple graphs or multi-view attributes. This paper introduces a generic framework for clustering multi-view attributed graph data. Inspired by the success of contrastive learning, the proposed method, called multi-view contrastive graph clustering (MCGC), aims to learn a consensus graph due to the potential noise or incompleteness of the original graph. The approach consists of two main steps: firstly, filtering out undesirable high-frequency noise while preserving the graph's geometric features through graph filtering to obtain a smooth representation of nodes; secondly, learning a consensus graph regularized by graph contrastive loss. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Notably, this simple approach outperforms existing deep learning-based methods.
