Tabular data synthesis has gained significant attention due to the limitations and privacy concerns associated with available data. In this study, we introduce a generalized framework using GANs and invertible neural networks for tabular synthesis. This framework serves two purposes: enhancing synthesis quality by reducing the negative log-density of real records during adversarial training, and generating realistic fake records that are sufficiently different from real records to mitigate potential information leakage. We conducted experiments on real-world datasets for classification, regression, and privacy attacks. Our results indicate that decreasing the negative log-density during adversarial training leads to the highest synthesis quality, as measured by task-oriented evaluation metrics such as F1 score. Conversely, increasing the negative log-density increases the distance between real and fake records, thereby improving robustness against privacy attacks.
