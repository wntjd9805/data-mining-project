Two-stage methods have been dominant in Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection, but recently, one-stage methods have gained popularity. This paper aims to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of both approaches. Two-stage methods struggle with accurately positioning positive human-object pairs, while one-stage methods struggle with finding the right balance in multi-task learning, specifically object detection and interaction classification. The challenge is to extract the strengths and discard the weaknesses of both methods. To address this, a new one-stage framework is proposed, which separates human-object detection and interaction classification. A human-object pair generator is designed by modifying a state-of-the-art one-stage HOI detector, followed by an isolated interaction classifier for each pair. The proposed framework includes two cascade decoders that focus on either detection or interaction classification. The implementation uses a transformer-based HOI detector as the base model. The introduced disentangling paradigm significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a relative mAP gain of 9.32% on HICO-Det.
