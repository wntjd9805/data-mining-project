Neuroscientists studying semantics in the brain use two approaches. One is to identify areas correlated with semantic processing load, while the other is to find areas predicted by the semantic representation of stimulus words. However, previous studies on syntax have mainly focused on identifying areas correlated with syntactic processing load. This discrepancy may be due to the complexity of representing syntactic structure in a way that can be used to model brain activity, or the uncertainty of whether neuroimaging tools like fMRI can accurately reveal complex syntactic representations. In this study, we propose new features that encode information about the syntactic structure of sentences. Using these features and fMRI recordings of participants reading a natural text, we analyze the brain's representation of syntax. Our findings show that our syntactic structure-based features explain additional variance in brain activity, even after accounting for processing load. Additionally, we observe that regions well-predicted by syntactic features are distributed throughout the language system and cannot be distinguished from regions processing semantics.
