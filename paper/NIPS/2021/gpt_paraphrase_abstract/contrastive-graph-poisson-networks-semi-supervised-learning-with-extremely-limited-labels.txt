We propose a new framework called Contrastive Graph Poisson Networks (CGPN) to address the issue of limited labeled data in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for node classification. Most existing GNN models require sufficient labeled data for effective training, but their performance suffers when labels are extremely limited. CGPN integrates a newly designed GraphPoisson Network (GPN) to propagate limited labels to the entire graph, along with a normal GNN like Graph Attention Network to guide the propagation. A contrastive objective is applied to exploit supervision information from the learning process of GPN and GNN models. CGPN enhances the learning performance of GNNs under extremely limited labels by contrastively propagating the limited labels to the entire graph. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of CGPN.
