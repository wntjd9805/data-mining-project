We present a new method called implicit Deep Adaptive Design (iDAD) that enables real-time adaptive experiments using implicit models. iDAD reduces the computational cost of Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) by training a design policy network beforehand, which can then be quickly deployed during the experiment. Unlike previous approaches, iDAD can be trained on any model that generates differentiable samples, eliminating the need for closed form likelihood or conditionally independent experiments. With iDAD, design decisions can be made in milliseconds compared to traditional BOED methods that require heavy computation during the experiment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of iDAD through various experiments, highlighting its speed and efficiency in adaptive design using implicit models.
