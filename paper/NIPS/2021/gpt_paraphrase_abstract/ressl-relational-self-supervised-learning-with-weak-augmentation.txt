This paper introduces a new paradigm in self-supervised learning called relational self-supervised learning (ReSSL). While existing methods in self-supervised learning focus on instance level information, ReSSL aims to model the relationships between different instances. The proposed method uses a sharpened distribution of pairwise similarities as a metric for measuring the relationship between instances. Weak augmentations are also considered important for representing reliable relations, and a momentum strategy is employed for practical efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that ReSSL outperforms previous state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both performance and training efficiency. The code for ReSSL is available at https://github.com/KyleZheng1997/ReSSL.
