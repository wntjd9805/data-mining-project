Causal models are increasingly important in machine learning, but quantifying uncertainty in causal inference remains challenging. This paper focuses on the problem of combining datasets from multiple causal graphs to estimate the average treatment effect of a target variable. Since the data comes from different sources and can vary in quality and quantity, it is crucial to have a principled approach to uncertainty quantification. The authors propose a framework called Bayesian Interventional Mean Processes, which combines ideas from probabilistic integration and kernel mean embeddings to represent interventional distributions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This framework also considers the uncertainty within each causal graph. The authors demonstrate the usefulness of their uncertainty estimation by applying it to the Causal Bayesian Optimization task and achieving better results than state-of-the-art methods.
