Supervised Pix2Pix and unsupervised Cycle-consistency are dominant modes in medical image-to-image translation. However, both have limitations. Pix2Pix requires paired and well-aligned images, which may not always be feasible. Cycle-consistency works on unpaired or misaligned images but may not yield optimal results. To overcome this dilemma, we propose a new unsupervised mode called RegGAN. RegGAN treats misaligned target images as noisy labels and incorporates a registration network to adaptively fit the misaligned noise distribution. This approach aims to find the common optimal solution for image translation and registration tasks. We integrated RegGAN into existing image-to-image translation methods and demonstrated its ability to improve their performance. For instance, our simple CycleGAN model outperformed the latest NICEGAN model with fewer network parameters. RegGAN surpassed both Pix2Pix and Cycle-consistency approaches, as it is insensitive to noise and suitable for scenarios where well-aligned data is unavailable.
