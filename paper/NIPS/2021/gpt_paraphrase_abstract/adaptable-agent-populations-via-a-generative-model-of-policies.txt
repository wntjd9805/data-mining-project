This study focuses on the importance of diversity in the natural world and aims to apply it to the field of reinforcement learning. The researchers propose a generative model that can learn a range of effective strategies in a given environment. This model maps a low-dimensional latent space to the agent's policy space, allowing for the adaptation and robustness of the population of agents. Similar to how real-world populations evolve through natural selection, this method can adapt to changes in the environment by selecting policies in the latent space. The effectiveness of the generative model is tested in various environments, and further details, including code and visualizations, can be found at the provided website.
