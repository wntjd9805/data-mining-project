We present a method for creating prediction sets in an online setting where the data generating distribution can change over time in an unknown manner. Our approach builds on conformal inference principles and can be applied with any black box method that provides point predictions or estimated quantiles of the unseen label's distribution. Unlike previous methods, which assume data points are exchangeable, our adaptive approach guarantees the desired coverage frequency over long periods regardless of the true data generation process. To achieve this, we treat the distribution shift as a learning problem with a single parameter that needs continuous re-estimation as its optimal value varies over time. Our method, adaptive conformal inference, is tested on two real-world datasets and demonstrates robust predictions even in the presence of noticeable and significant distribution shifts.
