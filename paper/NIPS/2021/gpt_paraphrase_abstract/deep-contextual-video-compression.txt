This paper introduces a new approach to neural video compression that moves away from the traditional predictive coding framework. Instead, the proposed framework utilizes conditional coding to achieve higher compression ratios. The authors explore how to define, use, and learn conditions within a deep video compression framework. They suggest using feature domain context as the condition, allowing for the inclusion of rich information in both the encoder and decoder processes. The framework is also flexible, allowing for the design of various conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art deep video compression methods, achieving a 26.0% bitrate saving compared to x265 using the veryslow preset for 1080P standard test videos. The code for the framework is available at https://github.com/DeepMC-DCVC/DCVC.
