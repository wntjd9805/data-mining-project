Proteins play a crucial role in life and their functions are determined by their 3D structures. A key way to understand protein structure is by measuring the proximity between amino acids, known as the inter-residue contact map. Protein contact prediction (PCP) is an important tool in studying protein structure. The current approach to PCP involves using coevolutionary features derived from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) to estimate inter-residue contacts. However, this method suffers from information loss and the presence of non-homologous residues and gaps in the MSAs. To address these issues, we propose a new approach called Co-evolution Transformer (CoT). CoT aggregates information from all homologous sequences in the MSA to capture global coevolutionary patterns. It selectively weighs the features from different homologs to mitigate the influence of non-homologous information. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CoT, achieving a high precision score for Free Modeling (FM) domains on the CASP14 benchmark. CoT outperforms the winner of the CASP14 contact prediction challenge by 9.8%. This work was conducted during an internship at Microsoft Research and is presented at the 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021).
