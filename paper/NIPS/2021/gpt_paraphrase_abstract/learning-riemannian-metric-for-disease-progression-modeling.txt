Linear mixed-effect models are commonly used to estimate disease progression using longitudinal data. While these models provide interpretability, they rely on certain assumptions about the progression profiles and their variability among subjects. To address this limitation, researchers have proposed embedding the data in a Riemannian manifold and learning patient-specific trajectories around a central geodesic. This approach offers a few interpretable parameters but requires a prior choice of the metric that determines the shape of the trajectories. In this study, the authors extend this approach by learning the metric directly from the data, allowing for more flexibility while maintaining interpretability. Specifically, they learn the metric as the push-forward of the Euclidean metric using a diffeomorphism. This diffeomorphism is estimated iteratively using radial basis functions from a reproducible kernel Hilbert space. By updating the metric, the authors improve the forecasting of imaging and clinical biomarkers in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. The results of this study outperform 56 benchmarked methods in the TADPOLE challenge. The research was partially supported by NIH grants and funding from the French government. The data used in this study were obtained from the ADNI database, and the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI but did not participate in the analysis or writing of this report. This work was presented at the 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021).
