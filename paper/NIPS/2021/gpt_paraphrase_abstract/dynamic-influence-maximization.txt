We present a systematic investigation into dynamic influence maximization (DIM). In the DIM problem, the objective is to maximize the spread of influence in a dynamically changing social network while minimizing the cost of updates. We examine two evolution models: incremental and fully dynamic. In the incremental model, the network grows over time by introducing new users and establishing new social connections. We propose an algorithm that achieves a (1-1/e-(cid:15)) approximation to the optimal solution. The algorithm has an amortized running time of k Â· poly(log n, (cid:15)-1), which is comparable to the best offline algorithms with only a poly-logarithmic overhead.In the fully dynamic model, users join and leave the network, and influence propagation can change in real time. We prove that, unless the amortized running time is n1-o(1), no algorithm can achieve a 2-(log n)1-o(1) approximation, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH).To solve the DIM problem, we introduce novel adaptive sampling methods that reduce it to the dynamic MAX-k coverage problem. We design an efficient (1-1/e-(cid:15)) approximation algorithm for this problem. Our lower bound is based on the distributed PCP framework.Overall, our study provides insights, algorithms, and lower bounds for dynamic influence maximization in evolving social networks.
