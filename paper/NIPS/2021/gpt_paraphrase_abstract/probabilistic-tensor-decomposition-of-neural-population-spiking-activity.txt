The coordination of neural firing across cells, time, and experimental conditions is crucial for understanding the computational significance of neural responses. Tensor decomposition is a widely used method in various fields to untangle the influence of multiple factors in data. However, its applicability in neuroscience is limited due to the lack of a comprehensive probabilistic treatment for non-Gaussian spike-count data. In this study, we introduce a new approach using PÃ³lya-Gamma augmentation to enable scalable variational inference in non-conjugate spike-count models. We also incorporate techniques for inferring the appropriate tensor rank and incorporating prior knowledge based on brain anatomy. Applying this model to neural recordings during visual-vestibular sensory integration, we uncover how the encoding of self- and visual-motion signals is modulated by sensory information.
