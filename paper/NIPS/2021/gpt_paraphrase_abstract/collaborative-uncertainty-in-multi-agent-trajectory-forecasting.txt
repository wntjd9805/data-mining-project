Uncertainty modeling is crucial in trajectory forecasting systems for interpretation and safety purposes. Recent studies have incorporated interaction modules to capture agent interactions and generate correlated predicted trajectories. However, these correlations introduce uncertainty that is often overlooked. To address this issue, we introduce a novel concept called collaborative uncertainty (CU) to model the uncertainty resulting from interaction modules. We develop a general CU-based framework that enables a prediction model to learn future trajectories and their corresponding uncertainties. This framework is integrated as a plugin module into state-of-the-art systems and applied to two cases using multivariate Gaussian and Laplace distributions. We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic datasets and public trajectory forecasting benchmarks, yielding promising results. The synthetic dataset experiments demonstrate that the CU-based framework effectively approximates the ground-truth distribution. Moreover, the trajectory forecasting benchmarks show that the CU-based framework consistently improves the performance of state-of-the-art systems. Notably, the proposed CU-based framework enhances VectorNet's performance by 57 cm in terms of Final Displacement Error on the nuScenes dataset. Visualization results of CU indicate that its value is closely related to the amount of interactive information among agents.
