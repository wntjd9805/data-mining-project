We explore active learning in the streaming setting without assuming any specific characteristics of the label-generating functions. We use the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) approximation tools to create a neural embedding that determines the feature space and learned model. To handle unknown function complexity, we develop an algorithm that balances regret and solves the online model selection problem efficiently. We provide guarantees on cumulative regret and number of requested labels based on the complexity of the labeling function. In the linear case, these guarantees align with existing results on generalization error in statistical learning.
