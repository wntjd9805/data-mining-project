This paper focuses on the issue of Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT), where the marginal conditions are relaxed and weighted penalties are used instead of equality. The paper introduces a reformulation of the optimization problem as a non-negative penalized linear regression problem, allowing for the development of new algorithms based on inverse problems and nonnegative matrix factorization. The majorization-minimization approach is used to efficiently update a variety of penalties. Additionally, the paper presents an efficient algorithm for computing the regularization path of UOT with quadratic penalties, which leads to a convergence of piece-wise linear OT plans to the solution of balanced OT. Numerical experiments on simulated and real data are conducted to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The paper also discusses the potential application of more advanced optimization tools in solving OT problems using the reformulation.
