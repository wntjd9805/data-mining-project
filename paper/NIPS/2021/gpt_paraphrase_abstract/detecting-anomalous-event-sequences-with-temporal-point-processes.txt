Automated anomaly detection in event data is valuable in healthcare, DevOps, and information security domains. This study focuses on detecting abnormal continuous-time event sequences as out-of-distribution (OoD) detection for temporal point processes (TPPs). Initially, the problem is approached using goodness-of-fit (GoF) tests, but the limitations of popular GoF statistics for TPPs are revealed. To overcome these limitations, a novel test is proposed. The new method can be easily implemented and combined with different TPP models, including neural TPPs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed statistic performs well in both traditional GoF testing and anomaly detection in simulated and real-world data.
