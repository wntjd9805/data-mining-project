We propose a new framework called correlated multiple instance learning (MIL) to address the issue of neglecting correlation among different instances in current MIL methods. We also introduce a Transformer based MIL (TransMIL) that incorporates morphological and spatial information. TransMIL achieves better performance and faster convergence compared to state-of-the-art methods in computational pathology problems. Test results show that TransMIL achieves up to 93.09% AUC for binary tumor classification on the CAMELYON16 dataset, and up to 96.03% and 98.82% AUC for cancer subtypes classification on the TCGA-NSCLC and TCGA-RCC datasets, respectively. The implementation can be found at: https://github.com/szc19990412/TransMIL.
