This paper introduces a solution to the challenge of learning in a multi-target environment without prior knowledge of the targets, which typically requires a large number of samples and hinders generalization. The proposed approach involves utilizing the goal-aware cross-entropy (GACE) loss, which can be applied in a self-supervised manner using auto-labeled goal states in conjunction with reinforcement learning. The authors also develop goal-discriminative attention networks (GDAN) that utilize goal-relevant information to concentrate on the provided instruction. The effectiveness of these methods is evaluated in visual navigation and robot arm manipulation tasks with multi-target environments, and the results demonstrate that GDAN surpasses existing techniques in terms of task success ratio, sample efficiency, and generalization. Furthermore, qualitative analyses showcase that the proposed method enhances the agent's understanding and focus on the given instruction, thus promoting goal-directed behavior.
