The potential to greatly enhance molecular dynamics and revolutionize chemical simulations lies in the accurate prediction of molecular interactions. Despite the recent success of graph neural networks (GNNs) in surpassing traditional methods, they still have limitations in their ability to differentiate certain types of graphs. This study aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice by demonstrating that GNNs with directed edge embeddings and two-hop message passing can serve as universal approximators for predictions that are invariant to translation and equivariant to permutation and rotation. Building on these findings, the authors propose a new neural network called GemNet, which incorporates various structural improvements. Through multiple ablation studies, it is shown that GemNet outperforms previous models on several datasets, achieving significant improvements especially on challenging molecules. The implementation of GemNet is available online.
