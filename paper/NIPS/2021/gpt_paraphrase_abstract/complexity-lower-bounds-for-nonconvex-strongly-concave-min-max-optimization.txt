We establish a lower bound for the complexity of finding stationary points in min-max optimization problems with smooth, nonconvex objective functions. The lower bound is Ω (cid:0)√κ(cid:15)−2(cid:1) for deterministic oracles, where (cid:15) represents approximate stationarity and κ is the condition number. Our lower bound matches the best existing upper bound up to logarithmic factors. For stochastic oracles, we provide a lower bound of Ω (cid:0)√κ(cid:15)−2 + κ1/3(cid:15)−4(cid:1), indicating a gap between the best existing upper bound O(κ3(cid:15)−4) and our lower bound in the condition number dependence.
