Scallop is a system that combines deep learning and symbolic reasoning techniques to create an intelligent system. It addresses the limitation of scalability in existing combinations of these techniques, making them unsuitable for real-world applications. Scallop introduces a provenance framework that allows users to specify the level of reasoning granularity, resulting in generalized probabilistic reasoning, reduced computational cost, and relative accuracy guarantees. In comparison to DeepProbLog, a neural logic programming approach, Scallop performs significantly better in synthetic tasks involving mathematical and logical reasoning without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, Scallop successfully scales to a real-world Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark, outperforming VQA-tailored models by a significant margin. Specifically, Scallop achieves 84.22% accuracy in multi-hop reasoning, surpassing Neural Module Networks and transformers by 12.42% and 21.66% respectively.
