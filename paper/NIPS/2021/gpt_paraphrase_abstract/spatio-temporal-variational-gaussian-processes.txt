We present a new method for Gaussian process inference that can handle multivariate data and scales linearly with time. By combining spatio-temporal filtering with natural gradient variational inference, we achieve a non-conjugate GP approach. Our natural gradient approach allows for parallel filtering and smoothing, reducing the complexity with respect to time steps to a logarithmic scale. We develop a sparse approximation that builds a state-space model using a smaller set of spatial inducing points. For separable Markov kernels, both the full and sparse cases accurately recover the standard variational GP while offering improved computational efficiency. To further enhance spatial scaling, we introduce a mean-field assumption of independence between spatial locations. This, along with sparsity and parallelization, enables an efficient and accurate method for large spatio-temporal problems.
