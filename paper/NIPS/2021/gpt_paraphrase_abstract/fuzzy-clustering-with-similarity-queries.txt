The fuzzy or soft k-means problem is an extension of the well-known k-means problem that allows for clustering uncertain and vague datasets. This paper proposes a semi-supervised active clustering framework where the learner interacts with a domain expert to obtain similarity information. The study focuses on the query and computational complexities in this framework and proves that a small number of similarity queries can lead to a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for an otherwise NP-hard problem. Algorithms are provided for fuzzy clustering in this setting that require a limited number of similarity queries and have polynomial-time complexity. The fuzzy k-means objective is a nonconvex problem that includes k-means as a special case and is equivalent to other nonconvex problems like non-negative matrix factorization. The commonly used Lloyd-type algorithms can get stuck at local minima, but the results of this paper demonstrate that making a few similarity queries makes the problem easier to solve. The algorithms are tested on real-world datasets and show effectiveness in practical applications.
