The problem of finding a unique low-dimensional decomposition for a given matrix has been a recurring issue in various fields. This study focuses on the problem of finding a unique decomposition of a low-rank matrix Y, which can be represented sparsely. Specifically, we examine the case where Y = AX, where A is a matrix with full column rank and X is an element-wise sparse matrix. We prove that this sparse decomposition of Y can be identified uniquely by recovering the ground-truth A column by column, with some intrinsic signed permutation. Our approach involves solving a nonconvex optimization problem constrained to the unit sphere. Our analysis shows that any strict local solution is close to the true solution and can be obtained using a data-driven initialization followed by a second-order descent algorithm. We validate these theoretical findings through numerical experiments.
