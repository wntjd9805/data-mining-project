Existing mapping services often fail to recommend routes that reach the destination, and they also struggle when encountering unseen roads. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called NEUROMLR to address these limitations. NEUROMLR learns a generative model from historical trajectories, considering factors such as current location, destination, and real-time traffic conditions. We use a combination of Lipschitz embeddings and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to learn the conditional distributions. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that NEUROMLR significantly improves accuracy compared to existing methods. Moreover, NEUROMLR generalizes much better to unseen data and has a higher likelihood of recommending routes that reach the destination.
