A novel topological neural framework called topological relational inference (TRI) is proposed to address the over-smoothing and vulnerability issues faced by graph neural networks (GNNs). TRI integrates higher-order graph information into GNNs by rewiring the original graph using the persistent homology of small neighborhoods of nodes. This allows for systematic learning of a local graph structure. The extracted topological summaries are then incorporated as side information into the local algorithm. This framework combines conventional graph structure information with information on graph higher order topological properties. The new local topological representation is theoretically stable and has implications on the graph algebraic connectivity. Experimental results on node classification tasks demonstrate that the TRI-GNN outperforms 14 state-of-the-art baselines on 6 out of 7 graphs and exhibits higher robustness to perturbations, achieving up to 10% better performance under noisy scenarios.
