The classification of scenes is an important task that requires further study. Scene characteristics are spread throughout the entire image, making it necessary to identify informative regions. Previous research has focused on discovering and aggregating these regions, but has not fully utilized the inherent properties of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for scene classification. In this paper, we propose a new perspective that considers the focus area of scene images and CNN models. We find that CNN models for scene classification benefit from a larger focus area, as it helps capture scene characteristics. We also analyze existing training methods and question the optimal approach for scene classification. To better utilize scene characteristics, we introduce a new learning scheme that encourages a larger focus area by erasing already activated regions during training. We maintain pairwise consistency between the erased and original images using a tailored loss that leverages category-relevance information. Our experiments on Places365 dataset demonstrate significant improvements with various CNNs. However, our method performs poorly on object-centric datasets like ImageNet, suggesting that it specifically captures the unique characteristics of scenes.
