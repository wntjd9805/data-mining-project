Symbolic regression is the process of finding mathematical equations that accurately represent the output of a black-box system. It is a difficult problem to solve and has been tackled using methods like neural-guided search and genetic programming. In this study, we propose a hybrid approach that combines both neural-guided and genetic programming techniques to solve symbolic regression and other optimization problems. Our method uses neural-guided search to generate a starting population for the genetic programming component, gradually improving the quality of the population. We compared our approach to a top-performing model and found that our method recovered 65% more expressions in benchmark tasks. We also discovered that decoupling the neural-guided and genetic programming components yielded better results for symbolic regression. Additionally, we introduced a new set of 22 benchmark problems that are more challenging than existing ones. The source code for our approach is available at www.github.com/brendenpetersen/deep-symbolic-optimization.
