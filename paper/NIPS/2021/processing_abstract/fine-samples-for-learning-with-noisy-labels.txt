Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) become weak when the datasets contain noisy (incorrect) class labels. Robust techniques in the presence of noisy labels can be categorized into two types: developing noise-robust functions or using noise-cleansing methods by detecting the noisy data. Recently, noise-cleansing methods have been considered as the most competitive noisy-label learning algorithms. De-spite their success, their noisy label detectors are often based on heuristics more than a theory, requiring a robust classiﬁer to predict the noisy data with loss val-ues. In this paper, we propose a novel detector for ﬁltering label noise. Unlike most existing methods, we focus on each data point’s latent representation dy-namics and measure the alignment between the latent distribution and each repre-sentation using the eigen decomposition of the data gram matrix. Our framework, coined as ﬁltering noisy instances via their eigenvectors (FINE), provides a robust detector using derivative-free simple methods with theoretical guarantees. Under our framework, we propose three applications of the FINE: sample-selection ap-proach, semi-supervised learning (SSL) approach, and collaboration with noise-robust loss functions. Experimental results show that the proposed methods con-sistently outperform corresponding baselines for all three applications on various benchmark datasets 1.
