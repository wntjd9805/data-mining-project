Bilevel optimization has been widely applied in many important machine learning applications such as hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning. Recently, several momentum-based algorithms have been proposed to solve bilevel optimiza-tion problems faster. However, those momentum-based algorithms do not achieve provably better computational complexity than (cid:101)O((cid:15)−2) of the SGD-based algo-rithm. In this paper, we propose two new algorithms for bilevel optimization, where the ﬁrst algorithm adopts momentum-based recursive iterations, and the second algorithm adopts recursive gradient estimations in nested loops to decrease the variance. We show that both algorithms achieve the complexity of (cid:101)O((cid:15)−1.5), which outperforms all existing algorithms by the order of magnitude. Our experiments validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the superior empirical performance of our algorithms in hyperparameter applications.
