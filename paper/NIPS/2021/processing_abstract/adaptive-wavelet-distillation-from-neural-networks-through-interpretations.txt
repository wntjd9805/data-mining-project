Recent deep-learning models have achieved impressive prediction performance, but often sacriﬁce interpretability and computational efﬁciency. Interpretability is crucial in many disciplines, such as science and medicine, where models must be carefully vetted or where interpretation is the goal itself. Moreover, interpretable models are concise and often yield computational efﬁciency. Here, we propose adaptive wavelet distillation (AWD), a method which aims to distill information from a trained neural network into a wavelet transform. Speciﬁcally, AWD pe-nalizes feature attributions of a neural network in the wavelet domain to learn an effective multi-resolution wavelet transform. The resulting model is highly predic-tive, concise, computationally efﬁcient, and has properties (such as a multi-scale structure) which make it easy to interpret. In close collaboration with domain experts, we showcase how AWD addresses challenges in two real-world settings: cosmological parameter inference and molecular-partner prediction. In both cases,AWD yields a scientiﬁcally interpretable and concise model which gives predictive performance better than state-of-the-art neural networks. Moreover, AWD identi-ﬁes predictive features that are scientiﬁcally meaningful in the context of respective domains. All code and models are released in a full-ﬂedged package available onGithub. 1
