Realistically—and equitably—modeling the dynamics of group-level disparities in machine learning remains an open problem. In particular, we desire models that do not suppose inherent differences between artiﬁcial groups of people—but rather endogenize disparities by appeal to unequal initial conditions of insular subpopulations. In this paper, agents each have a real-valued feature X (e.g., credit score) informed by a “true” binary label Y representing qualiﬁcation (e.g., for a loan). Each agent alternately (1) receives a binary classiﬁcation label ˆY (e.g., loan approval) from a Bayes-optimal machine learning classiﬁer observing X and (2) may update their qualiﬁcation Y by imitating successful strategies (e.g., seek a raise) within an isolated group G of agents to which they belong. We consider the disparity of qualiﬁcation rates Pr(Y = 1) between different groups and how this disparity changes subject to a sequence of Bayes-optimal classiﬁers repeatedly retrained on the global population. We model the evolving qualiﬁcation rates of each subpopulation (group) using the replicator equation, which derives from a class of imitation processes. We show that differences in qualiﬁcation rates between subpopulations can persist indeﬁnitely for a set of non-trivial equilibrium states due to uniformed classiﬁer deployments, even when groups are identical in all aspects except initial qualiﬁcation densities. We next simulate the effects of commonly proposed fairness interventions on this dynamical system along with a new feedback control mechanism capable of permanently eliminating group-level qualiﬁcation rate disparities. We conclude by discussing the limitations of our model and ﬁndings and by outlining potential future work.
