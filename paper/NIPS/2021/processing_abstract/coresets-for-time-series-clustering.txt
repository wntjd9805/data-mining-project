We study the problem of constructing coresets for clustering problems with time series data. This problem has gained importance across many ﬁelds including biology, medicine, and economics due to the proliferation of sensors for real-time measurement and rapid drop in storage costs. In particular, we consider the setting where the time series data on N entities is generated from a Gaussian mixture model with autocorrelations over k clusters in Rd. Our main contribution is an algorithm to construct coresets for the maximum likelihood objective for this mixture model. Our algorithm is efﬁcient, and, under a mild assumption on the covariance matrices of the Gaussians, the size of the coreset is independent of the number of entities N and the number of observations for each entity, and depends only polynomially on k, d and 1/ε, where ε is the error parameter. We empirically assess the performance of our coresets with synthetic data.
