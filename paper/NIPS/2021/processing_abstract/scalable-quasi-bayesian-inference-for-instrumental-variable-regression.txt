Recent years have witnessed an upsurge of interest in employing ﬂexible machine learning models for instrumental variable (IV) regression, but the development of uncertainty quantiﬁcation methodology is still lacking. In this work we present a scalable quasi-Bayesian procedure for IV regression, building upon the recently developed kernelized IV models. Contrary to Bayesian modeling for IV, our ap-proach does not require additional assumptions on the data generating process, and leads to a scalable approximate inference algorithm with time cost compara-ble to the corresponding point estimation methods. Our algorithm can be further extended to work with neural network models. We analyze the theoretical proper-ties of the proposed quasi-posterior, and demonstrate through empirical evaluation the competitive performance of our method.
