We study the fundamental problem of ReLU regression, where the goal is to ﬁtRectiﬁed Linear Units (ReLUs) to data. This supervised learning task is efﬁciently solvable in the realizable setting, but is known to be computationally hard with adversarial label noise. In this work, we focus on ReLU regression in the Massart noise model, a natural and well-studied semi-random noise model. In this model, the label of every point is generated according to a function in the class, but an adversary is allowed to change this value arbitrarily with some probability, which is at most ⌘< 1/2. We develop an efﬁcient algorithm that achieves exact parameter recovery in this model under mild anti-concentration assumptions on the underlying distribution. Such assumptions are necessary for exact recovery to be information-theoretically possible. We demonstrate that our algorithm signiﬁcantly outperforms naive applications of `1 and `2 regression on both synthetic and real data.
