Two-stage methods have dominated Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection for several years. Recently, one-stage HOI detection methods have become popular. In this paper, we aim to explore the essential pros and cons of two-stage and one-stage methods. With this as the goal, we ﬁnd that conventional two-stage methods mainly suffer from positioning positive interactive human-object pairs, while one-stage methods are challenging to make an appropriate trade-off on multi-task learning, i.e., object detection, and interaction classiﬁcation. Therefore, a core problem is how to take the essence and discard the dregs from the conventional two types of methods. To this end, we propose a novel one-stage framework with disentangling human-object detection and interaction classiﬁcation in a cascade manner. In detail, we ﬁrst design a human-object pair generator based on a state-of-the-art one-stageHOI detector by removing the interaction classiﬁcation module or head and then design a relatively isolated interaction classiﬁer to classify each human-object pair.Two cascade decoders in our proposed framework can focus on one speciﬁc task, detection or interaction classiﬁcation. In terms of the speciﬁc implementation, we adopt a transformer-based HOI detector as our base model. The newly introduced disentangling paradigm outperforms existing methods by a large margin, with a signiﬁcant relative mAP gain of 9.32% on HICO-Det.
