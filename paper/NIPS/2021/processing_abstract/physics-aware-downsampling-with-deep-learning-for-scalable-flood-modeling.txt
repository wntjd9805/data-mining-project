Background. Floods are the most common natural disaster in the world, affecting the lives of hundreds of millions. Flood forecasting is therefore a vitally important endeavor, typically achieved using physical water ﬂow simulations, which rely on accurate terrain elevation maps. However, such simulations, based on solving partial differential equations, are computationally prohibitive on a large scale. This scalability issue is commonly alleviated using a coarse grid representation of the elevation map, though this representation may distort crucial terrain details, leading to signiﬁcant inaccuracies in the simulation.Contributions. We train a deep neural network to perform physics-informed down-sampling of the terrain map: we optimize the coarse grid representation of the terrain maps, so that the ﬂood prediction will match the ﬁne grid solution. For the learning process to succeed, we conﬁgure a dataset speciﬁcally for this task. We demonstrate that with this method, it is possible to achieve a signiﬁcant reduction in computational cost, while maintaining an accurate solution. A reference imple-mentation accompanies the paper as well as documentation and code for dataset reproduction.
