We propose a general method to construct centroid approximation for the dis-tribution of maximum points of a random function (a.k.a. argmax distribution), which ﬁnds broad applications in machine learning. Our method optimizes a set of centroid points to compactly approximate the argmax distribution with a simple objective function, without explicitly drawing exact samples from the argmax distribution. Theoretically, the argmax centroid method can be shown to minimize a surrogate of Wasserstein distance between the ground-truth argmax distribution and the centroid approximation under proper conditions. We demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of our method on a variety of real-world multi-task learning applications, including few-shot image classiﬁcation, personalized dialogue systems and multi-target domain adaptation.
