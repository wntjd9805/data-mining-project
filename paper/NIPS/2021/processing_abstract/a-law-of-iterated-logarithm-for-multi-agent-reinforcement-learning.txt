In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), multiple agents interact with a common environment, as also with each other, for solving a shared problem in sequential decision-making. It has wide-ranging applications in gaming, robotics, finance, etc. In this work, we derive a novel law of iterated logarithm for a family of distributed nonlinear stochastic approximation schemes that is useful in MARL.In particular, our result describes the convergence rate on almost every sample path where the algorithm converges. This result is the first of its kind in the distributed setup and provides deeper insights than the existing ones, which only discuss con-vergence rates in the expected or the CLT sense. Importantly, our result holds under significantly weaker assumptions: neither the gossip matrix needs to be doubly stochastic nor the stepsizes square summable. As an application, we show that, for the stepsize n−γ with γ ∈ (0, 1), the distributed TD(0) algorithm with n−γ ln n) a.s.; for linear function approximation has a convergence rate of O( n−1 ln ln n) a.s. These decay rates do not the 1/n type stepsize, the same is O( depend on the graph depicting the interactions among the different agents.√√
