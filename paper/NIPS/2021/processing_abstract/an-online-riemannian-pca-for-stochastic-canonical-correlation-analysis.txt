We present an efficient stochastic algorithm (RSG+) for canonical correlation anal-ysis (CCA) using a reparametrization of the projection matrices. We show how this reparametrization (into structured matrices), simple in hindsight, directly presents an opportunity to repurpose/adjust mature techniques for numerical optimization on Riemannian manifolds. Our developments nicely complement existing methods for this problem which either require O(d3) time complexity per iteration withO( 1√) convergence rate (where d is the dimensionality) or only extract the top t 1 component with O( 1 t ) convergence rate. In contrast, our algorithm offers an improvement: it achieves O(d2k) runtime complexity per iteration for extracting the top k canonical components with O( 1 t ) convergence rate. While our paper focuses more on the formulation and the algorithm, our experiments show that the empirical behavior on common datasets is quite promising. We also explore a potential application in training fair models with missing sensitive attributes.
