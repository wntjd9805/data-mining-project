Low-rank Tucker and CP tensor decompositions are powerful tools in data analytics.The widely used alternating least squares (ALS) method, which solves a sequence of over-determined least squares subproblems, is costly for large and sparse tensors.We propose a fast and accurate sketched ALS algorithm for Tucker decomposi-tion, which solves a sequence of sketched rank-constrained linear least squares subproblems. Theoretical sketch size upper bounds are provided to achieve O((cid:15)) relative error for each subproblem with two sketching techniques, TensorSketch and leverage score sampling. Experimental results show that this new ALS algorithm, combined with a new initialization scheme based on the randomized range Ô¨Ånder, yields decomposition accuracy comparable to the standard higher-order orthogonal iteration (HOOI) algorithm. The new algorithm achieves up to 22.0% relative decomposition residual improvement compared to the state-of-the-art sketched randomized algorithm for Tucker decomposition of various synthetic and real datasets. This Tucker-ALS algorithm is further used to accelerate CP decompo-sition, by using randomized Tucker compression followed by CP decomposition of the Tucker core tensor. Experimental results show that this algorithm not only converges faster, but also yields more accurate CP decompositions.
