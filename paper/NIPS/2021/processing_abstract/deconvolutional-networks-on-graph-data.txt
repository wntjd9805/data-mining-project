In this paper, we consider an inverse problem in graph learning domain – “given the graph representations smoothed by Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), how can we reconstruct the input graph signal?" We propose Graph DeconvolutionalNetwork (GDN) and motivate the design of GDN via a combination of inverseﬁlters in spectral domain and de-noising layers in wavelet domain, as the inverse operation results in a high frequency ampliﬁer and may amplify the noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on several tasks including graph feature imputation and graph structure generation.
