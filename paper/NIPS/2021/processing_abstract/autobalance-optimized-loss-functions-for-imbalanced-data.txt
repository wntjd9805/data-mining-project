Imbalanced datasets are commonplace in modern machine learning problems. The presence of under-represented classes or groups with sensitive attributes results in concerns about generalization and fairness. Such concerns are further exacerbated by the fact that large capacity deep nets can perfectly ﬁt the training data and appear to achieve perfect accuracy and fairness during training, but perform poorly during test. To address these challenges, we propose AutoBalance, a bi-level optimization framework that automatically designs a training loss function to optimize a blend of accuracy and fairness-seeking objectives. Speciﬁcally, a lower-level problem trains the model weights, and an upper-level problem tunes the loss function by monitoring and optimizing the desired objective over the validation data. Our loss design enables personalized treatment for classes/groups by employing a parametric cross-entropy loss and individualized data augmentation schemes. We evaluate the beneﬁts and performance of our approach for the application scenarios of imbalanced and group-sensitive classiﬁcation. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the beneﬁts of AutoBalance over state-of-the-art approaches. Our experimental ﬁndings are complemented with theoretical insights on loss function design and the beneﬁts of train-validation split. All code is available open-source.
