Tractably modelling distributions over manifolds has long been an important goal in the natural sciences. Recent work has focused on developing general machine learning models to learn such distributions. However, for many applications these distributions must respect manifold symmetries—a trait which most previous models disregard. In this paper, we lay the theoretical foundations for learning symmetry-invariant distributions on arbitrary manifolds via equivariant manifoldﬂows. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by learning quantum ﬁeld theory-motivated invariant SU (n) densities and by correcting meteor impact dataset bias.
