Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a powerful tool to solve the weakly super-vised classiﬁcation in whole slide image (WSI) based pathology diagnosis. How-ever, the current MIL methods are usually based on independent and identical distribution hypothesis, thus neglect the correlation among different instances.To address this problem, we proposed a new framework, called correlated MIL, and provided a proof for convergence. Based on this framework, we devised a Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), which explored both morphological and spatial information. The proposed TransMIL can effectively deal with unbal-anced/balanced and binary/multiple classiﬁcation with great visualization and in-terpretability. We conducted various experiments for three different computational pathology problems and achieved better performance and faster convergence com-pared with state-of-the-art methods. The test AUC for the binary tumor classi-ﬁcation can be up to 93.09% over CAMELYON16 dataset. And the AUC over the cancer subtypes classiﬁcation can be up to 96.03% and 98.82% over TCGA-NSCLC dataset and TCGA-RCC dataset, respectively.
