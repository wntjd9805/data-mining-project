Recently many algorithms were devised for reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation. While they have clear algorithmic distinctions, they also have many implementation differences that are algorithm-independent and some-times under-emphasized. Such mixing of algorithmic novelty and implementation craftsmanship makes rigorous analyses of the sources of performance improve-ments across algorithms difﬁcult. In this work, we focus on a series of off-policy inference-based actor-critic algorithms – MPO, AWR, and SAC – to decouple their algorithmic innovations and implementation decisions. We present uniﬁed derivations through a single control-as-inference objective, where we can catego-rize each algorithm as based on either Expectation-Maximization (EM) or directKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence minimization and treat the rest of speciﬁcations as implementation details. We performed extensive ablation studies, and identiﬁed substantial performance drops whenever implementation details are mismatched for algorithmic choices. These results show which implementation or code details are co-adapted and co-evolved with algorithms, and which are transferable across algorithms: as examples, we identiﬁed that tanh Gaussian policy and network sizes are highly adapted to algorithmic types, while layer normalization and ELU are critical for MPO’s performances but also transfer to noticeable gains in SAC. We hope our work can inspire future work to further demystify sources of performance improvements across multiple algorithms and allow researchers to build on one another’s both algorithmic and implementational innovations.1
