We propose new methods for learning Bayesian networks (BNs) that reliably sup-port fast inference. We utilize maximum state space size as a more ﬁne-grained measure for the BN’s reasoning complexity than the standard treewidth measure, thereby accommodating the possibility that variables range over domains of differ-ent sizes. Our methods combine heuristic BN structure learning algorithms with the recently introduced MaxSAT-powered local improvement method (PeruvembaRamaswamy and Szeider, AAAI’21). Our experiments show that our new learning methods produce BNs that support signiﬁcantly faster exact probabilistic inference than BNs learned with treewidth bounds.
