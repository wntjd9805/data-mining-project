Certiﬁable local robustness, which rigorously precludes small-norm adversarial examples, has received signiﬁcant attention as a means of addressing security concerns in deep learning. However, for some classiﬁcation problems, local robustness is not a natural objective, even in the presence of adversaries; for example, if an image contains two classes of subjects, the correct label for the image may be considered arbitrary between the two, and thus enforcing strict separation between them is unnecessary. In this work, we introduce two relaxed safety properties for classiﬁers that address this observation: (1) relaxed top-k robustness, which serves as the analogue of top-k accuracy; and (2) afﬁnity robustness, which speciﬁes which sets of labels must be separated by a robustness margin, and which can be (cid:15)-close in (cid:96)p space. We show how to construct models that can be efﬁciently certiﬁed against each relaxed robustness property, and trained with very little overhead relative to standard gradient descent. Finally, we demonstrate experimentally that these relaxed variants of robustness are well-suited to several signiﬁcant classiﬁcation problems, leading to lower rejection rates and higher certiﬁed accuracies than can be obtained when certifying “standard” local robustness1.
