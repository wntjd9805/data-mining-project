Transfer Learning has shown great potential to enhance single-agent ReinforcementLearning (RL) efﬁciency. Similarly, Multiagent RL (MARL) can also be acceler-ated if agents can share knowledge with each other. However, it remains a problem of how an agent should learn from other agents. In this paper, we propose a novelMultiagent Policy Transfer Framework (MAPTF) to improve MARL efﬁciency.MAPTF learns which agent’s policy is the best to reuse for each agent and when to terminate it by modeling multiagent policy transfer as the option learning problem.Furthermore, in practice, the option module can only collect all agent’s local expe-riences for update due to the partial observability of the environment. While in this setting, each agent’s experience may be inconsistent with each other, which may cause the inaccuracy and oscillation of the option-value’s estimation. Therefore, we propose a novel option learning algorithm, the successor representation option learning to solve it by decoupling the environment dynamics from rewards and learning the option-value under each agent’s preference. MAPTF can be easily combined with existing deep RL and MARL approaches, and experimental results show it signiﬁcantly boosts the performance of existing methods in both discrete and continuous state spaces.
