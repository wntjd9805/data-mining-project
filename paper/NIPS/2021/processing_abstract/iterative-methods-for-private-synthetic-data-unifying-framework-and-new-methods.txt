We study private synthetic data generation for query release, where the goal is to construct a sanitized version of a sensitive dataset, subject to differential privacy, that approximately preserves the answers to a large collection of statistical queries.We ﬁrst present an algorithmic framework that uniﬁes a long line of iterative al-gorithms in the literature. Under this framework, we propose two new methods.Our ﬁrst method, generative networks with the exponential mechanism (GEM), cir-cumvents computational bottlenecks in algorithms such as MWEM by optimizing over generative models parameterized by neural networks, which capture a rich family of distributions while enabling fast gradient-based optimization. The second method, private entropy projection (PEP), can be viewed as an advanced variant of MWEM that adaptively reuses past query measurements to boost accuracy. We demonstrate that GEM and PEP empirically outperform existing algorithms. Fur-thermore, we show that GEM nicely incorporates prior information from public data while overcoming limitations of PMWPub, the existing state-of-the-art method that also leverages public data.
