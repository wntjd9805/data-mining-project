We provide a ﬁrst-order oracle complexity lower bound for ﬁnding stationary points of min-max optimization problems where the objective function is smooth, nonconvex in the minimization variable, and strongly concave in the maximization variable. We establish a lower bound of Ω (cid:0)√κ(cid:15)−2(cid:1) for deterministic oracles, where (cid:15) deﬁnes the level of approximate stationarity and κ is the condition number.Our lower bound matches the best existing upper bound in the (cid:15) and κ dependence up to logarithmic factors. For stochastic oracles, we provide a lower bound ofΩ (cid:0)√κ(cid:15)−2 + κ1/3(cid:15)−4(cid:1). It suggests that there is a gap between the best existing upper bound O(κ3(cid:15)−4) and our lower bound in the condition number dependence.
