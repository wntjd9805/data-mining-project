Molecular representation learning is the first yet vital step in combining deep learn-ing and molecular science. To push the boundaries of molecular representation learning, we present PhysChem, a novel neural architecture that learns molecu-lar representations via fusing physical and chemical information of molecules.PhysChem is composed of a physicist network (PhysNet) and a chemist network (ChemNet). PhysNet is a neural physical engine that learns molecular conforma-tions through simulating molecular dynamics with parameterized forces; ChemNet implements geometry-aware deep message-passing to learn chemical / biomedical properties of molecules. Two networks specialize in their own tasks and cooperate by providing expertise to each other. By fusing physical and chemical information,PhysChem achieved state-of-the-art performances on MoleculeNet, a standard molecular machine learning benchmark. The effectiveness of PhysChem was further corroborated on cutting-edge datasets of SARS-CoV-2.
