We consider robust variants of the standard optimal transport, named robust optimal transport, where marginal constraints are relaxed via Kullback-Leibler divergence.We show that Sinkhorn-based algorithms can approximate the optimal cost of robust optimal transport in (cid:101)O( n2ε ) time, in which n is the number of supports of the probability distributions and ε is the desired error. Furthermore, we investigate a ﬁxed-support robust barycenter problem between m discrete probability distribu-tions with at most n number of supports and develop an approximating algorithm based on iterative Bregman projections (IBP). For the speciﬁc case m = 2, we show that this algorithm can approximate the optimal barycenter value in (cid:101)O( mn2ε ) time, thus being better than the previous complexity (cid:101)O( mn2ε2 ) of the IBP algorithm for approximating the Wasserstein barycenter.
