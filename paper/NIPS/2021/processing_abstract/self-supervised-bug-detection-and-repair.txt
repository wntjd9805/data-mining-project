Machine learning-based program analyses have recently shown the promise of integrating formal and probabilistic reasoning towards aiding software develop-ment. However, in the absence of large annotated corpora, training these analyses is challenging. Towards addressing this, we present BUGLAB, an approach for self-supervised learning of bug detection and repair. BUGLAB co-trains two models: (1) a detector model that learns to detect and repair bugs in code, (2) a selector model that learns to create buggy code for the detector to use as training data. APython implementation of BUGLAB improves by up to 30% upon baseline meth-ods on a test dataset of 2374 real-life bugs and ﬁnds 19 previously unknown bugs in open-source software.
