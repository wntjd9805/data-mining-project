Recovery of support of a sparse vector from simple measurements is a widely-studied problem, considered under the frameworks of compressed sensing, 1-bit compressed sensing, and more general single index models. We consider gener-alizations of this problem: mixtures of linear regressions, and mixtures of linear classiﬁers, where the goal is to recover supports of multiple sparse vectors using only a small number of possibly noisy linear, and 1-bit measurements respectively.The key challenge is that the measurements from different vectors are randomly mixed. Both of these problems have also received attention recently. In mixtures of linear classiﬁers, an observation corresponds to the side of the queried hyperplane a random unknown vector lies in; whereas in mixtures of linear regressions we observe the projection of a random unknown vector on the queried hyperplane. The primary step in recovering the unknown vectors from the mixture is to ﬁrst identify the support of all the individual component vectors. In this work we study the number of measurements sufﬁcient for recovering the supports of all the component vectors in a mixture in both these models. We provide algorithms that use a number of measurements polynomial in k, log n and quasi-polynomial in `, to recover the support of all the ` unknown vectors in the mixture with high probability when each individual component is a k-sparse n-dimensional vector.
