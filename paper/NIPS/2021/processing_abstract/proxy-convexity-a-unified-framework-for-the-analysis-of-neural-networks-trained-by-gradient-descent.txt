Although the optimization objectives for learning neural networks are highly non-convex, gradient-based methods have been wildly successful at learning neural networks in practice. This juxtaposition has led to a number of recent studies on provable guarantees for neural networks trained by gradient descent. Unfortunately, the techniques in these works are often highly speciﬁc to the particular setup in each problem, making it difﬁcult to generalize across different settings. To address this drawback in the literature, we propose a uniﬁed non-convex optimization framework for the analysis of neural network training. We introduce the notions of proxy convexity and proxy Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) inequalities, which are satisﬁed if the original objective function induces a proxy objective function that is implicitly minimized when using gradient methods. We show that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on objectives satisfying proxy convexity or the proxy PL inequality leads to efﬁcient guarantees for proxy objective functions. We further show that many existing guarantees for neural networks trained by gradient descent can be uniﬁed through proxy convexity and proxy PL inequalities.
