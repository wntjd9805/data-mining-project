Machine learning has successfully framed many sequential decision making prob-lems as either supervised prediction, or optimal decision-making policy iden-tiﬁcation via reinforcement learning. In data-constrained ofﬂine settings, both approaches may fail as they assume fully optimal behavior or rely on exploring alternatives that may not exist. We introduce an inherently different approach that identiﬁes possible “dead-ends” of a state space. We focus on the condition of pa-tients in the intensive care unit, where a “medical dead-end” indicates that a patient will expire, regardless of all potential future treatment sequences. We postulate“treatment security” as avoiding treatments with probability proportional to their chance of leading to dead-ends, present a formal proof, and frame discovery as anRL problem. We then train three independent deep neural models for automated state construction, dead-end discovery and conﬁrmation. Our empirical results discover that dead-ends exist in real clinical data among septic patients, and further reveal gaps between secure treatments and those that were administered.
