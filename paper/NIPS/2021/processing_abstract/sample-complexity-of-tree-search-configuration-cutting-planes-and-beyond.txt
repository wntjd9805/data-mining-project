Cutting-plane methods have enabled remarkable successes in integer program-ming over the last few decades. State-of-the-art solvers integrate a myriad of cutting-plane techniques to speed up the underlying tree-search algorithm used toﬁnd optimal solutions. In this paper we provide sample complexity bounds for cut-selection in branch-and-cut (B&C). Given a training set of integer programs sampled from an application-speciﬁc input distribution and a family of cut selection policies, these guarantees bound the number of samples sufﬁcient to ensure that using any policy in the family, the size of the tree B&C builds on average over the training set is close to the expected size of the tree B&C builds. We ﬁrst bound the sample complexity of learning cutting planes from the canonical family ofChvátal-Gomory cuts. Our bounds handle any number of waves of any number of cuts and are ﬁne tuned to the magnitudes of the constraint coefﬁcients. Next, we prove sample complexity bounds for more sophisticated cut selection policies that use a combination of scoring rules to choose from a family of cuts. Finally, beyond the realm of cutting planes for integer programming, we develop a general abstraction of tree search that captures key components such as node selection and variable selection. For this abstraction, we bound the sample complexity of learning a good policy for building the search tree.
