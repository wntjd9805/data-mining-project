The goal of program synthesis from examples is to ﬁnd a computer program that is consistent with a given set of input-output examples. Most learning-based approaches try to ﬁnd a program that satisﬁes all examples at once. Our work, by contrast, considers an approach that breaks the problem into two stages: (a)ﬁnd programs that satisfy only one example, and (b) leverage these per-example solutions to yield a program that satisﬁes all examples. We introduce the CrossAggregator neural network module based on a multi-head attention mechanism that learns to combine the cues present in these per-example solutions to synthesize a global solution. Evaluation across programs of different lengths and under two different experimental settings reveal that when given the same time budget, our technique signiﬁcantly improves the success rate over PCCoder [30] and other ablation baselines.
