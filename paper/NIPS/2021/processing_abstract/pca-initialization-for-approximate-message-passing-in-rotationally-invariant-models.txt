We study the problem of estimating a rank-1 signal in the presence of rotationally invariant noise—a class of perturbations more general than Gaussian noise. Prin-cipal Component Analysis (PCA) provides a natural estimator, and sharp results on its performance have been obtained in the high-dimensional regime. Recently, an Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithm has been proposed as an alter-native estimator with the potential to improve the accuracy of PCA. However, the existing analysis of AMP requires an initialization that is both correlated with the signal and independent of the noise, which is often unrealistic in practice. In this work, we combine the two methods, and propose to initialize AMP with PCA. Our main result is a rigorous asymptotic characterization of the performance of this estimator. Both the AMP algorithm and its analysis differ from those previously derived in the Gaussian setting: at every iteration, our AMP algorithm requires a speciﬁc term to account for PCA initialization, while in the Gaussian case, PCA initialization affects only the ﬁrst iteration of AMP. The proof is based on a two-phase artiﬁcial AMP that ﬁrst approximates the PCA estimator and then mimics the true AMP. Our numerical simulations show an excellent agreement betweenAMP results and theoretical predictions, and suggest an interesting open direction on achieving Bayes-optimal performance.
