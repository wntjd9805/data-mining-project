Recognizing ﬁne-grained categories remains a challenging task, due to the sub-tle distinctions among different subordinate categories, which results in the need of abundant annotated samples. To alleviate the data-hungry problem, we con-sider the problem of learning novel categories from web data with the support of a clean set of base categories, which is referred to as weak-shot learning. In this setting, we propose a method called SimTrans to transfer pairwise seman-tic similarity from base categories to novel categories. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrstly train a similarity net on clean data, and then leverage the transferred similarity to denoise web training data using two simple yet effective strategies. In addi-tion, we apply adversarial loss on similarity net to enhance the transferability of similarity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our weak-shot setting and our SimTrans method. Datasets and codes are available at https://github.com/bcmi/SimTrans-Weak-Shot-Classiﬁcation.
