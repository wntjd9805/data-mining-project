Parametric stochastic simulators are ubiquitous in science, often featuring high-dimensional input parameters and/or an intractable likelihood. PerformingBayesian parameter inference in this context can be challenging. We present a neu-ral simulation-based inference algorithm which simultaneously offers simulation efﬁciency and fast empirical posterior testability, which is unique among modern algorithms. Our approach is simulation efﬁcient by simultaneously estimating low-dimensional marginal posteriors instead of the joint posterior and by proposing simulations targeted to an observation of interest via a prior suitably truncated by an indicator function. Furthermore, by estimating a locally amortized posterior our algorithm enables efﬁcient empirical tests of the robustness of the inference results.Since scientists cannot access the ground truth, these tests are necessary for trusting inference in real-world applications. We perform experiments on a marginalized version of the simulation-based inference benchmark and two complex and narrow posteriors, highlighting the simulator efﬁciency of our algorithm as well as the quality of the estimated marginal posteriors.
