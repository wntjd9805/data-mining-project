Many applications involve multi-type event data. Understanding the complex inﬂuences of the events on each other is critical to discover useful knowledge and to predict future events and their types. Existing methods either ignore or partially account for these inﬂuences. Recent works use recurrent neural networks to model the event rate. While being highly expressive, they couple all the tem-poral dependencies in a black-box and can hardly extract meaningful knowledge.More important, most methods assume an exponential time decay of the inﬂuence strength, which is over-simpliﬁed and can miss many important strength varying patterns. To overcome these limitations, we propose SPRITE, a Self-adaptablePoint pRocess wIth nonparametric Time dEcays, which can decouple the inﬂuences between every pair of the events and capture various time decays of the inﬂuence strengths. Speciﬁcally, we use an embedding to represent each event type and model the event inﬂuence as an unknown function of the embeddings and time span. We derive a general construction that can cover all possible time-decaying functions. By placing Gaussian process (GP) priors over the latent functions and using Gauss-Legendre quadrature to obtain the integral in the construction, we can ﬂexibly estimate all kinds of time-decaying inﬂuences, without restricting to any speciﬁc form or imposing derivative constraints that bring learning difﬁculties.We then use weight space augmentation of GPs to develop an efﬁcient stochastic variational learning algorithm. We show the advantages of our approach in both the ablation study and real-world applications.
