We introduce a new general identiﬁable framework for principled disentanglement referred to as Structured Nonlinear Independent Component Analysis (SNICA).Our contribution is to extend the identiﬁability theory of deep generative models for a very broad class of structured models. While previous works have shown identiﬁability for speciﬁc classes of time-series models, our theorems extend this to more general temporal structures as well as to models with more complex structures such as spatial dependencies. In particular, we establish the major result that identiﬁability for this framework holds even in the presence of noise of unknown distribution. Finally, as an example of our framework’s ﬂexibility, we introduce the ﬁrst nonlinear ICA model for time-series that combines the following very useful properties: it accounts for both nonstationarity and autocorrelation in a fully unsupervised setting; performs dimensionality reduction; models hidden states; and enables principled estimation and inference by variational maximum-likelihood.
