Federated learning (FL) is a challenging setting for optimization due to the het-erogeneity of the data across different clients which can cause a client drift phe-nomenon.In fact, designing an algorithm for FL that is uniformly better than simple centralized training has been a major open problem thus far. In this work, we propose a general algorithmic framework, MIME, which i) mitigates client drift and ii) adapts an arbitrary centralized optimization algorithm such as mo-mentum and Adam to the cross-device federated learning setting. MIME uses a combination of control-variates and server-level optimizer state (e.g. momentum) at every client-update step to ensure that each local update mimics that of the cen-tralized method run on i.i.d. data. We prove a reduction result showing that MIME can translate the convergence of a generic algorithm in the centralized setting into convergence in the federated setting. Moreover, we show that, when combined with momentum-based variance reduction, MIME is provably faster than any cen-tralized method–the ﬁrst such result. We also perform a thorough experimental exploration of MIME’s performance on real world datasets (implemented here).
