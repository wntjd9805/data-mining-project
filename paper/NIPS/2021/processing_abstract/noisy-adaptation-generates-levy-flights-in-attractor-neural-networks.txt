Lévy ﬂights describe a special class of random walks whose step sizes satisfy a power-law tailed distribution. As being an efﬁcient searching strategy in unknown environments, Lévy ﬂights are widely observed in animal foraging behaviors.Recent studies further showed that human cognitive functions also exhibit the characteristics of Lévy ﬂights. Despite being a general phenomenon, the neural mechanism at the circuit level for generating Lévy ﬂights remains largely unclear.Here, we investigate how Lévy ﬂights can be achieved in attractor neural networks.To elucidate the underlying mechanism clearly, we ﬁrst study continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs), and ﬁnd that noisy neural adaptation, exempliﬁed by spike frequency adaptation (SFA) in this work, can generate Lévy ﬂights represent-ing transitions of the network state in the attractor space. Speciﬁcally, the strength of SFA deﬁnes a travelling wave boundary, below which the network state displays local Brownian motion, and above which the network state displays long-jump motion. Noises in neural adaptation cause the network state to intermittently switch between these two motion modes, manifesting the characteristics of Lévy ﬂights.We further extend the study to a general attractor neural network, and demon-strate that our model can explain the Lévy-ﬂight phenomenon observed during free memory retrieval of humans. We hope that this study will give us insight into understanding the neural mechanism for optimal information processing in the brain.
