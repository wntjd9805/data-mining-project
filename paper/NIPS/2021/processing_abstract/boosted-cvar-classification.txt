Many modern machine learning tasks require models with high tail performance, i.e. high performance over the worst-off samples in the dataset. This problem has been widely studied in ﬁelds such as algorithmic fairness, class imbalance, and risk-sensitive decision making. A popular approach to maximize the model’s tail performance is to minimize the CVaR (Conditional Value at Risk) loss, which computes the average risk over the tails of the loss. However, for classiﬁcation tasks where models are evaluated by the 0/1 loss, we show that if the classiﬁers are deterministic, then the minimizer of the average 0/1 loss also minimizes the CVaR 0/1 loss, suggesting that CVaR loss minimization is not helpful without additional assumptions. We circumvent this negative result by minimizing the CVaR loss over randomized classiﬁers, for which the minimizers of the average 0/1 loss and the CVaR 0/1 loss are no longer the same, so minimizing the latter can lead to better tail performance. To learn such randomized classiﬁers, we propose theBoosted CVaR Classiﬁcation framework which is motivated by a direct relationship between CVaR and a classical boosting algorithm called LPBoost. Based on this framework, we design an algorithm called α-AdaLPBoost. We empirically evaluate our proposed algorithm on four benchmark datasets and show that it achieves higher tail performance than deterministic model training methods.
