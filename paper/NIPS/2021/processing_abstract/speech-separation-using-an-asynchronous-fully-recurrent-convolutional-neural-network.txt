Recent advances in the design of neural network architectures, in particular those specialized in modeling sequences, have provided signiﬁcant improvements in speech separation performance. In this work, we propose to use a bio-inspired architecture called Fully Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network (FRCNN) to solve the separation task. This model contains bottom-up, top-down and lateral connections to fuse information processed at various time-scales represented by stages. In contrast to the traditional approach updating stages in parallel, we propose to ﬁrst update the stages one by one in the bottom-up direction, then fuse information from adjacent stages simultaneously and ﬁnally fuse information from all stages to the bottom stage together. Experiments showed that this asynchronous updating scheme achieved signiﬁcantly better results with much fewer parameters than the traditional synchronous updating scheme. In addition, the proposed model achieved good balance between speech separation accuracy and computational efﬁciency as compared to other state-of-the-art models on three benchmark datasets.
