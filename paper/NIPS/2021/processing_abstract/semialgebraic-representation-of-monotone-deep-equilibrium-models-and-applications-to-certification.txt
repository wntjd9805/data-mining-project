Deep equilibrium models are based on implicitly deﬁned functional relations and have shown competitive performance compared with the traditional deep networks.Monotone operator equilibrium networks (monDEQ) retain interesting performance with additional theoretical guaranties. Existing certiﬁcation tools for classical deep networks cannot directly be applied to monDEQs for which much fewer tools exist.We introduce a semialgebraic representation for ReLU based monDEQs which allows to approximate the corresponding input output relation by semideﬁnite programming (SDP). We present several applications to network certiﬁcation and obtain SDP models for the following problems : robustness certiﬁcation, Lipschitz constant estimation, ellipsoidal uncertainty propagation. We use these models to certify robustness of monDEQs w.r.t. a general Lq norm. Experimental results show that the proposed models outperform existing approaches for monDEQ certiﬁcation.Furthermore, our investigations suggest that monDEQs are much more robust toL2 perturbations than L∞ perturbations.
