The stochastic multi-arm bandit problem has been extensively studied under stan-dard assumptions on the arm’s distribution (e.g bounded with known support, exponential family, etc). These assumptions are suitable for many real-world prob-lems but sometimes they require knowledge (on tails for instance) that may not be precisely accessible to the practitioner, raising the question of the robustness of bandit algorithms to model misspeciﬁcation. In this paper we study a genericDirichlet Sampling (DS) algorithm, based on pairwise comparisons of empirical indices computed with re-sampling of the arms’ observations and a data-dependent exploration bonus. We show that different variants of this strategy achieve provably optimal regret guarantees when the distributions are bounded and logarithmic regret for semi-bounded distributions with a mild quantile condition. We also show that a simple tuning achieve robustness with respect to a large class of unbounded distri-butions, at the cost of slightly worse than logarithmic asymptotic regret. We ﬁnally provide numerical experiments showing the merits of DS in a decision-making problem on synthetic agriculture data.
