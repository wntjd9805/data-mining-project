We study the problem of the identiﬁcation of m arms with largest means under aﬁxed error rate δ (ﬁxed-conﬁdence Top-m identiﬁcation), for misspeciﬁed linear bandit models. This problem is motivated by practical applications, especially in medicine and recommendation systems, where linear models are popular due to their simplicity and the existence of efﬁcient algorithms, but in which data inevitably deviates from linearity. In this work, we ﬁrst derive a tractable lower bound on the sample complexity of any δ-correct algorithm for the general Top-m identiﬁcation problem. We show that knowing the scale of the deviation from linearity is necessary to exploit the structure of the problem. We then describe theﬁrst algorithm for this setting, which is both practical and adapts to the amount of misspeciﬁcation. We derive an upper bound to its sample complexity which conﬁrms this adaptivity and that matches the lower bound when δ → 0. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on both synthetic and real-world data, showing competitive performance with respect to existing baselines.
