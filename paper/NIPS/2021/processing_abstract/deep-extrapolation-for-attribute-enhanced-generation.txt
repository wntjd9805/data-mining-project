Attribute extrapolation in sample generation is challenging for deep neural net-works operating beyond the training distribution. We formulate a new task for extrapolation in sequence generation, focusing on natural language and proteins, and propose GENhance, a generative framework that enhances attributes through a learned latent space. Trained on movie reviews and a computed protein sta-bility dataset, GENhance can generate strongly-positive text reviews and highly stable protein sequences without being exposed to similar data during training.We release our benchmark tasks and models to contribute to the study of gen-erative modeling extrapolation and data-driven design in biology and chemistry: https://github.com/salesforce/genhance.
