Hypergraphs are important objects to model ternary or higher-order relations of objects, and have a number of applications in analysing many complex datasetsIn this work we study a new heat diffusion process in occurring in practice. hypergraphs, and employ this process to design a polynomial-time algorithm that approximately ﬁnds bipartite components in a hypergraph. We theoretically prove the performance of our proposed algorithm, and compare it against the previous state-of-the-art through extensive experimental analysis on both synthetic and real-world datasets. We ﬁnd that our new algorithm consistently and signiﬁcantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art across a wide range of hypergraphs.
