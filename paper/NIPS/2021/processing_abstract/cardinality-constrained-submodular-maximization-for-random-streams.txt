We consider the problem of maximizing submodular functions in single-pass streaming and secretaries-with-shortlists models, both with random arrival or-der. For cardinality constrained monotone functions, Agrawal, Shadravan, andStein [ASS19] gave a single-pass (1 − 1/e − ε)-approximation algorithm using only linear memory, but their exponential dependence on ε makes it impractical even for ε = 0.1. We simplify both the algorithm and the analysis, obtaining an exponential improvement in the ε-dependence (in particular, O(k/ε) memory).Extending these techniques, we also give a simple (1/e − ε)-approximation for non-monotone functions in O(k/ε) memory. For the monotone case, we also give a corresponding unconditional hardness barrier of 1 − 1/e + ε for single-pass algorithms in randomly ordered streams, even assuming unlimited computation.Finally, we show that the algorithms are simple to implement and work well on real world datasets.
