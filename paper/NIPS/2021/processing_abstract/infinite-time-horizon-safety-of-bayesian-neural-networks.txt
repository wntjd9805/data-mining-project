Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) place distributions over the weights of a neural network to model uncertainty in the data and the network’s prediction. We consider the problem of verifying safety when running a Bayesian neural network policy in a feedback loop with inﬁnite time horizon systems. Compared to the existing sampling-based approaches, which are inapplicable to the inﬁnite time horizon setting, we train a separate deterministic neural network that serves as an inﬁnite time horizon safety certiﬁcate. In particular, we show that the certiﬁcate network guarantees the safety of the system over a subset of the BNN weight posterior’s support. Our method ﬁrst computes a safe weight set and then alters the BNN’s weight posterior to reject samples outside this set. Moreover, we show how to extend our approach to a safe-exploration reinforcement learning setting, in order to avoid unsafe trajectories during the training of the policy. We evaluate our approach on a series of reinforcement learning benchmarks, including non-Lyapunovian safety speciﬁcations.
