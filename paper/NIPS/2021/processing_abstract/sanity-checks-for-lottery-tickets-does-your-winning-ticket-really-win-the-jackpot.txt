There have been long-standing controversies and inconsistencies over the exper-iment setup and criteria for identifying the “winning ticket” in literature. To reconcile such, we revisit the deﬁnition of lottery ticket hypothesis, with compre-hensive and more rigorous conditions. Under our new deﬁnition, we show concrete evidence to clarify whether the winning ticket exists across the major DNN architec-tures and/or applications. Through extensive experiments, we perform quantitative analysis on the correlations between winning tickets and various experimental factors, and empirically study the patterns of our observations. We ﬁnd that the key training hyperparameters, such as learning rate and training epochs, as well as the architecture characteristics such as capacities and residual connections, are all highly correlated with whether and when the winning tickets can be identiﬁed.Based on our analysis, we summarize a guideline for parameter settings in regards of speciﬁc architecture characteristics, which we hope to catalyze the research progress on the topic of lottery ticket hypothesis.
