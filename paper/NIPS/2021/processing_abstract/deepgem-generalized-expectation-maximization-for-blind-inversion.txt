Typically, inversion algorithms assume that a forward model, which relates a source to its resulting measurements, is known and ﬁxed. Using collected indirect measurements and the forward model, the goal becomes to recover the source.When the forward model is unknown, or imperfect, artifacts due to model mis-match occur in the recovery of the source. In this paper, we study the problem of blind inversion: solving an inverse problem with unknown or imperfect knowl-edge of the forward model parameters. We propose DeepGEM, a variationalExpectation-Maximization (EM) framework that can be used to solve for the un-known parameters of the forward model in an unsupervised manner. DeepGEM makes use of a normalizing ﬂow generative network to efﬁciently capture complex posterior distributions, which leads to more accurate evaluation of the source’s posterior distribution used in EM. We showcase the effectiveness of our DeepGEM approach by achieving strong performance on the challenging problem of blind seismic tomography, where we signiﬁcantly outperform the standard method used in seismology. We also demonstrate the generality of DeepGEM by applying it to a simple case of blind deconvolution.
