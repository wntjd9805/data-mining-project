Adapting large-scale pretrained language models to downstream tasks viaﬁne-tuning is the standard method for achieving state-of-the-art performance onNLP benchmarks. However, ﬁne-tuning all weights of models with millions or billions of parameters is sample-inefﬁcient, unstable in low-resource settings, and wasteful as it requires storing a separate copy of the model for each task. Recent work has developed parameter-efﬁcient ﬁne-tuning methods, but these approaches either still require a relatively large number of parameters or underperform standardﬁne-tuning.In this work, we propose COMPACTER, a method for ﬁne-tuning large-scale language models with a better trade-off between task performance and the number of trainable parameters than prior work. COMPACTER accomplishes this by building on top of ideas from adapters, low-rank optimization, and parameterized hypercomplex multiplication layers.Speciﬁcally, COMPACTER inserts task-speciﬁc weight matrices into a pretrained model’s weights, which are computed efﬁciently as a sum of Kronecker products be-tween shared “slow” weights and “fast” rank-one matrices deﬁned per COMPACTER layer. By only training 0.047% of a pretrained model’s parameters, COMPACTER performs on par with standard ﬁne-tuning on GLUE and outperforms standardﬁne-tuning on SuperGLUE and low-resource settings.
