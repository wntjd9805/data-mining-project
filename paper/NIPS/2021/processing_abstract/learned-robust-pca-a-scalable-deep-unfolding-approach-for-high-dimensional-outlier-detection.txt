Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) is a critical tool in modern machine learning, which detects outliers in the task of low-rank matrix reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a scalable and learnable non-convex approach for high-dimensional RPCA problems, which we call Learned Robust PCA (LRPCA).LRPCA is highly efﬁcient, and its free parameters can be effectively learned to optimize via deep unfolding. Moreover, we extend deep unfolding from ﬁnite itera-tions to inﬁnite iterations via a novel feedforward-recurrent-mixed neural network model. We establish the recovery guarantee of LRPCA under mild assumptions forRPCA. Numerical experiments show that LRPCA outperforms the state-of-the-artRPCA algorithms, such as ScaledGD and AltProj, on both synthetic datasets and real-world applications.
