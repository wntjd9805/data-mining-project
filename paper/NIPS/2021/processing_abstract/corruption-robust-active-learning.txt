We conduct theoretical studies on streaming-based active learning for binary classi-ﬁcation under unknown adversarial label corruptions. In this setting, every time before the learner observes a sample, the adversary decides whether to corrupt the label or not. First, we show that, in a benign corruption setting (which includes the misspeciﬁcation setting as a special case), with a slight enlargement on the hypoth-esis elimination threshold, the classical RobustCAL framework can (surprisingly) achieve nearly the same label complexity guarantee as in the non-corrupted setting.However, this algorithm can fail in the general corruption setting. To resolve this drawback, we propose a new algorithm which is provably correct without any assumptions on the presence of corruptions. Furthermore, this algorithm enjoys the minimax label complexity in the non-corrupted setting (which is achieved byRobustCAL) and only requires ˜O(Ctotal) additional labels in the corrupted setting to achieve O(ε + Ctotal n ), where ε is the target accuracy, Ctotal is the total number of corruptions and n is the total number of unlabeled samples.
