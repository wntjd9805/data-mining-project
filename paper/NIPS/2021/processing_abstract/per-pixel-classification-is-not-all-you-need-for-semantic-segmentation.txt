Modern approaches typically formulate semantic segmentation as a per-pixel classi-ﬁcation task, while instance-level segmentation is handled with an alternative mask classiﬁcation. Our key insight: mask classiﬁcation is sufﬁciently general to solve both semantic- and instance-level segmentation tasks in a uniﬁed manner using the exact same model, loss, and training procedure. Following this observation, we propose MaskFormer, a simple mask classiﬁcation model which predicts a set of binary masks, each associated with a single global class label prediction.Overall, the proposed mask classiﬁcation-based method simpliﬁes the landscape of effective approaches to semantic and panoptic segmentation tasks and shows excellent empirical results. In particular, we observe that MaskFormer outperforms per-pixel classiﬁcation baselines when the number of classes is large. Our mask classiﬁcation-based method outperforms both current state-of-the-art semantic (55.6 mIoU on ADE20K) and panoptic segmentation (52.7 PQ on COCO) models.1
