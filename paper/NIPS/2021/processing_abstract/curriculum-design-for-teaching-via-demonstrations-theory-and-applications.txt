We consider the problem of teaching via demonstrations in sequential decision-making settings. In particular, we study how to design a personalized curriculum over demonstrations to speed up the learner’s convergence. We provide a uniﬁed curriculum strategy for two popular learner models: Maximum Causal EntropyInverse Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt-IRL) and Cross-Entropy BehavioralCloning (CrossEnt-BC). Our uniﬁed strategy induces a ranking over demonstra-tions based on a notion of difﬁculty scores computed w.r.t. the teacher’s optimal policy and the learner’s current policy. Compared to the state of the art, our strategy doesn’t require access to the learner’s internal dynamics and still enjoys similar convergence guarantees under mild technical conditions. Furthermore, we adapt our curriculum strategy to the setting where no teacher agent is present using task-speciﬁc difﬁculty scores. Experiments on a synthetic car driving environment and navigation-based environments demonstrate the effectiveness of our curriculum strategy.
