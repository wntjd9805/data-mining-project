We propose to personalize a 2D human pose estimator given a set of test images of a person without using any manual annotations. While there is a signiﬁcant advancement in human pose estimation, it is still very challenging for a model to generalize to different unknown environments and unseen persons. Instead of using a ﬁxed model for every test case, we adapt our pose estimator during test time to exploit person-speciﬁc information. We ﬁrst train our model on diverse data with both a supervised and a self-supervised pose estimation objectives jointly.We use a Transformer model to build a transformation between the self-supervised keypoints and the supervised keypoints. During test time, we personalize and adapt our model by ﬁne-tuning with the self-supervised objective. The pose is then improved by transforming the updated self-supervised keypoints. We experiment with multiple datasets and show signiﬁcant improvements on pose estimations with our self-supervised personalization.
