The generalization mystery of overparametrized deep nets has motivated efforts to understand how gradient descent (GD) converges to low-loss solutions that generalize well. Real-life neural networks are initialized from small random values and trained with cross-entropy loss for classiﬁcation (unlike the "lazy" or "NTK" regime of training where analysis was more successful), and a recent sequence of results (Lyu and Li, 2020; Chizat and Bach, 2020; Ji and Telgarsky, 2020a) provide theoretical evidence that GD may converge to the "max-margin" solution with zero loss, which presumably generalizes well. However, the global optimality of margin is proved only in some settings where neural nets are inﬁnitely or exponentially wide. The current paper is able to establish this global optimality for two-layerLeaky ReLU nets trained with gradient ﬂow on linearly separable and symmetric data, regardless of the width. The analysis also gives some theoretical justiﬁcation for recent empirical ﬁndings (Kalimeris et al., 2019) on the so-called simplicity bias of GD towards linear or other "simple" classes of solutions, especially early in training. On the pessimistic side, the paper suggests that such results are fragile.A simple data manipulation can make gradient ﬂow converge to a linear classiﬁer with suboptimal margin.
