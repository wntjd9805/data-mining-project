Contrastive self-supervised learning has outperformed supervised pretraining on many downstream tasks like segmentation and object detection. However, current methods are still primarily applied to curated datasets like ImageNet. In this paper, we ﬁrst study how biases in the dataset affect existing methods. Our results show that an approach like MoCo [19] works surprisingly well across: (i) object- versus scene-centric, (ii) uniform versus long-tailed and (iii) general versus domain-speciﬁc datasets. Second, given the generality of the approach, we try to realize further gains with minor modiﬁcations. We show that learning additional invariances - through the use of multi-scale cropping, stronger augmentations and nearest neighbors - improves the representations. Finally, we observe that MoCo learns spatially structured representations when trained with a multi-crop strategy.The representations can be used for semantic segment retrieval and video instance segmentation without ﬁnetuning. Moreover, the results are on par with specialized models. We hope this work will serve as a useful study for other researchers. The code and models are available 2.
