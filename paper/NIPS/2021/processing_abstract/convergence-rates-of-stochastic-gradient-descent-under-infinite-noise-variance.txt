Recent studies have provided both empirical and theoretical evidence illustrating that heavy tails can emerge in stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in various scenar-ios. Such heavy tails potentially result in iterates with diverging variance, which hinders the use of conventional convergence analysis techniques that rely on the existence of the second-order moments. In this paper, we provide convergence guarantees for SGD under a state-dependent and heavy-tailed noise with a poten-tially inﬁnite variance, for a class of strongly convex objectives. In the case where the p-th moment of the noise exists for some p ∈ [1, 2), we ﬁrst identify a condition on the Hessian, coined ‘p-positive (semi-)deﬁniteness’, that leads to an interesting interpolation between the positive semi-deﬁnite cone (p = 2) and the cone of diagonally dominant matrices with non-negative diagonal entries (p = 1). Under this condition, we provide a convergence rate for the distance to the global optimum in Lp. Furthermore, we provide a generalized central limit theorem, which shows that the properly scaled Polyak-Ruppert averaging converges weakly to a multi-variate α-stable random vector. Our results indicate that even under heavy-tailed noise with inﬁnite variance, SGD can converge to the global optimum without necessitating any modiﬁcation neither to the loss function nor to the algorithm itself, as typically required in robust statistics. We demonstrate the implications of our results over misspeciﬁed models, in the presence of heavy-tailed data.
