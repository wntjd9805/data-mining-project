Existing approaches to unsupervised object discovery (UOD) do not scale up to large datasets without approximations that compromise their performance. We propose a novel formulation of UOD as a ranking problem, amenable to the arsenal of distributed methods available for eigenvalue problems and link analysis.Through the use of self-supervised features, we also demonstrate the Ô¨Årst effective fully unsupervised pipeline for UOD. Extensive experiments on COCO [42] andOpenImages [35] show that, in the single-object discovery setting where a single prominent object is sought in each image, the proposed LOD (Large-scale ObjectDiscovery) approach is on par with, or better than the state of the art for medium-scale datasets (up to 120K images), and over 37% better than the only other algorithms capable of scaling up to 1.7M images. In the multi-object discovery setting where multiple objects are sought in each image, the proposed LOD is over 14% better in average precision (AP) than all other methods for datasets ranging from 20K to 1.7M images. Using self-supervised features, we also show that the proposed method obtains state-of-the-art UOD performance on OpenImages1.Figure 1: Sample UOD results obtained by LOD on the OpenImages dataset [35] which contains 1.7M images.Ground-truth boxes are shown in yellow, and predictions are in red.
