Work in deep clustering focuses on ﬁnding a single partition of data. However, high-dimensional data, such as images, typically feature multiple interesting char-acteristics one could cluster over. For example, images of objects against a back-ground could be clustered over the shape of the object and separately by the colour of the background. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Facet Clustering VariationalAutoencoders (MFCVAE), a novel class of variational autoencoders with a hierarchy of latent variables, each with a Mixture-of-Gaussians prior, that learns multiple clusterings simultaneously, and is trained fully unsupervised and end-to-end. MFC-VAE uses a progressively-trained ladder architecture which leads to highly stable performance. We provide novel theoretical results for optimising the ELBO analyt-ically with respect to the categorical variational posterior distribution, correcting earlier inﬂuential theoretical work. On image benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach separates out and clusters over different aspects of the data in a disentan-gled manner. We also show other advantages of our model: the compositionality of its latent space and that it provides controlled generation of samples.
