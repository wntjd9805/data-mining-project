We study the reinforcement learning problem for discounted Markov DecisionProcesses (MDPs) under the tabular setting. We propose a model-based algorithm named UCBVI-γ, which is based on the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle and the Bernstein-type bonus. We show that UCBVI-γ achieves an (cid:101)O(cid:0)√SAT /(1 − γ)1.5(cid:1) regret, where S is the number of states, A is the number of actions, γ is the discount factor and T is the number of steps. In addition, we construct a class of hard MDPs and show that for any algorithm, the expected regret is at least (cid:101)Ω(cid:0)√SAT /(1 − γ)1.5(cid:1). Our upper bound matches the minimax lower bound up to logarithmic factors, which suggests that UCBVI-γ is nearly minimax optimal for discounted MDPs.
