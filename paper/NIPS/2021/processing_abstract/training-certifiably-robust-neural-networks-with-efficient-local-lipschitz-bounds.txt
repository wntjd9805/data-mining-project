Certiﬁed robustness is a desirable property for deep neural networks in safety-critical applications, and popular training algorithms can certify robustness of a neural network by computing a global bound on its Lipschitz constant. However, such a bound is often loose: it tends to over-regularize the neural network and de-grade its natural accuracy. A tighter Lipschitz bound may provide a better tradeoff between natural and certiﬁed accuracy, but is generally hard to compute exactly due to non-convexity of the network. In this work, we propose an efﬁcient and trainable local Lipschitz upper bound by considering the interactions between activation functions (e.g. ReLU) and weight matrices. Speciﬁcally, when comput-ing the induced norm of a weight matrix, we eliminate the corresponding rows and columns where the activation function is guaranteed to be a constant in the neighborhood of each given data point, which provides a provably tighter bound than the global Lipschitz constant of the neural network. Our method can be used as a plug-in module to tighten the Lipschitz bound in many certiﬁable training algorithms. Furthermore, we propose to clip activation functions (e.g., ReLU andMaxMin) with a learnable upper threshold and a sparsity loss to assist the network to achieve an even tighter local Lipschitz bound. Experimentally, we show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both clean and certiﬁed accuracy on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and TinyImageNet datasets with various network architectures.
