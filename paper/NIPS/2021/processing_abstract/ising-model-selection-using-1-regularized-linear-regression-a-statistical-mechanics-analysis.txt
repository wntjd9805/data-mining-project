We theoretically analyze the typical learning performance of (cid:96)1-regularized linear regression ((cid:96)1-LinR) for Ising model selection using the replica method from statis-tical mechanics. For typical random regular graphs in the paramagnetic phase, an accurate estimate of the typical sample complexity of (cid:96)1-LinR is obtained. Remark-ably, despite the model misspeciﬁcation, (cid:96)1-LinR is model selection consistent with the same order of sample complexity as (cid:96)1-regularized logistic regression ((cid:96)1-LogR), i.e., M = O (log N ), where N is the number of variables of the Ising model. Moreover, we provide an efﬁcient method to accurately predict the non-asymptotic behavior of (cid:96)1-LinR for moderate M, N , such as precision and recall.Simulations show a fairly good agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results, even for graphs with many loops, which supports our ﬁndings.Although this paper mainly focuses on (cid:96)1-LinR, our method is readily applicable for precisely characterizing the typical learning performances of a wide class of (cid:96)1-regularized M -estimators including (cid:96)1-LogR and interaction screening.
