Hierarchical clustering studies a recursive partition of a data set into clusters of successively smaller size, and is a fundamental problem in data analysis. In this work we study the cost function for hierarchical clustering introduced byDasgupta [12], and present two polynomial-time approximation algorithms: Ourﬁrst result is an O(1)-approximation algorithm for graphs of high conductance.Our simple construction bypasses complicated recursive routines of ﬁnding sparse cuts known in the literature (e.g., [6, 11]). Our second and main result is an O(1)-approximation algorithm for a wide family of graphs that exhibit a well-deﬁned structure of clusters. This result generalises the previous state-of-the-art [10], which holds only for graphs generated from stochastic models. The signiﬁcance of our work is demonstrated by the empirical analysis on both synthetic and real-world data sets, on which our presented algorithm outperforms the previously proposed algorithm for graphs with a well-deﬁned cluster structure [10].
