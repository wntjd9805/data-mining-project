We propose a novel neural representation for videos (NeRV) which encodes videos in neural networks. Unlike conventional representations that treat videos as frame sequences, we represent videos as neural networks taking frame index as input.Given a frame index, NeRV outputs the corresponding RGB image. Video encoding in NeRV is simply ﬁtting a neural network to video frames and decoding process is a simple feedforward operation. As an image-wise implicit representation,NeRV output the whole image and shows great efﬁciency compared to pixel-wise implicit representation, improving the encoding speed by 25× to 70×, the decoding speed by 38× to 132×, while achieving better video quality. With such a representation, we can treat videos as neural networks, simplifying several video-related tasks. For example, conventional video compression methods are restricted by a long and complex pipeline, speciﬁcally designed for the task. In contrast, withNeRV, we can use any neural network compression method as a proxy for video compression, and achieve comparable performance to traditional frame-based video compression approaches (H.264, HEVC etc.). Besides compression, we demonstrate the generalization of NeRV for video denoising. The source code and pre-trained model can be found at https://github.com/haochen-rye/NeRV.git.
