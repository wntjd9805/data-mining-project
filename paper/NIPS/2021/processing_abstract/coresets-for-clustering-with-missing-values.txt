for coresets k-MEANSWe provide the ﬁrst coreset for clustering points in Rd that have multiple missing values (coordinates). Previous coreset constructions only allow one missing co-ordinate. The challenge in this setting is that objective functions, like k-MEANS, are evaluated only on the set of available (non-missing) coordinates, which varies across points. Recall that an (cid:15)-coreset of a large dataset is a small proxy, usually a reweighted subset of points, that (1 + (cid:15))-approximates the clustering objective for every possible center set. sizeOur (jk)O(min(j,k))((cid:15)−1d log n)2, where n is the number of data points, d is the dimension and j is the maximum number of missing coordinates for each data point. We further design an algorithm to construct these coresets in near-linear time, and consequently improve a recent quadratic-time PTAS for k-MEANS with missing values [Eiben et al., SODA 2021] to near-linear time.We validate our coreset construction, which is based on importance sampling and is easy to implement, on various real data sets. Our coreset exhibits a ﬂexible tradeoff between coreset size and accuracy, and generally outperforms the uniform-sampling baseline. Furthermore, it signiﬁcantly speeds up a Lloyd’s-style heuristic for k-MEANS with missing values. k-MEDIAN clustering have and
