The theory of spectral ﬁltering is a remarkable tool to understand the statistical properties of learning with kernels. For least squares, it allows to derive various regularization schemes that yield faster convergence rates of the excess risk than with Tikhonov regularization. This is typically achieved by leveraging classical assumptions called source and capacity conditions, which characterize the difﬁ-culty of the learning task. In order to understand estimators derived from other loss functions, Marteau-Ferey et al. [1] have extended the theory of Tikhonov reg-ularization to generalized self concordant loss functions (GSC), which contain, e.g., the logistic loss. In this paper, we go a step further and show that fast and op-timal rates can be achieved for GSC by using the iterated Tikhonov regularization scheme, which is intrinsically related to the proximal point method in optimiza-tion, and overcomes the limitation of the classical Tikhonov regularization.
