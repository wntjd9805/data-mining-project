We consider ofﬂine reinforcement learning (RL) with heterogeneous agents under severe data scarcity, i.e., we only observe a single historical trajectory for every agent under an unknown, potentially sub-optimal policy. We ﬁnd that the performance of state-of-the-art ofﬂine and model-based RL methods degrade signiﬁcantly given such limited data availability, even for commonly perceived “solved” benchmark settings such as “MountainCar” and “CartPole”. To address this challenge, we propose PerSim, a model-based ofﬂine RL approach which ﬁrst learns a personalized simulator for each agent by collectively using the historical trajectories across all agents, prior to learning a policy. We do so by positing that the transition dynamics across agents can be represented as a latent function of latent factors associated with agents, states, and actions; subsequently, we theoretically establish that this function is well-approximated by a “low-rank” decomposition of separable agent, state, and action latent functions. This representation suggests a simple, regularized neural network architecture to effectively learn the transition dynamics per agent, even with scarce, ofﬂine data. We perform extensive experiments across several benchmark environments and RL methods. The consistent improvement of our approach, measured in terms of both state dynamics prediction and eventual reward, conﬁrms the efﬁcacy of our framework in leveraging limited historical data to simultaneously learn personalized policies across agents.
