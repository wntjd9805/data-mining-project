This paper studies model-based bandit and reinforcement learning (RL) with non-linear function approximations. We propose to study convergence to approximate local maxima because we show that global convergence is statistically intractable even for one-layer neural net bandit with a deterministic reward. For both non-linear bandit and RL, the paper presents a model-based algorithm, Virtual Ascent with Online Model Learner (ViOlin), which provably converges to a local max-imum with sample complexity that only depends on the sequential Rademacher complexity of the model class. Our results imply novel sample complexity bounds on several concrete settings such as linear bandit with ﬁnite or sparse model class, and two-layer neural net bandit. A key algorithmic insight is that optimism may lead to over-exploration even for two-layer neural net model class. On the other hand, for convergence to local maxima, it sufﬁces to maximize the virtual return if the model can also reasonably predict the gradient and Hessian of the real return.
