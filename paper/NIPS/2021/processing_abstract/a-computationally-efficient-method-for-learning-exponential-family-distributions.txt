We consider the question of learning the natural parameters of a k-parameter mini-mal exponential family from i.i.d. samples in a computationally and statistically efﬁcient manner. We focus on the setting where the support as well as the natural parameters are appropriately bounded. While the traditional maximum likelihood estimator for this class of exponential family is consistent, asymptotically normal, and asymptotically efﬁcient, evaluating it is computationally hard. In this work, we propose a computationally efﬁcient estimator that is consistent as well as asymp-totically normal under mild conditions. We provide ﬁnite sample guarantees to achieve an ((cid:96)2) error of α in the parameter estimation with sample complexityO(poly(k/α)) and computational complexity O(poly(k/α)). To establish these results, we show that, at the population level, our method can be viewed as the maximum likelihood estimation of a re-parameterized distribution belonging to the same class of exponential family.
