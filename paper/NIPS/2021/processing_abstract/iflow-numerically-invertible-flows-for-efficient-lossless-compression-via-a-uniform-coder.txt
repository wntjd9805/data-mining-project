It was estimated that the world produced 59ZB (5.9 × 1013GB) of data in 2020, resulting in the enormous costs of both data storage and transmission. Fortunately, recent advances in deep generative models have spearheaded a new class of so-called "neural compression" algorithms, which signiﬁcantly outperform traditional codecs in terms of compression ratio. Unfortunately, the application of neural compression garners little commercial interest due to its limited bandwidth; there-fore, developing highly efﬁcient frameworks is of critical practical importance. In this paper, we discuss lossless compression using normalizing ﬂows which have demonstrated a great capacity for achieving high compression ratios. As such, we introduce iFlow, a new method for achieving efﬁcient lossless compression. Weﬁrst propose Modular Scale Transform (MST) and a novel family of numerically invertible ﬂow transformations based on MST. Then we introduce the UniformBase Conversion System (UBCS), a fast uniform-distribution codec incorporated into iFlow, enabling efﬁcient compression. iFlow achieves state-of-the-art compres-sion ratios and is 5× quicker than other high-performance schemes. Furthermore, the techniques presented in this paper can be used to accelerate coding time for a broad class of ﬂow-based algorithms.
