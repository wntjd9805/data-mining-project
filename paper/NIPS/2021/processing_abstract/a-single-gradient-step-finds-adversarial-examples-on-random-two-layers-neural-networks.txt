Daniely and Schacham [2020] recently showed that gradient descent ﬁnds adver-sarial examples on random undercomplete two-layers ReLU neural networks. The term “undercomplete” refers to the fact that their proof only holds when the number of neurons is a vanishing fraction of the ambient dimension. We extend their result to the overcomplete case, where the number of neurons is larger than the dimension (yet also subexponential in the dimension). In fact we prove that a single step of gradient descent sufﬁces. We also show this result for any subexponential width random neural network with smooth activation function.
