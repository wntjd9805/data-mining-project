In many sequential decision making applications, the change of decision would bring an additional cost, such as the wear-and-tear cost associated with chang-ing server status. To control the switching cost, we introduce the problem of online convex optimization with continuous switching constraint, where the goal is to achieve a small regret given a budget on the overall switching cost. Weﬁrst investigate the hardness of the problem, and provide a lower bound of or-der ⌦(pT ) when the switching cost budget S =⌦( pT ), and ⌦(min)} when S = O(pT ), where T is the time horizon. The essential idea is to care-fully design an adaptive adversary, who can adjust the loss function according to the cumulative switching cost of the player incurred so far based on the orthogo-nal technique. We then develop a simple gradient-based algorithm which enjoys the minimax optimal regret bound. Finally, we show that, for strongly convex functions, the regret bound can be improved to O(log T ) for S = ⌦(log T ), andO(minT / exp(S) + S, TT /S, T{) for S = O(log T ).}{
