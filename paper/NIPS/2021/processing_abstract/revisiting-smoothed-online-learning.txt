α )-competitive for α-polyhedral functions and 1 + 4In this paper, we revisit the problem of smoothed online learning, in which the online learner suffers both a hitting cost and a switching cost, and target two per-formance metrics: competitive ratio and dynamic regret with switching cost. To bound the competitive ratio, we assume the hitting cost is known to the learner in each round, and investigate the simple idea of balancing the two costs by an optimization problem. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that minimizing the hitting cost alone is max(1, 2λ -competitive forλ-quadratic growth functions, both of which improve state-of-the-art results signi-ﬁcantly. Moreover, when the hitting cost is both convex and λ-quadratic growth, we reduce the competitive ratio to 1 + 2√ by minimizing the weighted sum of theλ hitting cost and the switching cost. To bound the dynamic regret with switching cost, we follow the standard setting of online convex optimization, in which the hitting cost is convex but hidden from the learner before making predictions. We modify Ader, an existing algorithm designed for dynamic regret, slightly to take into account the switching cost when measuring the performance. The proposed al-gorithm, named as Smoothed Ader, attains an optimal O((cid:112)T (1 + PT )) bound for dynamic regret with switching cost, where PT is the path-length of the comparator sequence. Furthermore, if the hitting cost is accessible in the beginning of each round, we obtain a similar guarantee without the bounded gradient condition, and establish an Ω((cid:112)T (1 + PT )) lower bound to conﬁrm the optimality.
