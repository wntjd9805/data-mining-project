Identifying an effective model of a dynamical system from sensory data and using it for future state prediction and control is challenging. Recent data-driven algorithms based on Koopman theory are a promising approach to this problem, but they typically never update the model once it has been identiﬁed from a relatively small set of observations, thus making long-term prediction and control difﬁcult for realistic systems, in robotics or ﬂuid mechanics for example. This paper introduces a novel method for learning an embedding of the state space with linear dynamics from sensory data. Unlike previous approaches, the dynamics model can be updated online and thus easily applied to systems with non-linear dynamics in the original conﬁguration space. The proposed approach is evaluated empirically on several classical dynamical systems and sensory modalities, with good performance on long-term prediction and control.
