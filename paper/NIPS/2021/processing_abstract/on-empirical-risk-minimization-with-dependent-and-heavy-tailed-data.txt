In this work, we establish risk bounds for the Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) with both dependent and heavy-tailed data-generating processes. We do so by extending the seminal works [Men15, Men18] on the analysis of ERM with heavy-tailed but independent and identically distributed observations, to the strictly sta-tionary exponentially Î²-mixing case. Our analysis is based on explicitly controlling the multiplier process arising from the interaction between the noise and the func-tion evaluations on inputs. It allows for the interaction to be even polynomially heavy-tailed, which covers a significantly large class of heavy-tailed models be-yond what is analyzed in the learning theory literature. We illustrate our results by deriving rates of convergence for the high-dimensional linear regression problem with dependent and heavy-tailed data.
