When compared to the image classiﬁcation models, black-box adversarial attacks against video classiﬁcation models have been largely understudied. This could be possible because, with video, the temporal dimension poses signiﬁcant additional challenges in gradient estimation. Query-efﬁcient black-box attacks rely on effec-tively estimated gradients towards maximizing the probability of misclassifying the target video. In this work, we demonstrate that such effective gradients can be searched for by parameterizing the temporal structure of the search space with geometric transformations. Speciﬁcally, we design a novel iterative algorithm Geo-metric TRAnsformed Perturbations (GEO-TRAP), for attacking video classiﬁcation models. GEO-TRAP employs standard geometric transformation operations to reduce the search space for effective gradients by searching for a small group of parameters that deﬁne these operations. This group of parameters describes the ge-ometric progression of gradients, resulting in a reduced and structured search space.Our algorithm inherently leads to successful perturbations with surprisingly few queries. For example, adversarial examples generated from GEO-TRAP have better 73.55% fewer queries compared to the state-of-the-art attack success rates with method for video adversarial attacks on the widely used Jester dataset. Overall, our algorithm exposes vulnerabilities of diverse video classiﬁcation models and achieves new state-of-the-art results under black-box settings on two large datasets.Code is available here: https://github.com/sli057/Geo-TRAP∼
