Graph neural networks, a popular class of models effective in a wide range of graph-based learning tasks, have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks.While the majority of the literature focuses on such vulnerability in node-level classiﬁcation tasks, little effort has been dedicated to analysing adversarial attacks on graph-level classiﬁcation, an important problem with numerous real-life applica-tions such as biochemistry and social network analysis. The few existing methods often require unrealistic setups, such as access to internal information of the victim models, or an impractically-large number of queries. We present a novel Bayesian optimisation-based attack method for graph classiﬁcation models. Our method is black-box, query-efﬁcient and parsimonious with respect to the perturbation applied.We empirically validate the effectiveness and ﬂexibility of the proposed method on a wide range of graph classiﬁcation tasks involving varying graph properties, constraints and modes of attack. Finally, we analyse common interpretable patterns behind the adversarial samples produced, which may shed further light on the adver-sarial robustness of graph classiﬁcation models. An open-source implementation is available at https://github.com/xingchenwan/grabnel.
