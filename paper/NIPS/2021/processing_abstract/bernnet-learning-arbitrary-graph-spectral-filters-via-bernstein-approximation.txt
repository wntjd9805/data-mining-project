Many representative graph neural networks, e.g., GPR-GNN and ChebNet, ap-proximate graph convolutions with graph spectral ﬁlters. However, existing work either applies predeﬁned ﬁlter weights or learns them without necessary constraints, which may lead to oversimpliﬁed or ill-posed ﬁlters. To overcome these issues, we propose BernNet, a novel graph neural network with theoretical support that provides a simple but effective scheme for designing and learning arbitrary graph spectral ﬁlters. In particular, for any ﬁlter over the normalized Laplacian spectrum of a graph, our BernNet estimates it by an order-K Bernstein polynomial approxi-mation and designs its spectral property by setting the coefﬁcients of the Bernstein basis. Moreover, we can learn the coefﬁcients (and the corresponding ﬁlter weights) based on observed graphs and their associated signals and thus achieve the BernNet specialized for the data. Our experiments demonstrate that BernNet can learn arbitrary spectral ﬁlters, including complicated band-rejection and comb ﬁlters, and it achieves superior performance in real-world graph modeling tasks.
