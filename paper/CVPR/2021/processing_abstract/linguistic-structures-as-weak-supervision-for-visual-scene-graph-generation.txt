Prior work in scene graph generation requires categor-ical supervision at the level of triplets—subjects and ob-jects, and predicates that relate them, either with or without bounding box information. However, scene graph gener-ation is a holistic task: thus holistic, contextual supervi-sion should intuitively improve performance. In this work, we explore how linguistic structures in captions can beneﬁt scene graph generation. Our method captures the informa-tion provided in captions about relations between individ-ual triplets, and context for subjects and objects (e.g. visual properties are mentioned). Captions are a weaker type of supervision than triplets since the alignment between the exhaustive list of human-annotated subjects and objects in triplets, and the nouns in captions, is weak. However, given the large and diverse sources of multimodal data on the web (e.g. blog posts with images and captions), linguis-tic supervision is more scalable than crowdsourced triplets.We show extensive experimental comparisons against prior methods which leverage instance- and image-level supervi-sion, and ablate our method to show the impact of leverag-ing phrasal and sequential context, and techniques to im-prove localization of subjects and objects.
