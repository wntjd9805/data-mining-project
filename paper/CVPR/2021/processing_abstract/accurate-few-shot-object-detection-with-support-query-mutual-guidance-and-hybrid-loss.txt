Most object detection methods require huge amounts of annotated data and can detect only the categories that ap-pear in the training set. However, in reality acquiring mas-sive annotated training data is both expensive and time-consuming.In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage detector for accurate few-shot object detection. In the ﬁrst stage, we employ a support-query mutual guidance mech-anism to generate more support-relevant proposals. Con-cretely, on the one hand, a query-guided support weighting module is developed for aggregating different supports to generate the support feature. On the other hand, a support-guided query enhancement module is designed by dynamic kernels. In the second stage, we score and ﬁlter proposals via multi-level feature comparison between each proposal and the aggregated support feature based on a distance met-ric learnt by an effective hybrid loss, which makes the em-bedding space of distance metric more discriminative. Ex-tensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method substantially outperforms the existing methods and lifts the SOTA of FSOD task to a higher level.
