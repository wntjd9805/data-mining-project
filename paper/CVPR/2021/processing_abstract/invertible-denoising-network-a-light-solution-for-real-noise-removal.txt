Invertible networks have various beneÔ¨Åts for image de-noising since they are lightweight, information-lossless, and memory-saving during back-propagation. However, apply-ing invertible models to remove noise is challenging be-cause the input is noisy, and the reversed output is clean, following two different distributions. We propose an invert-ible denoising network, InvDN, to address this challenge.InvDN transforms the noisy input into a low-resolution clean image and a latent representation containing noise.To discard noise and restore the clean image, InvDN re-places the noisy latent representation with another one sam-pled from a prior distribution during reversion. The de-noising performance of InvDN is better than all the existing competitive models, achieving a new state-of-the-art result for the SIDD dataset while enjoying less run time. More-over, the size of InvDN is far smaller, only having 4.2% of the number of parameters compared to the most recently proposed DANet. Further, via manipulating the noisy la-tent representation, InvDN is also able to generate noise more similar to the original one. Our code is available at: https://github.com/Yang-Liu1082/InvDN.git.
