Inspired by the great success of deep neural net-works (DNNs), many unfolding methods have been pro-posed to integrate traditional image modeling techniques, such as dictionary learning (DicL) and sparse coding, intoDNNs for image restoration. However, the performance of such methods remains limited for several reasons. First, the unfolded architectures do not strictly follow the image representation model of DicL and lose the desired physical meaning. Second, handcrafted priors are still used in most unfolding methods without effectively utilizing the learn-ing capability of DNNs. Third, a universal dictionary is learned to represent all images, reducing the model repre-sentation ﬂexibility. We propose a novel framework of deep convolutional dictionary learning (DCDicL), which follows the representation model of DicL strictly, learns the pri-ors for both representation coefﬁcients and the dictionar-ies, and can adaptively adjust the dictionary for each in-put image based on its content. The effectiveness of ourDCDicL method is validated on the image denoising prob-lem. DCDicL demonstrates leading denoising performance in terms of both quantitative metrics (e.g., PSNR, SSIM) and visual quality. In particular, it can reproduce the subtle im-age structures and textures, which are hard to recover by many existing denoising DNNs.
