Temporal action segmentation approaches have been very successful recently. However, annotating videos with frame-wise labels to train such models is very expensive and time consuming. While weakly supervised methods trained using only ordered action lists require less annotation ef-fort, the performance is still worse than fully supervised approaches. In this paper, we propose to use timestamp su-pervision for the temporal action segmentation task. Time-stamps require a comparable annotation effort to weakly supervised approaches, and yet provide a more supervisory signal. To demonstrate the effectiveness of timestamp su-pervision, we propose an approach to train a segmentation model using only timestamps annotations. Our approach uses the model output and the annotated timestamps to gen-erate frame-wise labels by detecting the action changes. We further introduce a conÔ¨Ådence loss that forces the predicted probabilities to monotonically decrease as the distance to the timestamps increases. This ensures that all and not only the most distinctive frames of an action are learned during training. The evaluation on four datasets shows that mod-els trained with timestamps annotations achieve compara-ble performance to the fully supervised approaches.
