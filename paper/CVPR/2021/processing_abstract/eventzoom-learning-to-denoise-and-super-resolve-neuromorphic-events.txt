We address the problem of jointly denoising and super resolving neuromorphic events, a novel visual signal that represents thresholded temporal gradients in a space-time window. The challenge for event signal processing is that they are asynchronously generated, and do not carry ab-solute intensity but only binary signs informing temporal variations. To study event signal formation and degrada-tion, we implement a display-camera system which enables multi-resolution event recording. We further propose Event-Zoom, a deep neural framework with a backbone architec-ture of 3D U-Net. EventZoom is trained in a noise-to-noise fashion where the two ends of the network are unﬁltered noisy events, enforcing noise-free event restoration. For res-olution enhancement, EventZoom incorporates an event-to-image module supervised by high resolution images. Our results showed that EventZoom achieves at least 40× tem-poral efﬁciency compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) event denoisers. Additionally, we demonstrate that EventZoom enables performance improvements on applications includ-ing event-based visual object tracking and image recon-struction. EventZoom achieves SOTA super resolution im-age reconstruction results while being 10× faster.
