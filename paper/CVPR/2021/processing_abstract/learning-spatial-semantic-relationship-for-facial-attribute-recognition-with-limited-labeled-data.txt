Recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated ex-cellent results for Facial Attribute Recognition (FAR), typ-ically trained with large-scale labeled data. However, in many real-world FAR applications, only limited labeled da-ta are available, leading to remarkable deterioration in per-formance for most existing deep learning-based FAR meth-ods. To address this problem, here we propose a method termed Spatial-Semantic Patch Learning (SSPL). The train-ing of SSPL involves two stages. First, three auxiliary tasks, consisting of a Patch Rotation Task (PRT), a Patch Seg-mentation Task (PST), and a Patch Classiﬁcation Task (PC-T), are jointly developed to learn the spatial-semantic re-lationship from large-scale unlabeled facial data. We thus obtain a powerful pre-trained model.In particular, PRT exploits the spatial information of facial images in a self-supervised learning manner. PST and PCT respectively capture the pixel-level and image-level semantic informa-tion of facial images based on a facial parsing model. Sec-ond, the spatial-semantic knowledge learned from auxiliary tasks is transferred to the FAR task. By doing so, it enables that only a limited number of labeled data are required toﬁne-tune the pre-trained model. We achieve superior per-formance compared with state-of-the-art methods, as sub-stantiated by extensive experiments and studies.
