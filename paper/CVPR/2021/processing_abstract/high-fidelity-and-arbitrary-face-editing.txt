Cycle consistency is widely used for face editing. How-ever, we observe that the generator tends to ﬁnd a tricky way to hide information from the original image to satisfy the constraint of cycle consistency, making it impossible to maintain the rich details (e.g., wrinkles and moles) of non-editing areas. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective method named HifaFace to address the above-mentioned problem from two perspectives. First, we relieve the pres-sure of the generator to synthesize rich details by directly feeding the high-frequency information of the input image into the end of the generator. Second, we adopt an addi-tional discriminator to encourage the generator to synthe-size rich details. Speciﬁcally, we apply wavelet transforma-tion to transform the image into multi-frequency domains, among which the high-frequency parts can be used to re-cover the rich details. We also notice that a ﬁne-grained and wider-range control for the attribute is of great impor-tance for face editing. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel attribute regression loss. Powered by the proposed framework, we achieve high-ﬁdelity and arbitrary face edit-ing, outperforming other state-of-the-art approaches.
