In many real-world applications, the relative depth of ob-jects in an image is crucial for scene understanding. Recent approaches mainly tackle the problem of depth prediction in monocular images by treating the problem as a regres-sion task. Yet, being interested in an order relation in theﬁrst place, ranking methods suggest themselves as a natural alternative to regression, and indeed, ranking approaches leveraging pairwise comparisons as training information (“object A is closer to the camera than B”) have shown promising performance on this problem. In this paper, we elaborate on the use of so-called listwise ranking as a gener-alization of the pairwise approach. Our method is based on the Plackett-Luce (PL) model, a probability distribution on rankings, which we combine with a state-of-the-art neural network architecture and a simple sampling strategy to re-duce training complexity. Moreover, taking advantage of the representation of PL as a random utility model, the proposed predictor offers a natural way to recover (shift-invariant) metric depth information from ranking-only data provided at training time. An empirical evaluation on several bench-mark datasets in a “zero-shot” setting demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach compared to existing ranking and regression methods.
