×Binary grid mask representation is broadly used in in-stance segmentation. A representative instantiation is MaskR-CNN which predicts masks on a 28 28 binary grid.Generally, a low-resolution grid is not sufﬁcient to cap-ture the details, while a high-resolution grid dramatically increases the training complexity. In this paper, we propose a new mask representation by applying the discrete cosine transform(DCT) to encode the high-resolution binary grid mask into a compact vector. Our method, termed DCT-Mask, could be easily integrated into most pixel-based in-stance segmentation methods. Without any bells and whis-tles, DCT-Mask yields signiﬁcant gains on different frame-works, backbones, datasets, and training schedules. It does not require any pre-processing or pre-training, and almost no harm to the running speed. Especially, for higher-quality annotations and more complex backbones, our method has a greater improvement. Moreover, we analyze the perfor-mance of our method from the perspective of the quality of mask representation. The main reason why DCT-Mask works well is that it obtains a high-quality mask represen-tation with low complexity.
