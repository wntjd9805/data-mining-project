Synthetic datasets play a critical role in pre-trainingCNN models for optical ﬂow, but they are painstaking to generate and hard to adapt to new applications. To au-tomate the process, we present AutoFlow, a simple and effective method to render training data for optical ﬂow that optimizes the performance of a model on a target dataset. AutoFlow takes a layered approach to render syn-thetic data, where the motion, shape, and appearance of each layer are controlled by learnable hyperparameters.Experimental results show that AutoFlow achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in pre-training both PWC-Net and RAFT.Our code and data are available at autoflow-google. github.io.
