Our objective in this work is ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation of actions in untrimmed videos, where the actions may be tem-porally extended or may span only a few frames of the video.We cast this into a query-response mechanism, where each query addresses a particular question, and has its own re-sponse label set. (i) We pro-We make the following four contributions: pose a new model—a Temporal Query Network—which enables the query-response functionality, and a structural understanding of ﬁne-grained actions.It attends to rel-evant segments for each query with a temporal attention mechanism, and can be trained using only the labels for each query. (ii) We propose a new way—stochastic fea-ture bank update—to train a network on videos of vari-ous lengths with the dense sampling required to respond (iii) we compare the TQN to to ﬁne-grained queries. other architectures and text supervision methods, and an-alyze their pros and cons. Finally, (iv) we evaluate the method extensively on the FineGym and Diving48 bench-marks for ﬁne-grained action classiﬁcation and surpass the state-of-the-art using only RGB features.
