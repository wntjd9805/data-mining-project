In this paper, we focus on improving online multi-object tracking (MOT). In particular, we introduce a region-basedSiamese Multi-Object Tracking network, which we nameSiamMOT. SiamMOT includes a motion model that esti-mates the instance’s movement between two frames such that detected instances are associated. To explore how the motion modelling affects its tracking capability, we present two variants of Siamese tracker, one that implicitly mod-els motion and one that models it explicitly. We carry out extensive quantitative experiments on three differentMOT datasets: MOT17, TAO-person and Caltech RoadsidePedestrians, showing the importance of motion modelling for MOT and the ability of SiamMOT to substantially out-perform the state-of-the-art. Finally, SiamMOT also outper-forms the winners of ACM MM’20 HiEve Grand Challenge on HiEve dataset. Moreover, SiamMOT is efﬁcient, and it runs at 17 FPS for 720P videos on a single modern GPU.
