Features that are equivariant to a larger group of sym-metries have been shown to be more discriminative and powerful in recent studies [4, 40, 5]. However, higher-order equivariant features often come with an exponentially-growing computational cost. Furthermore, it remains rel-atively less explored how rotation-equivariant features can be leveraged to tackle 3D shape alignment tasks. While many past approaches have been based on either non-equivariant or invariant descriptors to align 3D shapes, we argue that such tasks may beneﬁt greatly from an equiv-ariant framework.In this paper, we propose an effective and practical SE(3) (3D translation and rotation) equivari-ant network for point cloud analysis that addresses both problems. First, we present SE(3) separable point convo-lution, a novel framework that breaks down the 6D con-volution into two separable convolutional operators alter-natively performed in the 3D Euclidean and SO(3) spaces respectively. This signiﬁcantly reduces the computational cost without compromising the performance. Second, we in-troduce an attention layer to effectively harness the expres-siveness of the equivariant features. While jointly trained with the network, the attention layer implicitly derives the intrinsic local frame in the feature space and generates at-tention vectors that can be integrated with different align-ment tasks. We evaluate our approach through extensive studies and visual interpretations. The empirical results demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms strong baselines in a variety of benchmarks.
