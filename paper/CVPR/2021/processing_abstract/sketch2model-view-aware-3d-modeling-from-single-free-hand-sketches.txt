We investigate the problem of generating 3D meshes from single free-hand sketches, aiming at fast 3D modeling for novice users. It can be regarded as a single-view re-construction problem, but with unique challenges, brought by the variation and conciseness of sketches. Ambiguities in poorly-drawn sketches could make it hard to determine how the sketched object is posed. In this paper, we address the importance of viewpoint speciﬁcation for overcoming such ambiguities, and propose a novel view-aware generation approach. By explicitly conditioning the generation pro-cess on a given viewpoint, our method can generate plausi-ble shapes automatically with predicted viewpoints, or with speciﬁed viewpoints to help users better express their in-tentions. Extensive evaluations on various datasets demon-strate the effectiveness of our view-aware design in solving sketch ambiguities and improving reconstruction quality.
