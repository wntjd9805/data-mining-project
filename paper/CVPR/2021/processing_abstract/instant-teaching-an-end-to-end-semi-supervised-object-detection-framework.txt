Supervised learning based object detection frameworks demand plenty of laborious manual annotations, which may not be practical in real applications. Semi-supervised ob-ject detection (SSOD) can effectively leverage unlabeled data to improve the model performance, which is of great signiﬁcance for the application of object detection mod-In this paper, we revisit SSOD and propose Instant-els.Teaching, a completely end-to-end and effective SSOD framework, which uses instant pseudo labeling with ex-tended weak-strong data augmentations for teaching during each training iteration. To alleviate the conﬁrmation bias problem and improve the quality of pseudo annotations, we further propose a co-rectify scheme based on Instant-Teaching, denoted as Instant-Teaching∗. Extensive experi-ments on both MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets sub-stantiate the superiority of our framework. Speciﬁcally, our method surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 4.2 mAP onMS-COCO when using 2% labeled data. Even with full su-pervised information of MS-COCO, the proposed method still outperforms state-of-the-art methods by about 1.0 mAP.On PASCAL VOC, we can achieve more than 5 mAP im-provement by applying VOC07 as labeled data and VOC12 as unlabeled data.
