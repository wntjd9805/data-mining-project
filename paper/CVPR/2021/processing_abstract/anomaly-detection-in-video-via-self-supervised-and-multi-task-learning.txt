Anomaly detection in video is a challenging computer vi-sion problem. Due to the lack of anomalous events at train-ing time, anomaly detection requires the design of learn-In this paper, we ing methods without full supervision. approach anomalous event detection in video through self-supervised and multi-task learning at the object level. Weﬁrst utilize a pre-trained detector to detect objects. Then, we train a 3D convolutional neural network to produce dis-criminative anomaly-speciﬁc information by jointly learn-ing multiple proxy tasks: three self-supervised and one based on knowledge distillation. The self-supervised tasks are: (i) discrimination of forward/backward moving ob-jects (arrow of time), (ii) discrimination of objects in con-secutive/intermittent frames (motion irregularity) and (iii) reconstruction of object-speciﬁc appearance information.The knowledge distillation task takes into account both classiﬁcation and detection information, generating large prediction discrepancies between teacher and student mod-els when anomalies occur. To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to approach anomalous event detection in video as a multi-task learning problem, integrating multi-ple self-supervised and knowledge distillation proxy tasks in a single architecture. Our lightweight architecture out-performs the state-of-the-art methods on three benchmarks:Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UCSD Ped2. Additionally, we perform an ablation study demonstrating the importance of integrating self-supervised learning and normality-speciﬁc distillation in a multi-task learning setting.
