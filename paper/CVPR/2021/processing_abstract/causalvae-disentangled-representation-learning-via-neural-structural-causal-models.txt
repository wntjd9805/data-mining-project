Learning disentanglement aims at ﬁnding a low dimen-sional representation which consists of multiple explana-tory and generative factors of the observational data. The framework of variational autoencoder (VAE) is commonly used to disentangle independent factors from observations.However, in real scenarios, factors with semantics are not necessarily independent. Instead, there might be an under-lying causal structure which renders these factors depen-dent. We thus propose a new VAE based framework namedCausalVAE, which includes a Causal Layer to transform independent exogenous factors into causal endogenous ones that correspond to causally related concepts in data. We further analyze the model identiﬁabitily, showing that the proposed model learned from observations recovers the true one up to a certain degree. Experiments are conducted on various datasets, including synthetic and real word bench-mark CelebA. Results show that the causal representations learned by CausalVAE are semantically interpretable, and their causal relationship as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is identiﬁed with good accuracy. Furthermore, we demon-strate that the proposed CausalVAE model is able to generate counterfactual data through “do-operation” to the causal factors.
