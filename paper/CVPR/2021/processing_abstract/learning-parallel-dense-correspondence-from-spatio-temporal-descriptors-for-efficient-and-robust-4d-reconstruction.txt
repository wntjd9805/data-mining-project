TimeThis paper focuses on the task of 4D shape reconstruc-tion from a sequence of point clouds. Despite the recent success achieved by extending deep implicit representations into 4D space [29], it is still a great challenge in two re-spects, i.e. how to design a ﬂexible framework for learn-ing robust spatio-temporal shape representations from 4D point clouds, and develop an efﬁcient mechanism for cap-turing shape dynamics.In this work, we present a novel pipeline to learn a temporal evolution of the 3D human shape through spatially continuous transformation func-tions among cross-frame occupancy ﬁelds. The key idea is to parallelly establish the dense correspondence between predicted occupancy ﬁelds at different time steps via explic-itly learning continuous displacement vector ﬁelds from ro-bust spatio-temporal shape representations. Extensive com-parisons against previous state-of-the-arts show the supe-rior accuracy of our approach for 4D human reconstruc-tion in the problems of 4D shape auto-encoding and com-pletion, and a much faster network inference with about 8 times speedup demonstrates the signiﬁcant efﬁciency of our approach.
