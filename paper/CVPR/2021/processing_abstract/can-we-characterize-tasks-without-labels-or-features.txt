the dataset. 2. The output, characterizing which requires labels forThe problem of expert model selection deals with choos-ing the appropriate pretrained network (“expert”) to trans-fer to a target task. Methods, however, generally depend on two separate assumptions: the presence of labeled images and access to powerful “probe” networks that yield useful features. In this work, we demonstrate the current reliance on both of these aspects and develop algorithms to operate when either of these assumptions fail. In the unlabeled case, we show that pseudolabels from the probe network provide discriminative enough gradients to perform nearly-equal task selection even when the probe network is trained on imagery unrelated to the tasks. To compute the embedding with no probe network at all, we introduce the Task TangentKernel (TTK) which uses a kernelized distance across mul-tiple random networks to achieve performance over dou-ble that of other methods with randomly initialized models.Code is available at https://github.com/BramSW/ task_characterization_cvpr_2021/.
