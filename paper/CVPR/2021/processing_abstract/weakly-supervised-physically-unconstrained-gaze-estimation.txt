Faces	w/	gaze	labels'Looking	At	Each	Other	(LAEO)' collectionA major challenge for physically unconstrained gaze es-timation is acquiring training data with 3D gaze annota-tions for in-the-wild and outdoor scenarios.In contrast, videos of human interactions in unconstrained environ-ments are abundantly available and can be much more eas-ily annotated with frame-level activity labels. In this work, we tackle the previously unexplored problem of weakly-supervised gaze estimation from videos of human interac-tions. We leverage the insight that strong gaze-related ge-ometric constraints exist when people perform the activity of “looking at each other” (LAEO). To acquire viable 3D gaze supervision from LAEO labels, we propose a training algorithm along with several novel loss functions especially designed for the task. With weak supervision from two large scale CMU-Panoptic and AVA-LAEO activity datasets, we show signiﬁcant improvements in (a) the accuracy of semi-supervised gaze estimation and (b) cross-domain gener-alization on the state-of-the-art physically unconstrained in-the-wild Gaze360 gaze estimation benchmark. We open source our code at https://github.com/NVlabs/weakly-supervised-gaze.
