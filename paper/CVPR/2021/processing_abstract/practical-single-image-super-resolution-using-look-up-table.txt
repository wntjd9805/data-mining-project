A number of super-resolution (SR) algorithms from in-terpolation to deep neural networks (DNN) have emerged to restore or create missing details of the input low-resolution image. As mobile devices and display hardware develops, the demand for practical SR technology has increased. Cur-rent state-of-the-art SR methods are based on DNNs for bet-ter quality. However, they are feasible when executed by using a parallel computing module (e.g. GPUs), and have been difﬁcult to apply to general uses such as end-user soft-ware, smartphones, and televisions. To this end, we propose an efﬁcient and practical approach for the SR by adopting look-up table (LUT). We train a deep SR network with a small receptive ﬁeld and transfer the output values of the learned deep model to the LUT. At test time, we retrieve the precomputed HR output values from the LUT for queryLR input pixels. The proposed method can be performed very quickly because it does not require a large number ofﬂoating point operations. Experimental results show the ef-ﬁciency and the effectiveness of our method. Especially, our method runs faster while showing better quality compared to bicubic interpolation.
