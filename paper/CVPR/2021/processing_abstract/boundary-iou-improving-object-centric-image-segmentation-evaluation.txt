We present Boundary IoU (Intersection-over-Union), a new segmentation evaluation measure focused on bound-ary quality. We perform an extensive analysis across dif-ferent error types and object sizes and show that BoundaryIoU is signiÔ¨Åcantly more sensitive than the standard MaskIoU measure to boundary errors for large objects and does not over-penalize errors on smaller objects. The new qual-ity measure displays several desirable characteristics like symmetry w.r.t. prediction/ground truth pairs and balanced responsiveness across scales, which makes it more suitable for segmentation evaluation than other boundary-focused measures like Trimap IoU and F-measure. Based on Bound-ary IoU, we update the standard evaluation protocols for instance and panoptic segmentation tasks by proposing the Boundary AP (Average Precision) and Boundary PQ (Panoptic Quality) metrics, respectively. Our experiments show that the new evaluation metrics track boundary qual-ity improvements that are generally overlooked by currentMask IoU-based evaluation metrics. We hope that the adop-tion of the new boundary-sensitive evaluation metrics will lead to rapid progress in segmentation methods that im-prove boundary quality.1
