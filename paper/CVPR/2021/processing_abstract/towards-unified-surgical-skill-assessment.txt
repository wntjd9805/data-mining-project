Surgical skills have a great inﬂuence on surgical safety and patients’ well-being. Traditional assessment of sur-gical skills involves strenuous manual efforts, which lacks efﬁciency and repeatability. Therefore, we attempt to au-tomatically predict how well the surgery is performed us-ing the surgical video. In this paper, a uniﬁed multi-path framework for automatic surgical skill assessment is pro-posed, which takes care of multiple composing aspects of surgical skills, including surgical tool usage, intraoperative event pattern, and other skill proxies. The dependency rela-tionships among these different aspects are specially mod-eled by a path dependency module in the framework. We conduct extensive experiments on the JIGSAWS dataset of simulated surgical tasks, and a new clinical dataset of real laparoscopic surgeries. The proposed framework achieves promising results on both datasets, with the state-of-the-art on the simulated dataset advanced from 0.71 Spearman’s correlation to 0.80. It is also shown that combining multi-ple skill aspects yields better performance than relying on a single aspect.
