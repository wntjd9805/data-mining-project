3D point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in computer vision and robotics. Recently, learning-based point cloud registration methods have made great progress.However, these methods are sensitive to outliers, which lead to more incorrect correspondences.In this paper, we propose a novel deep graph matching-based frame-work for point cloud registration. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst transform point clouds into graphs and extract deep fea-tures for each point. Then, we develop a module based on deep graph matching to calculate a soft correspon-dence matrix. By using graph matching, not only the lo-cal geometry of each point but also its structure and topol-ogy in a larger range are considered in establishing cor-respondences, so that more correct correspondences are found. We train the network with a loss directly deﬁned on the correspondences, and in the test stage the soft cor-respondences are transformed into hard one-to-one corre-spondences so that registration can be performed by sin-gular value decomposition. Furthermore, we introduce a transformer-based method to generate edges for graph con-struction, which further improves the quality of the corre-spondences. Extensive experiments on registering clean, noisy, partial-to-partial and unseen category point clouds show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
