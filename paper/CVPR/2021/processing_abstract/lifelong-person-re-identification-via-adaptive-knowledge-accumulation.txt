Step 1Model-0Step 2Model-1Step 3Model-2Person re-identiﬁcation (ReID) methods always learn through a stationary domain that is ﬁxed by the choice of a given dataset. In many contexts (e.g., lifelong learning), those methods are ineffective because the domain is con-tinually changing in which case incremental learning over multiple domains is required potentially. In this work we explore a new and challenging ReID task, namely lifelong person re-identiﬁcation (LReID), which enables to learn continuously across multiple domains and even generalise on new and unseen domains. Following the cognitive pro-cesses in the human brain, we design an Adaptive Knowl-edge Accumulation (AKA) framework that is endowed with two crucial abilities: knowledge representation and knowl-edge operation. Our method alleviates catastrophic for-getting on seen domains and demonstrates the ability to generalize to unseen domains. Correspondingly, we also provide a new and large-scale benchmark for LReID. Ex-tensive experiments demonstrate our method outperforms other competitors by a margin of 5.8% mAP in general-ising evaluation. The codes will be available at https://github.com/TPCD/LifelongReID.
