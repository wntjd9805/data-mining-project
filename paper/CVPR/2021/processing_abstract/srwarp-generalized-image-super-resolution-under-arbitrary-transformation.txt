Deep CNNs have achieved signiﬁcant successes in im-age processing and its applications, including single image super-resolution (SR). However, conventional methods still resort to some predetermined integer scaling factors, e.g.,×2 or ×4. Thus, they are difﬁcult to be applied when arbi-trary target resolutions are required. Recent approaches ex-tend the scope to real-valued upsampling factors, even with varying aspect ratios to handle the limitation. In this pa-per, we propose the SRWarp framework to further general-ize the SR tasks toward an arbitrary image transformation.We interpret the traditional image warping task, speciﬁcally when the input is enlarged, as a spatially-varying SR prob-lem. We also propose several novel formulations, includ-ing the adaptive warping layer and multiscale blending, to reconstruct visually favorable results in the transformation process. Compared with previous methods, we do not con-strain the SR model on a regular grid but allow numerous possible deformations for ﬂexible and diverse image edit-ing. Extensive experiments and ablation studies justify the necessity and demonstrate the advantage of the proposedSRWarp method under various transformations.
