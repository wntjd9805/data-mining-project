Before AdaptationAfter AdaptationDomain adaptation (DA) aims at transferring knowl-edge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Though many DA theories and algorithms have been proposed, most of them are tailored into classiﬁca-tion settings and may fail in regression tasks, especially in the practical keypoint detection task. To tackle this difﬁ-cult but signiﬁcant task, we present a method of regressive domain adaptation (RegDA) for unsupervised keypoint de-tection. Inspired by the latest theoretical work, we ﬁrst uti-lize an adversarial regressor to maximize the disparity on the target domain and train a feature generator to minimize this disparity. However, due to the high dimension of the output space, this regressor fails to detect samples that de-viate from the support of the source. To overcome this prob-lem, we propose two important ideas. First, based on our observation that the probability density of the output space is sparse, we introduce a spatial probability distribution to describe this sparsity and then use it to guide the learning of the adversarial regressor. Second, to alleviate the opti-mization difﬁculty in the high-dimensional space, we inno-vatively convert the minimax game in the adversarial train-ing to the minimization of two opposite goals. Extensive ex-periments show that our method brings large improvement by 8% to 11% in terms of PCK on different datasets.
