Estimating the 3D motion of points in a scene, known as scene ﬂow, is a core problem in computer vision. Tra-ditional learning-based methods designed to learn end-to-end 3D ﬂow often suffer from poor generalization. Here we present a recurrent architecture that learns a single step of an unrolled iterative alignment procedure for reﬁning scene ﬂow predictions. Inspired by classical algorithms, we demonstrate iterative convergence toward the solution us-ing strong regularization. The proposed method can han-dle sizeable temporal deformations and suggests a slim-mer architecture than competitive all-to-all correlation ap-proaches. Trained on FlyingThings3D synthetic data only, our network successfully generalizes to real scans, outper-forming all existing methods by a large margin on the KITTI self-supervised benchmark.1
