We propose a method to disentangle linear-encoded fa-cial semantics from StyleGAN without external supervision.The method derives from linear regression and sparse rep-resentation learning concepts to make the disentangled la-tent representations easily interpreted as well. We start by coupling StyleGAN with a stabilized 3D deformable facial reconstruction method to decompose single-view GAN gen-erations into multiple semantics. Latent representations are then extracted to capture interpretable facial semantics. In this work, we make it possible to get rid of labels for disen-tangling meaningful facial semantics. Also, we demonstrate that the guided extrapolation along the disentangled repre-sentations can help with data augmentation, which sheds light on handling unbalanced data. Finally, we provide an analysis of our learned localized facial representations and illustrate that the semantic information is encoded, which surprisingly complies with human intuition. The overall un-supervised design brings more ï¬‚exibility to representation learning in the wild.
