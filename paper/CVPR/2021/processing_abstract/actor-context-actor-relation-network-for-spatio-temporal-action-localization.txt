Localizing persons and recognizing their actions from videos is a challenging task towards high-level video under-standing. Recent advances have been achieved by modeling direct pairwise relations between entities. In this paper, we take one step further, not only model direct relations between pairs but also take into account indirect higher-order rela-tions established upon multiple elements. We propose to explicitly model the Actor-Context-Actor Relation, which is the relation between two actors based on their interac-tions with the context. To this end, we design an Actor-Context-Actor Relation Network (ACAR-Net) which builds upon a novel High-order Relation Reasoning Operator and an Actor-Context Feature Bank to enable indirect relation reasoning for spatio-temporal action localization. Experi-ments on AVA and UCF101-24 datasets show the advantages of modeling actor-context-actor relations, and visualization of attention maps further veriﬁes that our model is capable ofﬁnding relevant higher-order relations to support action de-tection. Notably, our method ranks ﬁrst in the AVA-Kinetics action localization task of ActivityNet Challenge 2020, out-performing other entries by a signiﬁcant margin (+6.71 mAP). The code is available online.1
