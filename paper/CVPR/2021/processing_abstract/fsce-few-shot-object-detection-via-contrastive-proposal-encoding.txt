Emerging interests have been brought to recognize previously unseen objects given very few training exam-ples, known as few-shot object detection (FSOD). Recent researches demonstrate that good feature embedding is the key to reach favorable few-shot learning performance.We observe object proposals with different Intersection-of-Union (IoU) scores are analogous to the intra-image aug-mentation used in contrastive visual representation learn-ing. And we exploit this analogy and incorporate super-vised contrastive learning to achieve more robust objects representations in FSOD. We present Few-Shot object de-tection via Contrastive proposals Encoding (FSCE), a sim-ple yet effective approach to learning contrastive-aware ob-ject proposal encodings that facilitate the classiﬁcation of detected objects. We notice the degradation of average pre-cision (AP) for rare objects mainly comes from misclassify-ing novel instances as confusable classes. And we ease the misclassiﬁcation issues by promoting instance level intra-class compactness and inter-class variance via our con-trastive proposal encoding loss (CPE loss). Our design outperforms current state-of-the-art works in any shot and all data splits, with up to +8.8% on standard benchmarkPASCAL VOC and +2.7% on challenging COCO bench-mark.
