Natural image matting separates the foreground from background in fractional occupancy which can be caused by highly transparent objects, complex foreground (e.g., net or tree), and/or objects containing very ﬁne details (e.g., hairs). Although conventional matting formulation can be applied to all of the above cases, no previous work has at-tempted to reason the underlying causes of matting due to various foreground semantics.We show how to obtain better alpha mattes by incorpo-rating into our framework semantic classiﬁcation of mat-ting regions. Speciﬁcally, we consider and learn 20 classes of matting patterns, and propose to extend the conven-tional trimap to semantic trimap. The proposed semantic trimap can be obtained automatically through patch struc-ture analysis within trimap regions. Meanwhile, we learn a multi-class discriminator to regularize the alpha predic-tion at semantic level, and content-sensitive weights to bal-ance different regularization losses. Experiments on mul-tiple benchmarks show that our method outperforms other methods and has achieved the most competitive state-of-the-art performance. Finally, we contribute a large-scale Se-mantic Image Matting Dataset with careful consideration of data balancing across different semantic classes.
