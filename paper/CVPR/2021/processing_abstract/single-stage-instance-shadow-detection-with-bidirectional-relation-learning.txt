Instance shadow detection aims to ﬁnd shadow instances paired with the objects that cast the shadows. The previous work adopts a two-stage framework to ﬁrst predict shadow instances, object instances, and shadow-object associations from the region proposals, then leverage a post-processing to match the predictions to form the ﬁnal shadow-object pairs. In this paper, we present a new single-stage fully-convolutional network architecture with a bidirectional re-lation learning module to directly learn the relations of shadow and object instances in an end-to-end manner.Compared with the prior work, our method actively ex-plores the internal relationship between shadows and ob-jects to learn a better pairing between them, thus improving the overall performance for instance shadow detection. We evaluate our method on the benchmark dataset for instance shadow detection, both quantitatively and visually. The ex-perimental results demonstrate that our method clearly out-performs the state-of-the-art method.
