Consensus maximisation (MaxCon), which is widely used for robust ﬁtting in computer vision, aims to ﬁnd the largest subset of data that ﬁts the model within some tol-erance level. In this paper, we outline the connection be-tween MaxCon problem and the abstract problem of ﬁnding the maximum upper zero of a Monotone Boolean Function (MBF) deﬁned over the Boolean Cube. Then, we link the concept of inﬂuences (in a MBF) to the concept of outlier (in MaxCon) and show that inﬂuences of points belonging to the largest structure in data would generally be smaller under certain conditions. Based on this observation, we present an iterative algorithm to perform consensus max-imisation. Results for both synthetic and real visual data experiments show that the MBF based algorithm is capa-ble of generating a near optimal solution relatively quickly.This is particularly important where there are large number of outliers (gross or pseudo) in the observed data.
