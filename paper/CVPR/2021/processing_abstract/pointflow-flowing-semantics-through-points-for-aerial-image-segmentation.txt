Aerial Image Segmentation is a particular semantic seg-mentation problem and has several challenging character-istics that general semantic segmentation does not have.There are two critical issues: The one is an extremely foreground-background imbalanced distribution, and the other is multiple small objects along with the complex back-ground. Such problems make the recent dense afﬁnity con-text modeling perform poorly even compared with base-lines due to over-introduced background context. To handle these problems, we propose a point-wise afﬁnity propaga-tion module based on the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) framework, named PointFlow. Rather than dense afﬁn-ity learning, a sparse afﬁnity map is generated upon se-lected points between the adjacent features, which reduces the noise introduced by the background while keeping ef-ﬁciency.In particular, we design a dual point matcher to select points from the salient area and object bound-aries, respectively. Experimental results on three differ-ent aerial segmentation datasets suggest that the proposed method is more effective and efﬁcient than state-of-the-art general semantic segmentation methods. Especially, our methods achieve the best speed and accuracy trade-off on three aerial benchmarks. Further experiments on three general semantic segmentation datasets prove the general-ity of our method. Code and models are made available (https://github.com/lxtGH/PFSegNets).
