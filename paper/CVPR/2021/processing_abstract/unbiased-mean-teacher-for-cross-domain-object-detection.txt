Cross-domain object detection is challenging, because object detection model is often vulnerable to data variance, especially to the considerable domain shift between two distinctive domains. In this paper, we propose a new Un-biased Mean Teacher (UMT) model for cross-domain ob-ject detection. We reveal that there often exists a consider-able model bias for the simple mean teacher (MT) model in cross-domain scenarios, and eliminate the model bias with several simple yet highly effective strategies. In par-ticular, for the teacher model, we propose a cross-domain distillation method for MT to maximally exploit the exper-tise of the teacher model. Moreover, for the student model, we alleviate its bias by augmenting training samples with pixel-level adaptation. Finally, for the teaching process, we employ an out-of-distribution estimation strategy to select samples that most Ô¨Åt the current model to further enhance the cross-domain distillation process. By tackling the model bias issue with these strategies, our UMT model achieves mAPs of 44.1%, 58.1%, 41.7%, and 43.1% on bench-mark datasets Clipart1k, Watercolor2k, Foggy Cityscapes, and Cityscapes, respectively, which outperforms the exist-ing state-of-the-art results in notable margins.
