Recently, some methods have focused on learning local relation among parts of pedestrian images for person re-identiﬁcation (Re-ID), as it offers powerful representation capabilities. However, they only provide the intra-local re-lation among parts within single pedestrian image and ig-nore the inter-local relation among parts from different im-ages, which results in incomplete local relation information.In this paper, we propose a novel deep graph model namedHeterogeneous Local Graph Attention Networks (HLGAT) to model the inter-local relation and the intra-local rela-tion in the completed local graph, simultaneously. Specif-ically, we ﬁrst construct the completed local graph using local features, and we resort to the attention mechanism to aggregate the local features in the learning process of inter-local relation and intra-local relation so as to empha-size the importance of different local features. As for the inter-local relation, we propose the attention regularization loss to constrain the attention weights based on the iden-tities of local features in order to describe the inter-local relation accurately. As for the intra-local relation, we pro-pose to inject the contextual information into the attention weights to consider structure information. Extensive exper-iments on Market-1501, CUHK03, DukeMTMC-reID andMSMT17 demonstrate that the proposed HLGAT outper-forms the state-of-the-art methods.
