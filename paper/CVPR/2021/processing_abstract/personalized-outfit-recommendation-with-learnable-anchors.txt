outfit aThe multimedia community has recently seen a tremen-dous surge of interest in the fashion recommendation prob-lem. A lot of efforts have been made to model the com-patibility between fashion items. Some have also studied users’ personal preferences for the outﬁts. There is, how-ever, another difﬁculty in the task that hasn’t been dealt with carefully by previous work. Users that are new to the sys-tem usually only have several (less than 5) outﬁts available for learning. With such a limited number of training exam-ples, it is challenging to model the user’s preferences reli-ably. In this work, we propose a new solution for personal-ized outﬁt recommendation that is capable of handling this case. We use a stacked self-attention mechanism to model the high-order interactions among the items. We then em-bed the items in an outﬁt into a single compact representa-tion within the outﬁt space. To accommodate the variety of users’ preferences, we characterize each user with a set of anchors, i.e. a group of learnable latent vectors in the out-ﬁt space that are the representatives of the outﬁts the user likes. We also learn a set of general anchors to model the general preference shared by all users. Based on this rep-resentation of the outﬁts and the users, we propose a simple but effective strategy for the new user proﬁling tasks. Exten-sive experiments on large scale real-world datasets demon-strate the performance of our proposed method.
