texture rather than object shape.2It is widely accepted that reasoning about object shape is important for object recognition. However, the most power-ful object recognition methods today do not explicitly make use of object shape during learning. In this work, motivated by recent developments in low-shot learning, ﬁndings in de-velopmental psychology, and the increased use of synthetic data in computer vision research, we investigate how rea-soning about 3D shape can be used to improve low-shot learning methods’ generalization performance. We pro-pose a new way to improve existing low-shot learning ap-proaches by learning a discriminative embedding space us-ing 3D object shape, and using this embedding by learning how to map images into it. Our new approach improves the performance of image-only low-shot learning approaches on multiple datasets. We also introduce Toys4K, a 3D object dataset with the largest number of object categories cur-rently available, which supports low-shot learning. 1
