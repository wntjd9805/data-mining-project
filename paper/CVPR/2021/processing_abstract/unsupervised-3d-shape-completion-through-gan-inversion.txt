Most 3D shape completion approaches rely heavily on partial-complete shape pairs and learn in a fully super-vised manner. Despite their impressive performances on in-domain data, when generalizing to partial shapes in other forms or real-world partial scans, they often obtain unsat-isfactory results due to domain gaps. In contrast to previ-ous fully supervised approaches, in this paper we presentShapeInversion, which introduces Generative AdversarialNetwork (GAN) inversion to shape completion for the Ô¨Årst time. ShapeInversion uses a GAN pre-trained on complete shapes by searching for a latent code that gives a complete shape that best reconstructs the given partial input. In this way, ShapeInversion no longer needs paired training data, and is capable of incorporating the rich prior captured in a well-trained generative model. On the ShapeNet bench-mark, the proposed ShapeInversion outperforms the SOTA unsupervised method, and is comparable with supervised methods that are learned using paired data. It also demon-strates remarkable generalization ability, giving robust re-sults for real-world scans and partial inputs of various forms and incompleteness levels. Importantly, ShapeInver-sion naturally enables a series of additional abilities thanks to the involvement of a pre-trained GAN, such as producing multiple valid complete shapes for an ambiguous partial in-put, as well as shape manipulation and interpolation.
