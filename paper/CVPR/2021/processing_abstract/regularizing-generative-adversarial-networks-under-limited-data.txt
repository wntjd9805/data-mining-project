geNet benchmark is available. The source code is available at https://github.com/google/lecam-gan.Recent years have witnessed the rapid progress of gen-erative adversarial networks (GANs). However, the success of the GAN models hinges on a large amount of training data. This work proposes a regularization approach for training robust GAN models on limited data. We theoret-ically show a connection between the regularized loss and an f -divergence called LeCam-divergence, which we ﬁnd is more robust under limited training data. Extensive ex-periments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed regularization scheme 1) improves the gener-alization performance and stabilizes the learning dynamics of GAN models under limited training data, and 2) comple-ments the recent data augmentation methods. These proper-ties facilitate training GAN models to achieve state-of-the-art performance when only limited training data of the Ima-*Work done during HY’s internship at Google Research.
