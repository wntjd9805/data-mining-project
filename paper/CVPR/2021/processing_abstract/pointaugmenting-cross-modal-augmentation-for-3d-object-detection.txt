Camera and LiDAR are two complementary sensors for 3D object detection in the autonomous driving con-text. Camera provides rich texture and color cues whileLiDAR specializes in relative distance sensing. The chal-lenge of 3D object detection lies in effectively fusing 2D camera images with 3D LiDAR points.In this paper, we present a novel cross-modal 3D object detection algorithm, named PointAugmenting. On one hand, PointAugment-ing decorates point clouds with corresponding point-wiseCNN features extracted by pretrained 2D detection mod-els, and then performs 3D object detection over the deco-rated point clouds. In comparison with highly abstract se-mantic segmentation scores to decorate point clouds, CNN features from detection networks adapt to object appear-ance variations, achieving signiﬁcant improvement. On the other hand, PointAugmenting beneﬁts from a novel cross-modal data augmentation algorithm, which consistently pastes virtual objects into images and point clouds dur-ing network training. Extensive experiments on the large-scale nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effec-tiveness and efﬁciency of our PointAugmenting. Notably,PointAugmenting outperforms the LiDAR-only baseline de-tector by +6.5% mAP and achieves the new state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes leaderboard to date.
