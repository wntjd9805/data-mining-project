Humans can communicate emotions through a plethora of facial expressions, each with its own intensity, nuances and ambiguities. The generation of such variety by means of conditional GANs is limited to the expressions encoded in the used label system. These limitations are caused either due to burdensome labelling demand or the confounded la-bel space. On the other hand, learning from inexpensive and intuitive basic categorical emotion labels leads to lim-ited emotion variability. In this paper, we propose a novelGAN-based framework that learns an expressive and inter-pretable conditional space (usable as a label space) of emo-tions, instead of conditioning on handcrafted labels. Our framework only uses the categorical labels of basic emo-tions to learn jointly the conditional space as well as emo-tion manipulation. Such learning can beneﬁt from the im-age variability within discrete labels, especially when the intrinsic labels reside beyond the discrete space of the de-ﬁned. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, by allowing us to control and gener-ate a gamut of complex and compound emotions while us-ing only the basic categorical emotion labels during train-ing.
