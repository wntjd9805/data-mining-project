Generative adversarial network (GAN) has become one of the most important neural network models for classical unsupervised machine learning. A variety of discriminator loss functions have been developed to train GAN’s discrim-inators and they all have a common structure: a sum of real and fake losses that only depends on the actual and generated data respectively. One challenge associated with an equally weighted sum of two losses is that the training may beneﬁt one loss but harm the other, which we show causes instability and mode collapse. In this paper, we in-troduce a new family of discriminator loss functions that adopts a weighted sum of real and fake parts, which we call adaptive weighted loss functions or aw-loss functions. Us-ing the gradients of the real and fake parts of the loss, we can adaptively choose weights to train a discriminator in the direction that beneﬁts the GAN’s stability. Our method can be potentially applied to any discriminator model with a loss that is a sum of the real and fake parts. Experiments validated the effectiveness of our loss functions on uncon-ditional and conditional image generation tasks, improving the baseline results by a signiﬁcant margin on CIFAR-10,STL-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets in Inception Scores (IS) and Fr´echet Inception Distance (FID) metrics.
