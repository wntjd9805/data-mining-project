We propose a novel end-to-end learning-based approach for single image defocus deblurring. The proposed ap-proach is equipped with a novel Iterative Filter Adap-tive Network (IFAN) that is speciﬁcally designed to han-dle spatially-varying and large defocus blur. For adaptively handling spatially-varying blur, IFAN predicts pixel-wise deblurring ﬁlters, which are applied to defocused features of an input image to generate deblurred features. For effec-tively managing large blur, IFAN models deblurring ﬁlters as stacks of small-sized separable ﬁlters. Predicted separa-ble deblurring ﬁlters are applied to defocused features us-ing a novel Iterative Adaptive Convolution (IAC) layer. We also propose a training scheme based on defocus disparity estimation and reblurring, which signiﬁcantly boosts the de-blurring quality. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and quali-tatively on real-world images.
