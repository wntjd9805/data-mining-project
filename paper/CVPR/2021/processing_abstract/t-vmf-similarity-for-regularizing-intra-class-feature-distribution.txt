Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) leverage large-scale training dataset to produce remarkable perfor-mance on various image classiﬁcation tasks. It, however, is difﬁcult to effectively train the CNNs on some realis-tic learning situations such as regarding class imbalance, small-scale and label noises. Regularizing CNNs works well on learning with such deteriorated training datasets by mitigating overﬁtting issues. In this work, we propose a method to effectively impose regularization on feature rep-resentation learning. By focusing on the angle between a feature and a classiﬁer which is embedded in cosine similar-ity at the classiﬁcation layer, we formulate a novel similarity beyond the cosine based on von Mises-Fisher distribution of directional statistics. In contrast to the cosine similar-ity, our similarity is compact while having heavy tail, which contributes to regularizing intra-class feature distribution to improve generalization performance. Through the exper-iments on some realistic learning situations such as of im-balance, small-scale and noisy labels, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for training CNNs, in comparison to the other regularization methods.
