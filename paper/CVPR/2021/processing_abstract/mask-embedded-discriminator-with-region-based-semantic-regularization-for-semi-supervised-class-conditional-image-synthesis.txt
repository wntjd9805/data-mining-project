Semi-supervised generative learning (SSGL) makes use of unlabeled data to achieve a trade-off between the da-ta collection/annotation effort and generation performance, when adequate labeled data are not available. Learning precise class semantics is crucial for class-conditional im-age synthesis with limited supervision. Toward this end, we propose a semi-supervised Generative Adversarial Network with a Mask-Embedded Discriminator, which is referred to as MED-GAN. By incorporating a mask embedding mod-ule, the discriminator features are associated with spatial information, such that the focus of the discriminator can be limited in the speciﬁed regions when distinguishing between real and synthesized images. A generator is enforced to syn-thesize the instances holding more precise class semantics in order to deceive the enhanced discriminator. Also ben-eﬁting from mask embedding, region-based semantic reg-ularization is imposed on the discriminator feature space, and the degree of separation between real and fake class-es and among object categories can thus be increased. This eventually improves class-conditional distribution matching between real and synthesized data. In the experiments, the superior performance of MED-GAN demonstrates the effec-tiveness of mask embedding and associated regularizers in facilitating SSGL.
