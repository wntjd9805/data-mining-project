We show the generative capability of an image classiﬁer network by synthesizing high-resolution, photo-realistic, and diverse images at scale. The overall methodology, called Synthesize-It-Classiﬁer (STIC), does not require an explicit generator network to estimate the density of the data distribution and sample images from that, but instead uses the classiﬁer’s knowledge of the boundary to perform gradient ascent w.r.t. class logits and then synthesizes im-ages using the Gram Matrix Metropolis Adjusted LangevinAlgorithm (GRMALA) by drawing on a blank canvas. Dur-ing training, the classiﬁer iteratively uses these synthesized images as fake samples and re-estimates the class bound-ary in a recurrent fashion to improve both the classiﬁca-tion accuracy and quality of synthetic images. The STIC shows that mixing of the hard fake samples (i.e. those syn-thesized by the one-hot class conditioning), and the soft fake samples (which are synthesized as a convex combination of classes, i.e. a mixup of classes [36]) improves class inter-polation. We demonstrate an Attentive-STIC network that shows iterative drawing of synthesized images on the Im-ageNet dataset that has thousands of classes. In addition, we introduce the synthesis using a class conditional score classiﬁer (Score-STIC) instead of a normal image classiﬁer and show improved results on several real world datasets, i.e. ImageNet, LSUN and CIFAR 10.
