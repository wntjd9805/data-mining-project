Request: Make the image lighterOperation Planning InputOutputLanguage-Guided Image Editing Input target #% intermediate images #$ input #!Recently, language-guided global image editing draws increasing attention with growing application potentials.However, previous GAN-based methods are not only con-ﬁned to domain-speciﬁc, low-resolution data but also lack-ing in interpretability. To overcome the collective difﬁcul-ties, we develop a text-to-operation model to map the vague editing language request into a series of editing operations, e.g., change contrast, brightness, and saturation. Each op-eration is interpretable and differentiable. Furthermore, the only supervision in the task is the target image, which is insufﬁcient for a stable training of sequential decisions.Hence, we propose a novel operation planning algorithm to generate possible editing sequences from the target im-age as pseudo ground truth. Comparison experiments on the newly collected MA5k-Req dataset and GIER dataset show the advantages of our methods. Code is available at https://github.com/jshi31/T2ONet.
