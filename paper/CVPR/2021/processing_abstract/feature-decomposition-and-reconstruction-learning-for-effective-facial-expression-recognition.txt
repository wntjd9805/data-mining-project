In this paper, we propose a novel Feature Decomposition and Reconstruction Learning (FDRL) method for effective facial expression recognition. We view the expression infor-mation as the combination of the shared information (ex-pression similarities) across different expressions and the unique information (expression-speciﬁc variations) for each expression. More speciﬁcally, FDRL mainly consists of two crucial networks: a Feature Decomposition Network (FDN) and a Feature Reconstruction Network (FRN). In particu-lar, FDN ﬁrst decomposes the basic features extracted from a backbone network into a set of facial action-aware latent features to model expression similarities. Then, FRN cap-tures the intra-feature and inter-feature relationships for la-tent features to characterize expression-speciﬁc variations, and reconstructs the expression feature. To this end, two modules including an intra-feature relation modeling mod-ule and an inter-feature relation modeling module are de-veloped in FRN. Experimental results on both the in-the-lab databases (including CK+, MMI, and Oulu-CASIA) and the in-the-wild databases (including RAF-DB and SFEW) show that the proposed FDRL method consistently achieves higher recognition accuracy than several state-of-the-art methods. This clearly highlights the beneﬁt of feature de-composition and reconstruction for classifying expressions.
