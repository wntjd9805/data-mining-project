Domain generalizable (DG) person re-identiﬁcation (ReID) is a challenging problem because we cannot ac-cess any unseen target domain data during training. Almost all the existing DG ReID methods follow the same pipeline where they use a hybrid dataset from multiple source do-mains for training, and then directly apply the trained model to the unseen target domains for testing. These meth-ods often neglect individual source domains’ discriminative characteristics and their relevances w.r.t. the unseen target domains, though both of which can be leveraged to help the model’s generalization. To handle the above two issues, we propose a novel method called the relevance-aware mixture of experts (RaMoE), using an effective voting-based mix-ture mechanism to dynamically leverage source domains’ diverse characteristics to improve the model’s generaliza-tion. Speciﬁcally, we propose a decorrelation loss to make the source domain networks (experts) keep the diversity and discriminability of individual domains’ characteristics. Be-sides, we design a voting network to adaptively integrate all the experts’ features into the more generalizable ag-gregated features with domain relevance. Considering the target domains’ invisibility during training, we propose a novel learning-to-learn algorithm combined with our rela-tion alignment loss to update the voting network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RaMoE outper-forms the state-of-the-art methods.
