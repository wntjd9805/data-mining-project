a-posteriori (MAP) estimation problem [17, 21]:The classical maximum a-posteriori (MAP) framework for non-blind image deblurring requires deﬁning suitable data and regularization terms, whose interplay yields the desired clear image through optimization. The vast majority of prior work focuses on advancing one of these two crucial ingredients, while keeping the other one standard. Con-sidering the indispensable roles and interplay of both data and regularization terms, we propose a simple and effective approach to jointly learn these two terms, embedding deep neural networks within the constraints of the MAP frame-work, trained in an end-to-end manner. The neural net-works not only yield suitable image-adaptive features for both terms, but actually predict per-pixel spatially-variant features instead of the commonly used spatially-uniform ones. The resulting spatially-variant data and regulariza-tion terms particularly improve the restoration of ﬁne-scale structures and detail. Quantitative and qualitative results underline the effectiveness of our approach, substantially outperforming the current state of the art.
