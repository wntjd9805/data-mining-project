Encouraging progress in few-shot semantic segmenta-tion has been made by leveraging features learned upon base classes with sufÔ¨Åcient training data to represent novel classes with few-shot examples. However, this feature shar-ing mechanism inevitably causes semantic aliasing between novel classes when they have similar compositions of se-mantic concepts. In this paper, we reformulate few-shot seg-mentation as a semantic reconstruction problem, and con-vert base class features into a series of basis vectors which span a class-level semantic space for novel class recon-struction. By introducing contrastive loss, we maximize the orthogonality of basis vectors while minimizing semantic aliasing between classes. Within the reconstructed repre-sentation space, we further suppress interference from other classes by projecting query features to the support vector for precise semantic activation. Our proposed approach, referred to as anti-aliasing semantic reconstruction (ASR), provides a systematic yet interpretable solution for few-shot learning problems. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets show that ASR achieves strong re-sults compared with the prior works. Code will be released at github.com/Bibkiller/ASR.
