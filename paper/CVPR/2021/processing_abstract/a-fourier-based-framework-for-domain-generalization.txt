Modern deep neural networks suffer from performance degradation when evaluated on testing data under differ-ent distributions from training data. Domain generaliza-tion aims at tackling this problem by learning transferable knowledge from multiple source domains in order to gen-eralize to unseen target domains. This paper introduces a novel Fourier-based perspective for domain generaliza-tion. The main assumption is that the Fourier phase in-formation contains high-level semantics and is not easily affected by domain shifts. To force the model to capture phase information, we develop a novel Fourier-based data augmentation strategy called amplitude mix which linearly interpolates between the amplitude spectrums of two im-ages. A dual-formed consistency loss called co-teacher reg-ularization is further introduced between the predictions in-duced from original and augmented images. Extensive ex-periments on three benchmarks have demonstrated that the proposed method is able to achieve state-of-the-arts perfor-mance for domain generalization.
