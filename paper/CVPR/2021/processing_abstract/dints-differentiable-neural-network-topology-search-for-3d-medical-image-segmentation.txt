Recently, neural architecture search (NAS) has been ap-plied to automatically search high-performance networks for medical image segmentation. The NAS search space usually contains a network topology level (controlling con-nections among cells with different spatial scales) and a cell level (operations within each cell). Existing meth-ods either require long searching time for large-scale 3D image datasets, or are limited to pre-deﬁned topologies (such as U-shaped or single-path) .In this work, we fo-cus on three important aspects of NAS in 3D medical image segmentation: ﬂexible multi-path network topology, high search efﬁciency, and budgeted GPU memory usage. A novel differentiable search framework is proposed to sup-port fast gradient-based search within a highly ﬂexible network topology search space. The discretization of the searched optimal continuous model in differentiable scheme may produce a sub-optimal ﬁnal discrete model (discretiza-tion gap). Therefore, we propose a topology loss to alleviate this problem. In addition, the GPU memory usage for the searched 3D model is limited with budget constraints dur-ing search. Our Differentiable Network Topology Search scheme (DiNTS) is evaluated on the Medical SegmentationDecathlon (MSD) challenge, which contains ten challeng-ing segmentation tasks. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance and the top ranking on the MSD chal-lenge leaderboard.
