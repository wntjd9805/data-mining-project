Localization of anatomical landmarks to perform two-dimensional measurements in echocardiography is part of routine clinical workﬂow in cardiac disease diagnosis. Au-tomatic localization of those landmarks is highly desirable to improve workﬂow and reduce interobserver variability.Training a machine learning framework to perform such lo-calization is hindered given the sparse nature of gold stan-dard labels; only few percent of cardiac cine series frames are normally manually labeled for clinical use. In this pa-per, we propose a new end-to-end reciprocal detection and tracking model that is speciﬁcally designed to handle the sparse nature of echocardiography labels. The model is trained using few annotated frames across the entire car-diac cine sequence to generate consistent detection and tracking of landmarks, and an adversarial training for the model is proposed to take advantage of these annotated frames. The superiority of the proposed reciprocal model is demonstrated using a series of experiments.
