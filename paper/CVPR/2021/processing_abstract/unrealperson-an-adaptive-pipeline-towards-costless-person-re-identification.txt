The main difﬁculty of person re-identiﬁcation (ReID) lies in collecting annotated data and transferring the model across different domains. This paper presents UnrealPer-son, a novel pipeline that makes full use of unreal image data to decrease the costs in both the training and deploy-ment stages. Its fundamental part is a system that can gen-erate synthesized images of high-quality and from control-lable distributions. Instance-level annotation goes with the synthesized data and is almost free. We point out some de-tails in image synthesis that largely impact the data quality.With 3,000 IDs and 120,000 instances, our method achieves a 38.5% rank-1 accuracy when being directly transferred toMSMT17. It almost doubles the former record using syn-thesized data and even surpasses previous direct transfer records using real data. This offers a good basis for un-supervised domain adaption, where our pre-trained model is easily plugged into the state-of-the-art algorithms to-wards higher accuracy. In addition, the data distribution can be ﬂexibly adjusted to ﬁt some corner ReID scenarios, which widens the application of our pipeline. We publish our data synthesis toolkit and synthesized data in https://github.com/FlyHighest/UnrealPerson.
