accuracy. We also release the codes.Despite the recent success of single image-based 3D hu-man pose and shape estimation methods, recovering tem-porally consistent and smooth 3D human motion from a video is still challenging. Several video-based methods have been proposed; however, they fail to resolve the sin-gle image-based methods’ temporal inconsistency issue due to a strong dependency on a static feature of the current frame. In this regard, we present a temporally consistent mesh recovery system (TCMR). It effectively focuses on the past and future frames’ temporal information without being dominated by the current static feature. Our TCMR signif-icantly outperforms previous video-based methods in tem-poral consistency with better per-frame 3D pose and shape
