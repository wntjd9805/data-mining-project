With the growing use of camera devices, the industry has many image datasets that provide more opportunities for collaboration between the machine learning commu-nity and industry. However, the sensitive information in the datasets discourages data owners from releasing these datasets. Despite recent research devoted to removing sen-sitive information from images, they provide neither mean-ingful privacy-utility trade-off nor provable privacy guar-antees. In this study, with the consideration of the percep-tual similarity, we propose perceptual indistinguishability (PI) as a formal privacy notion particularly for images. We also propose PI-Net, a privacy-preserving mechanism that achieves image obfuscation with PI guarantee. Our study shows that PI-Net achieves signiÔ¨Åcantly better privacy util-ity trade-off through public image data.
