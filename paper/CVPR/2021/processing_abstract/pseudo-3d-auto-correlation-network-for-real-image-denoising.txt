The extraction of auto-correlation in images has shown great potential in deep learning networks, such as the self-attention mechanism in the channel domain and the self-similarity mechanism in the spatial domain. However, the realization of the above mechanisms mostly requires com-plicated module stacking and a large number of convolu-tion calculations, which inevitably increases model com-plexity and memory cost. Therefore, we propose a pseudo 3D auto-correlation network (P3AN) to explore a more efÔ¨Å-cient way of capturing contextual information in image de-noising. On the one hand, P3AN uses fast 1D convolution instead of dense connections to realize criss-cross interac-tion, which requires less computational resources. On the other hand, the operation does not change the feature size and makes it easy to expand. It means that only a simple adaptive fusion is needed to obtain contextual information that includes both the channel domain and the spatial do-main. Our method built a pseudo 3D auto-correlation at-tention block through 1D convolutions and a lightweight 2D structure for more discriminative features. Extensive exper-iments have been conducted on three synthetic and four real noisy datasets. According to quantitative metrics and visual quality evaluation, the P3AN shows great superiority and surpasses state-of-the-art image denoising methods.
