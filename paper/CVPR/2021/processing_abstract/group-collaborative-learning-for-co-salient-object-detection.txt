We present a novel group collaborative learning frame-work (GCoNet) capable of detecting co-salient objects in real time (16ms), by simultaneously mining consensus rep-resentations at group level based on the two necessary cri-teria: 1) intra-group compactness to better formulate the consistency among co-salient objects by capturing their in-herent shared attributes using our novel group afﬁnity mod-ule; 2) inter-group separability to effectively suppress the inﬂuence of noisy objects on the output by introducing our new group collaborating module conditioning the inconsis-tent consensus. To learn a better embedding space without extra computational overhead, we explicitly employ auxil-iary classiﬁcation supervision. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks, i.e., CoCA, CoSOD3k, andCosal2015, demonstrate that our simple GCoNet outper-forms 10 cutting-edge models and achieves the new state-of-the-art. We demonstrate this paper’s new technical contri-butions on a number of important downstream computer vi-sion applications including content aware co-segmentation, co-localization based automatic thumbnails, etc. Code has been made publicly available: https://github.com/ fanq15/GCoNet.
