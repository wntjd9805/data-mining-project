Despite the recent success of deep neural networks, it remains challenging to effectively model the long-tail class distribution in visual recognition tasks. To address this prob-lem, we ﬁrst investigate the performance bottleneck of the two-stage learning framework via ablative study. Motivated by our discovery, we propose a uniﬁed distribution alignment strategy for long-tail visual recognition. Speciﬁcally, we de-velop an adaptive calibration function that enables us to adjust the classiﬁcation scores for each data point. We then introduce a generalized re-weight method in the two-stage learning to balance the class prior, which provides a ﬂexible and uniﬁed solution to diverse scenarios in visual recogni-tion tasks. We validate our method by extensive experiments on four tasks, including image classiﬁcation, semantic seg-mentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our approach achieves the state-of-the-art results across all four recognition tasks with a simple and uniﬁed framework.
