Capturing challenging human motions is critical for nu-merous applications, but it suffers from complex motion pat-terns and severe self-occlusion under the monocular setting.In this paper, we propose ChallenCap — a template-based approach to capture challenging 3D human motions using a single RGB camera in a novel learning-and-optimization framework, with the aid of multi-modal references. We propose a hybrid motion inference stage with a generation network, which utilizes a temporal encoder-decoder to ex-tract the motion details from the pair-wise sparse-view ref-erence, as well as a motion discriminator to utilize the un-paired marker-based references to extract speciﬁc challeng-ing motion characteristics in a data-driven manner. We fur-ther adopt a robust motion optimization stage to increase the tracking accuracy, by jointly utilizing the learned mo-tion details from the supervised multi-modal references as well as the reliable motion hints from the input image refer-ence. Extensive experiments on our new challenging motion dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach to capture challenging human motions.
