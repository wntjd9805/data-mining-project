We present Self-Ensembling Single-Stage object Detec-tor (SE-SSD) for accurate and efﬁcient 3D object detec-tion in outdoor point clouds. Our key focus is on exploit-ing both soft and hard targets with our formulated con-straints to jointly optimize the model, without introducing extra computation in the inference. Speciﬁcally, SE-SSD contains a pair of teacher and student SSDs, in which we design an effective IoU-based matching strategy to ﬁlter soft targets from the teacher and formulate a consistency loss to align student predictions with them. Also, to maximize the distilled knowledge for ensembling the teacher, we design a new augmentation scheme to produce shape-aware aug-mented samples to train the student, aiming to encourage it to infer complete object shapes. Lastly, to better exploit hard targets, we design an ODIoU loss to supervise the stu-dent with constraints on the predicted box centers and ori-entations. Our SE-SSD attains top performance compared with all prior published works. Also, it attains top preci-sions for car detection in the KITTI benchmark (ranked 1st and 2nd on the BEV and 3D leaderboards1, respectively) with an ultra-high inference speed.
