3D morphable models are widely used for the shape rep-resentation of an object class in computer vision and graph-ics applications. In this work, we focus on deep 3D mor-phable models that directly apply deep learning on 3D mesh data with a hierarchical structure to capture information at multiple scales. While great efforts have been made to de-sign the convolution operator, how to best aggregate ver-tex features across hierarchical levels deserves further at-tention.In contrast to resorting to mesh decimation, we propose an attention based module to learn mapping matri-ces for better feature aggregation across hierarchical lev-els. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the mapping matrices are generated by a compatibility function of the keys and queries. The keys and queries are trainable variables, learned by optimizing the target objective, and shared by all data samples of the same object class. Our proposed module can be used as a train-only drop-in replacement for the feature aggregation in existing architectures for both downsampling and upsam-pling. Our experiments show that through the end-to-end training of the mapping matrices, we achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of 3D shape datasets in comparison to existing morphable models.
