Detecting aligned 3D keypoints is essential under many scenarios such as object tracking, shape retrieval and robotics. However, it is generally hard to prepare a high-quality dataset for all types of objects due to the ambiguity of keypoint itself. Meanwhile, current unsupervised detec-tors are unable to generate aligned keypoints with good cov-erage. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised aligned keypoint detector, Skeleton Merger, which utilizes skeletons to reconstruct objects. It is based on an Autoencoder archi-tecture. The encoder proposes keypoints and predicts acti-vation strengths of edges between keypoints. The decoder performs uniform sampling on the skeleton and reÔ¨Ånes it into small point clouds with pointwise offsets. Then the acti-vation strengths are applied and the sub-clouds are merged.Composite Chamfer Distance (CCD) is proposed as a dis-tance between the input point cloud and the reconstruction composed of sub-clouds masked by activation strengths. We demonstrate that Skeleton Merger is capable of detecting semantically-rich salient keypoints with good alignment, and shows comparable performance to supervised methods on the KeypointNet dataset. It is also shown that the detec-tor is robust to noise and subsampling. Our code is avail-able at https://github.com/eliphatfs/SkeletonMerger.
