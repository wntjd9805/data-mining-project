This paper studies the single image super-resolution problem using adder neural networks (AdderNets). Com-pared with convolutional neural networks, AdderNets uti-lize additions to calculate the output features thus avoid massive energy consumptions of conventional multiplica-tions. However, it is very hard to directly inherit the existing success of AdderNets on large-scale image classiﬁcation to the image super-resolution task due to the different calcu-lation paradigm. Speciﬁcally, the adder operation cannot easily learn the identity mapping, which is essential for im-age processing tasks. In addition, the functionality of high-pass ﬁlters cannot be ensured by AdderNets. To this end, we thoroughly analyze the relationship between an adder oper-ation and the identity mapping and insert shortcuts to en-hance the performance of SR models using adder networks.Then, we develop a learnable power activation for adjust-ing the feature distribution and reﬁning details. Experi-ments conducted on several benchmark models and datasets demonstrate that, our image super-resolution models usingAdderNets can achieve comparable performance and visual quality to that of their CNN baselines with an about 2.5× reduction on the energy consumption.
