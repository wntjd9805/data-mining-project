Determining which image regions to concentrate is crit-ical for Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. Con-ventional HOI detectors focus on either detected human and object pairs or pre-deÔ¨Åned interaction locations, which lim-its learning of the effective features. In this paper, we refor-mulate HOI detection as an adaptive set prediction prob-lem, with this novel formulation, we propose an AdaptiveSet-based one-stage framework (AS-Net) with parallel in-stance and interaction branches. To attain this, we map a trainable interaction query set to an interaction prediction set with transformer. Each query adaptively aggregates the interaction-relevant features from global contexts through multi-head co-attention. Besides, the training process is supervised adaptively by matching each ground-truth with the interaction prediction. Furthermore, we design an ef-fective instance-aware attention module to introduce in-structive features from the instance branch into the inter-action branch. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods without any extra human pose and lan-guage features on three challenging HOI detection datasets.Especially, we achieve over 31% relative improvement on a large scale HICO-DET dataset.
