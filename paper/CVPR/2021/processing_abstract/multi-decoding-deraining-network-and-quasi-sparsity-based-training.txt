Existing deep deraining models are mainly learned via directly minimizing the statistical differences between rainy images and rain-free ground truths. They emphasize learn-ing a mapping from rainy images to rain-free images with supervision. Despite the demonstrated success, these meth-ods do not perform well on restoring the ﬁne-grained local details or removing blurry rainy traces. In this work, we aim to exploit the intrinsic priors of rainy images and de-velop intrinsic loss functions to facilitate training derain-ing networks, which decompose a rainy image into a rain-free background layer and a rainy layer containing intact rain streaks. To this end, we introduce the quasi-sparsity prior to train network so as to generate two sparse lay-ers with intact textures of different objects. Then we ex-plore the low-value prior to compensate sparsity, forcing all rain streaks to enter into one layer while non-rain con-tents into another layer to restore image details. We in-troduce a multi-decoding structure to specially supervise the generation of multi-type deraining features. This helps to learn the most contributory features to deraining in re-spective spaces. Moreover, our model stabilizes the feature values from multi-spaces via information sharing to allevi-ate potential artifacts, which also accelerates the running speed. Extensive experiments show that the proposed de-raining method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in terms of effectiveness and efﬁciency.
