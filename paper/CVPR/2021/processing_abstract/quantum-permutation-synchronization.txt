We present QuantumSync, the ﬁrst quantum algorithm for solving a synchronization problem in the context of com-puter vision. In particular, we focus on permutation syn-chronization which involves solving a non-convex optimiza-tion problem in discrete variables. We start by formulating synchronization into a quadratic unconstrained binary opti-mization problem (QUBO). While such formulation respects the binary nature of the problem, ensuring that the result is a set of permutations requires extra care. Hence, we: (i) show how to insert permutation constraints into a QUBO problem and (ii) solve the constrained QUBO problem on the current generation of the adiabatic quantum computersD-Wave. Thanks to the quantum annealing, we guarantee global optimality with high probability while sampling the energy landscape to yield conﬁdence estimates. Our proof-of-concepts realization on the adiabatic D-Wave computer demonstrates that quantum machines offer a promising way to solve the prevalent yet difﬁcult synchronization problems.
