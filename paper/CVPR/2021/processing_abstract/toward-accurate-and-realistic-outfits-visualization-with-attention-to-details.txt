Model 1Outfit AResults A-1Outfit BResults B-1Virtual try-on methods aim to generate images of fash-ion models wearing arbitrary combinations of garments.This is a challenging task because the generated image must appear realistic and accurately display the interaction be-tween garments. Prior works produce images that are ﬁlled with artifacts and fail to capture important visual details necessary for commercial applications. We propose OutﬁtVisualization Net (OVNet) to capture these important de-tails (e.g. buttons, shading, textures, realistic hemlines, and interactions between garments) and produce high quality multiple-garment virtual try-on images. OVNet consists of 1) a semantic layout generator and 2) an image genera-tion pipeline using multiple coordinated warps. We train the warper to output multiple warps using a cascade loss, which reﬁnes each successive warp to focus on poorly gen-erated regions of a previous warp and yields consistent im-provements in detail. In addition, we introduce a method for matching outﬁts with the most suitable model and pro-duce signiﬁcant improvements for both our and other previ-ous try-on methods. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we demonstrate our method generates substan-tially higher-quality studio images compared to prior works for multi-garment outﬁts. An interactive interface powered by this method has been deployed on fashion e-commerce websites and received overwhelmingly positive feedback.
