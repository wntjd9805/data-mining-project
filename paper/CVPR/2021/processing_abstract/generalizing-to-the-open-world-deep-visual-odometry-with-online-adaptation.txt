Pretrained on CityscapesDespite learning-based visual odometry (VO) has shown impressive results in recent years, the pretrained networks may easily collapse in unseen environments. The large domain gap between training and testing data makes themIn this paper, we difﬁcult to generalize to new scenes. propose an online adaptation framework for deep VO with the assistance of scene-agnostic geometric computations and Bayesian inference. In contrast to learning-based pose estimation, our method solves pose from optical ﬂow and depth while the single-view depth estimation is continuously improved with new observations by online learned uncer-tainties. Meanwhile, an online learned photometric uncer-tainty is used for further depth and pose optimization by a differentiable Gauss-Newton layer. Our method enables fast adaptation of deep VO networks to unseen environ-ments in a self-supervised manner. Extensive experiments including Cityscapes to KITTI and outdoor KITTI to indoorTUM demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art generalization ability among self-supervised VO methods.
