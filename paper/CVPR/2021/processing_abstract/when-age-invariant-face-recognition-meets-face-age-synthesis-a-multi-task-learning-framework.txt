Therefore, this paper proposes a uniﬁed, multi-task framework to jointly handle these two tasks, termed MTL-Face, which can learn age-invariant identity-related repre-sentation while achieving pleasing face synthesis. Specif-ically, we ﬁrst decompose the mixed face features into two uncorrelated components—identity- and age-related features—through an attention mechanism, and then decor-relate these two components using multi-task training and continuous domain adaption.In contrast to the conven-tional one-hot encoding that achieves group-level FAS, we propose a novel identity conditional module to achieve identity-level FAS, with a weight-sharing strategy to im-prove the age smoothness of synthesized faces.In addi-tion, we collect and release a large cross-age face dataset with age and gender annotations to advance AIFR andFAS. Extensive experiments on ﬁve benchmark cross-age datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our pro-posed MTLFace over state-of-the-art methods for AIFR andFAS. We further validate MTLFace on two popular gen-eral face recognition datasets, showing competitive perfor-mance for face recognition in the wild.
