This paper addresses the challenging unsupervised scene ﬂow estimation problem by jointly learning four low-level vision sub-tasks: optical ﬂow F, stereo-depth D, cam-era pose P and motion segmentation S. Our key insight is that the rigidity of the scene shares the same inherent geo-metrical structure with object movements and scene depth.Hence, rigidity from S can be inferred by jointly couplingF, D and P to achieve more robust estimation. To this end, we propose a novel scene ﬂow framework named EfﬁScene with efﬁcient joint rigidity learning, going beyond the ex-In isting pipeline with independent auxiliary structures.EfﬁScene, we ﬁrst estimate optical ﬂow and depth at the coarse level and then compute camera pose by Perspective-n-Points method. To jointly learn local rigidity, we design a novel Rigidity From Motion (RfM) layer with three prin-cipal components: (i) correlation extraction; (ii) boundary learning; and (iii) outlier exclusion. Final outputs are fused based on the rigid map MR from RfM at ﬁner levels. To efﬁciently train EfﬁScene, two new losses Lbnd and Lunc are designed to prevent trivial solutions and to regularize the ﬂow boundary discontinuity. Extensive experiments on scene ﬂow benchmark KITTI show that our method is ef-fective and signiﬁcantly improves the state-of-the-art ap-proaches for all sub-tasks, i.e. optical ﬂow (5.19 → 4.20), depth estimation (3.78 → 3.46), visual odometry (0.012 → 0.011) and motion segmentation (0.57 → 0.62).
