Continual learning is a realistic learning scenario forAI models. Prevalent scenario of continual learning, how-ever, assumes disjoint sets of classes as tasks and is less realistic rather artiﬁcial. Instead, we focus on ‘blurry’ task boundary; where tasks shares classes and is more realis-tic and practical. To address such task, we argue the im-portance of diversity of samples in an episodic memory.To enhance the sample diversity in the memory, we pro-pose a novel memory management strategy based on per-sample classiﬁcation uncertainty and data augmentation, named Rainbow Memory (RM). With extensive empirical validations on MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet datasets, we show that the proposed method signiﬁcantly improves the accuracy in blurry continual learning setups, outperforming state of the arts by large margins despite its simplicity.
