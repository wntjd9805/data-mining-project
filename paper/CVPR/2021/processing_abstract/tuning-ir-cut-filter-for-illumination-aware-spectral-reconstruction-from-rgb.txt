To reconstruct spectral signals from multi-channel ob-servations, in particular trichromatic RGBs, has recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional scanning-based spectral imager. It has been proven that the recon-struction accuracy relies heavily on the spectral response of the RGB camera in use. To improve accuracy, data-driven algorithms have been proposed to retrieve the best response curves of existing RGB cameras, or even to de-sign brand new three-channel response curves. Instead, this paper explores the ﬁlter-array based color imaging mecha-nism of existing RGB cameras, and proposes to design theIR-cut ﬁlter properly for improved spectral recovery, which stands out as an in-between solution with better trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and implementation com-plexity. We further propose a deep learning based spec-tral reconstruction method, which allows to recover the il-lumination spectrum as well. Experiment results with both synthetic and real images under daylight illumination have shown the beneﬁts of our IR-cut ﬁlter tuning method and our illumination-aware spectral reconstruction method.
