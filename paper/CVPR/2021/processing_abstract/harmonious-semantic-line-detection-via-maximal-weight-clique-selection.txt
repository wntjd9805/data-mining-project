A novel algorithm to detect an optimal set of seman-tic lines is proposed in this work. We develop two net-works: selection network (S-Net) and harmonization net-work (H-Net). First, S-Net computes the probabilities and offsets of line candidates. Second, we ﬁlter out irrelevant lines through a selection-and-removal process. Third, we construct a complete graph, whose edge weights are com-puted by H-Net. Finally, we determine a maximal weight clique representing an optimal set of semantic lines. More-over, to assess the overall harmony of detected lines, we propose a novel metric, called HIoU. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can detect harmo-nious semantic lines effectively and efﬁciently.
