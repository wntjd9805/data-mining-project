Visual salient object detection (SOD) aims at ﬁnding the salient object(s) that attract human attention, while cam-ouﬂaged object detection (COD) on the contrary intends to discover the camouﬂaged object(s) that hidden in the sur-rounding. In this paper, we propose a paradigm of lever-aging the contradictory information to enhance the detec-tion ability of both salient object detection and camouﬂaged object detection. We start by exploiting the easy positive samples in the COD dataset to serve as hard positive sam-ples in the SOD task to improve the robustness of the SOD model. Then, we introduce a “similarity measure” module to explicitly model the contradicting attributes of these two tasks. Furthermore, considering the uncertainty of labeling in both tasks’ datasets, we propose an adversarial learn-ing network to achieve both higher order similarity measure and network conﬁdence estimation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our solution leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for both tasks1.
