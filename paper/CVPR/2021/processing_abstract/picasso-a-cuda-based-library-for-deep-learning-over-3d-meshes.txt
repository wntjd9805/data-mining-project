We present Picasso, a CUDA-based library comprising novel modules for deep learning over complex real-world 3D meshes. Hierarchical neural architectures have proved effective in multi-scale feature extraction which signiﬁes the need for fast mesh decimation. However, existing meth-ods rely on CPU-based implementations to obtain multi-resolution meshes. We design GPU-accelerated mesh deci-mation to facilitate network resolution reduction efﬁciently on-the-ﬂy. Pooling and unpooling modules are deﬁned on the vertex clusters gathered during decimation. For fea-ture learning over meshes, Picasso contains three types of novel convolutions namely, facet2vertex, vertex2facet, and facet2facet convolution. Hence, it treats a mesh as a geo-metric structure comprising vertices and facets, rather than a spatial graph with edges as previous methods do. Picasso also incorporates a fuzzy mechanism in its ﬁlters for robust-ness to mesh sampling (vertex density). It exploits Gaussian mixtures to deﬁne fuzzy coefﬁcients for the facet2vertex con-volution, and barycentric interpolation to deﬁne the coefﬁ-cients for the remaining two convolutions. In this release, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules with competitive segmentation results on S3DIS. The library will be made public through github.
