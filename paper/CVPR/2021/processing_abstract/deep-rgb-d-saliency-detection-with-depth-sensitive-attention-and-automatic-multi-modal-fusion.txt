Depth DecompositionRGB-D salient object detection (SOD) is usually formu-lated as a problem of classiﬁcation or regression over two modalities, i.e., RGB and depth. Hence, effective RGB-D feature modeling and multi-modal feature fusion both play a vital role in RGB-D SOD. In this paper, we pro-pose a depth-sensitive RGB feature modeling scheme us-In ing the depth-wise geometric prior of salient objects. principle, the feature modeling scheme is carried out in a depth-sensitive attention module, which leads to the RGB feature enhancement as well as the background distraction reduction by capturing the depth geometry prior. More-over, to perform effective multi-modal feature fusion, we further present an automatic architecture search approach for RGB-D SOD, which does well in ﬁnding out a feasi-ble architecture from our specially designed multi-modal multi-scale search space. Extensive experiments on seven standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art.
