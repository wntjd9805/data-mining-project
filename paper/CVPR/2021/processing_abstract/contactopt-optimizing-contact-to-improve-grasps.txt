Physical contact between hands and objects plays a crit-ical role in human grasps. We show that optimizing the pose of a hand to achieve expected contact with an ob-ject can improve hand poses inferred via image-based meth-ods. Given a hand mesh and an object mesh, a deep model trained on ground truth contact data infers desirable con-tact across the surfaces of the meshes. Then, ContactOpt efﬁciently optimizes the pose of the hand to achieve desir-able contact using a differentiable contact model. Notably, our contact model encourages mesh interpenetration to ap-proximate deformable soft tissue in the hand. In our evalua-tions, our methods result in grasps that better match ground truth contact, have lower kinematic error, and are signiﬁ-cantly preferred by human participants. Code and models are available online1.
