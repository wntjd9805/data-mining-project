BiSeNet [28, 27] has been proved to be a popular two-stream network for real-time segmentation. However, its principle of adding an extra path to encode spatial informa-tion is time-consuming, and the backbones borrowed from pretrained tasks, e.g., image classiﬁcation, may be inefﬁ-cient for image segmentation due to the deﬁciency of task-speciﬁc design. To handle these problems, we propose a novel and efﬁcient structure named Short-Term Dense Con-catenate network (STDC network) by removing structure re-dundancy. Speciﬁcally, we gradually reduce the dimension of feature maps and use the aggregation of them for im-age representation, which forms the basic module of STDC network.In the decoder, we propose a Detail Aggrega-tion module by integrating the learning of spatial informa-tion into low-level layers in single-stream manner. Finally, the low-level features and deep features are fused to pre-dict the ﬁnal segmentation results. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid dataset demonstrate the effec-tiveness of our method by achieving promising trade-off between segmentation accuracy and inference speed. OnCityscapes, we achieve 71.9% mIoU on the test set with a speed of 250.4 FPS on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti, which is 45.2% faster than the latest methods, and achieve 76.8% mIoU with 97.0 FPS while inferring on higher resolution images.
