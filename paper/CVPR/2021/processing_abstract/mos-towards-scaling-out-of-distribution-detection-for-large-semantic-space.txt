Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is a central challenge for safely deploying machine learning models in the real world. Existing solutions are mainly driven by small datasets, with low resolution and very few class la-bels (e.g., CIFAR). As a result, OOD detection for large-scale image classiÔ¨Åcation tasks remains largely unexplored.In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by proposing a group-based OOD detection framework, along with a novelOOD scoring function termed MOS. Our key idea is to decompose the large semantic space into smaller groups with similar concepts, which allows simplifying the deci-sion boundaries between in- vs. out-of-distribution data for effective OOD detection. Our method scales substantially better for high-dimensional class space than previous ap-proaches. We evaluate models trained on ImageNet against four carefully curated OOD datasets, spanning diverse se-mantics. MOS establishes state-of-the-art performance, re-ducing the average FPR95 by 14.33% while achieving 6x speedup in inference compared to the previous best method.
