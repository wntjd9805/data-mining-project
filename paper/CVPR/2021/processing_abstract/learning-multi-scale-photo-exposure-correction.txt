Capturing photographs with wrong exposures remains a major source of errors in camera-based imaging. Expo-sure problems are categorized as either: (i) overexposed, where the camera exposure was too long, resulting in bright and washed-out image regions, or (ii) underexposed, where the exposure was too short, resulting in dark regions. Both under- and overexposure greatly reduce the contrast and vi-sual appeal of an image. Prior work mainly focuses on un-derexposed images or general image enhancement. In con-trast, our proposed method targets both over- and underex-posure errors in photographs. We formulate the exposure correction problem as two main sub-problems: (i) color en-hancement and (ii) detail enhancement. Accordingly, we propose a coarse-to-ﬁne deep neural network (DNN) model, trainable in an end-to-end manner, that addresses each sub-problem separately. A key aspect of our solution is a new dataset of over 24,000 images exhibiting the broadest range of exposure values to date with a corresponding properly exposed image. Our method achieves results on par with ex-isting state-of-the-art methods on underexposed images and yields signiﬁcant improvements for images suffering from overexposure errors.
