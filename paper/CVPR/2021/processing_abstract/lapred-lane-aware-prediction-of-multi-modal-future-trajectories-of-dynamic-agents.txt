In this paper, we address the problem of predicting the future motion of a dynamic agent (called a target agent) given its current and past states as well as the informa-tion on its environment. It is paramount to develop a pre-diction model that can exploit the contextual information in both static and dynamic environments surrounding the target agent and generate diverse trajectory samples that are meaningful in a trafﬁc context. We propose a novel prediction model, referred to as the lane-aware prediction (LaPred) network, which uses the instance-level lane en-tities extracted from a semantic map to predict the multi-modal future trajectories. For each lane candidate found in the neighborhood of the target agent, LaPred extracts the joint features relating the lane and the trajectories of the neighboring agents. Then, the features for all lane candi-dates are fused with the attention weights learned through a self-supervised learning task that identiﬁes the lane candi-date likely to be followed by the target agent. Using the instance-level lane information, LaPred can produce the trajectories compliant with the surroundings better than 2D raster image-based methods and generate the diverse fu-ture trajectories given multiple lane candidates. The exper-iments conducted on the public nuScenes dataset and Argo-verse dataset demonstrate that the proposed LaPred method signiﬁcantly outperforms the existing prediction models, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the benchmarks.
