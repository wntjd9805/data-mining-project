Existing semantic segmentation works mainly focus on learning the contextual information in high-level semantic features with CNNs. In order to maintain a precise bound-ary, low-level texture features are directly skip-connected into the deeper layers. Nevertheless, texture features are not only about local structure, but also include global sta-In this paper, we tistical knowledge of the input image. fully take advantages of the low-level texture features and propose a novel Statistical Texture Learning Network (STL-Net) for semantic segmentation. For the ﬁrst time, STL-Net analyzes the distribution of low level information and efﬁciently utilizes them for the task. Speciﬁcally, a novelQuantization and Counting Operator (QCO) is designed to describe the texture information in a statistical manner.Based on QCO, two modules are introduced: (1) TextureEnhance Module (TEM), to capture texture-related infor-mation and enhance the texture details; (2) Pyramid TextureFeature Extraction Module (PTFEM), to effectively extract the statistical texture features from multiple scales. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed STL-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on three seman-tic segmentation benchmarks: Cityscapes, PASCAL Context and ADE20K.
