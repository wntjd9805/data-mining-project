Pixel-wise segmentation is one of the most data and an-notation hungry tasks in our ﬁeld. Providing representa-tive and accurate annotations is often mission-critical es-pecially for challenging medical applications. In this pa-per, we propose a semi-weakly supervised segmentation al-gorithm to overcome this barrier. Our approach is based on a new formulation of deep supervision and student-teacher model and allows for easy integration of different supervi-sion signals.In contrast to previous work, we show that care has to be taken how deep supervision is integrated in lower layers and we present multi-label deep supervision as the most important secret ingredient for success. With our novel training regime for segmentation that ﬂexibly makes use of images that are either fully labeled, marked with bounding boxes, just global labels, or not at all, we are able to cut the requirement for expensive labels by 94.22% – narrowing the gap to the best fully supervised baseline to only 5% mean IoU. Our approach is validated by extensive experiments on retinal ﬂuid segmentation and we provide an in-depth analysis of the anticipated effect each annotation type can have in boosting segmentation performance.
