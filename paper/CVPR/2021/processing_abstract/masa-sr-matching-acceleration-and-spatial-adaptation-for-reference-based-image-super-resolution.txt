Reference-based image super-resolution (RefSR) has shown promising success in recovering high-frequency de-tails by utilizing an external reference image (Ref). In this task, texture details are transferred from the Ref image to the low-resolution (LR) image according to their point- or patch-wise correspondence. Therefore, high-quality cor-respondence matching is critical. It is also desired to be computationally efﬁcient. Besides, existing RefSR methods tend to ignore the potential large disparity in distributions between the LR and Ref images, which hurts the effective-ness of the information utilization. In this paper, we pro-pose the MASA network for RefSR, where two novel mod-ules are designed to address these problems. The proposedMatch & Extraction Module signiﬁcantly reduces the com-putational cost by a coarse-to-ﬁne correspondence match-ing scheme. The Spatial Adaptation Module learns the dif-ference of distribution between the LR and Ref images, and remaps the distribution of Ref features to that of LR fea-tures in a spatially adaptive way. This scheme makes the network robust to handle different reference images. Exten-sive quantitative and qualitative experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed model.
