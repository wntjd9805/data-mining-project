Video instance segmentation (VIS) is a new and critical task in computer vision. To date, top-performing VIS meth-ods extend the two-stage Mask R-CNN by adding a track-In ing branch, leaving plenty of room for improvement. contrast, we approach the VIS task from a new perspective and propose a one-stage spatial granularity network (SG-Net). Compared to the conventional two-stage methods,SG-Net demonstrates four advantages: 1) Our method has a one-stage compact architecture and each task head (de-tection, segmentation, and tracking) is crafted interdepen-dently so they can effectively share features and enjoy the joint optimization; 2) Our mask prediction is dynamically performed on the sub-regions of each detected instance, leading to high-quality masks of ﬁne granularity; 3) Each of our task predictions avoids using expensive proposal-basedRoI features, resulting in much reduced runtime complex-ity per instance; 4) Our tracking head models objects’ cen-terness movements for tracking, which effectively enhances the tracking robustness to different object appearances. In evaluation, we present state-of-the-art comparisons on theYouTube-VIS dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our compact one-stage method can achieve improved performance in both accuracy and inference speed. We hope our SG-Net could serve as a strong and ﬂexible base-line for the VIS task. Our code will be available here1.
