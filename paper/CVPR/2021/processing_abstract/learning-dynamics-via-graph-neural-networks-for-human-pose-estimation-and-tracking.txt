History PosesPose Estimation (HRNet)OursMulti-person pose estimation and tracking serve as cru-cial steps for video understanding. Most state-of-the-art ap-proaches rely on ﬁrst estimating poses in each frame and only then implementing data association and reﬁnement.Despite the promising results achieved, such a strategy is inevitably prone to missed detections especially in heavily-cluttered scenes, since this tracking-by-detection paradigm is, by nature, largely dependent on visual evidences that are absent in the case of occlusion. In this paper, we pro-pose a novel online approach to learning the pose dynam-ics, which are independent of pose detections in current fame, and hence may serve as a robust estimation even in challenging scenarios including occlusion. Speciﬁcally, we derive this prediction of dynamics through a graph neural network (GNN) that explicitly accounts for both spatial-temporal and visual information. It takes as input the his-torical pose tracklets and directly predicts the correspond-ing poses in the following frame for each tracklet. The predicted poses will then be aggregated with the detected poses, if any, at the same frame so as to produce the ﬁnal pose, potentially recovering the occluded joints missed by the estimator. Experiments on PoseTrack 2017 and Pose-Track 2018 datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves results superior to the state of the art on both hu-man pose estimation and tracking tasks.
