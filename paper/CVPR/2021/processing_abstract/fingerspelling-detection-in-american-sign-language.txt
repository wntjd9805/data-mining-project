Fingerspelling, in which words are signed letter by let-ter, is an important component of American Sign Language.Most previous work on automatic ﬁngerspelling recogni-tion has assumed that the boundaries of ﬁngerspelling re-gions in signing videos are known beforehand. In this pa-per, we consider the task of ﬁngerspelling detection in raw, untrimmed sign language videos. This is an important step towards building real-world ﬁngerspelling recognition sys-tems. We propose a benchmark and a suite of evaluation metrics, some of which reﬂect the effect of detection on the downstream ﬁngerspelling recognition task. In addition, we propose a new model that learns to detect ﬁngerspelling via multi-task training, incorporating pose estimation andﬁngerspelling recognition (transcription) along with detec-tion, and compare this model to several alternatives. The model outperforms all alternative approaches across all metrics, establishing a state of the art on the benchmark.
