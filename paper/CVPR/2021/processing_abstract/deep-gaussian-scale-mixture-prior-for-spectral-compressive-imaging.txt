In coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) system, the real-world hyperspectral image (HSI) can be re-constructed from the captured compressive image in a snap-shot. Model-based HSI reconstruction methods employed hand-crafted priors to solve the reconstruction problem, but most of which achieved limited success due to the poor rep-resentation capability of these hand-crafted priors. Deep learning based methods learning the mappings between the compressive images and the HSIs directly achieved much better results. Yet, it is nontrivial to design a powerful deep network heuristically for achieving satisﬁed results. In this paper, we propose a novel HSI reconstruction method based on the Maximum a Posterior (MAP) estimation framework using learned Gaussian Scale Mixture (GSM) prior. Dif-ferent from existing GSM models using hand-crafted scale priors (e.g., the Jeffrey’s prior), we propose to learn the scale prior through a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). Furthermore, we also propose to estimate the lo-cal means of the GSM models by the DCNN. All the pa-rameters of the MAP estimation algorithm and the DCNN parameters are jointly optimized through end-to-end train-ing. Extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outper-forms existing state-of-the-art methods.
