Segmenting highly-overlapping objects is challenging, because typically no distinction is made between real object contours and occlusion boundaries. Unlike previous two-stage instance segmentation methods, we model image for-mation as composition of two overlapping layers, and pro-pose Bilayer Convolutional Network (BCNet), where the top GCN layer detects the occluding objects (occluder) and the bottom GCN layer infers partially occluded instance (occludee). The explicit modeling of occlusion relationship with bilayer structure naturally decouples the boundaries of both the occluding and occluded instances, and consid-ers the interaction between them during mask regression.We validate the efÔ¨Åcacy of bilayer decoupling on both one-stage and two-stage object detectors with different back-bones and network layer choices. Despite its simplicity, extensive experiments on COCO and KINS show that our occlusion-aware BCNet achieves large and consistent per-formance gain especially for heavy occlusion cases.
