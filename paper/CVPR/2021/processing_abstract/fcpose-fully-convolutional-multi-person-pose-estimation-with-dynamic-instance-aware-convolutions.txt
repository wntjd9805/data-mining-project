We propose a fully convolutional multi-person pose es-timation framework using dynamic instance-aware convo-lutions, termed FCPose. Different from existing methods, which often require ROI (Region of Interest) operations and/or grouping post-processing, FCPose eliminates theROIs and grouping post-processing with dynamic instance-aware keypoint estimation heads. The dynamic keypoint heads are conditioned on each instance (person), and can encode the instance concept in the dynamically-generated weights of their ﬁlters. Moreover, with the strong represen-tation capacity of dynamic convolutions, the keypoint heads in FCPose are designed to be very compact, resulting in fast inference and making FCPose have almost constant in-ference time regardless of the number of persons in the im-age. For example, on the COCO dataset, a real-time version of FCPose using the DLA-34 backbone infers about 4.5×*Corresponding author (email: chunhua@icloud.com). faster than Mask R-CNN (ResNet-101) (41.67 FPS vs. 9.26FPS) while achieving improved performance (64.8% APkp vs. 64.3% APkp). FCPose also offers better speed/accuracy trade-off than other state-of-the-art methods. Our exper-iment results show that FCPose is a simple yet effective multi-person pose estimation framework.
