Cardiac tagging magnetic resonance imaging (t-MRI) is the gold standard for regional myocardium deformation and cardiac strain estimation. However, this technique has not been widely used in clinical diagnosis, as a result of the dif-ﬁculty of motion tracking encountered with t-MRI images.In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based fully unsupervised method for in vivo motion tracking on t-MRI images. We ﬁrst estimate the motion ﬁeld (INF) between any two consecutive t-MRI frames by a bi-directional gen-erative diffeomorphic registration neural network. Using this result, we then estimate the Lagrangian motion ﬁeld between the reference frame and any other frame through a differentiable composition layer. By utilizing temporal information to perform reasonable estimations on spatio-temporal motion ﬁelds, this novel method provides a use-ful solution for motion tracking and image registration in dynamic medical imaging. Our method has been vali-dated on a representative clinical t-MRI dataset; the exper-imental results show that our method is superior to con-ventional motion tracking methods in terms of landmark tracking accuracy and inference efﬁciency.
