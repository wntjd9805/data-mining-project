Image of the sceneGround truthFeature learning for 3D object detection from point clouds is very challenging due to the irregularity of 3D point cloud data. In this paper, we propose Pointformer, a Trans-former backbone designed for 3D point clouds to learn fea-tures effectively. Speciﬁcally, a Local Transformer module is employed to model interactions among points in a local region, which learns context-dependent region features at an object level. A Global Transformer is designed to learn context-aware representations at the scene level. To fur-ther capture the dependencies among multi-scale represen-tations, we propose Local-Global Transformer to integrate local features with global features from higher resolution.In addition, we introduce an efﬁcient coordinate reﬁnement module to shift down-sampled points closer to object cen-troids, which improves object proposal generation. We usePointformer as the backbone for state-of-the-art object de-tection models and demonstrate signiﬁcant improvements over original models on both indoor and outdoor datasets.
