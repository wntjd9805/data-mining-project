Three-dimensional scanning by means of structured light illumination is an active imaging technique involving pro-jecting and capturing a series of striped patterns and then using the observed warping of stripes to reconstruct the tar-get object’s surface through triangulating each pixel in the camera to a unique projector coordinate corresponding to a particular feature in the projected patterns. The unde-sirable phenomenon of multi-path occurs when a camera pixel simultaneously sees features from multiple projector coordinates. Bimodal multi-path is a particularly common situation found along step edges, where the camera pixel sees both a foreground and background surface. Gener-alized from bimodal multi-path, this paper examines the phenomenon of sparse or N -modal multi-path as a more general case, where the camera pixel sees no fewer than two reﬂective surfaces, resulting in decoding errors. Using fringe projection proﬁlometry, our proposed solution is to treat each camera pixel as an underdetermined linear sys-tem of equations and to ﬁnd the sparsest (least number of paths) solution by taking an application-speciﬁc Bayesian learning approach. We validate this algorithm with both simulations and a number of challenging real-world sce-narios, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art techniques.
