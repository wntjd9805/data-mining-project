This paper proposes a novel heterogeneous grid convolu-tion that builds a graph-based image representation by ex-ploiting heterogeneity in the image content, enabling adap-tive, efﬁcient, and controllable computations in a convolu-tional architecture. More concretely, the approach builds a data-adaptive graph structure from a convolutional layer by a differentiable clustering method, pools features to the graph, performs a novel direction-aware graph convolu-tion, and unpool features back to the convolutional layer.By using the developed module, the paper proposes het-erogeneous grid convolutional networks, highly efﬁcient yet strong extension of existing architectures. We have evalu-ated the proposed approach on four image understanding tasks, semantic segmentation, object localization, road ex-traction, and salient object detection. The proposed method is effective on three of the four tasks. Especially, the method outperforms a strong baseline with more than 90% reduc-tion in ﬂoating-point operations for semantic segmentation, and achieves the state-of-the-art result for road extraction.We will share our code, model, and data.
