Specular highlight detection and removal are fundamen-tal and challenging tasks. Although recent methods have achieved promising results on the two tasks by training on synthetic training data in a supervised manner, they are typ-ically solely designed for highlight detection or removal, and their performance usually deteriorates signiﬁcantly on real-world images. In this paper, we present a novel net-work that aims to detect and remove highlights from natu-ral images. To remove the domain gap between synthetic training samples and real test images, and support the in-vestigation of learning-based approaches, we ﬁrst introduce a dataset with about 16K real images, each of which has the corresponding ground truths of highlight detection and re-moval. Using the presented dataset, we develop a multi-task network for joint highlight detection and removal, based on a new specular highlight image formation model. Ex-periments on the benchmark datasets and our new dataset show that our approach clearly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both highlight detection and removal.
