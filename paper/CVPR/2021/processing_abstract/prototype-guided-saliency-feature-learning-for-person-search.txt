Existing person search methods integrate person detec-tion and re-identiﬁcation (re-ID) module into a uniﬁed sys-tem. Though promising results have been achieved, the misalignment problem, which commonly occurs in person search, limits the discriminative feature representation for re-ID. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel framework to learn the discriminative representation by uti-lizing prototype in OIM loss. Unlike conventional methods using prototype as a representation of person identity, we utilize it as guidance to allow the attention network to con-sistently highlight multiple instances across different poses.Moreover, we propose a new prototype update scheme with adaptive momentum to increase the discriminative ability across different instances. Extensive ablation experiments demonstrate that our method can signiﬁcantly enhance the feature discriminative power, outperforming the state-of-the-art results on two person search benchmarks includingCUHK-SYSU and PRW.
