We propose Mask Guided (MG) Matting, a robust mat-ting framework that takes a general coarse mask as guid-ance. MG Matting leverages a network (PRN) design which encourages the matting model to provide self-guidance to progressively reÔ¨Åne the uncertain regions through the de-coding process. A series of guidance mask perturbation op-erations are also introduced in the training to further en-hance its robustness to external guidance. We show thatPRN can generalize to unseen types of guidance masks such as trimap and low-quality alpha matte, making it suit-able for various application pipelines. In addition, we re-visit the foreground color prediction problem for matting and propose a surprisingly simple improvement to address the dataset issue. Evaluation on real and synthetic bench-marks shows that MG Matting achieves state-of-the-art per-formance using various types of guidance inputs.
