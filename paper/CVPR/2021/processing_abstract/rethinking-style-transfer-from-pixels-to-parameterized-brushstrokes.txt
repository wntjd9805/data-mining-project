There have been many successful implementations of neural style transfer in recent years. In most of these works, the stylization process is conﬁned to the pixel domain. How-ever, we argue that this representation is unnatural because paintings usually consist of brushstrokes rather than pixels.We propose a method to stylize images by optimizing param-eterized brushstrokes instead of pixels and further introduce a simple differentiable rendering mechanism.Our approach signiﬁcantly improves visual quality and en-ables additional control over the stylization process such as controlling the ﬂow of brushstrokes through user input.We provide qualitative and quantitative evaluations that show the efﬁcacy of the proposed parameterized repre-sentation.
