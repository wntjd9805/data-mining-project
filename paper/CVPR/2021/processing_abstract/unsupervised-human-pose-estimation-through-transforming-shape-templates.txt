Human pose estimation is a major computer vision prob-lem with applications ranging from augmented reality and video capture to surveillance and movement tracking. In the medical context, the latter may be an important biomarker for neurological impairments in infants. Whilst many meth-ods exist, their application has been limited by the need for well annotated large datasets and the inability to gen-eralize to humans of different shapes and body composi-tions, e.g. children and infants. In this paper we present a novel method for learning pose estimators for human adults and infants in an unsupervised fashion. We ap-proach this as a learnable template matching problem fa-cilitated by deep feature extractors. Human-interpretable landmarks are estimated by transforming a template con-sisting of predeÔ¨Åned body parts that are characterized by 2D Gaussian distributions. Enforcing a connectivity prior guides our model to meaningful human shape representa-tions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two different datasets including adults and infants.
