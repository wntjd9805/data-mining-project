Our goal is to learn a deep network that, given a small number of images of an object of a given category, recon-structs it in 3D. While several recent works have obtained analogous results using synthetic data or assuming the avail-ability of 2D primitives such as keypoints, we are interested in working with challenging real data and with no manual an-notations. We thus focus on learning a model from multiple views of a large collection of object instances. We contribute with a new large dataset of object centric videos suitable for training and benchmarking this class of models. We show that existing techniques leveraging meshes, voxels, or im-plicit surfaces, which work well for reconstructing isolated objects, fail on this challenging data. Finally, we propose a new neural network design, called warp-conditioned ray embedding (WCR), which signiﬁcantly improves reconstruc-tion while obtaining a detailed implicit representation of 1Work completed during an internship at Facebook AI Research. the object surface and texture, also compensating for the noise in the initial SfM reconstruction that bootstrapped the learning process. Our evaluation demonstrates performance improvements over several deep monocular reconstruction baselines on existing benchmarks and on our novel dataset.For additional material please visit: https://henzler. github.io/publication/unsupervised_videos/.
