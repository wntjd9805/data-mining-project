We have witnessed rapid progress on 3D-aware image synthesis, leveraging recent advances in generative visual models and neural rendering. Existing approaches how-ever fall short in two ways: ﬁrst, they may lack an under-lying 3D representation or rely on view-inconsistent ren-dering, hence synthesizing images that are not multi-view consistent; second, they often depend upon representation network architectures that are not expressive enough, and their results thus lack in image quality. We propose a novel generative model, named Periodic Implicit Generative Ad-versarial Networks (π-GAN or pi-GAN), for high-quality 3D-aware image synthesis. π-GAN leverages neural repre-sentations with periodic activation functions and volumetric rendering to represent scenes as view-consistent radianceﬁelds. The proposed approach obtains state-of-the-art re-sults for 3D-aware image synthesis with multiple real and synthetic datasets.
