In unsupervised learning of image features without la-bels, especially on datasets with ﬁne-grained object classes, it is often very difﬁcult to tell if a given image belongs to one speciﬁc object class or another, even for human eyes.However, we can reliably tell if image C is more similar to image A than image B. In this work, we propose to explore how this relative order can be used to learn discriminative features with an unsupervised metric learning method. In-stead of resorting to clustering or self-supervision to create pseudo labels for an absolute decision, which often suffers from high label error rates, we construct reliable relative orders for groups of image samples and learn a deep neu-ral network to predict these relative orders. During train-ing, this relative order prediction network and the feature embedding network are tightly coupled, providing mutual constraints to each other to improve overall metric learn-ing performance in a cooperative manner. During test-ing, the predicted relative orders are used as constraints to optimize the generated features and reﬁne their feature distance-based image retrieval results using a constrained optimization procedure. Our experimental results demon-strate that the proposed relative orders for unsupervised learning (ROUL) method is able to signiﬁcantly improve the performance of unsupervised deep metric learning.
