Few-shot learning (FSL), which aims to recognise new classes by adapting the learned knowledge with extremely limited few-shot (support) examples, remains an important open problem in computer vision. Most of the existing meth-ods for feature alignment in few-shot learning only con-sider image-level or spatial-level alignment while omitting the channel disparity. Our insight is that these methods would lead to poor adaptation with redundant matching, and leveraging channel-wise adjustment is the key to well adapting the learned knowledge to new classes. There-fore, in this paper, we propose to learn a dynamic align-ment, which can effectively highlight both query regions and channels according to different local support infor-mation. Speciﬁcally, this is achieved by ﬁrst dynamically sampling the neighbourhood of the feature position condi-tioned on the input few shot, based on which we further predict a both position-dependent and channel-dependentDynamic Meta-ﬁlter. The ﬁlter is used to align the query feature with position-speciﬁc and channel-speciﬁc knowl-edge. Moreover, we adopt Neural Ordinary DifferentialEquation (ODE) to enable a more accurate control of the alignment.In such a sense our model is able to better capture ﬁne-grained semantic context of the few-shot exam-ple and thus facilitates dynamical knowledge adaptation for few-shot learning. The resulting framework establishes the new state-of-the-arts on major few-shot visual recognition benchmarks, including miniImageNet and tieredImageNet.
