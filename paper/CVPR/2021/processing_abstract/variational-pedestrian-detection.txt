Pedestrian detection in a crowd is a challenging task due to a high number of mutually-occluding human in-stances, which brings ambiguity and optimization difﬁcul-ties to the current IoU-based ground truth assignment pro-In this pa-cedure in classical object detection methods. per, we develop a unique perspective of pedestrian detec-tion as a variational inference problem. We formulate a novel and efﬁcient algorithm for pedestrian detection by modeling the dense proposals as a latent variable while proposing a customized Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes (AEVB) algorithm. Through the optimization of our pro-posed algorithm, a classical detector can be fashioned into a variational pedestrian detector. Experiments conducted on CrowdHuman and CityPersons datasets show that the proposed algorithm serves as an efﬁcient solution to han-dle the dense pedestrian detection problem for the case of single-stage detectors. Our method can also be ﬂexibly ap-plied to two-stage detectors, achieving notable performance enhancement.
