In this paper, we present a novel unpaired point cloud completion network, named Cycle4Completion, to infer the complete geometries from a partial 3D object. Previous unpaired completion methods merely focus on the learn-ing of geometric correspondence from incomplete shapes to complete shapes, and ignore the learning in the reverse direction, which makes them suffer from low completion accuracy due to the limited 3D shape understanding abil-ity. To address this problem, we propose two simultaneous cycle transformations between the latent spaces of com-plete shapes and incomplete ones. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁrst cycle transforms shapes from incomplete domain to com-plete domain, and then projects them back to the incom-plete domain. This process learns the geometric character-istic of complete shapes, and maintains the shape consis-tency between the complete prediction and the incomplete input. Similarly, the inverse cycle transformation starts from complete domain to incomplete domain, and goes back to complete domain to learn the characteristic of in-complete shapes. We experimentally show that our model with the learned bidirectional geometry correspondence outperforms state-of-the-art unpaired completion methods.Code will be available at https:// github.com/ diviswen/Cycle4Completion.
