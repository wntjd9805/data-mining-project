Due to its powerful capability of representation learning and high-efﬁciency computation, deep hashing has made signiﬁcant progress in large-scale image retrieval. How-ever, deep hashing networks are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which is a practical secure problem but seldom studied in hashing-based retrieval ﬁeld. In this paper, we propose a novel prototype-supervised adversarial network (ProS-GAN), which formulates a ﬂexible generative archi-tecture for efﬁcient and effective targeted hashing attack.To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst generation-based method to attack deep hashing networks. Generally, our proposed framework consists of three parts, i.e., a Pro-totypeNet, a generator and a discriminator. Speciﬁcally, the designed PrototypeNet embeds the target label into the semantic representation and learns the prototype code as the category-level representative of the target label. More-over, the semantic representation and the original image are jointly fed into the generator for ﬂexible targeted attack.Particularly, the prototype code is adopted to supervise the generator to construct the targeted adversarial example by minimizing the Hamming distance between the hash code of the adversarial example and the prototype code. Further-more, the generator is against the discriminator to simul-taneously encourage the adversarial examples visually re-alistic and the semantic representation informative. Exten-sive experiments verify that the proposed framework can ef-ﬁciently produce adversarial examples with better targeted attack performance and transferability over state-of-the-art targeted attack methods of deep hashing.
