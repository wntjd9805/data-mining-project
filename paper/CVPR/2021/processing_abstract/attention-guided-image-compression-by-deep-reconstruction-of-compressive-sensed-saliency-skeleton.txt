We propose a deep learning system for attention-guided dual-layer image compression (AGDL). In the AGDL com-pression system, an image is encoded into two layers, a base layer and an attention-guided reﬁnement layer. Unlike the existing ROI image compression methods that spend an ex-tra bit budget equally on all pixels in ROI, AGDL employs aCNN module to predict those pixels on and near a saliency sketch within ROI that are critical to perceptual quality.Only the critical pixels are further sampled by compressive sensing (CS) to form a very compact reﬁnement layer. An-other novel CNN method is developed to jointly decode the two compression layers for a much reﬁned reconstruction, while strictly satisfying the transmitted CS constraints on perceptually critical pixels. Extensive experiments demon-strate that the proposed AGDL system advances the state of the art in perception-aware image compression.
