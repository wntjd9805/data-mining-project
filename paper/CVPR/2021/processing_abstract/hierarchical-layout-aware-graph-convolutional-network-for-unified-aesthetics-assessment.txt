Learning computational models of image aesthetics can have a substantial impact on visual art and graphic de-sign. Although automatic image aesthetics assessment is a challenging topic by its subjective nature, psychological studies have conﬁrmed a strong correlation between im-age layouts and perceived image quality. While previous state-of-the-art methods attempt to learn holistic informa-tion using deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), our approach is motivated by the fact that Graph Convo-lutional Network (GCN) architecture is conceivably more suited for modeling complex relations among image regions than vanilla convolutional layers. Speciﬁcally, we present aHierarchical Layout-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (HLA-GCN) to capture layout information.It is a dedi-cated double-subnet neural network consisting of two LA-GCN modules. The ﬁrst LA-GCN module constructs an aesthetics-related graph in the coordinate space and per-forms reasoning over spatial nodes. The second LA-GCN module performs graph reasoning after aggregating signiﬁ-cant regions in a latent space. The model output is a hierar-chical representation with layout-aware features from both spatial and aggregated nodes for uniﬁed aesthetics assess-ment. Extensive evaluations show that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art on the AVA and AADB datasets across three different tasks.
