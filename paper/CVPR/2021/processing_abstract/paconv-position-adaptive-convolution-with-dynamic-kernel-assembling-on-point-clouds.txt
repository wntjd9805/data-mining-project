We introduce Position Adaptive Convolution (PAConv), a generic convolution operation for 3D point cloud process-ing. The key of PAConv is to construct the convolution ker-nel by dynamically assembling basic weight matrices stored in Weight Bank, where the coefﬁcients of these weight matri-ces are self-adaptively learned from point positions throughScoreNet. In this way, the kernel is built in a data-driven manner, endowing PAConv with more ﬂexibility than 2D convolutions to better handle the irregular and unordered point cloud data. Besides, the complexity of the learning process is reduced by combining weight matrices instead of brutally predicting kernels from point positions.Furthermore, different from the existing point convolu-tion operators whose network architectures are often heav-ily engineered, we integrate our PAConv into classicalMLP-based point cloud pipelines without changing net-work conﬁgurations. Even built on simple networks, our method still approaches or even surpasses the state-of-the-art models, and signiﬁcantly improves baseline perfor-mance on both classiﬁcation and segmentation tasks, yet with decent efﬁciency. Thorough ablation studies and vi-sualizations are provided to understand PAConv. Code is released on https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/PAConv.
