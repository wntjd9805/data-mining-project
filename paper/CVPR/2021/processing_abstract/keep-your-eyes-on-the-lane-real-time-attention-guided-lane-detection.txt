Modern lane detection methods have achieved remark-able performances in complex real-world scenarios, but many have issues maintaining real-time efﬁciency, which is important for autonomous vehicles. In this work, we pro-pose LaneATT: an anchor-based deep lane detection model, which, akin to other generic deep object detectors, uses the anchors for the feature pooling step. Since lanes follow a regular pattern and are highly correlated, we hypothesize that in some cases global information may be crucial to infer their positions, especially in conditions such as oc-clusion, missing lane markers, and others. Thus, this work proposes a novel anchor-based attention mechanism that aggregates global information. The model was evaluated ex-tensively on three of the most widely used datasets in the liter-ature. The results show that our method outperforms the cur-rent state-of-the-art methods showing both higher efﬁcacy and efﬁciency. Moreover, an ablation study is performed along with a discussion on efﬁciency trade-off options that are useful in practice. Code and models are available at https://github.com/lucastabelini/LaneATT.
