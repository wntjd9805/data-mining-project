We introduce a new family of neural network mod-els called Convolutional Dynamic Alignment Networks1 (CoDA-Nets), which are performant classiﬁers with a high degree ofTheir core build-interpretability. ing blocks are Dynamic Alignment Units (DAUs), which linearly transform their input with weight vectors that dynamically align with task-relevant patterns. As a result,CoDA-Nets model the classiﬁcation prediction through a series of input-dependent linear transformations, allowing for linear decomposition of the output into individual in-put contributions. Given the alignment of the DAUs, the resulting contribution maps align with discriminative input patterns. These model-inherent decompositions are of high visual quality and outperform existing attribution methods under quantitative metrics. Further, CoDA-Nets constitute performant classiﬁers, achieving on par results to ResNet and VGG models on e.g. CIFAR-10 and TinyImagenet.
