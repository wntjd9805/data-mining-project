Query: Several people begin chopping vegetables.Temporal video grounding aims to localize the target segment which is semantically aligned with the given sen-tence in an untrimmed video. Existing methods can be di-vided into two main categories, including proposal-based approaches and proposal-free approaches. However, the former ones suffer from the extra cost of generating pro-posals and inﬂexibility in determining ﬁne-grained bound-aries, and the latter ones usually attempt to decide the start and end timestamps directly, which brings about much dif-ﬁculty and inaccuracy. In this paper, we convert this task into a multi-step decision problem and propose a novel Cas-caded Prediction Network (CPN) to generate the grounding result in a coarse-to-ﬁne manner. Concretely, we ﬁrst en-code video and query into the same latent space and fuse them into integrated representations. Afterwards, we con-struct a segment-tree-based structure and make predictions via decision navigation and signal decomposition in a cas-caded way. We evaluate our proposed method on three large-scale publicly available benchmarks, namely Activi-tyNet Caption, Charades-STA and TACoS, where our CPN surpasses the performance of the state-of-the-art methods.
