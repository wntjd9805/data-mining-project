Scene ﬂow in 3D point clouds plays an important role in understanding dynamic environments. Although signiﬁ-cant advances have been made by deep neural networks, the performance is far from satisfactory as only per-point trans-lational motion is considered, neglecting the constraints of the rigid motion in local regions. To address the issue, we propose to introduce the motion consistency to force the smoothness among neighboring points.In addition, con-straints on the rigidity of the local transformation are also added by sharing unique rigid motion parameters for all points within each local region. To this end, a high-orderCRFs based relation module (Con-HCRFs) is deployed to explore both point-wise smoothness and region-wise rigid-ity. To empower the CRFs to have a discriminative unary term, we also introduce a position-aware ﬂow estimation module to be incorporated into the Con-HCRFs. Compre-hensive experiments on FlyingThings3D and KITTI show that our proposed framework (HCRF-Flow) achieves state-of-the-art performance and signiﬁcantly outperforms previ-ous approaches substantially.
