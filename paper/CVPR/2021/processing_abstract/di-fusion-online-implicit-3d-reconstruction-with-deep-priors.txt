Previous online 3D dense reconstruction methods strug-gle to achieve the balance between memory storage and sur-face quality, largely due to the usage of stagnant underlying geometry representation, such as TSDF (truncated signed distance functions) or surfels, without any knowledge of the scene priors.In this paper, we present DI-Fusion (DeepImplicit Fusion), based on a novel 3D representation, i.e.Probabilistic Local Implicit Voxels (PLIVoxs), for online 3D reconstruction with a commodity RGB-D camera. OurPLIVox encodes scene priors considering both the local geometry and uncertainty parameterized by a deep neu-ral network. With such deep priors, we are able to per-form online implicit 3D reconstruction achieving state-of-the-art camera trajectory estimation accuracy and mapping quality, while achieving better storage efﬁciency compared with previous online 3D reconstruction approaches.
