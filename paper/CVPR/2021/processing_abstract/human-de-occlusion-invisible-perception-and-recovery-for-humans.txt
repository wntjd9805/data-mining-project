OcclusionHuman De-occlusion ModelDe-occlusionIn this paper, we tackle the problem of human de-occlusion which reasons about occluded segmentation masks and invisible appearance content of humans. In par-ticular, a two-stage framework is proposed to estimate the invisible portions and recover the content inside. For the stage of mask completion, a stacked network structure is devised to reÔ¨Åne inaccurate masks from a general instance segmentation model and predict integrated masks simulta-neously. Additionally, the guidance from human parsing and typical pose masks are leveraged to bring prior infor-mation. For the stage of content recovery, a novel parsing guided attention module is applied to isolate body parts and capture context information across multiple scales. Besides, an Amodal Human Perception dataset (AHP) is collected to settle the task of human de-occlusion. AHP has advan-tages of providing annotations from real-world scenes and the number of humans is comparatively larger than other amodal perception datasets. Based on this dataset, ex-periments demonstrate that our method performs over the state-of-the-art techniques in both tasks of mask comple-tion and content recovery. Our AHP dataset is available at https://sydney0zq.github.io/ahp/.
