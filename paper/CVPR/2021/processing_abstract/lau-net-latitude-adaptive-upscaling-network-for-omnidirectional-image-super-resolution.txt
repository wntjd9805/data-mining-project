The omnidirectional images (ODIs) are usually at low-resolution, due to the constraints of collection, storage and transmission. The traditional two-dimensional (2D) im-age super-resolution methods are not effective for spher-ical ODIs, because ODIs tend to have non-uniformly dis-tributed pixel density and varying texture complexity across latitudes. In this work, we propose a novel latitude adap-tive upscaling network (LAU-Net) for ODI super-resolution, which allows pixels at different latitudes to adopt distinct upscaling factors. Speciﬁcally, we introduce a Laplacian multi-level separation architecture to split an ODI into dif-ferent latitude bands, and hierarchically upscale them with different factors. In addition, we propose a deep reinforce-ment learning scheme with a latitude adaptive reward, in order to automatically select optimal upscaling factors for different latitude bands. To the best of our knowledge,LAU-Net is the ﬁrst attempt to consider the latitude differ-ence for ODI super-resolution. Extensive results demon-strate that our LAU-Net signiﬁcantly advances the super-resolution performance for ODIs. Codes are available at https://github.com/wangh- allen/LAU- Net.
