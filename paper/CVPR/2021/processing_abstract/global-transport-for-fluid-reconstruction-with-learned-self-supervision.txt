We propose a novel method to reconstruct volumetricﬂows from sparse views via a global transport formulation.Instead of obtaining the space-time function of the obser-vations, we reconstruct its motion based on a single initial state. In addition we introduce a learned self-supervision that constrains observations from unseen angles. These vi-sual constraints are coupled via the transport constraints and a differentiable rendering step to arrive at a robust end-to-end reconstruction algorithm. This makes the recon-struction of highly realistic ﬂow motions possible, even from only a single input view. We show with a variety of synthetic and real ﬂows that the proposed global reconstruction of the transport process yields an improved reconstruction of theﬂuid motion.
