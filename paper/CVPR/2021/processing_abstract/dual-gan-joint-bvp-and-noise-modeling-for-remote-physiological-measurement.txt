Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) based physiolog-ical measurement has great application values in health monitoring, emotion analysis, etc. Existing methods mainly focus on how to enhance or extract the very weak blood volume pulse (BVP) signals from face videos, but seldom explicitly model the noises that dominate face video con-tent. Thus, they may suffer from poor generalization abil-ity in unseen scenarios. This paper proposes a novel ad-versarial learning approach for rPPG based physiological measurement by using Dual Generative Adversarial Net-works (Dual-GAN) to model the BVP predictor and noise distribution jointly. The BVP-GAN aims to learn a noise-resistant mapping from input to ground-truth BVP, and theNoise-GAN aims to learn the noise distribution. The twoGANs can promote each other’s capability, leading to im-proved feature disentanglement between BVP and noises.Besides, a plug-and-play block named ROI alignment and fusion (ROI-AF) block is proposed to alleviate the inconsis-tencies between different ROIs and exploit informative fea-tures from a wider receptive ﬁeld in terms of ROIs. In com-parison to state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieves better performance in heart rate, heart rate variability, and respiration frequency estimation from face videos.
