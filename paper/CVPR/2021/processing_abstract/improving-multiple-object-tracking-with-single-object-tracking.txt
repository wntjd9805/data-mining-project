Despite considerable similarities between multiple ob-ject tracking (MOT) and single object tracking (SOT) tasks, modern MOT methods have not beneﬁted from the devel-opment of SOT ones to achieve satisfactory performance.The major reason for this situation is that it is inappropri-ate and inefﬁcient to apply multiple SOT models directly to the MOT task, although advanced SOT methods are of the strong discriminative power and can run at fast speeds.In this paper, we propose a novel and end-to-end train-able MOT architecture that extends CenterNet by adding anSOT branch for tracking objects in parallel with the exist-ing branch for object detection, allowing the MOT task to beneﬁt from the strong discriminative power of SOT meth-ods in an effective and efﬁcient way. Unlike most existingSOT methods which learn to distinguish the target object from its local backgrounds, the added SOT branch trains a separate SOT model per target online to distinguish the target from its surrounding targets, assigning SOT models the novel discrimination. Moreover, similar to the detec-tion branch, the SOT branch treats objects as points, making its online learning efﬁcient even if multiple targets are pro-cessed simultaneously. Without tricks, the proposed tracker achieves MOTAs of 0.710 and 0.686, IDF1s of 0.719 and 0.714, on MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks, respectively, while running at 16 FPS on MOT17.
