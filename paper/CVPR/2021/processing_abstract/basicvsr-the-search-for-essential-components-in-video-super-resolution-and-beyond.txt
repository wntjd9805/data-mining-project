Video super-resolution (VSR) approaches tend to have more components than the image counterparts as they need to exploit the additional temporal dimension. Complex de-signs are not uncommon. In this study, we wish to untangle the knots and reconsider some most essential components for VSR guided by four basic functionalities, i.e., Propaga-tion, Alignment, Aggregation, and Upsampling. By reusing some existing components added with minimal redesigns, we show a succinct pipeline, BasicVSR, that achieves ap-pealing improvements in terms of speed and restoration quality in comparison to many state-of-the-art algorithms.We conduct systematic analysis to explain how such gain can be obtained and discuss the pitfalls. We further show the extensibility of BasicVSR by presenting an information-reÔ¨Åll mechanism and a coupled propagation scheme to fa-cilitate information aggregation. The BasicVSR and its ex-tension, IconVSR, can serve as strong baselines for futureVSR approaches.
