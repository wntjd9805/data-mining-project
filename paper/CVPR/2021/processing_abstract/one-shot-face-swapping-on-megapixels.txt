Face swapping has both positive applications such as entertainment, human-computer interaction, etc., and neg-ative applications such as DeepFake threats to politics, eco-nomics, etc. Nevertheless, it is necessary to understand the scheme of advanced methods for high-quality face swap-ping and generate enough and representative face swapping images to train DeepFake detection algorithms. This pa-per proposes the ﬁrst Megapixel level method for one shotFace Swapping (or MegaFS for short). Firstly, MegaFS or-ganizes face representation hierarchically by the proposedHierarchical Representation Face Encoder (HieRFE) in an extended latent space to maintain more facial details, rather than compressed representation in previous face swapping methods. Secondly, a carefully designed Face TransferModule (FTM) is proposed to transfer the identity from a source image to the target by a non-linear trajectory without explicit feature disentanglement. Finally, the swapped faces can be synthesized by StyleGAN2 with the beneﬁts of its training stability and powerful generative capability. Each part of MegaFS can be trained separately so the require-∗Corresponding author ment of our model for GPU memory can be satisﬁed for megapixel face swapping. In summary, complete face repre-sentation, stable training, and limited memory usage are the three novel contributions to the success of our method. Ex-tensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MegaFS and the ﬁrst megapixel level face swapping database is re-leased for research on DeepFake detection and face image editing in the public domain.
