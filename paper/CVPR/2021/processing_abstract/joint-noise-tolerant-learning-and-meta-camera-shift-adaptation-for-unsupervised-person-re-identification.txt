This paper considers the problem of unsupervised person re-identiﬁcation (re-ID), which aims to learn discriminative models with unlabeled data. One popular method is to ob-tain pseudo-label by clustering and use them to optimize the model. Although this kind of approach has shown promis-ing accuracy, it is hampered by 1) noisy labels produced by clustering and 2) feature variations caused by camera shift.The former will lead to incorrect optimization and thus hin-ders the model accuracy. The latter will result in assign-ing the intra-class samples of different cameras to different pseudo-label, making the model sensitive to camera vari-In this paper, we propose a uniﬁed framework to ations. solve both problems. Concretely, we propose a Dynamic and Symmetric Cross-Entropy loss (DSCE) to deal with noisy samples and a camera-aware meta-learning algo-rithm (MetaCam) to adapt camera shift. DSCE can allevi-ate the negative effects of noisy samples and accommodate the change of clusters after each clustering step. MetaCam simulates cross-camera constraint by splitting the training data into meta-train and meta-test based on camera IDs.With the interacted gradient from meta-train and meta-test, the model is enforced to learn camera-invariant features.Extensive experiments on three re-ID benchmarks show the effectiveness and the complementary of the proposed DSCE and MetaCam. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both fully unsupervised re-ID and unsupervised domain adaptive re-ID.
