Absolute LearningThe majority of existing few-shot learning methods de-scribe image relations with binary labels. However, such binary relations are insufﬁcient to teach the network com-plicated real-world relations, due to the lack of decision smoothness. Furthermore, current few-shot learning mod-els capture only the similarity via relation labels, but they are not exposed to class concepts associated with objects, which is likely detrimental to the classiﬁcation performance due to underutilization of the available class labels. For instance, children learn the concept of tiger from a few of ac-tual examples as well as from comparisons of tiger to other animals. Thus, we hypothesize that both similarity and class concept learning must be occurring simultaneously. With these observations at hand, we study the fundamental prob-lem of simplistic class modeling in current few-shot learning methods. We rethink the relations between class concepts, and propose a novel Absolute-relative Learning paradigm to fully take advantage of label information to reﬁne the image an relation representations in both supervised and un-supervised scenarios. Our proposed paradigm improves the performance of several state-of-the-art models on publicly available datasets.
