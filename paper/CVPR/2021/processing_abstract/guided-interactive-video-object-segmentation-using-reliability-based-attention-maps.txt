We propose a novel guided interactive segmentation (GIS) algorithm for video objects to improve the segmen-tation accuracy and reduce the interaction time. First, we design the reliability-based attention module to an-alyze the reliability of multiple annotated frames. Sec-ond, we develop the intersection-aware propagation module to propagate segmentation results to neighboring frames.Third, we introduce the GIS mechanism for a user to se-lect unsatisfactory frames quickly with less effort. Exper-imental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides more accurate segmentation results at a faster speed than conventional algorithms.
