We present a novel method for efﬁcient acquisition of shape and spatially varying reﬂectance of 3D objects us-ing polarization cues. Unlike previous works that have ex-ploited polarization to estimate material or object appear-ance under certain constraints (known shape or multiview acquisition), we lift such restrictions by coupling polariza-tion imaging with deep learning to achieve high quality estimate of 3D object shape (surface normals and depth) and SVBRDF using single-view polarization imaging under frontal ﬂash illumination. In addition to acquired polariza-tion images, we provide our deep network with strong novel cues related to shape and reﬂectance, in the form of a nor-malized Stokes map and an estimate of diffuse color. We additionally describe modiﬁcations to network architecture and training loss which provide further qualitative improve-ments. We demonstrate our approach to achieve superior results compared to recent works employing deep learning in conjunction with ﬂash illumination.
