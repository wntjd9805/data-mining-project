clustering-based approaches [4, 6, 7].Learning image representations without human super-vision is an important and active research ﬁeld. Several recent approaches have successfully leveraged the idea of making such a representation invariant under different types of perturbations, especially via contrastive-based instance discrimination training. Although effective visual represen-tations should indeed exhibit such invariances, there are other important characteristics, such as encoding contextual reasoning skills, for which alternative reconstruction-based approaches might be better suited.With this in mind, we propose a teacher-student scheme to learn representations by training a convolutional net to reconstruct a bag-of-visual-words (BoW) representation of an image, given as input a perturbed version of that same image. Our strategy performs an online training of both the teacher network (whose role is to generate the BoW targets) and the student network (whose role is to learn represen-tations), along with an online update of the visual-words vocabulary (used for the BoW targets). This idea effectively enables fully online BoW-guided unsupervised learning. Ex-tensive experiments demonstrate the interest of our BoW-based strategy, which surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods (including contrastive-based ones) in several ap-plications. For instance, in downstream tasks such Pascal object detection, Pascal classiﬁcation and Places205 clas-siﬁcation, our method improves over all prior unsupervised approaches, thus establishing new state-of-the-art results that are also signiﬁcantly better even than those of super-vised pre-training.
