embedding spaceWe introduce a weakly supervised method for represen-tation learning based on aligning temporal sequences (e.g., videos) of the same process (e.g., human action). The main idea is to use the global temporal ordering of latent cor-respondences across sequence pairs as a supervisory sig-nal.In particular, we propose a loss based on scoring the optimal sequence alignment to train an embedding net-work. Our loss is based on a novel probabilistic path ﬁnd-ing view of dynamic time warping (DTW) that contains the following three key features: (i) the local path routing de-cisions are contrastive and differentiable, (ii) pairwise dis-tances are cast as probabilities that are contrastive as well, and (iii) our formulation naturally admits a global cycle-consistency loss that veriﬁes correspondences. For evalua-tion, we consider the tasks of ﬁne-grained action classiﬁca-tion, few shot learning, and video synchronization. We re-port signiﬁcant performance increases over previous meth-ods. In addition, we report two applications of our temporal alignment framework, namely 3D pose reconstruction andﬁne-grained audio/visual retrieval.
