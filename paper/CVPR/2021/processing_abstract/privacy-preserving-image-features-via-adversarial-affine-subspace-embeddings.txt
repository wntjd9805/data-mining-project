Many computer vision systems require users to upload im-age features to the cloud for processing and storage. These features can be exploited to recover sensitive information about the scene or subjects, e.g., by reconstructing the ap-pearance of the original image. To address this privacy concern, we propose a new privacy-preserving feature repre-sentation. The core idea of our work is to drop constraints from each feature descriptor by embedding it within an afﬁne subspace containing the original feature as well as adver-sarial feature samples. Feature matching on the privacy-preserving representation is enabled based on the notion of subspace-to-subspace distance. We experimentally demon-strate the effectiveness of our method and its high practical relevance for the applications of visual localization and mapping as well as face authentication. Compared to the original features, our approach makes it signiﬁcantly more difﬁcult for an adversary to recover private information.
