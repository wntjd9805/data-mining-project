Clustering-based methods [27, 46, 10] conduct training with the generated pseudo labels and cur-rently dominate this research direction. However, they still suffer from the issue of pseudo label noise. To tackle the challenge, we propose to properly estimate pseudo label similarities between consecutive training generations with clustering consensus and reﬁne pseudo labels with tem-porally propagated and ensembled pseudo labels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to leverage the spirit of temporal ensembling [25] to improve classi-ﬁcation with dynamically changing classes over genera-tions. The proposed pseudo label reﬁnery strategy is sim-ple yet effective and can be seamlessly integrated into ex-isting clustering-based unsupervised re-identiﬁcation meth-ods. With our proposed approach, state-of-the-art method[10] can be further boosted with up to 8.8% mAP improve-ments on the challenging MSMT17 [39] dataset.
