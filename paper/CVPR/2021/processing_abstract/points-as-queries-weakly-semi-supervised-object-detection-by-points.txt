We propose a novel point annotated setting for the weakly semi-supervised object detection task, in which the dataset comprises small fully annotated images and large weakly annotated images by points. It achieves a balance between tremendous annotation burden and detection per-formance. Based on this setting, we analyze existing de-tectors and ﬁnd that these detectors have difﬁculty in fully exploiting the power of the annotated points. To solve this, we introduce a new detector, Point DETR, which extendsDETR by adding a point encoder. Extensive experiments conducted on MS-COCO dataset in various data settings show the effectiveness of our method. In particular, when using 20% fully labeled data from COCO, our detector achieves a promising performance, 33.3 AP, which outper-forms a strong baseline (FCOS) by 2.0 AP, and we demon-strate the point annotations bring over 10 points in variousAR metrics.
