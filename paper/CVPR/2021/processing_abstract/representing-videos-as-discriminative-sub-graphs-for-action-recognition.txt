Human actions are typically of combinatorial structures or patterns, i.e., subjects, objects, plus spatio-temporal in-teractions in between. Discovering such structures is there-fore a rewarding way to reason about the dynamics of inter-actions and recognize the actions. In this paper, we intro-duce a new design of sub-graphs to represent and encode the discriminative patterns of each action in the videos.SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we present MUlti-scale Sub-graph LEarning (MUSLE) framework that novelly builds space-time graphs and clusters the graphs into compact sub-graphs on each scale with respect to the number of nodes. Technically,MUSLE produces 3D bounding boxes, i.e., tubelets, in each video clip, as graph nodes and takes dense connectivity as graph edges between tubelets. For each action cate-gory, we execute online clustering to decompose the graph into sub-graphs on each scale through learning GaussianMixture Layer and select the discriminative sub-graphs as action prototypes for recognition. Extensive experiments are conducted on both Something-Something V1 & V2 andKinetics-400 datasets, and superior results are reported when comparing to state-of-the-art methods. More remark-ably, our MUSLE achieves to-date the best reported accu-racy of 65.0% on Something-Something V2 validation set.
