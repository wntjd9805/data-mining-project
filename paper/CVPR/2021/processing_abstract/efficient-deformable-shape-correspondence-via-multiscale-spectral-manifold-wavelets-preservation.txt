The functional map framework has proven to be ex-tremely effective for representing dense correspondences between deformable shapes. A key step in this framework is to formulate suitable preservation constraints to encode the geometric information that must be preserved by the un-known map. For this issue, we construct novel and power-ful constraints to determine the functional map, where mul-tiscale spectral manifold wavelets are required to be pre-served at each scale correspondingly. Such constraints al-low us to extract signiﬁcantly more information than previ-ous methods, especially those based on descriptor preser-vation constraints, and strongly ensure the isometric prop-erty of the map. In addition, we also propose a remarkable efﬁcient iterative method to alternatively update the func-tional maps and pointwise maps. Moreover, when we use the tight wavelet frames in iterations, the computation of the functional maps boils down to a simple ﬁltering procedure with low-pass and various band-pass ﬁlters, which avoids time-consuming solving large systems of linear equations commonly presented in functional maps. We demonstrate on a wide variety of experiments with different datasets that our approach achieves signiﬁcant improvements both in the shape correspondence quality and the computing efﬁciency.
