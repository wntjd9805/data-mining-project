The dual-pixel (DP) hardware works by splitting each pixel in half and creating an image pair in a single snap-shot. Several works estimate depth/inverse depth by treat-ing the DP pair as a stereo pair. However, dual-pixel dis-parity only occurs in image regions with the defocus blur.The heavy defocus blur in DP pairs affects the performance of matching-based depth estimation approaches. Instead of removing the blur effect blindly, we study the formation of the DP pair which links the blur and the depth informa-tion. In this paper, we propose a mathematical DP model which can beneﬁt depth estimation by the blur. These ex-plorations motivate us to propose an end-to-end DDDNet (DP-based Depth and Deblur Network) to jointly estimate the depth and restore the image. Moreover, we deﬁne a re-blur loss, which reﬂects the relationship of the DP image formation process with depth information, to regularise our depth estimate in training. To meet the requirement of a large amount of data for learning, we propose the ﬁrst DP image simulator which allows us to create datasets with DP pairs from any existing RGBD dataset. As a side contri-bution, we collect a real dataset for further research. Ex-tensive experimental evaluation on both synthetic and real datasets shows that our approach achieves competitive per-formance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
