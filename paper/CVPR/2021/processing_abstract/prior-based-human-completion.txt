We study a very challenging task, human image com-pletion, which tries to recover the human body part with a reasonable human shape from the corrupted region. Since each human body part is unique, it is infeasible to restore the missing part by borrowing textures from other visible re-gions. Thus, we propose two types of learned priors to com-pensate for the damaged region. One is a structure prior, it uses a human parsing map to represent the human body structure. The other is a structure-texture correlation prior.It learns a structure and a texture memory bank, which en-codes the common body structures and texture patterns, re-spectively. With the aid of these memory banks, the model could utilize the visible pattern to query and fetch a sim-ilar structure and texture pattern to introduce additional reasonable structures and textures for the corrupted region.Besides, since multiple potential human shapes are under-lying the corrupted region, we propose multi-scale structure discriminators to further restore a plausible topological structure. Experiments on various large-scale benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

(a) Existing image inpainting methods [48] usually works well to recover these repeated regions, (b) while they might fail to recover the unique human body region. (c) We mainly focus on how to recover the corrupted unique human body in the image via borrowing structure and texture information of other images from the learned mem-ory. With the help of additional prior information, our proposed method could generate a more realistic and plausible image.
