High-quality high-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance (MR) images afford more detailed information for reliable diagnosis and quantitative image analyses. Deep convolu-tional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising abil-ity for MR image super-resolution (SR) given low-resolution (LR) MR images. The LR MR images usually share some vi-sual characteristics: repeating patterns, relatively simpler structures, and less informative background. Most previousCNN-based SR methods treat the spatial pixels (including the background) equally. They also fail to sense the entire space of the input, which is critical for high-quality MR im-age SR. To address those problems, we propose squeeze and excitation reasoning attention networks (SERAN) for accu-rate MR image SR. We propose to squeeze attention from global spatial information of the input and obtain global descriptors. Such global descriptors enhance the network’s ability to focus on more informative regions and structures in MR images. We further build relationship among those global descriptors and propose primitive relationship rea-soning attention. The global descriptors are further reﬁned with learned attention. To fully make use of the aggregated information, we adaptively recalibrate feature responses with learned adaptive attention vectors. These attention vectors select a subset of global descriptors to complement each spatial location for accurate details and texture recon-struction. We propose squeeze and excitation attention with residual scaling, which not only stabilizes the training but also makes it ﬂexible to other basic networks. Extensive ex-periments show the effectiveness of our proposed SERAN, which clearly surpasses state-of-the-art methods on bench-marks quantitatively and visually.
