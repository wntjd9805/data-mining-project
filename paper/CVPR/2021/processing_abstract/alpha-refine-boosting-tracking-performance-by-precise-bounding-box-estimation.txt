Visual object tracking aims to precisely estimate the bounding box for the given target, which is a challeng-ing problem due to factors such as deformation and occlu-sion. Many recent trackers adopt the multiple-stage strategy to improve bounding box estimation. These methods ﬁrst coarsely locate the target and then reﬁne the initial predic-tion in the following stages. However, existing approaches still suffer from limited precision, and the coupling of dif-ferent stages severely restricts the method’s transferability.This work proposes a novel, ﬂexible, and accurate reﬁne-ment module called Alpha-Reﬁne (AR), which can signiﬁ-cantly improve the base trackers’ box estimation quality. By exploring a series of design options, we conclude that the key to successful reﬁnement is extracting and maintaining detailed spatial information as much as possible. Following this principle, Alpha-Reﬁne adopts a pixel-wise correlation, a corner prediction head, and an auxiliary mask head as the core components. Comprehensive experiments on Track-ingNet, LaSOT, GOT-10K, and VOT2020 benchmarks with multiple base trackers show that our approach signiﬁcantly improves the base tracker’s performance with little extra latency. The proposed Alpha-Reﬁne method leads to a se-ries of strengthened trackers, among which the ARSiamRPN (AR strengthened SiamRPNpp) and the ARDiMP50 (AR strengthened DiMP50) achieve good efﬁciency-precision trade-off, while the ARDiMPsuper (AR strengthened DiMP-super) achieves very competitive performance at a real-time speed.
