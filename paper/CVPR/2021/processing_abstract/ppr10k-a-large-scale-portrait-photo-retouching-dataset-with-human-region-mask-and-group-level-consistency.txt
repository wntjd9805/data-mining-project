Different from general photo retouching tasks, portrait photo retouching (PPR), which aims to enhance the visual quality of a collection of ﬂat-looking portrait photos, has its special and practical requirements such as human-region priority (HRP) and group-level consistency (GLC). HRP requires that more attention should be paid to human re-gions, while GLC requires that a group of portrait photos should be retouched to a consistent tone. Models trained on existing general photo retouching datasets, however, can hardly meet these requirements of PPR. To facilitate the re-search on this high-frequency task, we construct a large-scale PPR dataset, namely PPR10K, which is the ﬁrst of its kind to our best knowledge. PPR10K contains 1, 681 groups and 11, 161 high-quality raw portrait photos in to-tal. High-resolution segmentation masks of human regions are provided. Each raw photo is retouched by three experts, while they elaborately adjust each group of photos to have consistent tones. We deﬁne a set of objective measures to evaluate the performance of PPR and propose strategies to learn PPR models with good HRP and GLC performance.The constructed PPR10K dataset provides a good bench-mark for studying automatic PPR methods, and experiments demonstrate that the proposed learning strategies are effec-tive to improve the retouching performance.
