Neural Networks require large amounts of memory and compute to process high resolution images, even when only a small part of the image is actually informative for the task at hand. We propose a method based on a differentiableTop-K operator to select the most relevant parts of the input to efﬁciently process high resolution images. Our method may be interfaced with any downstream neural network, is able to aggregate information from different patches in aﬂexible way, and allows the whole model to be trained end-to-end using backpropagation. We show results for traf-ﬁc sign recognition, inter-patch relationship reasoning, andﬁne-grained recognition without using object/part bound-ing box annotations during training.
