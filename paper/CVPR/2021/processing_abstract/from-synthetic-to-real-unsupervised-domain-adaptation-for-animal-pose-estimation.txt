Animal pose estimation is an important ﬁeld that has re-ceived increasing attention in the recent years. The main challenge for this task is the lack of labeled data. Exist-ing works circumvent this problem with pseudo labels gen-erated from data of other easily accessible domains such as synthetic data. However, these pseudo labels are noisy even with consistency check or conﬁdence-based ﬁltering due to the domain shift in the data. To solve this prob-lem, we design a multi-scale domain adaptation module (MDAM) to reduce the domain gap between the synthetic and real data. We further introduce an online coarse-to-ﬁne pseudo label updating strategy. Speciﬁcally, we pro-pose a self-distillation module in an inner coarse-update loop and a mean-teacher in an outer ﬁne-update loop to generate new pseudo labels that gradually replace the old ones. Consequently, our model is able to learn from the old pseudo labels at the early stage, and gradually switch to the new pseudo labels to prevent overﬁtting in the later stage. We evaluate our approach on the TigDog and VisDA 2019 datasets, where we outperform existing approaches by a large margin. We also demonstrate the generalization ability of our model by testing extensively on both unseen domains and unseen animal categories. Our code is avail-able at the project website1.
