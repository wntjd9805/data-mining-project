Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods for person re-identiﬁcation (re-ID) aim at transferring re-ID knowledge from labeled source data to unlabeled target data. Although achieving great success, most of them only use limited data from a single-source domain for model pre-training, making the rich labeled data insufﬁciently ex-ploited. To make full use of the valuable labeled data, we introduce the multi-source concept into UDA person re-IDﬁeld, where multiple source datasets are used during train-ing. However, because of domain gaps, simply combining different datasets only brings limited improvement. In this paper, we try to address this problem from two perspectives, i.e. domain-speciﬁc view and domain-fusion view. Two con-structive modules are proposed, and they are compatible with each other. First, a rectiﬁcation domain-speciﬁc batch normalization (RDSBN) module is explored to simultane-ously reduce domain-speciﬁc characteristics and increase the distinctiveness of person features. Second, a graph con-volutional network (GCN) based multi-domain information fusion (MDIF) module is developed, which minimizes do-main distances by fusing features of different domains. The proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art UDA person re-ID methods by a large margin, and even achieves com-parable performance to the supervised approaches with-out any post-processing techniques.
