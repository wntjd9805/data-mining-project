We explore how a general AI algorithm can be used for 3D scene understanding to reduce the need for train-ing data. More exactly, we propose a modiﬁcation of the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to retrieve objects and room layouts from noisy RGB-D scans. While MCTS was developed as a game-playing algorithm, we show it can also be used for complex perception problems. Our adapted MCTS algorithm has few easy-to-tune hyperparameters and can optimise general losses. We use it to optimise the posterior prob-ability of objects and room layout hypotheses given theRGB-D data. This results in an analysis-by-synthesis approach that explores the solution space by rendering the current solution and comparing it to the RGB-D observations. To perform this exploration even more efﬁciently, we propose simple changes to the standardMCTS’ tree construction and exploration policy. We demonstrate our approach on the ScanNet dataset. Our method often retrieves conﬁgurations that are better than some manual annotations, especially on layouts.∗The ﬁrst two authors contributed equally. 13804
