ClassSR-FSRCNN: 36.97dB / 256M (FSRCNN: 36.81dB / 468M)We aim at accelerating super-resolution (SR) networks on large images (2K-8K). The large images are usually de-composed into small sub-images in practical usages. Based on this processing, we found that different image regions have different restoration difﬁculties and can be processedIntuitively, smooth by networks with different capacities. areas are easier to super-solve than complex textures. To utilize this property, we can adopt appropriate SR networks to process different sub-images after the decomposition. On this basis, we propose a new solution pipeline – ClassSR that combines classiﬁcation and SR in a uniﬁed framework.In particular, it ﬁrst uses a Class-Module to classify the sub-images into different classes according to restoration difﬁ-culties, then applies an SR-Module to perform SR for differ-ent classes. The Class-Module is a conventional classiﬁca-tion network, while the SR-Module is a network container that consists of the to-be-accelerated SR network and its simpliﬁed versions. We further introduce a new classiﬁca-tion method with two losses – Class-Loss and Average-Loss to produce the classiﬁcation results. After joint training, a majority of sub-images will pass through smaller networks, thus the computational cost can be signiﬁcantly reduced.Experiments show that our ClassSR can help most existing methods (e.g., FSRCNN, CARN, SRResNet, RCAN) save up to 50% FLOPs on DIV8K datasets. This general framework can also be applied in other low-level vision tasks.
