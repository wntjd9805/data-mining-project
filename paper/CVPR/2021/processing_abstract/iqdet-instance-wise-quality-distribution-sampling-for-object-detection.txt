StaticDynamicWe propose a dense object detector with an instance-wise sampling strategy, named IQDet. Instead of using hu-man prior sampling strategies, we Ô¨Årst extract the regional feature of each ground-truth to estimate the instance-wise quality distribution. According to a mixture model in spa-tial dimensions, the distribution is more noise-robust and adapted to the semantic pattern of each instance. Based on the distribution, we propose a quality sampling strategy, which automatically selects training samples in a proba-bilistic manner and trains with more high-quality samples.Extensive experiments on MS COCO show that our method steadily improves baseline by nearly 2.4 AP without bells and whistles. Moreover, our best model achieves 51.6 AP, outperforming all existing state-of-the-art one-stage detec-tors and it is completely cost-free in inference time.
