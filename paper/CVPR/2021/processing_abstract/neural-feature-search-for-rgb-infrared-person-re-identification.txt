(a)Feature SpaceManually DesignSelected FeaturesRGB-Infrared person re-identiﬁcation (RGB-IR ReID) is a challenging cross-modality retrieval problem, which aims at matching the person-of-interest over visible and infrared camera views. Most existing works achieve performance gains through manually-designed feature selection mod-ules, which often require signiﬁcant domain knowledge and rich experience. In this paper, we study a general paradigm, termed Neural Feature Search (NFS), to automate the pro-cess of feature selection. Speciﬁcally, NFS combines a dual-level feature search space and a differentiable search strat-egy to jointly select identity-related cues in coarse-grained channels and ﬁne-grained spatial pixels. This combination allows NFS to adaptively ﬁlter background noises and con-centrate on informative parts of human bodies in a data-driven manner. Moreover, a cross-modality contrastive op-timization scheme further guides NFS to search features that can minimize modality discrepancy whilst maximiz-ing inter-class distance. Extensive experiments on main-stream benchmarks demonstrate that our method outper-forms state-of-the-arts, especially achieving better perfor-mance on the RegDB dataset with signiﬁcant improvement of 11.20% and 8.64% in Rank-1 and mAP, respectively.
