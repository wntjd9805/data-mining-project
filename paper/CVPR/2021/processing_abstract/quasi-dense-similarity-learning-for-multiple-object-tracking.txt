Similarity learning has been recognized as a crucial step for object tracking. However, existing multiple object track-ing methods only use sparse ground truth matching as the training objective, while ignoring the majority of the infor-mative regions on the images. In this paper, we presentQuasi-Dense Similarity Learning, which densely samples hundreds of region proposals on a pair of images for con-trastive learning. We can directly combine this similarity learning with existing detection methods to build Quasi-Dense Tracking (QDTrack) without turning to displacement regression or motion priors. We also ﬁnd that the resulting distinctive feature space admits a simple nearest neighbor search at the inference time. Despite its simplicity, QD-Track outperforms all existing methods on MOT, BDD100K,Waymo, and TAO tracking benchmarks. It achieves 68.7MOTA at 20.3 FPS on MOT17 without using external train-ing data. Compared to methods with similar detectors, it boosts almost 10 points of MOTA and signiﬁcantly de-creases the number of ID switches on BDD100K and Waymo datasets.
