chair tableMany existing approaches for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation are fully supervised. These fully supervised approaches heavily rely on large amounts of labeled train-ing data that are difﬁcult to obtain and cannot segment new classes after training. To mitigate these limitations, we pro-pose a novel attention-aware multi-prototype transductive few-shot point cloud semantic segmentation method to seg-ment new classes given a few labeled examples. Speciﬁcally, each class is represented by multiple prototypes to model the complex data distribution of labeled points. Subsequently, we employ a transductive label propagation method to ex-ploit the afﬁnities between labeled multi-prototypes and unla-beled points, and among the unlabeled points. Furthermore, we design an attention-aware multi-level feature learning network to learn the discriminative features that capture the geometric dependencies and semantic correlations be-tween points. Our proposed method shows signiﬁcant and consistent improvements compared to baselines in differ-ent few-shot point cloud semantic segmentation settings (i.e. 2/3-way 1/5-shot) on two benchmark datasets.
