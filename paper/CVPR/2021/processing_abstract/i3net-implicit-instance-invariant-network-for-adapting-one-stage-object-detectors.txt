Recent works on two-stage cross-domain detection have widely explored the local feature patterns to achieve more accurate adaptation results. These methods heavily rely on the region proposal mechanisms and ROI-based instance-level features to design ﬁne-grained feature alignment modules with respect to the foreground objects. How-ever, for one-stage detectors, it is hard or even impossi-ble to obtain explicit instance-level features in the detec-tion pipelines. Motivated by this, we propose an ImplicitInstance-Invariant Network (I3Net), which is tailored for adapting one-stage detectors and implicitly learns instance-invariant features via exploiting the natural characteristics of deep features in different layers. Speciﬁcally, we facil-itate the adaptation from three aspects: (1) Dynamic andClass-Balanced Reweighting (DCBR) strategy, which con-siders the coexistence of intra-domain and intra-class vari-ations to assign larger weights to those sample-scarce cate-gories and easy-to-adapt samples; (2) Category-aware Ob-ject Pattern Matching (COPM) module, which boosts the cross-domain foreground objects matching guided by the categorical information and suppresses the uninformative background features; (3) Regularized Joint Category Align-ment (RJCA) module, which jointly enforces the category alignment at different domain-speciﬁc layers with a consis-tency regularization. Experiments reveal that I3Net exceeds the state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.
