In this paper, we propose a Monocular 3D Single Stage object Detector (M3DSSD) with feature alignment and asymmetric non-local attention. Current anchor-based monocular 3D object detection methods suffer from fea-ture mismatching. To overcome this, we propose a two-step feature alignment approach. In the ﬁrst step, the shape alignment is performed to enable the receptive ﬁeld of the feature map to focus on the pre-deﬁned anchors with highIn the second step, the center align-conﬁdence scores. ment is used to align the features at 2D/3D centers. Fur-ther, it is often difﬁcult to learn global information and capture long-range relationships, which are important for the depth prediction of objects. Therefore, we propose a novel asymmetric non-local attention block with multi-scale sampling to extract depth-wise features. The pro-posed M3DSSD achieves signiﬁcantly better performance than the monocular 3D object detection methods on theKITTI dataset, in both 3D object detection and bird’s eye view tasks.
