In this paper, we aim to synthesize cell microscopy images under different molecular interventions, motivated by practi-cal applications to drug development. Building on the recent success of graph neural networks for learning molecular embeddings and ﬂow-based models for image generation, we propose Mol2Image: a ﬂow-based generative model for molecule to cell image synthesis. To generate cell features at different resolutions and scale to high-resolution images, we develop a novel multi-scale ﬂow architecture based on a Haar wavelet image pyramid. To maximize the mutual information between the generated images and the molec-ular interventions, we devise a training strategy based on contrastive learning. To evaluate our model, we propose a new set of metrics for biological image generation that are robust, interpretable, and relevant to practitioners. We show quantitatively that our method learns a meaningful embedding of the molecular intervention, which is translated into an image representation reﬂecting the biological effects of the intervention.
