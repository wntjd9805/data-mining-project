With the large multimedia content online, deep hashing has become a popular method for efﬁcient image retrieval and storage. However, by inheriting the algorithmic back-end from softmax classiﬁcation, these techniques are vul-nerable to the well-known adversarial examples as well.The massive collection of online images into the database also opens up new attack vectors. Attackers can embed ad-versarial images into the database and target speciﬁc cat-egories to be retrieved by user queries. In this paper, we start from an adversarial standpoint to explore and enhance the capacity of targeted black-box transferability attack for deep hashing. We motivate this work by a series of empiri-cal studies to see the unique challenges in image retrieval.We study the relations between adversarial subspace and black-box transferability via utilizing random noise as a proxy. Then we develop a new attack that is simultane-ously adversarial and robust to noise to enhance transfer-ability. Our experimental results demonstrate about 1.2-3× improvements of black-box transferability compared with the state-of-the-art mechanisms.
