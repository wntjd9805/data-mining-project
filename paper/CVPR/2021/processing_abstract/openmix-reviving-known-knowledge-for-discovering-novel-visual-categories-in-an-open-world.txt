In this paper, we tackle the problem of discovering new classes in unlabeled visual data given labeled data from disjoint classes. Existing methods typically ﬁrst pre-train a model with labeled data, and then identify new classes in unlabeled data via unsupervised clustering. However, the labeled data that provide essential knowledge are often un-derexplored in the second step. The challenge is that the labeled and unlabeled examples are from non-overlapping classes, which makes it difﬁcult to build a learning rela-tionship between them. In this work, we introduce Open-Mix to mix the unlabeled examples from an open set and the labeled examples from known classes, where their non-overlapping labels and pseudo-labels are simultaneously mixed into a joint label distribution. OpenMix dynamically compounds examples in two ways. First, we produce mixed training images by incorporating labeled examples with un-labeled examples. With the beneﬁt of unique prior knowl-edge in novel class discovery, the generated pseudo-labels will be more credible than the original unlabeled predic-tions. As a result, OpenMix helps preventing the model from overﬁtting on unlabeled samples that may be assigned with wrong pseudo-labels. Second, the ﬁrst way encour-ages the unlabeled examples with high class-probabilities to have considerable accuracy. We introduce these exam-ples as reliable anchors and further integrate them with un-labeled samples. This enables us to generate more combi-nations in unlabeled examples and exploit ﬁner object re-lations among the new classes. Experiments on three clas-siﬁcation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the pro-posed OpenMix, which is superior to state-of-the-art meth-ods in novel class discovery.
