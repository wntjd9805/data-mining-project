Modern online multiple object tracking (MOT) methods usually focus on two directions to improve tracking per-formance. One is to predict new positions in an incoming frame based on tracking information from previous frames, and the other is to enhance data association by generat-ing more discriminative identity embeddings. Some works combined both directions within one framework but han-dled them as two individual tasks, thus gaining little mutual beneﬁts. In this paper, we propose a novel uniﬁed model with synergy between position prediction and embedding association. The two tasks are linked by temporal-aware target attention and distractor attention, as well as identity-aware memory aggregation model. Speciﬁcally, the atten-tion modules can make the prediction focus more on tar-gets and less on distractors, therefore more reliable embed-dings can be extracted accordingly for association. On the other hand, such reliable embeddings can boost identity-awareness through memory aggregation, hence strengthen attention modules and suppress drifts. In this way, the syn-ergy between position prediction and embedding associa-tion is achieved, which leads to strong robustness to occlu-sions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model over a wide range of existing meth-ods on MOTChallenge benchmarks.
