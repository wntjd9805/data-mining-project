The objective of co-saliency detection is to segment the co-occurring salient objects in a group of images. To ad-dress this task, we introduce a new deep network architec-ture via semantic-aware contrast Gromov-Wasserstein dis-tance (DeepACG). We ﬁrst adopt the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance to build dense 4D correlation volumes for all pairs of image pixels within the image group. These dense correlation volumes enable the network to accurately dis-cover the structured pair-wise pixel similarities among the common salient objects. Second, we develop a semantic-aware co-attention module (SCAM) to enhance the fore-ground co-saliency through predicted categorical informa-tion. Speciﬁcally, SCAM recognizes the semantic class of the foreground co-objects, and this information is then mod-ulated to the deep representations to localize the related pixels. Third, we design a contrast edge-enhanced module (EEM) to capture richer contexts and preserve ﬁne-grained spatial information. We validate the effectiveness of our model using three largest and most challenging benchmark datasets (Cosal2015, CoCA, and CoSOD3k). Extensive ex-periments have demonstrated the substantial practical mer-it of each module. Compared with the existing works, Deep-ACG shows signiﬁcant improvements and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
