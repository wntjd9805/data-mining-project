Detecting oriented and densely packed objects remains challenging for spatial feature aliasing caused by the in-tersection of reception ﬁelds between objects. In this pa-per, we propose a convex-hull feature adaptation (CFA) approach for conﬁguring convolutional features in accor-dance with oriented and densely packed object layouts.CFA is rooted in convex-hull feature representation, which deﬁnes a set of dynamically predicted feature points guided by the convex intersection over union (CIoU) to bound the extent of objects. CFA pursues optimal feature as-signment by constructing convex-hull sets and dynamically splitting positive or negative convex-hulls. By simulta-neously considering overlapping convex-hulls and objects and penalizing convex-hulls shared by multiple objects,CFA alleviates spatial feature aliasing towards optimal fea-ture adaptation. Experiments on DOTA and SKU110K-R datasets show that CFA signiﬁcantly outperforms the baseline approach, achieving new state-of-the-art detec-tion performance.

(Upper) When using box represen-tation, oriented and densely packed objects cause feature aliasing for the intersection of reception ﬁelds between objects. (Lower)With convex-hull representation, our CFA approach adapts fea-tures located on regular convolutional maps to oriented and densely packed objects, solving the feature aliasing issue in a sys-tematic way.
