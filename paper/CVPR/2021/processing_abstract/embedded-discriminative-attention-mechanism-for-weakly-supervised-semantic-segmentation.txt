Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level annotation uses class activation maps from the classiﬁer as pseudo-labels for semantic segmentation.However, such activation maps usually highlight the local discriminative regions rather than the whole object, which deviates from the requirement of semantic segmentation. To explore more comprehensive class-speciﬁc activation maps, we propose an Embedded Discriminative Attention Mecha-nism (EDAM) by integrating the activation map generation into the classiﬁcation network directly for WSSS. Speciﬁ-cally, a Discriminative Activation (DA) layer is designed to explicitly produce a series of normalized class-speciﬁc masks, which are then used to generate class-speciﬁc pixel-level pseudo-labels demanded in segmentation. For learn-ing the pseudo-labels, the masks are multiplied with the fea-ture maps after the backbone to generate the discriminative activation maps, each of which encodes the speciﬁc infor-mation of the corresponding category in the input images.Given such class-speciﬁc activation maps, a CollaborativeMulti-Attention (CMA) module is proposed to extract the collaborative information of each given category from im-ages in a batch. In inference, we directly use the activation masks from the DA layer as pseudo-labels for segmenta-tion. Based on the generated pseudo-labels, we achieve the mIoU of 70.60% on PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation test-set, which is the new state-of-the-art, to our best knowledge.Code and pre-trained models are available online soon.
