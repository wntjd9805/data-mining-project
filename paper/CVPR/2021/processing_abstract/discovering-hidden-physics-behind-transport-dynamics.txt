Transport processes are ubiquitous. They are, for exam-ple, at the heart of optical ﬂow approaches; or of perfu-sion imaging, where blood transport is assessed, most com-monly by injecting a tracer. An advection-diffusion equa-tion is widely used to describe these transport phenomena.Our goal is estimating the underlying physics of advection-diffusion equations, expressed as velocity and diffusion ten-sor ﬁelds. We propose a learning framework (YETI) build-ing on an auto-encoder structure between 2D and 3D im-age time-series, which incorporates the advection-diffusion model. To help with identiﬁability, we develop an advection-diffusion simulator which allows pre-training of our model by supervised learning using the velocity and diffusion ten-sor ﬁelds.Instead of directly learning these velocity and diffusion tensor ﬁelds, we introduce representations that assure incompressible ﬂow and symmetric positive semi-deﬁnite diffusion ﬁelds and demonstrate the additional ben-eﬁts of these representations on improving estimation ac-curacy. We further use transfer learning to apply YETI on a public brain magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion dataset of stroke patients and show its ability to successfully dis-tinguish stroke lesions from normal brain regions via the estimated velocity and diffusion tensor ﬁelds.
