In this paper, we diagnose deep neural networks for 3D point cloud processing to explore utilities of different intermediate-layer network architectures. We propose a number of hypotheses on the effects of speciﬁc intermediate-layer network architectures on the representation capacity of DNNs. In order to prove the hypotheses, we design ﬁve metrics to diagnose various types of DNNs from the follow-ing perspectives, information discarding, information con-centration, rotation robustness, adversarial robustness, and neighborhood inconsistency. We conduct comparative stud-ies based on such metrics to verify the hypotheses. We fur-ther use the veriﬁed hypotheses to revise intermediate-layer architectures of existing DNNs and improve their utilities.Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.The code will be released when this paper is accepted.
