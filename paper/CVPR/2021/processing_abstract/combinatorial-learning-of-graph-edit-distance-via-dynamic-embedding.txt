Graph Edit Distance (GED) is a popular similarity mea-surement for pairwise graphs and it also refers to the re-covery of the edit path from the source graph to the target graph. Traditional A* algorithm suffers scalability issues due to its exhaustive nature, whose search heuristics heavily rely on human prior knowledge. This paper presents a hy-brid approach by combing the interpretability of traditional search-based techniques for producing the edit path, as well as the efﬁciency and adaptivity of deep embedding models to achieve a cost-effective GED solver. Inspired by dynamic programming, node-level embedding is designated in a dy-namic reuse fashion and suboptimal branches are encour-aged to be pruned. To this end, our method can be read-ily integrated into A* procedure in a dynamic fashion, as well as signiﬁcantly reduce the computational burden with a learned heuristic. Experimental results on different graph datasets show that our approach can remarkably ease the search process of A* without sacriﬁcing much accuracy. To our best knowledge, this work is also the ﬁrst deep learning-based GED method for recovering the edit path.
