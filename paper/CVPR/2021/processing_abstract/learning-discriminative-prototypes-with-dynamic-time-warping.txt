Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is widely used for tem-poral data processing. However, existing methods can nei-ther learn the discriminative prototypes of different classes nor exploit such prototypes for further analysis. We proposeDiscriminative Prototype DTW (DP-DTW), a novel method to learn class-speciﬁc discriminative prototypes for tem-poral recognition tasks. DP-DTW shows superior perfor-mance compared to conventional DTWs on time series clas-siﬁcation benchmarks1. Combined with end-to-end deep learning, DP-DTW can handle challenging weakly super-vised action segmentation problems and achieves state of the art results on standard benchmarks. Moreover, detailed reasoning on the input video is enabled by the learned ac-tion prototypes. Speciﬁcally, an action-based video sum-marization can be obtained by aligning the input sequence with action prototypes.
