Softmax lossSCLFace forgery detection is raising ever-increasing interest in computer vision since facial manipulation technologies cause serious worries. Though recent works have reached sound achievements, there are still unignorable problems: a) learned features supervised by softmax loss are separa-ble but not discriminative enough, since softmax loss does not explicitly encourage intra-class compactness and inter-class separability; and b) ﬁxed ﬁlter banks and hand-crafted features are insufﬁcient to capture forgery patterns of fre-quency from diverse inputs. To compensate for such limita-tions, a novel frequency-aware discriminative feature learn-ing framework is proposed in this paper. Speciﬁcally, we de-sign a novel single-center loss (SCL) that only compresses intra-class variations of natural faces while boosting inter-class differences in the embedding space. In such a case, the network can learn more discriminative features with less optimization difﬁculty. Besides, an adaptive frequency feature generation module is developed to mine frequency clues in a completely data-driven fashion. With the above two modules, the whole framework can learn more discrim-inative features in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experi-ments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework on three versions of the FF++ dataset.
