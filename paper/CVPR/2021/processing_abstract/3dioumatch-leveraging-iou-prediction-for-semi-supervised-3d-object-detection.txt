3D object detection is an important yet demanding task that heavily relies on difﬁcult to obtain 3D annotations.To reduce the required amount of supervision, we propose 3DIoUMatch, a novel semi-supervised method for 3D ob-ject detection applicable to both indoor and outdoor scenes.We leverage a teacher-student mutual learning framework to propagate information from the labeled to the unlabeled train set in the form of pseudo-labels. However, due to the high task complexity, we observe that the pseudo-labels suf-fer from signiﬁcant noise and are thus not directly usable.To that end, we introduce a conﬁdence-based ﬁltering mech-anism, inspired by FixMatch. We set conﬁdence thresholds based upon the predicted objectness and class probability toﬁlter low-quality pseudo-labels. While effective, we observe that these two measures do not sufﬁciently capture localiza-tion quality. We therefore propose to use the estimated 3DIoU as a localization metric and set category-aware self-adjusted thresholds to ﬁlter poorly localized proposals. We adopt VoteNet as our backbone detector on indoor datasets while we use PV-RCNN on the autonomous driving dataset,KITTI. Our method consistently improves state-of-the-art methods on both ScanNet and SUN-RGBD benchmarks by signiﬁcant margins under all label ratios (including fully la-beled setting). For example, when training using only 10% labeled data on ScanNet, 3DIoUMatch achieves 7.7 abso-lute improvement on mAP@0.25 and 8.5 absolute improve-ment on mAP@0.5 upon the prior art. On KITTI, we are the ﬁrst to demonstrate semi-supervised 3D object detection and our method surpasses a fully supervised baseline from 1.8% to 7.6% under different label ratio and categories.
