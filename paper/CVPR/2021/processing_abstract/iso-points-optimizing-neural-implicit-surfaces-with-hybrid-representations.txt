Neural implicit functions have emerged as a powerful representation for surfaces in 3D. Such a function can en-code a high quality surface with intricate details into the parameters of a deep neural network. However, optimiz-ing for the parameters for accurate and robust reconstruc-tions remains a challenge, especially when the input data is noisy or incomplete.In this work, we develop a hy-brid neural surface representation that allows us to impose geometry-aware sampling and regularization, which signif-icantly improves the ﬁdelity of reconstructions. We propose to use iso-points as an explicit representation for a neural implicit function. These points are computed and updated on-the-ﬂy during training to capture important geometric features and impose geometric constraints on the optimiza-tion. We demonstrate that our method can be adopted to im-prove state-of-the-art techniques for reconstructing neural implicit surfaces from multi-view images or point clouds.Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that, com-pared with existing sampling and optimization methods, our approach allows faster convergence, better generalization, and accurate recovery of details and topology.
