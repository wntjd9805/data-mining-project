#9#473#491Despite the great success of Siamese-based trackers, their performance under complicated scenarios is still not satisfying, especially when there are distractors. To this end, we propose a novel Siamese relation network, which i.e. Relation Detector introduces two efﬁcient modules, (RD) and Reﬁnement Module (RM). RD performs in a meta-learning way to obtain a learning ability to ﬁlter the dis-tractors from the background while RM aims to effectively integrate the proposed RD into the Siamese framework to generate accurate tracking result. Moreover, to further im-prove the discriminability and robustness of the tracker, we introduce a contrastive training strategy that attempts not only to learn matching the same target but also to learn how to distinguish the different objects. Therefore, our tracker can achieve accurate tracking results when fac-ing background clutters, fast motion, and occlusion. Ex-perimental results on ﬁve popular benchmarks, includingVOT2018, VOT2019, OTB100, LaSOT, and UAV123, show that the proposed method is effective and can achieve state-of-the-art results. The code will be available at https://github.com/hqucv/siamrn#245#269#290#280#316#378Ground-truthOursDiMPSiamBANFigure 1. Tracking Result of our Siamese relation network with two state-of-the-art trackers in VOT2018 [22]. Beneﬁting from our Relation Detector and Reﬁnement Module, when facing sim-ilar distractors, appearance change and complex background, our tracker is more robust to these challenges and gets more accurate results. Figure 4 further shows the ability to ﬁltering distractors from the target region.
