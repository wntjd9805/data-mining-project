Despite the recent success of point cloud processing with geometric deep learning, it remains arduous to capture the complex topologies of point cloud data with a learning model. Given a point cloud dataset con-taining objects with various genera, or scenes with multiple objects, we propose an autoencoder, TearingNet, which tack-les the challenging task of representing the point clouds us-ing a ﬁxed-length descriptor. Unlike existing works directly deforming predeﬁned primitives of genus zero (e.g., a 2D square patch) to an object-level point cloud, our TearingNet is characterized by a proposed Tearing network module and a Folding network module interacting with each other itera-tively. Particularly, the Tearing network module learns the point cloud topology explicitly. By breaking the edges of a primitive graph, it tears the graph into patches or with holes to emulate the topology of a target point cloud, leading to faithful reconstructions. Experimentation shows the superi-ority of our proposal in terms of reconstructing point clouds as well as generating more topology-friendly representations than benchmarks.
