We introduce a new dataset for the emotional artiﬁcial intelligence research: identity-free video dataset for Micro-Gesture Understanding and Emotion analysis (iMiGUE).Different from existing public datasets, iMiGUE focuses on nonverbal body gestures without using any identity infor-mation, while the predominant researches of emotion anal-ysis concern sensitive biometric data, like face and speech.Most importantly, iMiGUE focuses on micro-gestures, i.e., unintentional behaviors driven by inner feelings, which are different from ordinary scope of gestures from other gesture datasets which are mostly intentionally performed for illus-trative purposes. Furthermore, iMiGUE is designed to eval-uate the ability of models to analyze the emotional states by integrating information of recognized micro-gesture, rather than just recognizing prototypes in the sequences separate-ly (or isolatedly). This is because the real need for emo-tion AI is to understand the emotional states behind ges-tures in a holistic way. Moreover, to counter for the chal-lenge of imbalanced sample distribution of this dataset, an unsupervised learning method is proposed to capture laten-t representations from the micro-gesture sequences them-selves. We systematically investigate representative meth-ods on this dataset, and comprehensive experimental result-s reveal several interesting insights from the iMiGUE, e.g., micro-gesture-based analysis can promote emotion under-standing. We conﬁrm that the new iMiGUE dataset could advance studies of micro-gesture and emotion AI.
