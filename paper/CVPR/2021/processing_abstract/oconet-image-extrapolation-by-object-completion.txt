Existing methods strug-gle to extrapolate images with salient objects in the fore-ground or are limited to very speciﬁc objects such as hu-mans, but tend to work well on indoor/outdoor scenes. We introduce OCONet (Object COmpletion Networks) to extrap-olate foreground objects, with an object completion network conditioned on its class. OCONet uses an encoder-decoder architecture trained with adversarial loss to predict the ob-ject’s texture as well as its extent, represented as a predicted signed-distance ﬁeld. An independent step extends the back-ground, and the object is composited on top using the pre-dicted mask. Both qualitative and quantitative results show that we improve on state-of-the-art image extrapolation re-sults for challenging examples.
