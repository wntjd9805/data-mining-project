Temporal context is key to the recognition of expressions of emotion. Existing methods, that rely on recurrent or self-attention models to enforce temporal consistency, work on the feature level, ignoring the task-speciﬁc temporal depen-dencies, and fail to model context uncertainty. To alleviate these issues, we build upon the framework of Neural Pro-cesses to propose a method for apparent emotion recog-nition with three key novel components: (a) probabilis-tic contextual representation with a global latent variable model; (b) temporal context modelling using task-speciﬁc predictions in addition to features; and (c) smart tempo-ral context selection. We validate our approach on four databases, two for Valence and Arousal estimation (SEWA and AffWild2), and two for Action Unit intensity estimation (DISFA and BP4D). Results show a consistent improvement over a series of strong baselines as well as over state-of-the-art methods.
