Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) aims to recog-nize objects from both seen and unseen classes, when only the labeled examples from seen classes are provided. Re-cent feature generation methods learn a generative model that can synthesize the missing visual features of unseen classes to mitigate the data-imbalance problem in GZSL.However, the original visual feature space is suboptimal forGZSL classiﬁcation since it lacks discriminative informa-tion. To tackle this issue, we propose to integrate the gen-eration model with the embedding model, yielding a hybridGZSL framework. The hybrid GZSL approach maps both the real and the synthetic samples produced by the genera-tion model into an embedding space, where we perform theﬁnal GZSL classiﬁcation. Speciﬁcally, we propose a con-trastive embedding (CE) for our hybrid GZSL framework.The proposed contrastive embedding can leverage not only the class-wise supervision but also the instance-wise su-pervision, where the latter is usually neglected by existingGZSL researches. We evaluate our proposed hybrid GZSL framework with contrastive embedding, named CE-GZSL, on ﬁve benchmark datasets. The results show that our CE-GZSL method can outperform the state-of-the-arts by a sig-niﬁcant margin on three datasets. Our codes are available on https://github.com/Hanzy1996/CE-GZSL.
