We present a new domain adaptive self-training pipeline, named ST3D, for unsupervised domain adaptation on 3D object detection from point clouds. First, we pre-train the 3D detector on the source domain with our proposed ran-dom object scaling strategy for mitigating the negative ef-fects of source domain bias. Then, the detector is itera-tively improved on the target domain by alternatively con-ducting two steps, which are the pseudo label updating with the developed quality-aware triplet memory bank and the model training with curriculum data augmentation. These speciﬁc designs for 3D object detection enable the detec-tor to be trained with consistent and high-quality pseudo labels and to avoid overﬁtting to the large number of easy examples in pseudo labeled data. Our ST3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on all evaluated datasets and even surpasses fully supervised results on KITTI 3D object de-tection benchmark.
