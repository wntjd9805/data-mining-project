Cross-view image geo-localization aims to determine the locations of street-view query images by matching withGPS-tagged reference images from aerial view. Recent works have achieved surprisingly high retrieval accuracy on city-scale datasets. However, these results rely on the assumption that there exists a reference image exactly cen-tered at the location of any query image, which is not ap-plicable for practical scenarios. In this paper, we redeﬁne this problem with a more realistic assumption that the query image can be arbitrary in the area of interest and the refer-ence images are captured before the queries emerge. This assumption breaks the one-to-one retrieval setting of exist-ing datasets as the queries and reference images are not perfectly aligned pairs, and there may be multiple refer-ence images covering one query location. To bridge the gap between this realistic setting and existing datasets, we propose a new large-scale benchmark –VIGOR– for cross-View Image Geo-localization beyond One-to-one Retrieval.We benchmark existing state-of-the-art methods and pro-pose a novel end-to-end framework to localize the query in a coarse-to-ﬁne manner. Apart from the image-level re-trieval accuracy, we also evaluate the localization accuracy in terms of the actual distance (meters) using the raw GPS data. Extensive experiments are conducted under differ-ent application scenarios to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results indicate that cross-view geo-localization in this realistic setting is still challenging, fos-tering new research in this direction.
