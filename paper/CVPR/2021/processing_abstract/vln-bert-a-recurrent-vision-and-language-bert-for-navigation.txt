Accuracy of many visiolinguistic tasks has beneﬁted signiﬁcantly from the application of vision-and-language (V&L) BERT. However, its application for the task of vision-and-language navigation (VLN) remains limited. One rea-son for this is the difﬁculty adapting the BERT architecture to the partially observable Markov decision process present in VLN, requiring history-dependent attention and decision making. In this paper we propose a recurrent BERT model that is time-aware for use in VLN. Speciﬁcally, we equip the BERT model with a recurrent function that maintains cross-modal state information for the agent. Through ex-tensive experiments on R2R and REVERIE we demonstrate that our model can replace more complex encoder-decoder models to achieve state-of-the-art results. Moreover, our approach can be generalised to other transformer-based ar-chitectures, supports pre-training, and is capable of solving navigation and referring expression tasks simultaneously.
