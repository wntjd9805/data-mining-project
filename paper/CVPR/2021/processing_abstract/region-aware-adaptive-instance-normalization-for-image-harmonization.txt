Different visual style of different imagesImage composition plays a common but important role in photo editing. To acquire photo-realistic composite im-ages, one must adjust the appearance and visual style of the foreground to be compatible with the background. Ex-isting deep learning methods for harmonizing composite images directly learn an image mapping network from the composite to real one, without explicit exploration on vi-sual style consistency between the background and the fore-ground images. To ensure the visual style consistency be-tween the foreground and the background, in this paper, we treat image harmonization as a style transfer problem. In particular, we propose a simple yet effective Region-awareAdaptive Instance Normalization (RAIN) module, which ex-plicitly formulates the visual style from the background and adaptively applies them to the foreground. With our set-tings, our RAIN module can be used as a drop-in module for existing image harmonization networks and is able to bring signiÔ¨Åcant improvements. Extensive experiments on the ex-isting image harmonization benchmark datasets shows the superior capability of the proposed method. Code is avail-able at https://github.com/junleen/RainNet.
