We propose a new convolution called Dynamic Region-Aware Convolution (DRConv), which can automatically as-sign multiple ﬁlters to corresponding spatial regions whereIn this way, DR-features have similar representation.Conv outperforms standard convolution in modeling seman-tic variations. Standard convolutional layer can increase the number of ﬁlers to extract more visual elements but re-sults in high computational cost. More gracefully, our DR-Conv transfers the increasing channel-wise ﬁlters to spa-tial dimension with learnable instructor, which not only im-prove representation ability of convolution, but also main-tains computational cost and the translation-invariance as standard convolution dose. DRConv is an effective and ele-gant method for handling complex and variable spatial in-formation distribution. It can substitute standard convolu-tion in any existing networks for its plug-and-play property, especially to power convolution layers in efﬁcient networks.We evaluate DRConv on a wide range of models (MobileNet series, ShufﬂeNetV2, etc.) and tasks (Classiﬁcation, FaceRecognition, Detection and Segmentation). On ImageNet classiﬁcation, DRConv-based ShufﬂeNetV2-0.5× achieves state-of-the-art performance of 67.1% at 46M multiply-adds level with 6.3% relative improvement.
