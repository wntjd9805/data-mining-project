Image-based methods for indoor lighting estimation suf-fer from the problem of intensity-distance ambiguity. This paper introduces a novel setup to help alleviate the ambi-guity based on the event camera. We further demonstrate that estimating the distance of a light source becomes a well-posed problem under this setup, based on which an optimization-based method and a learning-based method are proposed. Our experimental results validate that our approaches not only achieve superior performance for in-door lighting estimation (especially for the close light) but also signiﬁcantly alleviate the intensity-distance ambiguity.Light source exp(𝛷 𝑡 )𝒏𝐱𝒏𝒍BRDFDiffuse reflection𝒏𝒍𝑑Event streamsSphere𝑰(𝐱, 𝑡)Event camera𝑒 = {𝐱, 𝑡, 𝑝}
