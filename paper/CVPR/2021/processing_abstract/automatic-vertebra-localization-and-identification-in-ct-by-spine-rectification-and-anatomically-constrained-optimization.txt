Accurate vertebra localization and identiﬁcation are re-quired in many clinical applications of spine disorder di-agnosis and surgery planning. However, signiﬁcant chal-lenges are posed in this task by highly varying patholo-gies (such as vertebral compression fracture, scoliosis, and vertebral ﬁxation) and imaging conditions (such as limitedﬁeld of view and metal streak artifacts). This paper pro-poses a robust and accurate method that effectively exploits the anatomical knowledge of the spine to facilitate verte-bra localization and identiﬁcation. A key point localization model is trained to produce activation maps of vertebra cen-ters. They are then re-sampled along the spine centerline to produce spine-rectiﬁed activation maps, which are fur-ther aggregated into 1-D activation signals. Following this, an anatomically-constrained optimization module is intro-duced to jointly search for the optimal vertebra centers un-der a soft constraint that regulates the distance between ver-tebrae and a hard constraint on the consecutive vertebra in-dices. When being evaluated on a major public benchmark of 302 highly pathological CT images, the proposed method reports the state of the art identiﬁcation (id.) rate of 97.4%, and outperforms the best competing method of 94.7% id. rate by reducing the relative id. error rate by half.
