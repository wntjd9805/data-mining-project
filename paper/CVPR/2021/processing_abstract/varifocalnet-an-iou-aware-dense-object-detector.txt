Accurately ranking the vast number of candidate detec-tions is crucial for dense object detectors to achieve high performance. Prior work uses the classiﬁcation score or a combination of classiﬁcation and predicted localization scores to rank candidates. However, neither option re-sults in a reliable ranking, thus degrading detection per-formance. In this paper, we propose to learn an Iou-AwareClassiﬁcation Score (IACS) as a joint representation of ob-ject presence conﬁdence and localization accuracy. We show that dense object detectors can achieve a more accu-rate ranking of candidate detections based on the IACS. We design a new loss function, named Varifocal Loss, to train a dense object detector to predict the IACS, and propose a new star-shaped bounding box feature representation forIACS prediction and bounding box reﬁnement. Combining these two new components and a bounding box reﬁnement branch, we build an IoU-aware dense object detector based on the FCOS+ATSS architecture, that we call VarifocalNet or VFNet for short. Extensive experiments on MS COCO show that our VFNet consistently surpasses the strong base-line by ∼2.0 AP with different backbones. Our best modelVFNet-X-1200 with Res2Net-101-DCN achieves a single-model single-scale AP of 55.1 on COCO test-dev, which is state-of-the-art among various object detectors.
