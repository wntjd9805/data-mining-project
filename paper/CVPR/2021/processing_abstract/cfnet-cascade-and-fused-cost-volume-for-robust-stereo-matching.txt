Recently, the ever-increasing capacity of large-scale an-notated datasets has led to profound progress in stereo matching. However, most of these successes are limited to a speciﬁc dataset and cannot generalize well to other datasets. The main difﬁculties lie in the large domain dif-ferences and unbalanced disparity distribution across a va-riety of datasets, which greatly limit the real-world applica-bility of current deep stereo matching models. In this paper, we propose CFNet, a Cascade and Fused cost volume based network to improve the robustness of the stereo matching network. First, we propose a fused cost volume represen-tation to deal with the large domain difference. By fusing multiple low-resolution dense cost volumes to enlarge the receptive ﬁeld, we can extract robust structural representa-tions for initial disparity estimation. Second, we propose a cascade cost volume representation to alleviate the un-balanced disparity distribution. Speciﬁcally, we employ a variance-based uncertainty estimation to adaptively adjust the next stage disparity search space, in this way driving the network progressively prune out the space of unlikely cor-respondences. By iteratively narrowing down the dispar-ity search space and improving the cost volume resolution, the disparity estimation is gradually reﬁned in a coarse-to-ﬁne manner. When trained on the same training images and evaluated on KITTI, ETH3D, and Middlebury datasets with the ﬁxed model parameters and hyperparameters, our pro-posed method achieves the state-of-the-art overall perfor-mance and obtains the 1st place on the stereo task of Ro-bust Vision Challenge 2020.
