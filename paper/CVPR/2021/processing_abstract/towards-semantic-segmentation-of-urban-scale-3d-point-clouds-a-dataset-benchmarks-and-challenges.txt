An essential prerequisite for unleashing the potential of supervised deep learning algorithms in the area of 3D scene understanding is the availability of large-scale and richly annotated datasets. However, publicly available datasets are either in relative small spatial scales or have limited semantic annotations due to the expensive cost of data ac-quisition and data annotation, which severely limits the de-velopment of Ô¨Åne-grained semantic understanding in the context of 3D point clouds.In this paper, we present an urban-scale photogrammetric point cloud dataset with nearly three billion richly annotated points, which is three times the number of labeled points than the existing largest photogrammetric point cloud dataset. Our dataset con-sists of large areas from three UK cities, covering about 7.6 km2 of the city landscape.In the dataset, each 3D point is labeled as one of 13 semantic classes. We ex-tensively evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art algo-rithms on our dataset and provide a comprehensive anal-In particular, we identify several key ysis of the results. challenges towards urban-scale point cloud understanding.The dataset is available at https://github.com/QingyongHu/SensatUrban.
