Recently, learning-based approaches have achieved im-pressive results in the ﬁeld of low-light image denoising.Some state of the art approaches employ a rich physical model to generate realistic training data. However, the per-formance of these approaches ultimately depends on the re-alism of the physical model, and many works only concen-trate on everyday photography. In this work we present a denoising approach for extremely low-light images of per-manently shadowed regions (PSRs) on the lunar surface, taken by the Narrow Angle Camera on board the LunarReconnaissance Orbiter satellite. Our approach extends existing learning-based approaches by combining a phys-ical noise model of the camera with real noise samples and training image scene selection based on 3D ray tracing to generate realistic training data. We also condition our de-noising model on the camera’s environmental metadata at the time of image capture (such as the camera’s tempera-ture and age), showing that this improves performance. Our quantitative and qualitative results show that our method strongly outperforms the existing calibration routine for the camera and other baselines. Our results could signiﬁcantly impact lunar science and exploration, for example by aiding the identiﬁcation of surface water-ice and reducing uncer-tainty in rover and human traverse planning into PSRs.
