horse horseMachine learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, namely perturbations of the data that lead to wrong predictions despite being imperceptible.However, the existence of “universal” attacks (i.e., unique perturbations that transfer across different data points) has only been demonstrated for images to date. Part of the rea-son lies in the lack of a common domain, for geometric data such as graphs, meshes, and point clouds, where a univer-sal perturbation can be deﬁned. In this paper, we offer a change in perspective and demonstrate the existence of uni-versal attacks for geometric data (shapes). We introduce a computational procedure that operates entirely in the spec-tral domain, where the attacks take the form of small pertur-bations to short eigenvalue sequences; the resulting geom-etry is then synthesized via shape-from-spectrum recovery.Our attacks are universal, in that they transfer across dif-ferent shapes, different representations (meshes and point clouds), and generalize to previously unseen data.
