Despite the data labeling cost for the object detection tasks being substantially more than that of the classiﬁca-tion tasks, semi-supervised learning methods for object de-In this paper, we tection have not been studied much. propose an Interpolation-based Semi-supervised learning method for object Detection (ISD), which considers and solves the problems caused by applying conventional In-terpolation Regularization (IR) directly to object detection.We divide the output of the model into two types accord-ing to the objectness scores of both original patches that are mixed in IR. Then, we apply a separate loss suitable for each type in an unsupervised manner. The proposed losses dramatically improve the performance of semi-supervised learning as well as supervised learning.In the super-vised learning setting, our method improves the baseline methods by a signiﬁcant margin.In the semi-supervised learning setting, our algorithm improves the performance on a benchmark dataset (PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO) in a benchmark architecture (SSD).
