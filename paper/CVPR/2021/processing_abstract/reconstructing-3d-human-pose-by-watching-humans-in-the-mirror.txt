In this paper, we introduce the new task of reconstruct-ing 3D human pose from a single image in which we can see the person and the person’s image through a mirror.Compared to general scenarios of 3D pose estimation from a single view, the mirror reﬂection provides an additional view for resolving the depth ambiguity. We develop an optimization-based approach that exploits mirror symme-try constraints for accurate 3D pose reconstruction. We also provide a method to estimate the surface normal of the mirror from vanishing points in the single image. To validate the proposed approach, we collect a large-scale dataset named Mirrored-Human, which covers a large vari-ety of human subjects, poses and backgrounds. The experi-ments demonstrate that, when trained on Mirrored-Human with our reconstructed 3D poses as pseudo ground-truth, the accuracy and generalizability of existing single-view 3D pose estimators can be largely improved. The code and dataset are available at https://zju3dv.github. io/Mirrored-Human/.
