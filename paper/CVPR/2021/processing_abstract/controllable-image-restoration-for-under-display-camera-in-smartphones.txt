Under-display  camera 12:45Under-display camera (UDC) technology is essential for full-screen display in smartphones and is achieved by re-moving the concept of drilling holes on display. However, this causes inevitable image degradation in the form of spa-tially variant blur and noise because of the opaque display in front of the camera. To address spatially variant blur and noise in UDC images, we propose a novel controllable im-age restoration algorithm utilizing pixel-wise UDC-speciﬁc kernel representation and a noise estimator. The kernel representation is derived from an elaborate optical model that reﬂects the effect of both normal and oblique light inci-dence. Also, noise-adaptive learning is introduced to con-trol noise levels, which can be utilized to provide optimal results depending on the user preferences. The experiments showed that the proposed method achieved superior quan-titative performance as well as higher perceptual quality on both a real-world dataset and a monitor-based aligned dataset compared to conventional image restoration algo-rithms.
