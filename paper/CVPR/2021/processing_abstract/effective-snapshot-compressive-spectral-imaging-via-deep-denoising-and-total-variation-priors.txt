Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) is a new type of compressive imaging system that compresses multiple frames of images into a single snapshot measurement, which enjoys low cost, low bandwidth, and high-speed sens-ing rate. By applying the existing SCI methods to deal with hyperspectral images, however, could not fully exploit the underlying structures, and thereby demonstrate unsatisfac-tory reconstruction performance. To remedy such issue, this paper aims to propose a new effective method by taking ad-vantage of two intrinsic priors of the hyperspectral images, namely deep image denoising and total variation (TV) pri-ors. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we propose an optimization objective to utilize these two priors. By solving this optimization ob-jective, our method is equivalent to incorporate a weightedFFDNet and a 2DTV or 3DTV denoiser into the plug-and-play framework. Extensive numerical experiments demon-strate the outperformance of the proposed method over sev-eral state-of-the-art alternatives. Additionally, we provide a detailed convergence analysis of the resulting plug-and-play algorithm under relatively weak conditions such as without using diminishing step sizes.
