Unsupervised image clustering methods often introduce alternative objectives to indirectly train the model and are subject to faulty predictions and overconﬁdent results. To overcome these challenges, the current research proposes an innovative model RUC that is inspired by robust learn-ing. RUC’s novelty is at utilizing pseudo-labels of existing image clustering models as a noisy dataset that may include misclassiﬁed samples. Its retraining process can revise mis-aligned knowledge and alleviate the overconﬁdence prob-lem in predictions. The model’s ﬂexible structure makes it possible to be used as an add-on module to other cluster-ing methods and helps them achieve better performance on multiple datasets. Extensive experiments show that the pro-posed model can adjust the model conﬁdence with better calibration and gain additional robustness against adver-sarial noise.
