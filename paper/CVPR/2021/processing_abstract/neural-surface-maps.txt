Maps are arguably one of the most fundamental con-cepts used to deﬁne and operate on manifold surfaces in differentiable geometry. Accordingly, in geometry process-ing, maps are ubiquitous and are used in many core appli-cations, such as paramterization, shape analysis, remesh-ing, and deformation. Unfortunately, most computational representations of surface maps do not lend themselves to manipulation and optimization, usually entailing hard, dis-crete problems. While algorithms exist to solve these prob-lems, they are problem-speciﬁc, and a general framework for surface maps is still in need.In this paper, we advocate considering neural networks as encoding surface maps. Since neural networks can be composed on one another and are differentiable, we show it is easy to use them to deﬁne surfaces via atlases, compose them for surface-to-surface mappings, and optimize differ-entiable objectives relating to them, such as any notion of distortion, in a trivial manner. In our experiments, we repre-sent surfaces by generating a neural map that approximates a UV parameterization of a 3D model. Then, we compose this map with other neural maps which we optimize with re-spect to distortion measures. We show that our formulation enables trivial optimization of rather elusive mapping tasks, such as maps between a collection of surfaces.
