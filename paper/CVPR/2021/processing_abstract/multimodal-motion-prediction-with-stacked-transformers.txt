Predicting multiple plausible future trajectories of the nearby vehicles is crucial for the safety of autonomous driving. Recent motion prediction approaches attempt to achieve such multimodal motion prediction by implicitly regularizing the feature or explicitly generating multiple candidate proposals. However, it remains challenging since the latent features may concentrate on the most frequent mode of the data while the proposal-based methods depend largely on the prior knowledge to generate and select theIn this work, we propose a novel transformer proposals. framework for multimodal motion prediction, termed as mmTransformer. A novel network architecture based on stacked transformers is designed to model the multimodal-ity at feature level with a set of Ô¨Åxed independent propos-als. A region-based training strategy is then developed to induce the multimodality of the generated proposals. Ex-periments on Argoverse dataset show that the proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on mo-tion prediction, substantially improving the diversity and the accuracy of the predicted trajectories.
