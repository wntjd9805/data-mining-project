Lossy compression optimises the objectiveLossy image compression is often limited by the sim-plicity of the chosen loss measure. Recent research sug-gests that generative adversarial networks have the ability to overcome this limitation and serve as a multi-modal loss, especially for textures. Together with learned image com-pression, these two techniques can be used to great effect when relaxing the commonly employed tight measures of distortion. However, convolutional neural network-based algorithms have a large computational footprint. Ideally, an existing conventional codec should stay in place, ensur-ing faster adoption and adherence to a balanced computa-tional envelope.As a possible avenue to this goal, we propose and investi-gate how learned image coding can be used as a surrogate to optimise an image for encoding. A learned ﬁlter alters the image to optimise a different performance measure or a particular task. Extending this idea with a generative ad-versarial network, we show how entire textures are replaced by ones that are less costly to encode but preserve a sense of detail.Our approach can remodel a conventional codec to ad-just for the MS-SSIM distortion with over 20% rate im-provement without any decoding overhead. On task-aware image compression, we perform favourably against a simi-lar but codec-speciﬁc approach.
