The basic framework of depth completion is to predict a pixel-wise dense depth map using very sparse input data.In this paper, we try to solve this problem in a more effec-tive way, by reformulating the regression-based depth esti-mation problem into a combination of depth plane classi-ﬁcation and residual regression. Our proposed approach is to initially densify sparse depth information by ﬁguring out which plane a pixel should lie among a number of dis-cretized depth planes, and then calculate the ﬁnal depth value by predicting the distance from the speciﬁed plane.This will help the network to lessen the burden of directly regressing the absolute depth information from none, and to effectively obtain more accurate depth prediction result with less computation power and inference time. To do so, we ﬁrstly introduce a novel way of interpreting depth in-formation with the closest depth plane label p and a resid-ual value r, as we call it, Plane-Residual (PR) representa-tion. We also propose a depth completion network utilizingPR representation consisting of a shared encoder and two decoders, where one classiﬁes the pixel’s depth plane la-bel, while the other one regresses the normalized distance from the classiﬁed depth plane. By interpreting depth in-formation in PR representation and using our correspond-ing depth completion network, we were able to acquire im-proved depth completion performance with faster computa-tion, compared to previous approaches.
