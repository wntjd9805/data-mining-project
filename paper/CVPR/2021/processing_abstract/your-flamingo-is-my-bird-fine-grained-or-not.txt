Whether what you see in Figure 1 is a “ﬂamingo” or a“bird”, is the question we ask in this paper. While ﬁne-grained visual classiﬁcation (FGVC) strives to arrive at the former, for the majority of us non-experts just “bird” would probably sufﬁce. The real question is therefore – how can we tailor for different ﬁne-grained deﬁnitions un-der divergent levels of expertise. For that, we re-envisage the traditional setting of FGVC, from single-label clas-siﬁcation, to that of top-down traversal of a pre-deﬁned coarse-to-ﬁne label hierarchy – so that our answer becomes“bird” ⇒ “Phoenicopteriformes” ⇒ “Phoenicopteridae”⇒ “ﬂamingo”.To approach this new problem, we ﬁrst conduct a com-prehensive human study where we conﬁrm that most partic-ipants prefer multi-granularity labels, regardless whether they consider themselves experts. We then discover the key intuition that: coarse-level label prediction exacerbatesﬁne-grained feature learning, yet ﬁne-level feature betters the learning of coarse-level classiﬁer. This discovery en-ables us to design a very simple albeit surprisingly effective solution to our new problem, where we (i) leverage level-speciﬁc classiﬁcation heads to disentangle coarse-level fea-tures with ﬁne-grained ones, and (ii) allow ﬁner-grained features to participate in coarser-grained label predictions, which in turn helps with better disentanglement. Experi-ments show that our method achieves superior performance in the new FGVC setting, and performs better than state-of-the-art on the traditional single-label FGVC problem as well. Thanks to its simplicity, our method can be easily im-plemented on top of any existing FGVC frameworks and is parameter-free.
