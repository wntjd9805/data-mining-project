Recent works of multi-source domain adaptation focus on learning a domain-agnostic model, of which the param-eters are static. However, such a static model is difﬁcult to handle conﬂicts across multiple domains, and suffers from a performance degradation in both source domains and tar-get domain. In this paper, we present dynamic transfer to address domain conﬂicts, where the model parameters are adapted to samples. The key insight is that adapting model across domains is achieved via adapting model across sam-ples. Thus, it breaks down source domain barriers and turns multi-source domains into a single-source domain. This also simpliﬁes the alignment between source and target do-mains, as it only requires the target domain to be aligned with any part of the union of source domains. Further-more, we ﬁnd dynamic transfer can be simply modeled by aggregating residual matrices and a static convolution ma-trix. Experimental results show that, without using domain labels, our dynamic transfer outperforms the state-of-the-art method by more than 3% on the large multi-source do-main adaptation datasets – DomainNet.
