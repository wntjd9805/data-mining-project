While deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved great success on image de-raining task, most ex-isting methods can only learn ﬁxed mapping rules between paired rainy/clean images on a single dataset. This limits their applications in practical situations with multiple and incremental datasets where the mapping rules may change for different types of rain streaks. However, the catastrophic forgetting of traditional deep CNN model challenges the de-sign of generalized framework for multiple and incremental datasets. A strategy of sharing the network structure but in-dependently updating and storing the network parameters on each dataset has been developed as a potential solution.Nevertheless, this strategy is not applicable to compact sys-tems as it dramatically increases the overall training time and parameter space. To alleviate such limitation, in this study, we propose a parameter importance guided weights modiﬁcation approach, named PIGWM. Speciﬁcally, with new dataset (e.g. new rain dataset), the well-trained net-work weights are updated according to their importance evaluated on previous training dataset. With extensive ex-perimental validation, we demonstrate that a single network with a single parameter set of our proposed method can process multiple rain datasets almost without performance degradation. The proposed model is capable of achieving superior performance on both inhomogeneous and incre-mental datasets, and is promising for highly compact sys-tems to gradually learn myriad regularities of the different types of rain streaks. The results indicate that our proposed method has great potential for other computer vision tasks with dynamic learning environments.
