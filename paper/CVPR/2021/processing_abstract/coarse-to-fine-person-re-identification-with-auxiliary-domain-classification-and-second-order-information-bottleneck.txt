Person re-identiﬁcation (Re-ID) is to retrieve a particu-lar person captured by different cameras, which is of great signiﬁcance for security surveillance and pedestrian behav-ior analysis. However, due to the large intra-class variation of a person across cameras, e.g., occlusions, illuminations, viewpoints, and poses, Re-ID is still a challenging task in the ﬁeld of computer vision.In this paper, to attack the issues concerning with intra-class variation, we propose a coarse-to-ﬁne Re-ID framework with the incorporation of auxiliary-domain classiﬁcation (ADC) and second-order information bottleneck (2O-IB). In particular, as an auxil-iary task, ADC is introduced to extract the coarse-grained essential features to distinguish a person from miscella-neous backgrounds, which leads to the effective coarse- andﬁne-grained feature representations for Re-ID. On the other hand, to cope with the redundancy, irrelevance, and noise contained in the Re-ID features caused by intra-class varia-tions, we integrate 2O-IB into the network to compress and optimize the features, without increasing additional com-putation overhead during inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method signiﬁcantly reduces the neural network output variance of intra-class person im-ages and achieves the superior performance to state-of-the-art methods.
