Analyzing complex scenes with Deep Neural Networks is a challenging task, particularly when images contain multi-ple objects that partially occlude each other. Existing ap-proaches to image analysis mostly process objects inde-pendently and do not take into account the relative occlu-sion of nearby objects. In this paper, we propose a deep network for multi-object instance segmentation that is ro-bust to occlusion and can be trained from bounding box supervision only. Our work builds on Compositional Net-works, which learn a generative model of neural feature ac-tivations to locate occluders and to classify objects based on their non-occluded parts. We extend their generative model to include multiple objects and introduce a frame-work for efﬁcient inference in challenging occlusion sce-In particular, we obtain feed-forward predictions narios. of the object classes and their instance and occluder seg-mentations. We introduce an Occlusion Reasoning Module (ORM) that locates erroneous segmentations and estimates the occlusion order to correct them. The improved seg-mentation masks are, in turn, integrated into the network in a top-down manner to improve the image classiﬁcation.Our experiments on the KITTI INStance dataset (KINS) and a synthetic occlusion dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our model at multi-object instance seg-mentation under occlusion.
