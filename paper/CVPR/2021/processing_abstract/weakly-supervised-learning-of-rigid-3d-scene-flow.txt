We propose a data-driven scene ﬂow estimation algo-rithm exploiting the observation that many 3D scenes can be explained by a collection of agents moving as rigid bod-ies. At the core of our method lies a deep architecture able to reason at the object-level by considering 3D scene ﬂow in conjunction with other 3D tasks. This object level ab-straction enables us to relax the requirement for dense sceneﬂow supervision with simpler binary background segmenta-tion mask and ego-motion annotations. Our mild supervi-sion requirements make our method well suited for recently released massive data collections for autonomous driving, which do not contain dense scene ﬂow annotations. As out-put, our model provides low-level cues like pointwise ﬂow and higher-level cues such as holistic scene understanding at the level of rigid objects. We further propose a test-time optimization reﬁning the predicted rigid scene ﬂow. We showcase the effectiveness and generalization capacity of our method on four different autonomous driving datasets.We release our source code and pre-trained models under github.com/zgojcic/Rigid3DSceneFlow.
