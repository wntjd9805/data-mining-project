Man-made ObjectGiven a set of putative 2D-2D line correspondences, we aim to identify correct matches. Existing methods ex-ploit the geometric constraints. They are only applica-ble to structured scenes with orthogonality, parallelism and coplanarity. In contrast, we propose the ﬁrst approach suit-able for both structured and unstructured scenes. Instead of geometric constraint, we leverage the spatial regularity on sphere. Speciﬁcally, we propose to map line correspon-dences into vectors tangent to sphere. We use these vectors to encode both angular and positional variations of image lines, which is more reliable and concise than directly using inclinations, midpoints or endpoints of image lines. Neigh-boring vectors mapped from correct matches exhibit a spa-tial regularity called local trend consistency, regardless of the type of scenes. To encode this regularity, we design a neural network and also propose a novel loss function that enforces the smoothness constraint of vector ﬁeld. In addi-tion, we establish a large real-world dataset for image line matching. Experiments showed that our approach outper-forms state-of-the-art ones in terms of accuracy, efﬁciency and robustness, and also leads to high generalization.
