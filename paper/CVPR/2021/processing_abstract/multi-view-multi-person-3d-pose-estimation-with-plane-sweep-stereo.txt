Existing approaches for multi-view multi-person 3D pose estimation explicitly establish cross-view correspon-dences to group 2D pose detections from multiple camera views and solve for the 3D pose estimation for each per-son. Establishing cross-view correspondences is challeng-ing in multi-person scenes, and incorrect correspondences will lead to sub-optimal performance for the multi-stage pipeline. In this work, we present our multi-view 3D pose estimation approach based on plane sweep stereo to jointly address the cross-view fusion and 3D pose reconstruction in a single shot. Speciﬁcally, we propose to perform depth regression for each joint of each 2D pose in a target cam-era view. Cross-view consistency constraints are implic-itly enforced by multiple reference camera views via the plane sweep algorithm to facilitate accurate depth regres-sion. We adopt a coarse-to-ﬁne scheme to ﬁrst regress the person-level depth followed by a per-person joint-level rel-ative depth estimation. 3D poses are obtained from a sim-ple back-projection given the estimated depths. We evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets where it outperforms previous state-of-the-arts while being remarkably efﬁcient.Our code is available at the project website. 1
