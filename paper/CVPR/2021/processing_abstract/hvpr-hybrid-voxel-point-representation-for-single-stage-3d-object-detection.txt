We address the problem of 3D object detection, that is, estimating 3D object bounding boxes from point clouds. 3D object detection methods exploit either voxel-based or point-based features to represent 3D objects in a scene.Voxel-based features are efﬁcient to extract, while they fail to preserve ﬁne-grained 3D structures of objects. Point-based features, on the other hand, represent the 3D struc-tures more accurately, but extracting these features is com-putationally expensive. We introduce in this paper a novel single-stage 3D detection method having the merit of both voxel-based and point-based features. To this end, we pro-pose a new convolutional neural network (CNN) architec-ture, dubbed HVPR, that integrates both features into a single 3D representation effectively and efﬁciently. Specif-ically, we augment the point-based features with a mem-ory module to reduce the computational cost. We then ag-gregate the features in the memory, semantically similar to each voxel-based one, to obtain a hybrid 3D representa-tion in a form of a pseudo image, allowing to localize 3D objects in a single stage efﬁciently. We also propose an At-tentive Multi-scale Feature Module (AMFM) that extracts scale-aware features considering the sparse and irregular patterns of point clouds. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of our approach, achieving a better compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.
