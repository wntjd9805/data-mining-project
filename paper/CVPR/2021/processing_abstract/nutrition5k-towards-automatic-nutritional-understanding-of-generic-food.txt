Understanding the nutritional content of food from vi-sual data is a challenging computer vision problem, with the potential to have a positive and widespread impact on public health. Studies in this area are limited to existing datasets in the ﬁeld that lack sufﬁcient diversity or labels required for training models with nutritional understand-ing capability. We introduce Nutrition5k, a novel dataset of 5k diverse, real world food dishes with corresponding video streams, depth images, component weights, and high accuracy nutritional content annotation. We demonstrate the potential of this dataset by training a computer vision algorithm capable of predicting the caloric and macronu-trient values of a complex, real world dish at an ac-curacy that outperforms professional nutritionists. Fur-ther we present a baseline for incorporating depth sensor data to improve nutrition predictions. We release Nutri-tion5k in the hope that it will accelerate innovation in the space of nutritional understanding. The dataset is avail-able at https : / / github . com / google - research -datasets/Nutrition5k.
