The difﬁculty of obtaining paired data remains a ma-jor bottleneck for learning image restoration and enhance-ment models for real-world applications. Current strate-gies aim to synthesize realistic training data by modeling noise and degradations that appear in real-world settings.We propose DeFlow, a method for learning stochastic im-age degradations from unpaired data. Our approach is based on a novel unpaired learning formulation for con-ditional normalizing ﬂows. We model the degradation pro-cess in the latent space of a shared ﬂow encoder-decoder network. This allows us to learn the conditional distribu-tion of a noisy image given the clean input by solely min-imizing the negative log-likelihood of the marginal distri-butions. We validate our DeFlow formulation on the task of joint image restoration and super-resolution. The mod-els trained with the synthetic data generated by DeFlow outperform previous learnable approaches on three recent datasets.
