l Vote Cluster l Corresponding Seed Points--- Ground Truth Bounding Box--- Predicted Bounding Box 3D object detection in point clouds is a challenging vi-sion task that beneﬁts various applications for understand-ing the 3D visual world. Lots of recent research focuses on how to exploit end-to-end trainable Hough voting for generating object proposals. However, the current voting strategy can only receive partial votes from the surfaces of potential objects together with severe outlier votes from the cluttered backgrounds, which hampers full utilization of the information from the input point clouds.Inspired by the back-tracing strategy in the conventional Hough voting methods, in this work, we introduce a new 3D object detec-tion method, named as Back-tracing Representative PointsNetwork (BRNet), which generatively back-traces the repre-sentative points from the vote centers and also revisits com-plementary seed points around these generated points, so as to better capture the ﬁne local structural features surround-ing the potential objects from the raw point clouds. There-fore, this bottom-up and then top-down strategy in our BR-Net enforces mutual consistency between the predicted vote centers and the raw surface points and thus achieves more reliable and ﬂexible object localization and class predic-tion results. Our BRNet is simple but effective, which sig-niﬁcantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two large-scale point cloud datasets, ScanNet V2 (+7.5% in terms of mAP@0.50) and SUN RGB-D (+4.7% in terms of mAP@0.50), while it is still lightweight and efﬁcient.
