Input SpaceCluster-Friendly SpaceSeed DistributionSuperpixelSuperpixel is generated by automatically clustering pix-els in an image into hundreds of compact partitions, which is widely used to perceive the object contours for its excel-lent contour adherence. Although some works use the Con-volution Neural Network (CNN) to generate high-quality superpixel, we challenge the design principles of these net-works, speciﬁcally for their dependence on manual labels and excess computation resources, which limits their ﬂexi-bility compared with the traditional unsupervised segmen-tation methods. We target at redeﬁning the CNN-based su-perpixel segmentation as a lifelong clustering task and pro-pose an unsupervised CNN-based method called LNS-Net.The LNS-Net can learn superpixel in a non-iterative and lifelong manner without any manual labels. Speciﬁcally, a lightweight feature embedder is proposed for LNS-Net to efﬁciently generate the cluster-friendly features. With those features, seed nodes can be automatically assigned to clus-ter pixels in a non-iterative way. Additionally, our LNS-Net can adapt the sequentially lifelong learning by rescaling the gradient of weight based on both channel and spatial context to avoid overﬁtting. Experiments show that the pro-posed LNS-Net achieves signiﬁcantly better performance on three benchmarks with nearly ten times lower complexity compared with other state-of-the-art methods.
