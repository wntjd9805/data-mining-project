The goal of semi-supervised object detection is to learn a detection model using only a few labeled data and thereby reducing the large amounts of unlabeled data, cost of data labeling. Although a few studies have pro-posed various self-training-based methods or consistency regularization-based methods, they ignore the discrepan-cies among the detection results in the same image that oc-cur during different training iterations. Additionally, the predicted detection results vary among different detection models.In this paper, we propose an interactive form of self-training using mean teachers for semi-supervised object detection. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, to alleviate the instability among the detection results in different iterations, we pro-pose using nonmaximum suppression to fuse the detection results from different iterations. Simultaneously, we use multiple detection heads that predict pseudo labels for each other to provide complementary information. Furthermore, to avoid different detection heads collapsing to each other, we use a mean teacher model instead of the original detec-tion model to predict the pseudo labels. Thus, the object de-tection model can be trained on both labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.
