User-intended visual content ﬁlls the hole regions of an input image in the image editing scenario. The coarse low-level inputs, which typically consist of sparse sketch lines and color dots, convey user intentions for content creation (i.e., free-form editing). While existing methods combine an input image and these low-level controls for CNN inputs, the corresponding feature representations are not sufﬁcient to convey user intentions, leading to unfaithfully generated content. In this paper, we propose DeFLOCNet which re-lies on a deep encoder-decoder CNN to retain the guid-ance of these controls in the deep feature representations.In each skip-connection layer, we design a structure gener-ation block. Instead of attaching low-level controls to an in-put image, we inject these controls directly into each struc-ture generation block for sketch line reﬁnement and color propagation in the CNN feature space. We then concatenate the modulated features with the original decoder features for structure generation. Meanwhile, DeFLOCNet involves*Y. Song is the corresponding author. The results and code are available at https://github.com/KumapowerLIU/DeFLOCNet. another decoder branch for texture generation and detail enhancement. Both structures and textures are rendered in the decoder, leading to user-intended editing results. Exper-iments on benchmarks demonstrate that DeFLOCNet effec-tively transforms different user intentions to create visually pleasing content.
