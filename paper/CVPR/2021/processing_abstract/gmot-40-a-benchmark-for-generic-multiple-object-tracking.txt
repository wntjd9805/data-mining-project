Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) has witnessed remark-able advances in recent years. However, existing studies dominantly request prior knowledge of the tracking tar-get (eg, pedestrians), and hence may not generalize well to unseen categories.In contrast, Generic Multiple Ob-ject Tracking (GMOT), which requires little prior informa-tion about the target, is largely under-explored. In this pa-per, we make contributions to boost the study of GMOT in three aspects. First, we construct the ﬁrst publicly avail-able dense GMOT dataset, dubbed GMOT-40, which con-tains 40 carefully annotated sequences evenly distributed among 10 object categories. In addition, two tracking pro-tocols are adopted to evaluate different characteristics of tracking algorithms. Second, by noting the lack of de-voted tracking algorithms, we have designed a series of baseline GMOT algorithms. Third, we perform a thor-ough evaluations on GMOT-40, involving popular MOT al-gorithms (with necessary modiﬁcations) and the proposed baselines. The GMOT-40 benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/Spritea/GMOT40.
