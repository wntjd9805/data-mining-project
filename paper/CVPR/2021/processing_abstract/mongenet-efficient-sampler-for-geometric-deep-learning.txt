Recent advances in geometric deep-learning introduce complex computational challenges for evaluating the dis-tance between meshes. From a mesh model, point clouds are necessary along with a robust distance metric to as-sess surface quality or as part of the loss function for train-ing models. Current methods often rely on a uniform ran-dom mesh discretization, which yields irregular sampling and noisy distance estimation. In this paper we introduceMongeNet, a fast and optimal transport based sampler that allows for an accurate discretization of a mesh with bet-ter approximation properties. We compare our method to the ubiquitous random uniform sampling and show that the approximation error is almost half with a very small com-putational overhead.
