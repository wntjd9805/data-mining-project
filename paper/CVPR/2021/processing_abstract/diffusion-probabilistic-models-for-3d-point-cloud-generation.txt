We present a probabilistic model for point cloud gen-eration, which is fundamental for various 3D vision tasks such as shape completion, upsampling, synthesis and data augmentation.Inspired by the diffusion process in non-equilibrium thermodynamics, we view points in point clouds as particles in a thermodynamic system in contact with a heat bath, which diffuse from the original distribu-tion to a noise distribution. Point cloud generation thus amounts to learning the reverse diffusion process that trans-forms the noise distribution to the distribution of a desired shape. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we propose to model the reverse dif-fusion process for point clouds as a Markov chain condi-tioned on certain shape latent. We derive the variational bound in closed form for training and provide implemen-tations of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves competitive performance in point cloud generation and auto-encoding.
