We present Magic Layouts; a method for parsing screen-shots or hand-drawn sketches of user interface (UI) layouts.Our core contribution is to extend existing detectors to ex-ploit a learned structural prior for UI designs, enabling ro-bust detection of UI components; buttons, text boxes and similar. SpeciÔ¨Åcally we learn a prior over mobile UI lay-outs, encoding common spatial co-occurrence relationships between different UI components. Conditioning region pro-posals using this prior leads to performance gains on UI layout parsing for both hand-drawn UIs and app screen-shots, which we demonstrate within the context an interac-tive application for rapidly acquiring digital prototypes of user experience (UX) designs.
