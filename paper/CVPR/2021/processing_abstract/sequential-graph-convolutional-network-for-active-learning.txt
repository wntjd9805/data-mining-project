Labelled/unlabelled	imagesWe propose a novel pool-based Active Learning frame-work constructed on a sequential Graph Convolution Net-work (GCN). Each images feature from a pool of data rep-resents a node in the graph and the edges encode their sim-ilarities. With a small number of randomly sampled im-ages as seed labelled examples, we learn the parameters of the graph to distinguish labelled vs unlabelled nodes by minimising the binary cross-entropy loss. GCN performs message-passing operations between the nodes, and hence, induces similar representations of the strongly associated nodes. We exploit these characteristics of GCN to select the unlabelled examples which are sufﬁciently different from la-belled ones. To this end, we utilise the graph node embed-dings and their conﬁdence scores and adapt sampling tech-niques such as CoreSet and uncertainty-based methods to query the nodes. We ﬂip the label of newly queried nodes from unlabelled to labelled, re-train the learner to optimise the downstream task and the graph to minimise its modi-ﬁed objective. We continue this process within a ﬁxed bud-get. We evaluate our method on 6 different benchmarks: 4 real image classiﬁcation, 1 depth-based hand pose esti-mation and 1 synthetic RGB image classiﬁcation datasets.Our method outperforms several competitive baselines such as VAAL, Learning Loss, CoreSet and attains the new state-of-the-art performance on multiple applications.
