Uncertainty is the only certainty there is. Modeling data uncertainty is essential for regression, especially in uncon-strained settings. Traditionally the direct regression formu-lation is considered and the uncertainty is modeled by mod-ifying the output space to a certain family of probabilistic distributions. On the other hand, classiÔ¨Åcation based re-gression and ranking based solutions are more popular in practice while the direct regression methods suffer from the limited performance. How to model the uncertainty within the present-day technologies for regression remains an open issue. In this paper, we propose to learn probabilistic ordi-nal embeddings which represent each data as a multivariateGaussian distribution rather than a deterministic point in the latent space. An ordinal distribution constraint is pro-posed to exploit the ordinal nature of regression. Our prob-abilistic ordinal embeddings can be integrated into popular regression approaches and empower them with the ability of uncertainty estimation. Experimental results show that our approach achieves competitive performance. Code is avail-able at https://github.com/Li-Wanhua/POEs.
