We introduce a real-time, high-resolution background re-placement technique which operates at 30fps in 4K resolu-tion, and 60fps for HD on a modern GPU. Our technique is based on background matting, where an additional frame of the background is captured and used in recovering the al-pha matte and the foreground layer. The main challenge is to compute a high-quality alpha matte, preserving strand-level hair details, while processing high-resolution images in real-time. To achieve this goal, we employ two neural networks; a base network computes a low-resolution result which is reÔ¨Åned by a second network operating at high-resolution on selective patches. We introduce two large-scale video and image matting datasets: VideoMatte240K and PhotoMatte13K/85. Our approach yields higher qual-ity results compared to the previous state-of-the-art in back-ground matting, while simultaneously yielding a dramatic boost in both speed and resolution.
