Most of unsupervised person Re-Identiﬁcation (Re-ID) works produce pseudo-labels by measuring the feature similarity without considering the distribution discrepancy among cameras, leading to degraded accuracy in label computation across cameras. This paper targets to ad-dress this challenge by studying a novel intra-inter cam-era similarity for pseudo-label generation. We decompose the sample similarity computation into two stage, i.e., the intra-camera and inter-camera computations, respectively.The intra-camera computation directly leverages the CNN features for similarity computation within each camera.Pseudo-labels generated on different cameras train the re-id model in a multi-branch network. The second stage con-siders the classiﬁcation scores of each sample on different cameras as a new feature vector. This new feature effec-tively alleviates the distribution discrepancy among cam-eras and generates more reliable pseudo-labels. We hence train our re-id model in two stages with intra-camera and inter-camera pseudo-labels, respectively. This simple intra-inter camera similarity produces surprisingly good perfor-mance on multiple datasets, e.g., achieves rank-1 accuracy of 89.5% on the Market1501 dataset, outperforming the re-cent unsupervised works by 9+%, and is comparable with the latest transfer learning works that leverage extra anno-tations.
