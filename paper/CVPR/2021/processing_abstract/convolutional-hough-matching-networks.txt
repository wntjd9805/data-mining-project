Despite advances in feature representation, leveraging geometric relations is crucial for establishing reliable vi-sual correspondences under large variations of images. In this work we introduce a Hough transform perspective on convolutional matching and propose an effective geometric matching algorithm, dubbed Convolutional Hough Match-ing (CHM). The method distributes similarities of candidate matches over a geometric transformation space and evalu-ate them in a convolutional manner. We cast it into a train-able neural layer with a semi-isotropic high-dimensional kernel, which learns non-rigid matching with a small num-ber of interpretable parameters. To validate the effect, we develop the neural network with CHM layers that perform convolutional matching in the space of translation and scal-ing. Our method sets a new state of the art on standard benchmarks for semantic visual correspondence, proving its strong robustness to challenging intra-class variations.
