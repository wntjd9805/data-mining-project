Gaze target detection aims to infer where each person in a scene is looking. Existing works focus on 2D gaze and 2D saliency, but fail to exploit 3D contexts. In this work, we propose a three-stage method to simulate the human gaze inference behavior in 3D space. In the ﬁrst stage, we intro-duce a coarse-to-ﬁne strategy to robustly estimate a 3D gaze orientation from the head. The predicted gaze is decom-posed into a planar gaze on the image plane and a depth-channel gaze. In the second stage, we develop a Dual Atten-tion Module (DAM), which takes the planar gaze to produce the ﬁled of view and masks interfering objects regulated by depth information according to the depth-channel gaze. In the third stage, we use the generated dual attention as guid-ance to perform two sub-tasks: (1) identifying whether the gaze target is inside or out of the image; (2) locating the target if inside. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach performs favorably against state-of-the-art meth-ods on GazeFollow and VideoAttentionTarget datasets.
