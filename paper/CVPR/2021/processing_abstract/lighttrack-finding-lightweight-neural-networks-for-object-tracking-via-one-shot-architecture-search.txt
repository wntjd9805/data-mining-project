Object tracking has achieved signiﬁcant progress over the past few years. However, state-of-the-art trackers be-come increasingly heavy and expensive, which limits their deployments in resource-constrained applications. In this work, we present LightTrack, which uses neural architec-ture search (NAS) to design more lightweight and efﬁcient object trackers. Comprehensive experiments show that ourLightTrack is effective. It can ﬁnd trackers that achieve su-perior performance compared to handcrafted SOTA track-ers, such as SiamRPN++ [30] and Ocean [56], while us-ing much fewer model Flops and parameters. Moreover, when deployed on resource-constrained mobile chipsets, the discovered trackers run much faster. For example, onSnapdragon 845 Adreno GPU, LightTrack runs 12× faster than Ocean, while using 13× fewer parameters and 38× fewer Flops. Such improvements might narrow the gap be-tween academic models and industrial deployments in ob-ject tracking task. LightTrack is released at here.
