We present an efﬁcient high-resolution network, Lite-HRNet, for human pose estimation. We start by simply applying the efﬁcient shufﬂe block in ShufﬂeNet to HRNet (high-resolution network), yielding stronger performance over popular lightweight networks, such as MobileNet,ShufﬂeNet, and Small HRNet.We ﬁnd that the heavily-used pointwise (1 × 1) convo-lutions in shufﬂe blocks become the computational bottle-neck. We introduce a lightweight unit, conditional chan-nel weighting, to replace costly pointwise (1 × 1) convolu-tions in shufﬂe blocks. The complexity of channel weight-ing is linear w.r.t the number of channels and lower than the quadratic time complexity for pointwise convolutions.Our solution learns the weights from all the channels and over multiple resolutions that are readily available in the parallel branches in HRNet.It uses the weights as the bridge to exchange information across channels and res-olutions, compensating the role played by the pointwise (1 × 1) convolution. Lite-HRNet demonstrates superior re-sults on human pose estimation over popular lightweight networks. Moreover, Lite-HRNet can be easily applied to semantic segmentation task in the same lightweight man-ner. The code and models have been publicly available at https://github.com/HRNet/Lite-HRNet.
