Frame reconstruction (current or future frame) based onAuto-Encoder (AE) is a popular method for video anomaly detection. With models trained on the normal data, the re-construction errors of anomalous scenes are usually much larger than those of normal ones. Previous methods in-troduced the memory bank into AE, for encoding diverse normal patterns across the training videos. However, they are memory-consuming and cannot cope with unseen new scenarios in the testing data. In this work, we propose a dy-namic prototype unit (DPU) to encode the normal dynamics as prototypes in real time, free from extra memory cost. In addition, we introduce meta-learning to our DPU to form a novel few-shot normalcy learner, namely Meta-PrototypeUnit (MPU). It enables the fast adaption capability on new scenes by only consuming a few iterations of update. Ex-tensive experiments are conducted on various benchmarks.The superior performance over the state-of-the-art demon-strates the effectiveness of our method.
