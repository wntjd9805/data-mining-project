(a) Input image (b) Ground truthThe objective of this work is to segment high-resolution images without overloading GPU memory usage or losing the ﬁne details in the output segmentation map. The mem-ory constraint means that we must either downsample the big image or divide the image into local patches for sepa-rate processing. However, the former approach would lose the ﬁne details, while the latter can be ambiguous due to the lack of a global picture. In this work, we present Mag-Net, a multi-scale framework that resolves local ambigu-ity by looking at the image at multiple magniﬁcation levels.MagNet has multiple processing stages, where each stage corresponds to a magniﬁcation level, and the output of one stage is fed into the next stage for coarse-to-ﬁne information propagation. Each stage analyzes the image at a higher resolution than the previous stage, recovering the previ-ously lost details due to the lossy downsampling step, and the segmentation output is progressively reﬁned through the processing stages. Experiments on three high-resolution datasets of urban views, aerial scenes, and medical images show that MagNet consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a signiﬁcant margin.
