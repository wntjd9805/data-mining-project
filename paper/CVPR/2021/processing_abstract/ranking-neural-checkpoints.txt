This paper is concerned with ranking many pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs), called checkpoints, for the transfer learning to a downstream task. Thanks to the broad use of DNNs, we may easily collect hundreds of checkpoints from various sources. Which of them transfers the best to our downstream task of interest? Striving to answer this question thoroughly, we establish a neural checkpoint rank-ing benchmark (NeuCRaB) and study some intuitive rank-ing measures. These measures are generic, applying to the checkpoints of different output types without knowing how the checkpoints are pre-trained on which datasets. They also incur low computation cost, being practically mean-ingful. Our results suggest that the linear separability of the features extracted by the checkpoints is a strong indi-cator of transferability. We also arrive at a new ranking measure, N LEEP, which gives rise to the best performance in the experiments. Code will be made publicly available.
