Original LabelsTagsAttributesStylesRecently, image-to-image translation has made signiﬁ-cant progress in achieving both multi-label (i.e., translation conditioned on different labels) and multi-style (i.e., gener-ation with diverse styles) tasks. However, due to the unex-plored independence and exclusiveness in the labels, exist-ing endeavors are defeated by involving uncontrolled ma-nipulations to the translation results. In this paper, we pro-pose Hierarchical Style Disentanglement (HiSD) to address this issue. Speciﬁcally, we organize the labels into a hierar-chical tree structure, in which independent tags, exclusive attributes, and disentangled styles are allocated from top to bottom. Correspondingly, a new translation process is de-signed to adapt the above structure, in which the styles are identiﬁed for controllable translations. Both qualitative and quantitative results on the CelebA-HQ dataset verify the ability of the proposed HiSD. The code has been released at https://github.com/imlixinyang/HiSD.
