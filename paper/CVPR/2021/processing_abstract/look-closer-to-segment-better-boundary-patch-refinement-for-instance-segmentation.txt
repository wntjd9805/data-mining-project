Mask R-CNNOursTremendous efforts have been made on instance segmen-tation but the mask quality is still not satisfactory. The boundaries of predicted instance masks are usually impre-cise due to the low spatial resolution of feature maps and the imbalance problem caused by the extremely low proportion of boundary pixels. To address these issues, we propose a conceptually simple yet effective post-processing reﬁnement framework to improve the boundary quality based on the results of any instance segmentation model, termed BPR.Following the idea of looking closer to segment boundaries better, we extract and reﬁne a series of small boundary patches along the predicted instance boundaries. The re-ﬁnement is accomplished by a boundary patch reﬁnement network at higher resolution. The proposed BPR framework yields signiﬁcant improvements over the Mask R-CNN base-line on Cityscapes benchmark, especially on the boundary-aware metrics. Moreover, by applying the BPR framework to the “PolyTransform + SegFix” baseline, we reached 1st place on the Cityscapes leaderboard. Code is available at https://github.com/tinyalpha/BPR.
