Compositing an image usually inevitably suffers from inharmony problem that is mainly caused by incompat-ibility of foreground and background from two different images with distinct surfaces and lights, corresponding to material-dependent and light-dependent characteristics, namely, reﬂectance and illumination intrinsic images, re-spectively. Therefore, we seek to solve image harmoniza-tion via separable harmonization of reﬂectance and illu-mination, i.e., intrinsic image harmonization. Our method is based on an autoencoder that disentangles composite image into reﬂectance and illumination for further sepa-rate harmonization. Speciﬁcally, we harmonize reﬂectance through material-consistency penalty, while harmonize il-lumination by learning and transferring light from back-ground to foreground, moreover, we model patch relations between foreground and background of composite images in an inharmony-free learning way, to adaptively guide our intrinsic image harmonization. Both extensive exper-iments and ablation studies demonstrate the power of our method as well as the efﬁcacy of each component. We also contribute a new challenging dataset for benchmark-ing illumination harmonization. Code and dataset are at https://github.com/zhenglab/IntrinsicHarmony.
