Support Images Query ImagePredictionGround TruthConventional deep learning based methods for object de-tection require a large amount of bounding box annotations for training, which is expensive to obtain such high qual-ity annotated data. Few-shot object detection, which learns to adapt to novel classes with only a few annotated exam-ples, is very challenging since the ﬁne-grained feature of novel object can be easily overlooked with only a few data available. In this work, aiming to fully exploit features of annotated novel object and capture ﬁne-grained features of query object, we propose Dense Relation Distillation withContext-aware Aggregation (DCNet) to tackle the few-shot detection problem. Built on the meta-learning based frame-work, Dense Relation Distillation module targets at fully ex-ploiting support features, where support features and query feature are densely matched, covering all spatial locations in a feed-forward fashion. The abundant usage of the guid-ance information endows model the capability to handle common challenges such as appearance changes and oc-clusions. Moreover, to better capture scale-aware features,Context-aware Aggregation module adaptively harnesses features from different scales for a more comprehensive fea-ture representation. Extensive experiments illustrate that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results onPASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets. Code will be made available at https://github.com/hzhupku/DCNet.
