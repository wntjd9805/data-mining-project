Most works on person re-identiﬁcation (ReID) take ad-vantage of large backbone networks such as ResNet, which are designed for image classiﬁcation instead of ReID, for feature extraction. However, these backbones may not be computationally efﬁcient or the most suitable architectures for ReID. In this work, we aim to design a lightweight and suitable network for ReID. We propose a novel search space called Combined Depth Space (CDS), based on which we search for an efﬁcient network architecture, which we callCDNet, via a differentiable architecture search algorithm.Through the use of the combined basic building blocks inCDS, CDNet tends to focus on combined pattern informa-tion that is typically found in images of pedestrians. We then propose a low-cost search strategy named the Top-kSample Search strategy to make full use of the search space and avoid trapping in local optimal result. Furthermore, an effective Fine-grained Balance Neck (FBLNeck), which is removable at the inference time, is presented to balance the effects of triplet loss and softmax loss during the training process. Extensive experiments show that our CDNet (∼1.8M parameters) has comparable performance with state-of-the-art lightweight networks.
