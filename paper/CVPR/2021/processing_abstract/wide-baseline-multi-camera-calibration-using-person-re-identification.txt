We address the problem of estimating the 3D pose of a network of cameras for large-environment wide-baseline scenarios, e.g., cameras for construction sites, sports stadi-ums, and public spaces. This task is challenging since de-tecting and matching the same 3D keypoint observed from two very different camera views is difﬁcult, making standard structure-from-motion (SfM) pipelines inapplicable. In such circumstances, treating people in the scene as “keypoints” and associating them across different camera views can be an alternative method for obtaining correspondences.Based on this intuition, we propose a method that uses ideas from person re-identiﬁcation (re-ID) for wide-baseline cam-era calibration. Our method ﬁrst employs a re-ID method to associate human bounding boxes across cameras, then converts bounding box correspondences to point correspon-dences, and ﬁnally solves for camera pose using multi-view geometry and bundle adjustment. Since our method does not require specialized calibration targets except for visi-ble people, it applies to situations where frequent calibra-tion updates are required. We perform extensive experi-ments on datasets captured from scenes of different sizes (80m2, 350m2, 600m2), camera settings (indoor and out-door), and human activities (walking, playing basketball, construction). Experiment results show that our method achieves similar performance to standard SfM methods re-lying on manually labeled point correspondences.
