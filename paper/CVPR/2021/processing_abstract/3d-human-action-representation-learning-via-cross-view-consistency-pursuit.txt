In this work, we propose a Cross-view ContrastiveLearning framework for unsupervised 3D skeleton-based action Representation (CrosSCLR), by leveraging multi-view complementary supervision signal. CrosSCLR con-sists of both single-view contrastive learning (Skeleton-CLR) and cross-view consistent knowledge mining (CVC-KM) modules, integrated in a collaborative learning man-ner.It is noted that CVC-KM works in such a way that high-conÔ¨Ådence positive/negative samples and their dis-tributions are exchanged among views according to their embedding similarity, ensuring cross-view consistency in terms of contrastive context, i.e., similar distributions. Ex-tensive experiments show that CrosSCLR achieves remark-able action recognition results on NTU-60 and NTU-120 datasets under unsupervised settings, with observed higher-quality action representations.
