19.22 fpsMultiview shape-from-shading (SfS) has achieved high-detail geometry, but its computation is expensive for solv-ing a multiview registration and an ill-posed inverse ren-dering problem. Therefore, it has been mainly used for ofﬂine methods. Volumetric fusion enables real-time scan-ning using a conventional RGB-D camera, but its geom-etry resolution has been limited by the grid resolution of the volumetric distance ﬁeld and depth registration errors.In this paper, we propose a real-time scanning method that can acquire high-detail geometry by bridging volumet-ric fusion and multiview SfS in two steps. First, we pro-pose the ﬁrst real-time acquisition of photometric normals stored in texture space to achieve high-detail geometry. We also introduce geometry-aware texture mapping, which pro-gressively reﬁnes geometric registration between the texture space and the volumetric distance ﬁeld by means of normal texture, achieving real-time multiview SfS. We demonstrate our scanning of high-detail geometry using an RGB-D cam-era at ∼20 fps. Results verify that the geometry quality of our method is strongly competitive with that of ofﬂine multi-view SfS methods.
