Semi-supervised learning (SSL) is a key approach to-ward more data-efﬁcient machine learning by jointly lever-age both labeled and unlabeled data. We propose Al-phaMatch, an efﬁcient SSL method that leverages data aug-mentations, by efﬁciently enforcing the label consistency between the data points and the augmented data derived from them. Our key technical contribution lies on: 1) us-ing alpha-divergence to prioritize the regularization on data with high conﬁdence, achieving similar effect as FixMatch[32] but in a more ﬂexible fashion, and 2) proposing an optimization-based, EM-like algorithm to enforce the con-sistency, which enjoys better convergence than iterative reg-ularization procedures used in recent SSL methods such asFixMatch, UDA, and MixMatch. AlphaMatch is simple and easy to implement, and consistently outperforms prior arts on standard benchmarks, e.g. CIFAR-10, SVHN, CIFAR-100, STL-10. Speciﬁcally, we achieve 91.3% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 with just 4 labelled data per class, substan-tially improving over the previously best 88.7% accuracy achieved by FixMatch.
