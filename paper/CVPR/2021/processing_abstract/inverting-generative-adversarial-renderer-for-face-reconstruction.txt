Given a monocular face image as input, 3D face ge-ometry reconstruction aims to recover a corresponding 3D face mesh. Recently, both optimization-based and learning-based face reconstruction methods have taken advantage of the emerging differentiable renderer and shown promising results. However, the differentiable renderer, mainly based on graphics rules, simpliﬁes the realistic mechanism of the illumination, reﬂection, etc., of the real world, thus can-not produce realistic images. This brings a lot of domain-shift noise to the optimization or training process. In this work, we introduce a novel Generative Adversarial Ren-derer (GAR) and propose to tailor its inverted version to the general ﬁtting pipeline, to tackle the above problem.Speciﬁcally, the carefully designed neural renderer takes a face normal map and a latent code representing other fac-tors as inputs and renders a realistic face image. Since theGAR learns to model the complicated real-world image, in-stead of relying on the simpliﬁed graphics rules, it is ca-pable of producing realistic images, which essentially in-hibits the domain-shift noise in training and optimization.Equipped with the elaborated GAR, we further proposed a novel approach to predict 3D face parameters, in which weﬁrst obtain ﬁne initial parameters via Renderer Inverting and then reﬁne it with gradient-based optimizers. Exten-sive experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generative adversarial ren-derer and the novel optimization-based face reconstruction framework. Our method achieves state-of-the-art perfor-mances on multiple face reconstruction datasets.
