Humans have a natural instinct to identify unknown ob-ject instances in their environments. The intrinsic curiosity about these unknown instances aids in learning about them, when the corresponding knowledge is eventually available.This motivates us to propose a novel computer vision prob-lem called: ‘Open World Object Detection’, where a model is tasked to: 1) identify objects that have not been intro-duced to it as ‘unknown’, without explicit supervision to do so, and 2) incrementally learn these identiﬁed unknown cat-egories without forgetting previously learned classes, when the corresponding labels are progressively received. We formulate the problem, introduce a strong evaluation pro-tocol and provide a novel solution, which we call ORE:Open World Object Detector, based on contrastive cluster-ing and energy based unknown identiﬁcation. Our experi-mental evaluation and ablation studies analyse the efﬁcacy of ORE in achieving Open World objectives. As an interest-ing by-product, we ﬁnd that identifying and characterising unknown instances helps to reduce confusion in an incre-mental object detection setting, where we achieve state-of-the-art performance, with no extra methodological effort.We hope that our work will attract further research into this newly identiﬁed, yet crucial research direction.1
