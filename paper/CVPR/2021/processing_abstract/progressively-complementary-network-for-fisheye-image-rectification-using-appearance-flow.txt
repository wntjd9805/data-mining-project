Distortion rectiﬁcation is often required for ﬁsheye im-ages. The generation-based method is one mainstream solution due to its label-free property, but its naive skip-connection and overburdened decoder will cause blur and incomplete correction. First, the skip-connection directly transfers the image features, which may introduce distor-tion and cause incomplete correction. Second, the decoder is overburdened during simultaneously reconstructing the content and structure of the image, resulting in vague per-formance. To solve these two problems, in this paper, we focus on the interpretable correction mechanism of the dis-tortion rectiﬁcation network and propose a feature-level correction scheme. We embed a correction layer in skip-connection and leverage the appearance ﬂows in differen-t layers to pre-correct the image features. Consequently, the decoder can easily reconstruct a plausible result with the remaining distortion-less information. In addition, we propose a parallel complementary structure.It effective-ly reduces the burden of the decoder by separating content reconstruction and structure correction. Subjective and ob-jective experiment results on different datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.
