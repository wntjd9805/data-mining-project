For unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), to allevi-ate the effect of domain shift, many approaches align the source and target domains in the feature space by adversar-ial learning or by explicitly aligning their statistics. How-ever, the optimization objective of such domain alignment is generally not coordinated with that of the object clas-siﬁcation task itself such that their descent directions for optimization may be inconsistent. This will reduce the ef-fectiveness of domain alignment in improving the perfor-mance of UDA. In this paper, we aim to study and allevi-ate the optimization inconsistency problem between the do-main alignment and classiﬁcation tasks. We address this by proposing an effective meta-optimization based strategy dubbed MetaAlign, where we treat the domain alignment objective and the classiﬁcation objective as the meta-train and meta-test tasks in a meta-learning scheme. MetaAlign encourages both tasks to be optimized in a coordinated way, which maximizes the inner product of the gradients of the two tasks during training. Experimental results demon-strate the effectiveness of our proposed method on top of various alignment-based baseline approaches, for tasks of object classiﬁcation and object detection. MetaAlign helps achieve the state-of-the-art performance.
