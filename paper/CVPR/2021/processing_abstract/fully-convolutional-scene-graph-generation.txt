This paper presents a fully convolutional scene graph generation (FCSGG) model that detects objects and re-lations simultaneously. Most of the scene graph genera-tion frameworks use a pre-trained two-stage object detector, like Faster R-CNN, and build scene graphs using bound-ing box features. Such pipeline usually has a large number of parameters and low inference speed. Unlike these ap-proaches, FCSGG is a conceptually elegant and efﬁcient bottom-up approach that encodes objects as bounding box center points, and relationships as 2D vector ﬁelds which are named as Relation Afﬁnity Fields (RAFs). RAFs encode both semantic and spatial features, and explicitly represent the relationship between a pair of objects by the integral on a sub-region that points from subject to object. FCSGG only utilizes visual features and still generates strong results for scene graph generation. Comprehensive experiments on the Visual Genome dataset demonstrate the efﬁcacy, efﬁ-ciency, and generalizability of the proposed method. FC-SGG achieves highly competitive results on recall and zero-shot recall with signiﬁcantly reduced inference time.
