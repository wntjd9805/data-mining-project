In this paper, we study the semi-supervised semantic seg-mentation problem via exploring both labeled data and ex-tra unlabeled data. We propose a novel consistency regular-ization approach, called cross pseudo supervision (CPS).Our approach imposes the consistency on two segmenta-tion networks perturbed with different initialization for the same input image. The pseudo one-hot label map, output from one perturbed segmentation network, is used to su-pervise the other segmentation network with the standard cross-entropy loss, and vice versa. The CPS consistency has two roles: encourage high similarity between the predic-tions of two perturbed networks for the same input image, and expand training data by using the unlabeled data with pseudo labels. Experiment results show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation performance on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012.
