In this paper, we introduce NBNet, a novel framework for image denoising. Unlike previous works, we propose to tackle this challenging problem from a new perspective: noise reduction by image-adaptive projection. Speciﬁcally, we propose to train a network that can separate signal and noise by learning a set of reconstruction basis in the fea-ture space. Subsequently, image denosing can be achieved by selecting corresponding basis of the signal subspace and projecting the input into such space. Our key insight is that projection can naturally maintain the local structure of in-put signal, especially for areas with low light or weak tex-tures. Towards this end, we propose SSA, a non-local at-tention module we design to explicitly learn the basis gen-eration as well as subspace projection. We further incorpo-rate SSA with NBNet, a UNet structured network designed for end-to-end image denosing based. We conduct evalua-tions on benchmarks, including SIDD and DND, and NBNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on PSNR and SSIM with signiﬁcantly less computational cost.
