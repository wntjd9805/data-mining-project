We present a method to estimate an HDR environment map from a narrow ﬁeld-of-view LDR camera image in real-time. This enables perceptually appealing reﬂections and shading on virtual objects of any material ﬁnish, from mirror to diffuse, rendered into a real environment using augmented reality. Our method is based on our efﬁcient convolutional neural network, EnvMapNet, trained end-to-end with two novel losses, ProjectionLoss for the generated image, and ClusterLoss for adversarial training. Through qualitative and quantitative comparison to state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate that our algorithm reduces the directional error of estimated light sources by more than 50%, and achieves 3.7 times lower Frechet Inception Dis-tance (FID). We further showcase a mobile application that is able to run our neural network model in under 9 ms on an iPhone XS, and render in real-time, visually coherent vir-tual objects in previously unseen real-world environments.
