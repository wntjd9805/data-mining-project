We introduce Point2Skeleton, an unsupervised method to learn skeletal representations from point clouds. Exist-ing skeletonization methods are limited to tubular shapes and the stringent requirement of watertight input, while our method aims to produce more generalized skeletal represen-tations for complex structures and handle point clouds. Our key idea is to use the insights of the medial axis transform (MAT) to capture the intrinsic geometric and topological natures of the original input points. We ﬁrst predict a set of skeletal points by learning a geometric transformation, and then analyze the connectivity of the skeletal points to form skeletal mesh structures. Extensive evaluations and com-parisons show our method has superior performance and robustness. The learned skeletal representation will beneﬁt several unsupervised tasks for point clouds, such as surface reconstruction and segmentation.
