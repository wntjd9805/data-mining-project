Training: compute novel class representativesFew-shot instance segmentation methods are promising when labeled training data for novel classes is scarce. How-ever, current approaches do not facilitate ﬂexible addition of novel classes. They also require that examples of each class are provided at train and test time, which is memory inten-sive. In this paper, we address these limitations by present-ing the ﬁrst incremental approach to few-shot instance seg-mentation: iMTFA. We learn discriminative embeddings for object instances that are merged into class representatives.Storing embedding vectors rather than images effectively solves the memory overhead problem. We match these class embeddings at the RoI-level using cosine similarity. This allows us to add new classes without the need for further training or access to previous training data. In a series of experiments, we consistently outperform the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, the reduced memory requirements al-low us to evaluate, for the ﬁrst time, few-shot instance seg-mentation performance on all classes in COCO jointly1.
