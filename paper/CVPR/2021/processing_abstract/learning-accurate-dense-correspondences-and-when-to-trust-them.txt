Establishing dense correspondences between a pair of images is an important and general problem. However, dense ﬂow estimation is often inaccurate in the case of large displacements or homogeneous regions. For most appli-cations and down-stream tasks, such as pose estimation, image manipulation, or 3D reconstruction, it is crucial to know when and where to trust the estimated matches.In this work, we aim to estimate a dense ﬂow ﬁeld re-lating two images, coupled with a robust pixel-wise con-ﬁdence map indicating the reliability and accuracy of the prediction. We develop a ﬂexible probabilistic approach that jointly learns the ﬂow prediction and its uncertainty.In particular, we parametrize the predictive distribution as a constrained mixture model, ensuring better modelling of both accurate ﬂow predictions and outliers. Moreover, we develop an architecture and training strategy tailored for robust and generalizable uncertainty prediction in the con-text of self-supervised training. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on multiple challenging geometric match-ing and optical ﬂow datasets. We further validate the use-fulness of our probabilistic conﬁdence estimation for the task of pose estimation. Code and models are available at https://github.com/PruneTruong/PDCNet.
