Single image dehazing is a challenging ill-posed prob-lem due to the severe information degeneration. However, existing deep learning based dehazing methods only adopt clear images as positive samples to guide the training of de-hazing network while negative information is unexploited.Moreover, most of them focus on strengthening the dehaz-ing network with an increase of depth and width, leading to a signiﬁcant requirement of computation and memory. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive regularization (CR) built upon contrastive learning to exploit both the in-formation of hazy images and clear images as negative and positive samples, respectively. CR ensures that the restored image is pulled to closer to the clear image and pushed to far away from the hazy image in the representation space.Furthermore, considering trade-off between perfor-mance and memory storage, we develop a compact dehaz-ing network based on autoencoder-like (AE) framework. It involves an adaptive mixup operation and a dynamic fea-ture enhancement module, which can beneﬁt from preserv-ing information ﬂow adaptively and expanding the receptiveﬁeld to improve the network’s transformation capability, re-spectively. We term our dehazing network with autoencoder and contrastive regularization as AECR-Net. The extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demon-strate that our AECR-Net surpass the state-of-the-art ap-proaches. The code is released in https://github. com/GlassyWu/AECR-Net.
