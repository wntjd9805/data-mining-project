Point clouds produced by 3D scanning are often sparse, non-uniform, and noisy. Recent upsampling approaches aim to generate a dense point set, while achieving both distribution uniformity and proximity-to-surface, and pos-sibly amending small holes, all in a single network. Af-ter revisiting the task, we propose to disentangle the task based on its multi-objective nature and formulate two cas-caded sub-networks, a dense generator and a spatial re-ﬁner. The dense generator infers a coarse but dense out-put that roughly describes the underlying surface, while the spatial reﬁner further ﬁne-tunes the coarse output by ad-justing the location of each point. Speciﬁcally, we design a pair of local and global reﬁnement units in the spatial reﬁner to evolve a coarse feature map. Also, in the spa-tial reﬁner, we regress a per-point offset vector to further adjust the coarse outputs in ﬁne scale. Extensive quali-tative and quantitative results on both synthetic and real-scanned datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over the state-of-the-arts.
