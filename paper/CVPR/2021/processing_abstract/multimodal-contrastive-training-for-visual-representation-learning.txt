Label SupervisionSelf SupervisionProxy Tasks e.g. Bi-captioningWe develop an approach to learning visual representa-tions that embraces multimodal data, driven by a combi-nation of intra- and inter-modal similarity preservation ob-jectives. Unlike existing visual pre-training methods, which solve a proxy prediction task in a single domain, our method exploits intrinsic data properties within each modality and semantic information from cross-modal correlation simulta-neously, hence improving the quality of learned visual rep-resentations. By including multimodal training in a uni-ﬁed framework with different types of contrastive losses, our method can learn more powerful and generic visual features. We ﬁrst train our model on COCO and evaluate the learned visual representations on various downstream tasks including image classiﬁcation, object detection, and instance segmentation. For example, the visual represen-tations pre-trained on COCO by our method achieve state-of-the-art top-1 validation accuracy of 55.3% on ImageNet classiﬁcation, under the common transfer protocol. We also evaluate our method on the large-scale Stock images dataset and show its effectiveness on multi-label image tag-ging, and cross-modal retrieval tasks.
