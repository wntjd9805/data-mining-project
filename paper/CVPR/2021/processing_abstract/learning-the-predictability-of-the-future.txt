We introduce a framework for learning from unlabeled video what is predictable in the future. Instead of commit-ting up front to features to predict, our approach learns from data which features are predictable. Based on the observa-tion that hyperbolic geometry naturally and compactly en-codes hierarchical structure, we propose a predictive model in hyperbolic space. When the model is most conﬁdent, it will predict at a concrete level of the hierarchy, but when the model is not conﬁdent, it learns to automatically select a higher level of abstraction. Experiments on two estab-lished datasets show the key role of hierarchical representa-tions for action prediction. Although our representation is trained with unlabeled video, visualizations show that ac-tion hierarchies emerge in the representation.
