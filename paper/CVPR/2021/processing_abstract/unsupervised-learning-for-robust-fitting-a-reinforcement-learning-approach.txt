Robust model ﬁtting is a core algorithm in a large num-ber of computer vision applications. Solving this prob-lem efﬁciently for datasets highly contaminated with out-liers is, however, still challenging due to the underlying computational complexity. Recent literature has focused on learning-based algorithms. However, most approaches are supervised (which require a large amount of labelled training data). In this paper, we introduce a novel unsuper-vised learning framework that learns to directly solve robust model ﬁtting. Unlike other methods, our work is agnostic to the underlying input features, and can be easily gener-alized to a wide variety of LP-type problems with quasi-convex residuals. We empirically show that our method out-performs existing unsupervised learning approaches, and achieves competitive results compared to traditional meth-ods on several important computer vision problems1.
