This paper is about action segmentation under weak su-pervision in training, where the ground truth provides only a set of actions present, but neither their temporal ordering nor when they occur in a training video. We use a Hid-den Markov Model (HMM) grounded on a multilayer per-ceptron (MLP) to label video frames, and thus generate a pseudo-ground truth for the subsequent pseudo-supervised training. In testing, a Monte Carlo sampling of action sets seen in training is used to generate candidate temporal se-quences of actions, and select the maximum posterior se-quence. Our key contribution is a new anchor-constrainedViterbi algorithm (ACV) for generating the pseudo-ground truth, where anchors are salient action parts estimated for each action from a given ground-truth set. Our evalua-tion on the tasks of action segmentation and alignment on the benchmark Breakfast, MPII Cooking2, Hollywood Ex-tended datasets demonstrates our superior performance rel-ative to that of prior work.
