Deep learning methods have been widely applied to au-tomatic facial action unit (AU) intensity estimation and achieved the state-of-the-art performance. These methods, however, are mostly appearance-based and fail to exploit the underlying structural information among AUs. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic probabilistic graph con-volution (DPG) model to simultaneously exploit AU appear-ances, AU dynamics, and their semantic structural depen-dencies for AU intensity estimation. Firstly, we propose to use Bayesian Network to capture the inherent dependencies among AUs. Secondly, we introduce probabilistic graph convolution that allows to perform graph convolution on the distribution of Bayesian Network structure to extractAU structural features. Finally, we introduce a dynamic deep model based on LSTM to simultaneously combine AU appearance features, AU dynamic features, and AU struc-tural features for AU intensity estimation. In experiments, our method achieves comparable and even better perfor-mance with the state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark facial AU intensity estimation databases, i.e., FERA 2015 and DISFA.
