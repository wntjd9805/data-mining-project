Visual Emotion Analysis (VEA) has attracted increas-ing attention recently with the prevalence of sharing images on social networks. Since human emotions are ambiguous and subjective, it is more reasonable to address VEA in a label distribution learning (LDL) paradigm rather than a single-label classiﬁcation task. Different from other LDL tasks, there exist intrinsic relationships between emotions and unique characteristics within them, as demonstrated in psychological theories. Inspired by this, we propose a well-grounded circular-structured representation to utilize the prior knowledge for visual emotion distribution learn-ing. To be speciﬁc, we ﬁrst construct an Emotion Circle to unify any emotional state within it. On the proposed Emo-tion Circle, each emotion distribution is represented with an emotion vector, which is deﬁned with three attributes (i.e., emotion polarity, emotion type, emotion intensity) as well as two properties (i.e., similarity, additivity). Besides, we design a novel Progressive Circular (PC) loss to penalize the dissimilarities between predicted emotion vector and la-beled one in a coarse-to-ﬁne manner, which further boosts the learning process in an emotion-speciﬁc way. Extensive experiments and comparisons are conducted on public vi-sual emotion distribution datasets, and the results demon-strate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
