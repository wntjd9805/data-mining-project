Trafﬁc event cognition and reasoning in videos is an im-portant task that has a wide range of applications in in-telligent transportation, assisted driving, and autonomous vehicles. In this paper, we create a novel dataset, SUTD-TrafﬁcQA (Trafﬁc Question Answering), which takes the form of video QA based on the collected 10,080 in-the-wild videos and annotated 62,535 QA pairs, for benchmarking the cognitive capability of causal inference and event under-standing models in complex trafﬁc scenarios. Speciﬁcally, we propose 6 challenging reasoning tasks corresponding to various trafﬁc scenarios, so as to evaluate the reasoning capability over different kinds of complex yet practical traf-ﬁc events. Moreover, we propose Eclipse, a novel Efﬁcient glimpse network via dynamic inference, in order to achieve computation-efﬁcient and reliable video reasoning. The ex-periments show that our method achieves superior perfor-mance while reducing the computation cost signiﬁcantly.The project page: https://github.com/SUTDCV/SUTD-TrafficQA.
