An emerging line of research has found that spherical spaces better match the underlying geometry of facial im-ages, as evidenced by the state-of-the-art facial recognition methods which beneﬁt empirically from spherical represen-tations. Yet, these approaches rely on deterministic embed-dings and hence suffer from the feature ambiguity dilemma, whereby ambiguous or noisy images are mapped into poorly learned regions of representation space, leading to inaccu-racies. Probabilistic Face Embeddings (PFE) [17] is theﬁrst attempt to address this dilemma. However, we theo-retically and empirically identify two main failures of PFE when it is applied to spherical deterministic embeddings aforementioned. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for face conﬁdence learning in spherical space. Mathematically, we extend the von MisesFisher density to its r-radius counterpart and derive a new optimization objective in closed form. Theoretically, the proposed probabilistic framework provably allows for bet-ter interpretability, leading to principled feature compari-son and pooling. Extensive experimental results on multiple challenging benchmarks conﬁrm our hypothesis and theory, and showcase the advantages of our framework over prior probabilistic methods and spherical deterministic embed-dings in various face recognition tasks.
