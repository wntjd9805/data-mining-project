Differential Neural Architecture Search (NAS) requires all layer choices to be held in memory simultaneously; this limits the size of both search space and ﬁnal architecture. In contrast, Probabilistic NAS, such as PARSEC, learns a distri-bution over high-performing architectures, and uses only as much memory as needed to train a single model. Neverthe-less, it needs to sample many architectures, making it com-putationally expensive for searching in an extensive space.To solve these problems, we propose a sampling method adaptive to the distribution entropy, drawing more samples to encourage explorations at the beginning, and reducing samples as learning proceeds. Furthermore, to search fast in the multi-variate space, we propose a coarse-to-ﬁne strategy by using a factorized distribution at the beginning which can reduce the number of architecture parameters by over an order of magnitude. We call this method Fast ProbabilisticNAS (FP-NAS). Compared with PARSEC, it can sample 64% fewer architectures and search 2.1× faster. Compared withFBNetV2, FP-NAS is 1.9× - 3.5× faster, and the searched models outperform FBNetV2 models on ImageNet. FP-NAS allows us to expand the giant FBNetV2 space to be wider (i.e. larger channel choices) and deeper (i.e. more blocks), while adding Split-Attention block and enabling the search over the number of splits. When searching a model of size 0.4G FLOPS, FP-NAS is 132× faster than EfﬁcientNet, and the searched FP-NAS-L0 model outperforms EfﬁcientNet-B0 by 0.7% accuracy. Without using any architecture surrogate or scaling tricks, we directly search large models up to 1.0GFLOPS. Our FP-NAS-L2 model with simple distillation out-performs BigNAS-XL with advanced inplace distillation by 0.7% accuracy using similar FLOPS.
