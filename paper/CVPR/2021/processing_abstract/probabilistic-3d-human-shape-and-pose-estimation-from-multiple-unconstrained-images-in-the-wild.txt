This paper addresses the problem of 3D human body shape and pose estimation from RGB images. Recent progress in this ﬁeld has focused on single images, video or multi-view images as inputs. In contrast, we propose a new task: shape and pose estimation from a group of multi-ple images of a human subject, without constraints on sub-ject pose, camera viewpoint or background conditions be-tween images in the group. Our solution to this task predicts distributions over SMPL body shape and pose parameters conditioned on the input images in the group. We proba-bilistically combine predicted body shape distributions from each image to obtain a ﬁnal multi-image shape prediction.We show that the additional body shape information present in multi-image input groups improves 3D human shape es-timation metrics compared to single-image inputs on theSSP-3D dataset and a private dataset of tape-measured hu-mans. In addition, predicting distributions over 3D bodies allows us to quantify pose prediction uncertainty, which is useful when faced with challenging input images with sig-niﬁcant occlusion. Our method demonstrates meaningful pose uncertainty on the 3DPW dataset and is competitive with the state-of-the-art in terms of pose estimation metrics.
