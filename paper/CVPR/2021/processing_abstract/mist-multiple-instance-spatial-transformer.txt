We propose a deep network that can be trained to tackle image reconstruction and classiﬁcation problems that in-volve detection of multiple object instances, without any su-pervision regarding their whereabouts. The network learns to extract the most signiﬁcant K patches, and feeds these patches to a task-speciﬁc network – e.g., auto-encoder or classiﬁer – to solve a domain speciﬁc problem. The chal-lenge in training such a network is the non-differentiable top-K selection process. To address this issue, we lift the training optimization problem by treating the result of top-K selection as a slack variable, resulting in a simple, yet ef-fective, multi-stage training. Our method is able to learn to detect recurring structures in the training dataset by learning to reconstruct images. It can also learn to localize struc-tures when only knowledge on the occurrence of the object is provided, and in doing so it outperforms the state-of-the-art.Code available at https://github.com/ubc-vision/mist
