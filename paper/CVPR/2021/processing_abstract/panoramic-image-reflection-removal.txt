Although a partial view of the reﬂection scene is included in the panoramic image, it cannot be utilized directly due to its misalignment with the reﬂection-contaminated image. We propose a two-step approach to solve this problem, by ﬁrst accomplishing geometric and photometric alignment for the reﬂection scene via a coarse-to-ﬁne strategy, and then restoring the transmission scene via a recovery network.The proposed method is trained with a synthetic dataset and veriﬁed quantitatively with a real panoramic image dataset.The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by the signiﬁcant performance advantage over single image-based reﬂection removal methods and generalization capacity to limited-FoV scenarios captured by conventional camera or mobile phone users.
