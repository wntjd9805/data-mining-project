Data augmentation (DA) is an essential technique for training state-of-the-art deep learning systems. In this pa-per, we empirically show that the standard data augmen-tation methods may introduce distribution shift and conse-quently hurt the performance on unaugmented data during inference. To alleviate this issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach, dubbed KeepAugment, to increase theﬁdelity of augmented images. The idea is to use the saliency map to detect important regions on the original images and preserve these informative regions during augmentation.This information-preserving strategy allows us to generate more faithful training examples. Empirically, we demon-strate that our method signiﬁcantly improves upon a num-ber of prior art data augmentation schemes, e.g. AutoAug-ment, Cutout, random erasing, achieving promising results on image classiﬁcation, semi-supervised image classiﬁca-tion, multi-view multi-camera tracking and object detection.
