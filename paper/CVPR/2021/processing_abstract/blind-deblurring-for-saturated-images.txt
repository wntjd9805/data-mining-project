Blind deblurring has received considerable attention in recent years. However, state-of-the-art methods often fail to process saturated blurry images. The main reason is that pixels around saturated regions are not conforming to the commonly used linear blur model. Pioneer arts sug-gest excluding these pixels during the deblurring process, which sometimes simultaneously removes the informative edges around saturated regions and results in insufﬁcient information for kernel estimation when large saturated re-gions exist. To address this problem, we introduce a new blur model to ﬁt both saturated and unsaturated pixels, and all informative pixels can be considered during the deblur-ring process. Based on our model, we develop an effec-tive maximum a posterior (MAP)-based optimization frame-work. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on bench-mark datasets and challenging real-world examples show that the proposed method performs favorably against exist-ing methods.
