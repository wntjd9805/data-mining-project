Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has at-tracted extensive attention due to its efﬁciency in searching for cell structures. DARTS mainly focuses on the opera-tion search and derives the cell topology from the operation weights. However, the operation weights can not indicate the importance of cell topology and result in poor topology rating correctness. To tackle this, we propose to Decouple the Operation and Topology Search (DOTS), which decou-ples the topology representation from operation weights and makes an explicit topology search. DOTS is achieved by introducing a topology search space that contains combi-nations of candidate edges. The proposed search space directly reﬂects the search objective and can be easily ex-tended to support a ﬂexible number of edges in the searched cell. Existing gradient-based NAS methods can be incor-porated into DOTS for further improvement by the topol-ogy search. Considering that some operations (e.g., Skip-Connection) can affect the topology, we propose a group operation search scheme to preserve topology-related oper-ations for a better topology search. The experiments on CI-FAR10/100 and ImageNet demonstrate that DOTS is an ef-fective solution for differentiable NAS. The code is released at https://github.com/guyuchao/DOTS.
