Improving the performance of face forgery detectors often requires more identity-swapped images of higher-quality. One core objective of identity swapping is to gener-ate identity-discriminative faces that are distinct from the target while identical to the source. To this end, prop-erly disentangling identity and identity-irrelevant informa-tion is critical and remains a challenging endeavor. In this work, we propose a novel information disentangling and swapping network, called InfoSwap, to extract the most expressive information for identity representation from a pre-trained face recognition model. The key insight of our method is to formulate the learning of disentangled repre-sentations as optimizing an information bottleneck trade-off, in terms of Ô¨Ånding an optimal compression of the pre-trained latent features. Moreover, a novel identity con-trastive loss is proposed for further disentanglement by re-quiring a proper distance between the generated identity and the target. While the most prior works have focused on using various loss functions to implicitly guide the learn-ing of representations, we demonstrate that our model can provide explicit supervision for learning disentangled rep-resentations, achieving impressive performance in generat-ing more identity-discriminative swapped faces.
