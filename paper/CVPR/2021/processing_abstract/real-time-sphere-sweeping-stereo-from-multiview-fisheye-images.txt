A set of cameras with ﬁsheye lenses have been used to capture a wide ﬁeld of view. The traditional scan-line stereo algorithms based on epipolar geometry are directly inap-plicable to this non-pinhole camera setup due to optical characteristics of ﬁsheye lenses; hence, existing complete 360◦ RGB-D imaging systems have rarely achieved real-time performance yet. In this paper, we introduce an efﬁ-cient sphere-sweeping stereo that can run directly on multi-view ﬁsheye images without requiring additional spherical rectiﬁcation. Our main contributions are: First, we intro-duce an adaptive spherical matching method that accounts for each input ﬁsheye camera’s resolving power concerning spherical distortion. Second, we propose a fast inter-scale bilateral cost volume ﬁltering method that reﬁnes distance in noisy and textureless regions with optimal complexity ofO(n). It enables real-time dense distance estimation while preserving edges. Lastly, the ﬁsheye color and distance im-ages are seamlessly combined into a complete 360◦ RGB-D image via fast inpainting of the dense distance map. We demonstrate an embedded 360◦ RGB-D imaging prototype composed of a mobile GPU and four ﬁsheye cameras. Our prototype is capable of capturing complete 360◦ RGB-D videos with a resolution of two megapixels at 29 fps. Re-sults demonstrate that our real-time method outperforms traditional omnidirectional stereo and learning-based om-nidirectional stereo in terms of accuracy and performance.
