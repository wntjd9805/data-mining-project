This paper introduces a new fundamental characteris-tic, i.e., the dynamic range, from real-world metric tools to deep visual recognition. In metrology, the dynamic range is a basic quality of a metric tool, indicating its ﬂexibil-ity to accommodate various scales. Larger dynamic range offers higher ﬂexibility.In visual recognition, the multi-ple scale problem also exist. Different visual concepts may have different semantic scales. For example, “Animal” and“Plants” have a large semantic scale while “Elk” has a much smaller one. Under a small semantic scale, two dif-ferent elks may look quite different to each other . However, under a large semantic scale (e.g., animals and plants), these two elks should be measured as being similar.Introducing the dynamic range to deep metric learning, we get a novel computer vision task, i.e., the Dynamic Met-ric Learning.It aims to learn a scalable metric space to accommodate visual concepts across multiple semantic scales. Based on three types of images, i.e., vehicle, an-imal and online products, we construct three datasets forDynamic Metric Learning. We benchmark these datasets with popular deep metric learning methods and ﬁnd Dy-namic Metric Learning to be very challenging. The major difﬁculty lies in a conﬂict between different scales: the dis-criminative ability under a small scale usually compromises the discriminative ability under a large one, and vice versa.As a minor contribution, we propose Cross-Scale Learning (CSL) to alleviate such conﬂict. We show that CSL con-sistently improves the baseline on all the three datasets.The datasets and the code will be publicly available at https://github.com/SupetZYK/DynamicMetricLearning.
