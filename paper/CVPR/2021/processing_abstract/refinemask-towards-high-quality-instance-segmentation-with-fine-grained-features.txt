The two-stage methods for instance segmentation, e.g.Mask R-CNN, have achieved excellent performance re-cently. However, the segmented masks are still very coarse due to the downsampling operations in both the feature pyramid and the instance-wise pooling process, especially for large objects. In this work, we propose a new method called ReﬁneMask for high-quality instance segmentation of objects and scenes, which incorporates ﬁne-grained fea-tures during the instance-wise segmenting process in a multi-stage manner. Through fusing more detailed informa-tion stage by stage, ReﬁneMask is able to reﬁne high-quality masks consistently. ReﬁneMask succeeds in segmenting hard cases such as bent parts of objects that are over-smoothed by most previous methods and outputs accurate boundaries. Without bells and whistles, ReﬁneMask yields signiﬁcant gains of 2.6, 3.4, 3.8 AP over Mask R-CNN onCOCO, LVIS, and Cityscapes benchmarks respectively at a small amount of additional computational cost. Further-more, our single-model result outperforms the winner of theLVIS Challenge 2020 by 1.3 points on the LVIS test-dev set and establishes a new state-of-the-art.
