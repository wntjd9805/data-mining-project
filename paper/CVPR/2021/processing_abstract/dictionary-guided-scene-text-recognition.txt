Language prior plays an important role in the way hu-mans detect and recognize text in the wild. Current scene text recognition methods do use lexicons to improve recog-nition performance, but their naive approach of casting the output into a dictionary word based purely on the edit dis-tance has many limitations. In this paper, we present a novel approach to incorporate a dictionary in both the training and inference stage of a scene text recognition system. We use the dictionary to generate a list of possible outcomes and Ô¨Ånd the one that is most compatible with the visual ap-pearance of the text. The proposed method leads to a ro-bust scene text recognition model, which is better at han-dling ambiguous cases encountered in the wild, and im-proves the overall performance of state-of-the-art scene text spotting frameworks. Our work suggests that incorporating language prior is a potential approach to advance scene text detection and recognition methods. Besides, we con-tribute VinText, a challenging scene text dataset for Viet-namese, where some characters are equivocal in the vi-sual form due to accent symbols. This dataset will serve as a challenging benchmark for measuring the applicabil-ity and robustness of scene text detection and recognition algorithms.
