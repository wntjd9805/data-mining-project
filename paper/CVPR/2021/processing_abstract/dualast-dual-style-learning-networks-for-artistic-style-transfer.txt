Artistic style transfer is an image editing task that aims at repainting everyday photographs with learned artistic styles. Existing methods learn styles from either a single style example or a collection of artworks. Accordingly, the stylization results are either inferior in visual quality or limited in style controllability. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Dual Style-Learning Artistic Style Trans-fer (DualAST) framework to learn simultaneously both the holistic artist-style (from a collection of artworks) and the speciﬁc artwork-style (from a single style image): the artist-style sets the tone (i.e., the overall feeling) for the stylized image, while the artwork-style determines the details of the stylized image, such as color and texture. Moreover, we in-* Corresponding author troduce a Style-Control Block (SCB) to adjust the styles of generated images with a set of learnable style-control fac-tors. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the per-formance of the proposed framework, the results of which conﬁrm the superiority of our method.
