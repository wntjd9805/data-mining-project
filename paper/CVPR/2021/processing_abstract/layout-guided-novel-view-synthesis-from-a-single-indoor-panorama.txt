To tackle this challenging problem, we ﬁrst useConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to extract the deep features and estimate the depth map from the source-view image. Then, we leverage the room layout prior, a strong structural constraint of the indoor scene, to guide the gen-eration of target views. More concretely, we estimate the room layout in the source view and transform it into the target viewpoint as guidance. Meanwhile, we also con-strain the room layout of the generated target-view images to enforce geometric consistency. To validate the effective-ness of our method, we further build a large-scale photo-realistic dataset containing both small and large camera translations. The experimental results on our challeng-ing dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The project page is at https://github.com/bluestyle97/PNVS.
