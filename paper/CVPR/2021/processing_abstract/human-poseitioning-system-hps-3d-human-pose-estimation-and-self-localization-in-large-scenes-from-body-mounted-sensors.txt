We introduce (HPS) Human POSEitioning System, a method to recover the full 3D pose of a human registered with a 3D scan of the surrounding environment using wear-able sensors. Using IMUs attached at the body limbs and a head mounted camera looking outwards, HPS fuses cam-era based self-localization with IMU-based human body tracking. The former provides drift-free but noisy position and orientation estimates while the latter is accurate in the short-term but subject to drift over longer periods of time.We show that our optimization-based integration exploits the beneﬁts of the two, resulting in pose accuracy free of drift. Furthermore, we integrate 3D scene constraints into our optimization, such as foot contact with the ground, re-sulting in physically plausible motion. HPS complements more common third-person-based 3D pose estimation meth-ods.It allows capturing larger recording volumes and longer periods of motion, and could be used for VR/AR ap-* Joint ﬁrst authors with equal contribution. plications where humans interact with the scene without re-quiring direct line of sight with an external camera, or to train agents that navigate and interact with the environment based on ﬁrst-person visual input, like real humans.With HPS, we recorded a dataset of humans interact-ing with large 3D scenes (300-1000 m2) consisting of 7 subjects and more than 3 hours of diverse motion. The dataset, code and video will be available on the project page: http://virtualhumans.mpi-inf.mpg.de/hps/.
