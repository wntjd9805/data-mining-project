In recent years, Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) has become an indispensable part of the face recognition system to guarantee the stability and reliability of recogni-tion performance in an unconstrained scenario. For this purpose, the FIQA method should consider both the in-trinsic property and the recognizability of the face image.Most previous works aim to estimate the sample-wise em-bedding uncertainty or pair-wise similarity as the quality score, which only considers the partial information from the intra-class. However, these methods ignore the valuable in-formation from the inter-class, which is for estimating the recognizability of face image. In this work, we argue that a high-quality face image should be similar to its intra-class samples and dissimilar to its inter-class samples. Thus, we propose a novel unsupervised FIQA method that incorpo-rates Similarity Distribution Distance for Face Image Qual-ity Assessment (SDD-FIQA). Our method generates qual-ity pseudo-labels by calculating the Wasserstein Distance (WD) between the intra-class and inter-class similarity dis-tributions. With these quality pseudo-labels, we are capa-ble of training a regression network for quality prediction.Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed SDD-FIQA surpasses the state-of-the-arts by an impressive margin. Meanwhile, our method shows good generalization across different recognition systems.
