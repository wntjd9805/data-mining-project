Previous approaches to generate shapes in a 3D setting train a GAN on the latent space of an autoencoder (AE).Even though this produces convincing results, it has two major shortcomings. As the GAN is limited to reproduce the dataset the AE was trained on, we cannot reuse a trainedAE for novel data. Furthermore, it is difÔ¨Åcult to add spa-tial supervision into the generation process, as the AE only gives us a global representation. To remedy these issues, we propose to train the GAN on grids (i.e. each cell cov-ers a part of a shape). In this representation each cell is equipped with a latent vector provided by an AE. This local-ized representation enables more expressiveness (since the cell-based latent vectors can be combined in novel ways) as well as spatial control of the generation process (e.g. via bounding boxes). Our method outperforms the current state of the art on all established evaluation measures, proposed for quantitatively evaluating the generative capabilities ofGANs. We show limitations of these measures and propose the adaptation of a robust criterion from statistical analysis as an alternative.
