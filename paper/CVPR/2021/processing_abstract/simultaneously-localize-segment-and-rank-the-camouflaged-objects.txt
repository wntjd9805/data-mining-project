Camouﬂage is a key defence mechanism across species that is critical to survival. Common strategies for camou-ﬂage include background matching, imitating the color and pattern of the environment, and disruptive coloration, dis-guising body outlines [37]. Camouﬂaged object detection (COD) aims to segment camouﬂaged objects hiding in their surroundings. Existing COD models are built upon binary ground truth to segment the camouﬂaged objects without illustrating the level of camouﬂage. In this paper, we re-visit this task and argue that explicitly modeling the con-spicuousness of camouﬂaged objects against their particu-lar backgrounds can not only lead to a better understand-ing about camouﬂage and evolution of animals, but also provide guidance to design more sophisticated camouﬂage techniques. Furthermore, we observe that it is some speciﬁc parts of the camouﬂaged objects that make them detectable by predators. With the above understanding about camou-ﬂaged objects, we present the ﬁrst ranking based COD net-work (Rank-Net) to simultaneously localize, segment and rank camouﬂaged objects. The localization model is pro-posed to ﬁnd the discriminative regions that make the cam-ouﬂaged object obvious. The segmentation model segments the full scope of the camouﬂaged objects. Further, the rank-ing model infers the detectability of different camouﬂaged objects. Moreover, we contribute a large COD testing set to evaluate the generalization ability of COD models. Exper-imental results show that our model achieves new state-of-the-art, leading to a more interpretable COD network1.
