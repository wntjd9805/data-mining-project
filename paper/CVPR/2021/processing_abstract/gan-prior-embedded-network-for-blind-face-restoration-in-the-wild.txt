Blind face restoration (BFR) from severely degraded face images in the wild is a very challenging problem. Due to the high illness of the problem and the complex unknown degradation, directly training a deep neural network (DNN) usually cannot lead to acceptable results. Existing genera-tive adversarial network (GAN) based methods can produce better results but tend to generate over-smoothed restora-tions. In this work, we propose a new method by ﬁrst learn-ing a GAN for high-quality face image generation and em-bedding it into a U-shaped DNN as a prior decoder, thenﬁne-tuning the GAN prior embedded DNN with a set of synthesized low-quality face images. The GAN blocks are designed to ensure that the latent code and noise input to the GAN can be respectively generated from the deep and shallow features of the DNN, controlling the global face structure, local face details and background of the recon-structed image. The proposed GAN prior embedded net-work (GPEN) is easy-to-implement, and it can generate visually photo-realistic results. Our experiments demon-strated that the proposed GPEN achieves signiﬁcantly su-perior results to state-of-the-art BFR methods both quan-titatively and qualitatively, especially for the restoration of severely degraded face images in the wild.
