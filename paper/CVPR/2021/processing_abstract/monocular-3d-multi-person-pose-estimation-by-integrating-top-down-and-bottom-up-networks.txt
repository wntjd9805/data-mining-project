Frame 140Frame 150Frame 180In monocular video 3D multi-person pose estimation, inter-person occlusion and close interactions can cause hu-man detection to be erroneous and human-joints grouping to be unreliable. Existing top-down methods rely on hu-man detection and thus suffer from these problems. Ex-isting bottom-up methods do not use human detection, but they process all persons at once at the same scale, caus-ing them to be sensitive to multiple-persons scale varia-tions. To address these challenges, we propose the integra-tion of top-down and bottom-up approaches to exploit their strengths. Our top-down network estimates human joints from all persons instead of one in an image patch, making it robust to possible erroneous bounding boxes. Our bottom-up network incorporates human-detection based normal-ized heatmaps, allowing the network to be more robust in handling scale variations. Finally, the estimated 3D poses from the top-down and bottom-up networks are fed into our integration network for Ô¨Ånal 3D poses. Besides the inte-gration of top-down and bottom-up networks, unlike exist-ing pose discriminators that are designed solely for a sin-gle person, and consequently cannot assess natural inter-person interactions, we propose a two-person pose discrim-inator that enforces natural two-person interactions. Lastly, we also apply a semi-supervised method to overcome the 3D ground-truth data scarcity. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show the effectiveness of the proposed method.Our code is available publicly. 1
