Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which ded-icates to transfer the knowledge learned from multiple source domains to an unlabeled target domain, has drawn increasing attention in the research community. By assum-ing that the source and target domains share consistent key feature representations and identical label space, existing studies on MSDA typically utilize the entire union set of fea-tures from both the source and target domains to obtain the feature map and align the map for each category and do-main. However, the default setting of MSDA may neglect the issue of “partialness”, i.e., 1) a part of the features con-tained in the union set of multiple source domains may not present in the target domain; 2) the label space of the tar-get domain may not completely overlap with the multiple source domains. In this paper, we unify the above two cases to a more generalized MSDA task as Multi-Source PartialDomain Adaptation (MSPDA). We propose a novel model termed Partial Feature Selection and Alignment (PFSA) to jointly cope with both MSDA and MSPDA tasks. Speciﬁ-cally, we ﬁrstly employ a feature selection vector based on the correlation among the features of multiple sources and target domains. We then design three effective feature align-ment losses to jointly align the selected features by preserv-ing the domain information of the data sample clusters in the same category and the discrimination between differ-ent classes. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets for both MSDA and MSPDA tasks demonstrate that our proposed PFSA approach remarkably outperforms the state-of-the-art MSDA and unimodal PDA methods.
