Instance segmentation, the task of identifying and sep-arating each individual object of interest in the image, is one of the actively studied research topics in computer vi-sion. Although many feed-forward networks produce high-quality binary segmentation on different types of images, their ﬁnal result heavily relies on the post-processing step, which separates instances from the binary mask. In com-parison, the existing iterative methods extract a single ob-ject at a time using discriminative knowledge-based proper-ties (e.g., shapes, boundaries, etc.) without relying on post-processing. However, they do not scale well with a large number of objects. To exploit the advantages of conven-tional sequential segmentation methods without impairing the scalability, we propose a novel iterative deep reinforce-ment learning agent that learns how to differentiate multiple objects in parallel. By constructing a relational graph be-tween pixels, we design a reward function that encourages separating pixels of different objects and grouping pixels that belong to the same instance. We demonstrate that the proposed method can efﬁciently perform instance segmen-tation of many objects without heavy post-processing.
