Few-shot class-incremental learning is to recognize the new classes given few samples and not forget the old classes. It is a challenging task since representation opti-mization and prototype reorganization can only be achieved under little supervision. To address this problem, we pro-pose a novel incremental prototype learning scheme. Our scheme consists of a random episode selection strategy that adapts the feature representation to various generated in-cremental episodes to enhance the corresponding extensi-bility, and a self-promoted prototype reÔ¨Ånement mechanism which strengthens the expression ability of the new classes by explicitly considering the dependencies among different classes. Particularly, a dynamic relation projection module is proposed to calculate the relation matrix in a shared em-bedding space and leverage it as the factor for bootstrap-ping the update of prototypes. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the above-par incre-mental performance, outperforming state-of-the-art meth-ods by a margin of 13%, 17% and 11%, respectively.
