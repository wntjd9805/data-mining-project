State-of-the-art scene text detection methods usually model the text instance with local pixels or components from the bottom-up perspective and, therefore, are sensi-tive to noises and dependent on the complicated heuristic post-processing especially for arbitrary-shape texts. To re-lieve these two issues, instead, we propose to progressive-ly evolve the initial text proposal to arbitrarily shaped text contours in a top-down manner. The initial horizontal text proposals are generated by estimating the center and size of texts. To reduce the range of regression, the ﬁrst stage of the evolution predicts the corner points of oriented tex-t proposals from the initial horizontal ones. In the second stage, the contours of the oriented text proposals are itera-tively regressed to arbitrarily shaped ones. In the last iter-ation of this stage, we rescore the conﬁdence of the ﬁnal localized text by utilizing the cues from multiple contour points, rather than the single cue from the initial horizon-tal proposal center that may be out of arbitrary-shape text regions. Moreover, to facilitate the progressive contour evo-lution, we design a contour information aggregation mech-anism to enrich the feature representation on text contours by considering both the circular topology and semantic con-text. Experiments conducted on CTW1500, Total-Text, ArT, and TD500 have demonstrated that the proposed method e-specially excels in line-level arbitrary-shape texts.
