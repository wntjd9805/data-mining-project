Few-shot object detection has made substantial progress by representing novel class objects using the feature repre-sentation learned upon a set of base class objects. However, an implicit contradiction between novel class classiﬁcation and representation is unfortunately ignored. On the one hand, to achieve accurate novel class classiﬁcation, the dis-tributions of either two base classes must be far away from each other (max-margin). On the other hand, to precisely represent novel classes, the distributions of base classes should be close to each other to reduce the intra-class dis-tance of novel classes (min-margin). In this paper, we pro-pose a class margin equilibrium (CME) approach, with the aim to optimize both feature space partition and novel class reconstruction in a systematic way. CME ﬁrst converts the few-shot detection problem to the few-shot classiﬁcation problem by using a fully connected layer to decouple local-ization features. CME then reserves adequate margin space for novel classes by introducing simple-yet-effective class margin loss during feature learning. Finally, CME pur-sues margin equilibrium by disturbing the features of novel class instances in an adversarial min-max fashion. Exper-iments on Pascal VOC and MS-COCO datasets show thatCME signiﬁcantly improves upon two baseline detectors (up to 3 ∼ 5% in average), achieving state-of-the-art per-formance.
