We introduce a deep generative network for 3D shape de-tailization, akin to stylization with the style being geometric details. We address the challenge of creating large varieties of high-resolution and detailed 3D geometry from a small set of exemplars by treating the problem as that of geometric detail transfer. Given a low-resolution coarse voxel shape, our network reﬁnes it, via voxel upsampling, into a higher-resolution shape enriched with geometric details. The out-put shape preserves the overall structure (or content) of the input, while its detail generation is conditioned on an in-put “style code” corresponding to a detailed exemplar. Our 3D detailization via conditional reﬁnement is realized by a generative adversarial network, coined DECOR-GAN. The network utilizes a 3D CNN generator for upsampling coarse voxels and a 3D PatchGAN discriminator to enforce local patches of the generated model to be similar to those in the training detailed shapes. During testing, a style code is fed into the generator to condition the reﬁnement. We demon-strate that our method can reﬁne a coarse shape into a va-riety of detailed shapes with different styles. The generated results are evaluated in terms of content preservation, plau-sibility, and diversity. Comprehensive ablation studies are conducted to validate our network designs.
