Ever since Machine Learning as a Service emerges as a viable business that utilizes deep learning models to gener-ate lucrative revenue, Intellectual Property Right (IPR) has become a major concern because these deep learning mod-els can easily be replicated, shared, and re-distributed by any unauthorized third parties. To the best of our knowl-edge, one of the prominent deep learning models - Gener-ative Adversarial Networks (GANs) which has been widely used to create photorealistic image are totally unprotected despite the existence of pioneering IPR protection method-ology for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This pa-per therefore presents a complete protection framework in both black-box and white-box settings to enforce IPR pro-tection on GANs. Empirically, we show that the proposed method does not compromise the original GANs perfor-mance (i.e. image generation, image super-resolution, style transfer), and at the same time, it is able to withstand both removal and ambiguity attacks against embedded water-marks.
