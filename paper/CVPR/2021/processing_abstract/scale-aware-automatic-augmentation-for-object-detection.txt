We propose Scale-aware AutoAug to learn data augmen-tation policies for object detection. We deﬁne a new scale-aware search space, where both image- and box-level aug-mentations are designed for maintaining scale invariance.Upon this search space, we propose a new search met-ric, termed Pareto Scale Balance, to facilitate search with high efﬁciency. In experiments, Scale-aware AutoAug yields signiﬁcant and consistent improvement on various object detectors (e.g., RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, and FCOS), even compared with strong multi-scale training baselines. Our searched augmentation policies are trans-ferable to other datasets and box-level tasks beyond ob-ject detection (e.g., instance segmentation and keypoint es-timation) to improve performance. The search cost is much less than previous automated augmentation approaches for object detection.It is notable that our searched policies have meaningful patterns, which intuitively provide valu-able insight for human data augmentation design.
