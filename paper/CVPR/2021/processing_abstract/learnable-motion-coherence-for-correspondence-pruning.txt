Motion coherence is an important clue for distinguish-ing true correspondences from false ones. Modeling mo-tion coherence on sparse putative correspondences is chal-lenging due to their sparsity and uneven distributions. Ex-isting works on motion coherence are sensitive to parame-ter settings and have difﬁculty in dealing with complex mo-tion patterns. In this paper, we introduce a network calledLaplacian Motion Coherence Network (LMCNet) to learn motion coherence property for correspondence pruning. We propose a novel formulation of ﬁtting coherent motions with a smooth function on a graph of correspondences and show that this formulation allows a closed-form solution by graphLaplacian. This closed-form solution enables us to design a differentiable layer in a learning framework to capture global motion coherence from putative correspondences.The global motion coherence is further combined with local coherence extracted by another local layer to robustly de-tect inlier correspondences. Experiments demonstrate thatLMCNet has superior performances to the state of the art in relative camera pose estimation and correspondences prun-ing of dynamic scenes1.
