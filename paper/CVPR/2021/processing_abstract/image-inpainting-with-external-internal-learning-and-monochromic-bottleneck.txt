Although recent inpainting approaches have demon-strated signiﬁcant improvement with deep neural networks, they still suffer from artifacts such as blunt structures and abrupt colors when ﬁlling in the missing regions. To ad-dress these issues, we propose an external-internal inpaint-ing scheme with a monochromic bottleneck that helps im-age inpainting models remove these artifacts. In the exter-nal learning stage, we reconstruct missing structures and details in the monochromic space to reduce the learning di-mension. In the internal learning stage, we propose a novel internal color propagation method with progressive learn-ing strategies for consistent color restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed scheme helps image inpainting models produce more structure-preserved and visually compelling results.
