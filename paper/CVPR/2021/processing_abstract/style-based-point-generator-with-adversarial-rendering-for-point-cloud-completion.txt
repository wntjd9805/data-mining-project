In this paper, we proposed a novel Style-based PointGenerator with Adversarial Rendering (SpareNet) for point cloud completion. Firstly, we present the channel-attentiveEdgeConv to fully exploit the local structures as well as the global shape in point features. Secondly, we observe that the concatenation manner used by vanilla foldings limits its potential of generating a complex and faithful shape. En-lightened by the success of StyleGAN, we regard the shape feature as style code that modulates the normalization lay-ers during the folding, which considerably enhances its ca-pability. Thirdly, we realize that existing point supervisions, e.g., Chamfer Distance or Earth Mover’s Distance, cannot faithfully reﬂect the perceptual quality of the reconstructed points. To address this, we propose to project the com-pleted points to depth maps with a differentiable renderer and apply adversarial training to advocate the perceptual realism under different viewpoints. Comprehensive experi-ments on ShapeNet and KITTI prove the effectiveness of our method, which achieves state-of-the-art quantitative perfor-mance while offering superior visual quality.
