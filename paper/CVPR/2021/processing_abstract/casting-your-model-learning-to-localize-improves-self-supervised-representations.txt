Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have largely closed the gap with supervised ImageNet pretrain-ing. Despite their success these methods have been pri-marily applied to unlabeled ImageNet images, and show marginal gains when trained on larger sets of uncurated images. We hypothesize that current SSL methods perform best on iconic images, and struggle on complex scene im-ages with many objects. Analyzing contrastive SSL meth-ods shows that they have poor visual grounding and re-ceive poor supervisory signal when trained on scene im-ages. We propose Contrastive Attention-Supervised Tuning (CAST) to overcome these limitations. CAST uses unsuper-vised saliency maps to intelligently sample crops, and to provide grounding supervision via a Grad-CAM attention loss. Experiments on COCO show that CAST signiÔ¨Åcantly improves the features learned by SSL methods on scene im-ages, and further experiments show that CAST-trained mod-els are more robust to changes in backgrounds.
