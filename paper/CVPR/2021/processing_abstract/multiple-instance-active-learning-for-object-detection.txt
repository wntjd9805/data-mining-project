Despite the substantial progress of active learning for image recognition, there still lacks an instance-level ac-tive learning method speciﬁed for object detection. In this paper, we propose Multiple Instance Active Object Detec-tion (MI-AOD), to select the most informative images for detector training by observing instance-level uncertainty.MI-AOD deﬁnes an instance uncertainty learning module, which leverages the discrepancy of two adversarial in-stance classiﬁers trained on the labeled set to predict in-stance uncertainty of the unlabeled set. MI-AOD treats unlabeled images as instance bags and feature anchors in images as instances, and estimates the image uncertainty by re-weighting instances in a multiple instance learning (MIL) fashion. Iterative instance uncertainty learning and re-weighting facilitate suppressing noisy instances, toward bridging the gap between instance uncertainty and image-level uncertainty. Experiments validate that MI-AOD sets a solid baseline for instance-level active learning. On com-monly used object detection datasets, MI-AOD outperforms state-of-the-art methods with signiﬁcant margins, particu-larly when the labeled sets are small.
