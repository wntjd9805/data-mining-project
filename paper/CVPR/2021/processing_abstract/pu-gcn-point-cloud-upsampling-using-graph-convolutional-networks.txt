The effectiveness of learning-based point cloud upsampling pipelines heavily relies on the upsampling modules and feature extractors used therein. For the point upsampling module, we propose a novel model called NodeShufﬂe, which uses a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to better encode local point information from point neighborhoods.NodeShufﬂe is versatile and can be incorporated into any point cloud upsampling pipeline. Extensive experiments show how NodeShufﬂe consistently improves state-of-the-art upsampling methods. For feature extraction, we also propose a new multi-scale point feature extractor, calledInception DenseGCN. By aggregating features at multiple scales, this feature extractor enables further performance gain in the ﬁnal upsampled point clouds. We combineInception DenseGCN with NodeShufﬂe into a new point upsampling pipeline called PU-GCN. PU-GCN sets new state-of-art performance with much fewer parameters and more efﬁcient inference.
