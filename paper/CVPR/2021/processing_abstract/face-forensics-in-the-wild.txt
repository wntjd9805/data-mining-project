On existing public benchmarks, face forgery detection techniques have achieved great success. However, when used in multi-person videos, which often contain many peo-ple active in the scene with only a small subset having been manipulated, their performance remains far from being sat-isfactory. To take face forgery detection to a new level, we construct a novel large-scale dataset, called FFIW10K, which comprises 10,000 high-quality forgery videos, with an average of three human faces in each frame.The manipulation procedure is fully automatic, controlled by a domain-adversarial quality assessment network, makingIn ad-our dataset highly scalable with low human cost. dition, we propose a novel algorithm to tackle the task of multi-person face forgery detection.Supervised by only video-level label, the algorithm explores multiple in-stance learning and learns to automatically attend to tam-pered faces. Our algorithm outperforms representative ap-proaches for both forgery classiﬁcation and localization onFFIW10K, and also shows high generalization ability on ex-isting benchmarks. We hope that our dataset and study will help the community to explore this new ﬁeld in more depth.
