We propose a novel Siamese Natural LanguageTracker (SNLT), which brings the advancements in vi-sual tracking to the tracking by natural language (NL) descriptions task. The proposed SNLT is applicable to a wide range of Siamese trackers, providing a new class of baselines for the tracking by NL task and promis-ing future improvements from the advancements ofSiamese trackers. The carefully designed architecture of the Siamese Natural Language Region Proposal Net-work (SNL-RPN), together with the Dynamic Aggrega-tion of vision and language modalities, is introduced to perform the tracking by NL task. Empirical results over tracking benchmarks with NL annotations show that the proposed SNLT improves Siamese trackers by 3 to 7 percentage points with a slight tradeoï¬€ of speed. The proposed SNLT outperforms all NL trackers to-date and is competitive among state-of-the-art real-time trackers on LaSOT benchmarks while running at 50 frames per second on a single GPU.
