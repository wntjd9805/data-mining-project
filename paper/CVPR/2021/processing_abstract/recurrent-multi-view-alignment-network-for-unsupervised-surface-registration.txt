Learning non-rigid registration in an end-to-end man-ner is challenging due to the inherent high degrees of free-In this pa-dom and the lack of labeled training data. per, we resolve these two challenges simultaneously. First, we propose to represent the non-rigid transformation with a point-wise combination of several rigid transformations.This representation not only makes the solution space well-constrained but also enables our method to be solved iter-atively with a recurrent framework, which greatly reduces the difÔ¨Åculty of learning. Second, we introduce a differen-tiable loss function that measures the 3D shape similarity on the projected multi-view 2D depth images so that our full framework can be trained end-to-end without ground truth supervision. Extensive experiments on several differ-ent datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outper-forms the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin.
