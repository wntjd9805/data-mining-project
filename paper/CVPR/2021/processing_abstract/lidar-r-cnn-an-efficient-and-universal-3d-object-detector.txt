LiDAR-based 3D detection in point cloud is essential in the perception system of autonomous driving. In this pa-per, we present LiDAR R-CNN, a second stage detector that can generally improve any existing 3D detector. To fulﬁl-l the real-time and high precision requirement in practice, we resort to point-based approach other than the popular voxel-based approach. However, we ﬁnd an overlooked is-sue in previous work: Naively applying point-based meth-ods like PointNet could make the learned features ignore the size of proposals. To this end, we analyze this problem in detail and propose several methods to remedy it, which bring signiﬁcant performance improvement. Comprehen-sive experimental results on real-world datasets like Way-mo Open Dataset (WOD) and KITTI dataset with various popular detectors demonstrate the universality and supe-riority of our LiDAR R-CNN. In particular, based on one variant of PointPillars, our method could achieve new state-of-the-art results with minor cost. Codes will be released at https://github.com/tusimple/LiDAR_RCNN .
