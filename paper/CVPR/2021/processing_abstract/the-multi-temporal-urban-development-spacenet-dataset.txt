Satellite imagery analytics have numerous human de-velopment and disaster response applications, particularly when time series methods are involved. For example, quan-tifying population statistics is fundamental to 67 of the 231United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Indicators, but the World Bank estimates that over 100 countries cur-rently lack effective Civil Registration systems. To help ad-dress this deﬁcit and develop novel computer vision meth-ods for time series data, we present the Multi-TemporalUrban Development SpaceNet (MUDS, also known asSpaceNet 7) dataset. This open source dataset consists of medium resolution (4.0m) satellite imagery mosaics, which includes ≈ 24 images (one per month) covering > 100 unique geographies, and comprises > 40, 000 km2 of im-agery and exhaustive polygon labels of building footprints therein, totaling over 11M individual annotations. Each building is assigned a unique identiﬁer (i.e. address), which permits tracking of individual objects over time. Label ﬁ-delity exceeds image resolution; this “omniscient labeling” is a unique feature of the dataset, and enables surpris-ingly precise algorithmic models to be crafted. We demon-strate methods to track building footprint construction (or demolition) over time, thereby directly assessing urban-ization. Performance is measured with the newly devel-oped SpaceNet Change and Object Tracking (SCOT) met-ric, which quantiﬁes both object tracking as well as change detection. We demonstrate that despite the moderate reso-lution of the data, we are able to track individual building identiﬁers over time.
