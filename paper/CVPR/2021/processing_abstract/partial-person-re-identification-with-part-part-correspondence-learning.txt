Driven by the success of deep learning, the last decade has seen rapid advances in person re-identiﬁcation (re-ID).Nonetheless, most of approaches assume that the input is given with the fulﬁllment of expectations, while imperfect input remains rarely explored to date, which is a non-trivial problem since directly apply existing methods without ad-justment can cause signiﬁcant performance degradation. In this paper, we focus on recognizing partial (ﬂawed) input with the assistance of proposed Part-Part CorrespondenceLearning (PPCL), a self-supervised learning framework that learns correspondence between image patches without any additional part-level supervision. Accordingly, we proposePart-Part Cycle (PP-Cycle) constraint and Part-Part Triplet (PP-Triplet) constraint that exploit the duality and unique-ness between corresponding image patches respectively. We verify our proposed PPCL on several partial person re-ID benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can surpass previous methods in terms of the stan-dard evaluation metric.
