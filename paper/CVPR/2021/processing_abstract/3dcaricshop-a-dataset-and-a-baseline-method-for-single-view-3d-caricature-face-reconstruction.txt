Caricature is an artistic representation that deliberately exaggerates the distinctive features of a human face to con-vey humor or sarcasm. However, reconstructing a 3D cari-cature from a 2D caricature image remains a challenging task, mostly due to the lack of data. We propose to ﬁll this gap by introducing 3DCaricShop, the ﬁrst large-scale 3D caricature dataset that contains 2000 high-quality di-versiﬁed 3D caricatures manually crafted by professional artists. 3DCaricShop also provides rich annotations in-cluding a paired 2D caricature image, camera parame-ters and 3D facial landmarks. To demonstrate the ad-vantage of 3DCaricShop, we present a novel baseline ap-proach for single-view 3D caricature reconstruction. To ensure a faithful reconstruction with plausible face defor-mations, we propose to connect the good ends of the detail-rich implicit functions and the parametric mesh represen-tations. In particular, we ﬁrst register a template mesh to the output of the implicit generator and iteratively project the registration result onto a pre-trained PCA space to re-solve artifacts and self-intersections. To deal with the large deformation during non-rigid registration, we propose a novel view-collaborative graph convolution network (VC-GCN) to extract key points from the implicit mesh for ac-curate alignment. Our method is able to generate high-ﬁdelity 3D caricature in a pre-deﬁned mesh topology that is animation-ready. Extensive experiments have been con-ducted on 3DCaricShop to verify the signiﬁcance of the database and the effectiveness of the proposed method. We will release 3DCaricShop upon publication.
