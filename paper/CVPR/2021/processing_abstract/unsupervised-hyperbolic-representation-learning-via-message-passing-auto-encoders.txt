Most of the existing literature regarding hyperbolic em-bedding concentrate upon supervised learning, whereas the use of unsupervised hyperbolic embedding is less well ex-plored. In this paper, we analyze how unsupervised tasks can beneﬁt from learned representations in hyperbolic space. To explore how well the hierarchical structure of un-labeled data can be represented in hyperbolic spaces, we design a novel hyperbolic message passing auto-encoder whose overall auto-encoding is performed in hyperbolic space. The proposed model conducts auto-encoding the networks via fully utilizing hyperbolic geometry in mes-sage passing. Through extensive quantitative and qualita-tive analyses, we validate the properties and beneﬁts of the unsupervised hyperbolic representations.
