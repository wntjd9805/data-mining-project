Few-shot learning aims to correctly recognize query samples from unseen classes given a limited number of sup-port samples, often by relying on global embeddings of im-ages. In this paper, we propose to equip the backbone net-work with an attention agent, which is trained by reinforce-ment learning. The policy gradient algorithm is employed to train the agent towards adaptively localizing the repre-sentative regions on feature maps over time. We further de-sign a reward function based on the prediction of the held-out data, thus helping the attention mechanism to general-ize better across the unseen classes. The extensive experi-ments show, with the help of the reinforced attention, that our embedding network has the capability to progressively generate a more discriminative representation in few-shot learning. Moreover, experiments on the task of image clas-siÔ¨Åcation also show the effectiveness of the proposed design.Figure 1. Few-shot learning processes. (a) Vanilla few-shot learn-ing.
