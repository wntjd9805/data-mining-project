Recent years have witnessed great progress of object de-tection. However, due to the domain shift problem, apply-ing the knowledge of an object detector learned from one speciﬁc domain to another one often suffers severe perfor-mance degradation. Most existing methods adopt feature alignment either on the backbone network or instance clas-siﬁer to increase the transferability of object detector. Dif-ferently, we propose to perform feature alignment in theRPN stage such that the foreground and background RPN proposals in target domain can be effectively distinguished.Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst construct one set of learnable RPN pro-totpyes, and then enforce the RPN features to align with the prototypes for both source and target domains. It essentially cooperates the learning of RPN prototypes and features to align the source and target RPN features. Particularly, we propose a simple yet effective method suitable for RPN fea-ture alignment to generate high-quality pseudo label of pro-posals in target domain, i.e., using the ﬁltered detection re-sults with IoU. Furthermore, we adopt Grad CAM to ﬁnd the discriminative region within a foreground proposal and use it to increase the discriminability of RPN features for alignment. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain detection scenarios, and the results show the effectiveness of our proposed method against previous state-of-the-art methods.
