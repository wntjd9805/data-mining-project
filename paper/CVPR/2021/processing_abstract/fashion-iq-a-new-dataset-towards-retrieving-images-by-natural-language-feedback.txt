Classical Fashion SearchDialog-based Fashion SearchConversational interfaces for the detail-oriented retail fashion domain are more natural, expressive, and user friendly than classical keyword-based search interfaces. In this paper, we introduce the Fashion IQ dataset to sup-port and advance research on interactive fashion image re-trieval. Fashion IQ is the Ô¨Årst fashion dataset to provide human-generated captions that distinguish similar pairs of garment images together with side-information consisting of real-world product descriptions and derived visual at-tribute labels for these images. We provide a detailed analy-sis of the characteristics of the Fashion IQ data, and present a transformer-based user simulator and interactive image retriever that can seamlessly integrate visual attributes with image features, user feedback, and dialog history, leading to improved performance over the state of the art in dialog-based image retrieval. We believe that our dataset will en-courage further work on developing more natural and real-world applicable conversational shopping assistants.1
