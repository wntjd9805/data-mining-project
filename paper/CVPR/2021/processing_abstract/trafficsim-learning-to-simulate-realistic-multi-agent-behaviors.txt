Simulation has the potential to massively scale evalua-tion of self-driving systems, enabling rapid development as well as safe deployment. Bridging the gap between simu-lation and the real world requires realistic multi-agent be-haviors. Existing simulation environments rely on heuristic-based models that directly encode trafﬁc rules, which cannot capture irregular maneuvers (e.g., nudging, U-turns) and complex interactions (e.g., yielding, merging). In contrast, we leverage real-world data to learn directly from human demonstration, and thus capture more naturalistic driving behaviors. To this end, we propose TRAFFICSIM, a multi-In agent behavior model for realistic trafﬁc simulation. particular, we parameterize the policy with an implicit la-tent variable model that generates socially-consistent plans for all actors in the scene jointly. To learn a robust policy amenable for long horizon simulation, we unroll the policy in training and optimize through the fully differentiable simu-lation across time. Our learning objective incorporates both human demonstrations as well as common sense. We showTRAFFICSIM generates signiﬁcantly more realistic trafﬁc scenarios as compared to a diverse set of baselines. Notably, we can exploit trajectories generated by TRAFFICSIM as ef-fective data augmentation for training better motion planner.
