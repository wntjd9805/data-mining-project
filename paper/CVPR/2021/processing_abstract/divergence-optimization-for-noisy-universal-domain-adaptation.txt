Universal domain adaptation (UniDA) has been pro-posed to transfer knowledge learned from a label-rich source domain to a label-scarce target domain without any constraints on the label sets. In practice, however, it is dif-ﬁcult to obtain a large amount of perfectly clean labeled data in a source domain with limited resources. ExistingUniDA methods rely on source samples with correct anno-tations, which greatly limits their application in the real world. Hence, we consider a new realistic setting calledNoisy UniDA, in which classiﬁers are trained with noisy labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data with an unknown class distribution from the target domain.This paper introduces a two-head convolutional neural net-work framework to solve all problems simultaneously. Our network consists of one common feature generator and two classiﬁers with different decision boundaries. By optimiz-ing the divergence between the two classiﬁers’ outputs, we can detect noisy source samples, ﬁnd “unknown” classes in the target domain, and align the distribution of the source and target domains. In an extensive evaluation of different domain adaptation settings, the proposed method outper-formed existing methods by a large margin in most settings.
