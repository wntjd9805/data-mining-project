ClassiﬁcationReasoningUnreliable labels derived from large-scale dataset pre-vent neural networks from fully exploring the data. Exist-ing methods of learning with noisy labels primarily take noise-cleaning-based and sample-selection-based methods.However, for numerous studies on account of the above two views, selected samples cannot take full advantage of all data points and cannot represent actual distribution of cat-egories, in particular if label annotation is corrupted. In this paper, we start from a different perspective and propose a robust learning algorithm called DualGraph, which aims to capture structural relations among labels at two different levels with graph neural networks including instance-level and distribution-level relations. Speciﬁcally, the instance-level relation utilizes instance similarity characterize sam-ple category, while the distribution-level relation describes instance similarity distribution from each sample to all other samples. Since the distribution-level relation is ro-bust to label noise, our network propagates it as super-vised signals to reﬁne instance-level similarity. Combin-ing two level relations, we design an end-to-end training paradigm to counteract noisy labels while generating re-liable predictions. We conduct extensive experiments on the noisy CIFAR-10 dataset, CIFAR-100 dataset, and theClothing1M dataset. The results demonstrate the advanta-geous performance of the proposed method in comparison to state-of-the-art baselines.
