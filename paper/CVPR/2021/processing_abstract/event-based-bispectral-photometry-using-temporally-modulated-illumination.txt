Analysis of bispectral difference plays a critical role in various applications that involve rays propagating in a light absorbing medium.In general, the bispectral difference is obtained by subtracting signals at two individual wave-lengths captured by ordinary digital cameras, which tends to inherit the drawbacks of conventional cameras in dy-namic range, response speed and quantization precision. In this paper, we propose a novel method to obtain a bispec-tral difference image using an event camera with temporally modulated illumination. Our method is rooted in a key ob-servation on the analogy between the bispectral photometry principle of the participating medium and the event gener-ating mechanism in an event camera. By carefully modulat-ing the bispectral illumination, our method allows to read out the bispectral difference directly from triggered events.Experiments using a prototype imaging system have veriÔ¨Åed the feasibility of this novel usage of event cameras in pho-tometry based vision tasks, such as 3D shape reconstruction in water.
