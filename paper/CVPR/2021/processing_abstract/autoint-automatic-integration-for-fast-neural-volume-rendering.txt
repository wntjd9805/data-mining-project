Numerical integration is a foundational technique in sci-entiﬁc computing and is at the core of many computer vi-sion applications. Among these applications, neural volume rendering has recently been proposed as a new paradigm for view synthesis, achieving photorealistic image quality.However, a fundamental obstacle to making these methods practical is the extreme computational and memory require-ments caused by the required volume integrations along the rendered rays during training and inference. Millions of rays, each requiring hundreds of forward passes through a neural network are needed to approximate those inte-grations with Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we propose automatic integration, a new framework for learning efﬁ-cient, closed-form solutions to integrals using coordinate-based neural networks. For training, we instantiate the computational graph corresponding to the derivative of the coordinate-based network. The graph is ﬁtted to the sig-nal to integrate. After optimization, we reassemble the graph to obtain a network that represents the antideriva-tive. By the fundamental theorem of calculus, this enables the calculation of any deﬁnite integral in two evaluations of the network. Applying this approach to neural rendering, we improve a tradeoff between rendering speed and image quality: improving render times by greater than 10× with a tradeoff of reduced image quality.
