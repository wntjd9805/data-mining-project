Makeup transfer is the task of applying on a source face the makeup style from a reference image. Real-life makeups are diverse and wild, which cover not only color-changing but also patterns, such as stickers, blushes, and jewelries.However, existing works overlooked the latter components and conÔ¨Åned makeup transfer to color manipulation, fo-cusing only on light makeup styles. In this work, we pro-pose a holistic makeup transfer framework that can han-dle all the mentioned makeup components. It consists of an improved color transfer branch and a novel pattern trans-fer branch to learn all makeup properties, including color, shape, texture, and location. To train and evaluate such a system, we also introduce new makeup datasets for real and synthetic extreme makeup. Experimental results show that our framework achieves the state of the art performance on both light and extreme makeup styles. Code is available at https://github.com/VinAIResearch/CPM .
