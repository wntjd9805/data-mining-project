Person search aims to simultaneously localize and iden-tify a query person from realistic, uncropped images, which can be regarded as the uniﬁed task of pedestrian detection and person re-identiﬁcation (re-id). Most existing works employ two-stage detectors like Faster-RCNN, yielding en-couraging accuracy but with high computational overhead.In this work, we present the Feature-Aligned Person SearchNetwork (AlignPS), the ﬁrst anchor-free framework to ef-ﬁciently tackle this challenging task. AlignPS explicitly ad-dresses the major challenges, which we summarize as the misalignment issues in different levels (i.e., scale, region, and task), when accommodating an anchor-free detector for this task. More speciﬁcally, we propose an aligned feature aggregation module to generate more discriminative and robust feature embeddings by following a “re-id ﬁrst” prin-ciple. Such a simple design directly improves the baseline anchor-free model on CUHK-SYSU by more than 20% in mAP. Moreover, AlignPS outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage methods, with a higher speed.
