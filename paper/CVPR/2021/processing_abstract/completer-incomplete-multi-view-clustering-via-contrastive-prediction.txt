In this paper, we study two challenging problems in in-complete multi-view clustering analysis, namely, i) how to learn an informative and consistent representation among different views without the help of labels and ii) how to re-cover the missing views from data. To this end, we propose a novel objective that incorporates representation learning and data recovery into a uniﬁed framework from the view of information theory. To be speciﬁc, the informative and consistent representation is learned by maximizing the mu-tual information across different views through contrastive learning, and the missing views are recovered by minimiz-ing the conditional entropy of different views through dual prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this could be theﬁrst work to provide a theoretical framework that uniﬁes the consistent representation learning and cross-view data re-covery. Extensive experimental results show the proposed method remarkably outperforms 10 competitive multi-view clustering methods on four challenging datasets. The code is available at https://pengxi.me.
