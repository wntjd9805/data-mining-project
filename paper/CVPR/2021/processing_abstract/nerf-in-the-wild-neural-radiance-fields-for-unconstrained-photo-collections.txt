We present a learning-based method for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes using only unstructured col-lections of in-the-wild photographs. We build on NeuralRadiance Fields (NeRF), which uses the weights of a multi-layer perceptron to model the density and color of a scene as a function of 3D coordinates. While NeRF works well on images of static subjects captured under controlled settings, it is incapable of modeling many ubiquitous, real-world phenomena in uncontrolled images, such as variable illu-mination or transient occluders. We introduce a series of extensions to NeRF to address these issues, thereby enabling accurate reconstructions from unstructured image collec-tions taken from the internet. We apply our system, dubbedNeRF-W, to internet photo collections of famous landmarks, and demonstrate temporally consistent novel view render-ings that are signiÔ¨Åcantly closer to photorealism than the prior state of the art.
