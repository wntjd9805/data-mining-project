Various combinations of cameras enrich computa-tional photography, among which reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) plays a critical role in multiscale imag-ing systems. However, existing RefSR approaches fail to accomplish high-ﬁdelity super-resolution under a large res-olution gap, e.g., 8× upscaling, due to the lower consider-ation of the underlying scene structure. In this paper, we aim to solve the RefSR problem in actual multiscale camera systems inspired by multiplane image (MPI) representation.Speciﬁcally, we propose Cross-MPI, an end-to-end RefSR network composed of a novel plane-aware attention-basedMPI mechanism, a multiscale guided upsampling module as well as a super-resolution (SR) synthesis and fusion module.Instead of using a direct and exhaustive matching between the cross-scale stereo, the proposed plane-aware attention mechanism fully utilizes the concealed scene structure for efﬁcient attention-based correspondence searching. Fur-ther combined with a gentle coarse-to-ﬁne guided upsam-pling strategy, the proposed Cross-MPI can achieve a ro-bust and accurate detail transmission. Experimental results on both digitally synthesized and optical zoom cross-scale data show that the Cross-MPI framework can achieve su-perior performance against the existing RefSR methods and is a real ﬁt for actual multiscale camera systems even with large-scale differences.
