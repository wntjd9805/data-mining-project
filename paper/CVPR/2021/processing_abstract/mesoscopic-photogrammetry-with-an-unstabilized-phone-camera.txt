We present a feature-free photogrammetric technique that enables quantitative 3D mesoscopic (mm-scale height variation) imaging with tens-of-micron accuracy from se-quences of images acquired by a smartphone at close range (several cm) under freehand motion without addi-tional hardware. Our end-to-end, pixel-intensity-based ap-proach jointly registers and stitches all the images by es-timating a coaligned height map, which acts as a pixel-wise radial deformation ﬁeld that orthorectiﬁes each cam-era image to allow plane-plus-parallax registration. The height maps themselves are reparameterized as the out-put of an untrained encoder-decoder convolutional neu-ral network (CNN) with the raw camera images as the in-put, which effectively removes many reconstruction arti-facts. Our method also jointly estimates both the camera’s dynamic 6D pose and its distortion using a nonparametric model, the latter of which is especially important in meso-scopic applications when using cameras not designed for imaging at short working distances, such as smartphone cameras. We also propose strategies for reducing computa-tion time and memory, applicable to other multi-frame reg-istration problems. Finally, we demonstrate our method us-ing sequences of multi-megapixel images captured by an un-stabilized smartphone on a variety of samples (e.g., painting brushstrokes, circuit board, seeds).
