Batch Normalization (BN) is a popular technique for training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). BN uses scaling and shifting to normalize activations of mini-batches to ac-celerate convergence and improve generalization. The re-cently proposed Iterative Normalization (IterNorm) method improves these properties by whitening the activations iter-atively using Newton’s method. However, since Newton’s method initializes the whitening matrix independently at each training step, no information is shared between con-secutive steps. In this work, instead of exact computation of whitening matrix at each time step, we estimate it gradually during training in an online fashion, using our proposedStochastic Whitening Batch Normalization (SWBN) algo-rithm. We show that while SWBN improves the convergence rate and generalization of DNNs, its computational over-head is less than that of IterNorm. Due to the high efﬁciency of the proposed method, it can be easily employed in mostDNN architectures with a large number of layers. We provide comprehensive experiments and comparisons between BN,IterNorm, and SWBN layers to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique in conventional (many-shot) image classiﬁcation and few-shot classiﬁcation tasks.
