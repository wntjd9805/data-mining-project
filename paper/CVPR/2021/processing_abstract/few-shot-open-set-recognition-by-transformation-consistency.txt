In this paper, we attack a few-shot open-set recogni-tion (FSOSR) problem, which is a combination of few-shot learning (FSL) and open-set recognition (OSR). It aims to quickly adapt a model to a given small set of labeled sam-ples while rejecting unseen class samples. Since OSR re-quires rich data and FSL considers closed-set classiﬁcation, existing OSR and FSL methods show poor performances in solving FSOSR problems. The previous FSOSR method fol-lows the pseudo-unseen class sample-based methods, which collect pseudo-unseen samples from the other dataset or synthesize samples to model unseen class representations.However, this approach is heavily dependent on the com-position of the pseudo samples. In this paper, we propose a novel unknown class sample detector, named SnaTCHer, that does not require pseudo-unseen samples. Based on the transformation consistency, our method measures the dif-ference between the transformed prototypes and a modiﬁed prototype set. The modiﬁed set is composed by replacing a query feature and its predicted class prototype. SnaTCHer rejects samples with large differences to the transformed prototypes. Our method alters the unseen class distribu-tion estimation problem to a relative feature transformation problem, independent of pseudo-unseen class samples. We investigate our SnaTCHer with various prototype transfor-mation methods and observe that our method consistently improves unseen class sample detection performance with-out closed-set classiﬁcation reduction.
