Open compound domain adaptation (OCDA) is a do-main adaptation setting, where target domain is modeled as a compound of multiple unknown homogeneous domains, which brings the advantage of improved generalization to unseen domains.In this work, we propose a principled meta-learning based approach to OCDA for semantic seg-mentation, MOCDA, by modeling the unlabeled target do-main continuously. Our approach consists of four key steps.First, we cluster target domain into multiple sub-target do-mains by image styles, extracted in an unsupervised man-ner. Then, different sub-target domains are split into inde-pendent branches, for which batch normalization parame-ters are learnt to treat them independently. A meta-learner is thereafter deployed to learn to fuse sub-target domain-speciﬁc predictions, conditioned upon the style code. Mean-while, we learn to online update the model by model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) algorithm, thus to further improve generalization. We validate the beneﬁts of our ap-proach by extensive experiments on synthetic-to-real knowl-edge transfer benchmark, where we achieve the state-of-the-art performance in both compound and open domains.
