(a) Near-Duplicate RetrievalDetecting spliced images is one of the emerging chal-lenges in computer vision. Unlike prior methods that focus on detecting low-level artifacts generated during the ma-nipulation process, we use an image retrieval approach to tackle this problem. When given a spliced query image, our goal is to retrieve the original image from a database of authentic images. To achieve this goal, we propose rep-resenting an image by its constituent objects based on the intuition that the ﬁnest granularity of manipulations is of-tentimes at the object-level. We introduce a framework, ob-ject embeddings for spliced image retrieval (OE-SIR), that utilizes modern object detectors to localize object regions.Each region is then embedded and collectively used to rep-resent the image. Further, we propose a student-teacher training paradigm for learning discriminative embeddings within object regions to avoid expensive multiple forward passes. Detailed analysis of the efﬁcacy of different feature embedding models is also provided in this study. Extensive experimental results show that the OE-SIR achieves state-of-the-art performance in spliced image retrieval.Eiffel Tower (b) Instance Retrieval (c-1) Spliced Image Retrieval (c-2)Figure 1. Three different types of image retrieval tasks. (a) The traditional image retrieval algorithm tries to retrieve near-duplicate images using low-level image statistics. (b) Instance retrieval tries to retrieve the same instance (e.g. building) under different view-point, illumination, and occlusion. (c) Spliced image retrieval (SIR) tries to retrieve authentic images used to create the spliced query image. Results from SIR contain images with large varia-tion, so it is difﬁcult to learn a single embedding that is suitable for the SIR task.
