Neural network pruning is an essential approach for reducing the computational complexity of deep models so that they can be well deployed on resource-limited devices.Compared with conventional methods, the recently devel-oped dynamic pruning methods determine redundant ﬁlters variant to each input instance which achieves higher accel-eration. Most of the existing methods discover effective sub-networks for each instance independently and do not utilize the relationship between different inputs. To maximally ex-cavate redundancy in the given network architecture, this paper proposes a new paradigm that dynamically removes redundant ﬁlters by embedding the manifold information of all instances into the space of pruned networks (dubbed asManiDP). We ﬁrst investigate the recognition complexity and feature similarity between images in the training set.Then, the manifold relationship between instances and the pruned sub-networks will be aligned in the training pro-cedure. The effectiveness of the proposed method is ver-iﬁed on several benchmarks, which shows better perfor-mance in terms of both accuracy and computational cost compared to the state-of-the-art methods. For example, our method can reduce 55.3% FLOPs of ResNet-34 with only 0.57% top-1 accuracy degradation on ImageNet.
