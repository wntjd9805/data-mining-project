We propose a generative model of unordered point sets, such as point clouds, in the forms of an energy-based model, where the energy function is parameterized by an input-permutation-invariant bottom-up neural network. The en-ergy function learns a coordinate encoding of each point and then aggregates all individual point features into an energy for the whole point cloud. We call our model theGenerative PointNet because it can be derived from the dis-criminative PointNet. Our model can be trained by MCMC-based maximum likelihood learning (as well as its vari-ants), without the help of any assisting networks like those in GANs and VAEs. Unlike most point cloud generators that rely on hand-crafted distance metrics, our model does not require any hand-crafted distance metric for the point cloud generation, because it synthesizes point clouds by matching observed examples in terms of statistical properties deﬁned by the energy function. Furthermore, we can learn a short-run MCMC toward the energy-based model as a ﬂow-like generator for point cloud reconstruction and interpolation.The learned point cloud representation can be useful for point cloud classiﬁcation. Experiments demonstrate the ad-vantages of the proposed generative model of point clouds.
