Recent advances in label assignment in object detec-tion mainly seek to independently deﬁne positive/negative training samples for each ground-truth (gt) object. In this paper, we innovatively revisit the label assignment from a global perspective and propose to formulate the assign-ing procedure as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem – a well-studied topic in Optimization Theory. Concretely, we deﬁne the unit transportation cost between each deman-der (anchor) and supplier (gt) pair as the weighted sum-mation of their classiﬁcation and regression losses. After formulation, ﬁnding the best assignment solution is con-verted to solve the optimal transport plan at minimal trans-portation costs, which can be solved via Sinkhorn-KnoppIteration. On COCO, a single FCOS-ResNet-50 detector equipped with Optimal Transport Assignment (OTA) can reach 40.7% mAP under 1× scheduler, outperforming all other existing assigning methods. Extensive experiments conducted on COCO and CrowdHuman further validate the effectiveness of our proposed OTA, especially its superior-ity in crowd scenarios.
