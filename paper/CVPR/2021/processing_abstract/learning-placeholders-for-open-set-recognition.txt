Traditional classiﬁers are deployed under closed-set set-ting, with both training and test classes belong to the same set. However, real-world applications probably face the in-put of unknown categories, and the model will recognize them as known ones. Under such circumstances, open-set recognition is proposed to maintain classiﬁcation perfor-mance on known classes and reject unknowns. The closed-set models make overconﬁdent predictions over familiar known class instances, so that calibration and thresholding across categories become essential issues when extending to an open-set environment. To this end, we proposed to learnPlaceholdeRs for Open-SEt Recognition (PROSER), which prepares for the unknown classes by allocating placehold-ers for both data and classiﬁer. In detail, learning data placeholders tries to anticipate open-set class data, thus transforms closed-set training into open-set training. Be-sides, to learn the invariant information between target and non-target classes, we reserve classiﬁer placeholders as the class-speciﬁc boundary between known and unknown.The proposed PROSER efﬁciently generates novel class by manifold mixup, and adaptively sets the value of reserved open-set classiﬁer during training. Experiments on various datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
