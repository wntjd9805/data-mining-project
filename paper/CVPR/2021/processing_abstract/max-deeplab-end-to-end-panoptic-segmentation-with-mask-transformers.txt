We present MaX-DeepLab, the ﬁrst end-to-end model for panoptic segmentation. Our approach simpliﬁes the cur-rent pipeline that depends heavily on surrogate sub-tasks and hand-designed components, such as box detection, non-maximum suppression, thing-stuff merging, etc. Although these sub-tasks are tackled by area experts, they fail to comprehensively solve the target task. By contrast, ourMaX-DeepLab directly predicts class-labeled masks with a mask transformer, and is trained with a panoptic quality in-spired loss via bipartite matching. Our mask transformer employs a dual-path architecture that introduces a global memory path in addition to a CNN path, allowing direct communication with any CNN layers. As a result, MaX-DeepLab shows a signiﬁcant 7.1% PQ gain in the box-free regime on the challenging COCO dataset, closing the gap between box-based and box-free methods for the ﬁrst time.A small variant of MaX-DeepLab improves 3.0% PQ overDETR with similar parameters and M-Adds. Furthermore,MaX-DeepLab, without test time augmentation, achieves new state-of-the-art 51.3% PQ on COCO test-dev set.
