Go to the  kitchenSimultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) remains challenging for a number of downstream applications, such as visual robot navigation, because of rapid turns, feature-less walls, and poor camera quality. We introduce the Differ-entiable SLAM Network (SLAM-net) along with a navigation architecture to enable planar robot navigation in previously unseen indoor environments. SLAM-net encodes a particleﬁlter based SLAM algorithm in a differentiable computa-tion graph, and learns task-oriented neural network com-ponents by backpropagating through the SLAM algorithm.Because it can optimize all model components jointly for the end-objective, SLAM-net learns to be robust in challenging conditions. We run experiments in the Habitat platform with different real-world RGB and RGB-D datasets. SLAM-net signiﬁcantly outperforms the widely adapted ORB-SLAM in noisy conditions. Our navigation architecture with SLAM-net improves the state-of-the-art for the Habitat Challenge 2020 PointNav task by a large margin (37% to 64% success).Project website: http:// sites.google.com/ view/ slamnet
