Novel view synthesis is a challenging and ill-posed in-verse rendering problem. Neural rendering techniques have recently achieved photorealistic image quality for this task. State-of-the-art (SOTA) neural volume rendering ap-proaches, however, are slow to train and require minutes of inference (i.e., rendering) time for high image resolutions.We adopt high-capacity neural scene representations with periodic activations for jointly optimizing an implicit sur-face and a radiance Ô¨Åeld of a scene supervised exclusively with posed 2D images. Our neural rendering pipeline ac-celerates SOTA neural volume rendering by about two or-ders of magnitude and our implicit surface representation is unique in allowing us to export a mesh with view-dependent texture information. Thus, like other implicit surface rep-resentations, ours is compatible with traditional graphics pipelines, enabling real-time rendering rates, while achiev-ing unprecedented image quality compared to other surface methods. We assess the quality of our approach using exist-ing datasets as well as high-quality 3D face data captured with a custom multi-camera rig.
