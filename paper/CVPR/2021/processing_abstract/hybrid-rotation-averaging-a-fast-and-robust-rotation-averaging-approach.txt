We address rotation averaging (RA) and its application to real-world 3D reconstruction. Local optimisation based approaches are the de facto choice, though they only guar-antee a local optimum. Global optimisers ensure global op-timality in low noise conditions, but they are inefﬁcient and may easily deviate under the inﬂuence of outliers or ele-vated noise levels. We push the envelope of rotation aver-aging by leveraging the advantages of a global RA method and a local RA method. Combined with a fast view graphﬁltering as preprocessing, the proposed hybrid approach is robust to outliers. We further apply the proposed hybrid rotation averaging approach to incremental Structure fromMotion (SfM), the accuracy and robustness of SfM are both improved by adding the resulting global rotations as reg-ularisers to bundle adjustment. Overall, we demonstrate high practicality of the proposed method as bad camera poses are effectively corrected and drift is reduced.
