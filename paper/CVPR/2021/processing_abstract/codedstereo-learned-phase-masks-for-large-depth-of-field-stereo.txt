Conventional stereo suffers from a fundamental trade-off between imaging volume and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) – due to the conﬂicting impact of aperture size on both these variables. Inspired by the extended depth of ﬁeld cameras, we propose a novel end-to-end learning-based technique to overcome this limitation, by introducing a phase mask at the aperture plane of the cameras in a stereo imaging sys-tem. The phase mask creates a depth-dependent yet numer-ically invertible point spread function, allowing us to re-cover sharp image texture and stereo correspondence over a signiﬁcantly extended depth of ﬁeld (EDOF) than conven-tional stereo. The phase mask pattern, the EDOF image reconstruction, and the stereo disparity estimation are all trained together using an end-to-end learned deep neural network. We perform theoretical analysis and characteri-zation of the proposed approach and show a 6× increase in volume that can be imaged in simulation. We also build an experimental prototype and validate the approach using real-world results acquired using this prototype system.
