Removing outlier correspondences is one of the critical steps for successful feature-based point cloud registration.Despite the increasing popularity of introducing deep learn-ing techniques in this ﬁeld, spatial consistency, which is essentially established by a Euclidean transformation be-tween point clouds, has received almost no individual at-tention in existing learning frameworks. In this paper, we present PointDSC, a novel deep neural network that ex-plicitly incorporates spatial consistency for pruning out-lier correspondences. First, we propose a nonlocal fea-ture aggregation module, weighted by both feature and spa-tial coherence, for feature embedding of the input corre-spondences. Second, we formulate a differentiable spectral matching module, supervised by pairwise spatial compati-bility, to estimate the inlier conﬁdence of each correspon-dence from the embedded features. With modest computa-tion cost, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art hand-crafted and learning-based outlier rejection approaches on several real-world datasets by a signiﬁcant margin. We also show its wide applicability by combining PointDSC with different 3D local descriptors. [code release]
