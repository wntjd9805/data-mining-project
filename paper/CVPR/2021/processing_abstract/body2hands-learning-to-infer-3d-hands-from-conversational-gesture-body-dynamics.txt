We propose a novel learned deep prior of body motion for 3D hand shape synthesis and estimation in the domain of conversational gestures. Our model builds upon the insight that body motion and hand gestures are strongly correlated in non-verbal communication settings. We formulate the learning of this prior as a prediction task of 3D hand shape over time given body motion input alone. Trained with 3D pose estimations obtained from a large-scale dataset of internet videos, our hand prediction model produces con-vincing 3D hand gestures given only the 3D motion of the speaker’s arms as input. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our method on hand gesture synthesis from body motion input, and as a strong body prior for single-view image-based 3D hand pose estimation. We demonstrate that our method out-performs previous state-of-the-art approaches and can gen-eralize beyond the monologue-based training data to multi-person conversations.
