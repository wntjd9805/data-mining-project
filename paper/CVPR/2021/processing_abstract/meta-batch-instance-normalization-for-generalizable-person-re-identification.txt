Although supervised person re-identiﬁcation (Re-ID) methods have shown impressive performance, they suffer from a poor generalization capability on unseen domains.Therefore, generalizable Re-ID has recently attracted grow-ing attention. Many existing methods have employed an instance normalization technique to reduce style varia-tions, but the loss of discriminative information could not be avoided. In this paper, we propose a novel generaliz-able Re-ID framework, named Meta Batch-Instance Nor-malization (MetaBIN). Our main idea is to generalize nor-malization layers by simulating unsuccessful generaliza-tion scenarios beforehand in the meta-learning pipeline.To this end, we combine learnable batch-instance normal-ization layers with meta-learning and investigate the chal-lenging cases caused by both batch and instance normal-ization layers. Moreover, we diversify the virtual simu-lations via our meta-train loss accompanied by a cyclic inner-updating manner to boost generalization capabil-ity. After all, the MetaBIN framework prevents our model from overﬁtting to the given source styles and improves the generalization capability to unseen domains without addi-tional data augmentation or complicated network design.Extensive experimental results show that our model out-performs the state-of-the-art methods on the large-scale domain generalization Re-ID benchmark and the cross-domain Re-ID problem.
