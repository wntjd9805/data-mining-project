Class centerThe performance of face recognition system degrades when the variability of the acquired faces increases. Prior work alleviates this issue by either monitoring the face quality in pre-processing or predicting the data uncertainty along with the face feature. This paper proposes MagFace, a category of losses that learn a universal feature embed-ding whose magnitude can measure the quality of the given face. Under the new loss, it can be proven that the magni-tude of the feature embedding monotonically increases if the subject is more likely to be recognized. In addition, Mag-Face introduces an adaptive mechanism to learn a well-structured within-class feature distributions by pulling easy samples to class centers while pushing hard samples away.This prevents models from overÔ¨Åtting on noisy low-quality samples and improves face recognition in the wild. Ex-tensive experiments conducted on face recognition, qual-ity assessments as well as clustering demonstrate its su-periority over state-of-the-arts.
