DNN-based frame interpolation—that generates the in-termediate frames given two consecutive frames—typically relies on heavy model architectures with a huge number of features, preventing them from being deployed on systems with limited resources, e.g., mobile devices. We propose a compression-driven network design for frame interpola-tion (CDFI), that leverages model pruning through sparsity-inducing optimization to signiﬁcantly reduce the model size while achieving superior performance. Concretely, we ﬁrst compress the recently proposed AdaCoF model and show that a 10× compressed AdaCoF performs similarly as its original counterpart; then we further improve this com-pressed model by introducing a multi-resolution warping module, which boosts visual consistencies with multi-level details. As a consequence, we achieve a signiﬁcant per-formance gain with only a quarter in size compared with the original AdaCoF. Moreover, our model performs fa-vorably against other state-of-the-arts in a broad range of datasets. Finally, the proposed compression-driven frame-work is generic and can be easily transferred to other DNN-based frame interpolation algorithm.
