Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) aims to localize objects by only utilizing image-level labels. Class activation maps (CAMs) are the commonly used features to achieve WSOL. However, previous CAM-based meth-ods did not take full advantage of the shallow features, despite their importance for WSOL. Because shallow fea-tures are easily buried in background noise through con-ventional fusion.In this paper, we propose a simple but effective Shallow feature-aware Pseudo supervised ObjectLocalization (SPOL) model for accurate WSOL, which makes the utmost of low-level features embedded in shal-low layers. In practice, our SPOL model ﬁrst generates theCAMs through a novel element-wise multiplication of shal-low and deep feature maps, which ﬁlters the background noise and generates sharper boundaries robustly. Besides, we further propose a general class-agnostic segmentation model to achieve the accurate object mask, by only using the initial CAMs as the pseudo label without any extra an-notation. Eventually, a bounding box extractor is applied to the object mask to locate the target. Experiments verify that our SPOL outperforms the state-of-the-art on both CUB-200 and ImageNet-1K benchmarks, achieving 93.44% and 67.15% (i.e., 3.93% and 2.13% improvement) Top-5 local-ization accuracy, respectively.
