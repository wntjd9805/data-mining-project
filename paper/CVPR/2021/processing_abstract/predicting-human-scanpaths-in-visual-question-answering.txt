ImageQuestion:	Is	the	vase	the	same	color	as	the	scarf?Attention has been an important mechanism for both humans and computer vision systems. While state-of-the-art models to predict attention focus on estimating a static probabilistic saliency map with free-viewing behavior, real-life scenarios are ﬁlled with tasks of varying types and com-plexities, and visual exploration is a temporal process that contributes to task performance. To bridge the gap, we con-duct a ﬁrst study to understand and predict the temporal se-quences of eye ﬁxations (a.k.a. scanpaths) during perform-ing general tasks, and examine how scanpaths affect task performance. We present a new deep reinforcement learn-ing method to predict scanpaths leading to different perfor-mances in visual question answering. Conditioned on a task guidance map, the proposed model learns question-speciﬁc attention patterns to generate scanpaths. It addresses the exposure bias in scanpath prediction with self-critical se-quence training and designs a Consistency-Divergence loss to generate distinguishable scanpaths between correct and incorrect answers. The proposed model not only accurately predicts the spatio-temporal patterns of human behavior in visual question answering, such as ﬁxation position, dura-tion, and order, but also generalizes to free-viewing and vi-sual search tasks, achieving human-level performance in all tasks and signiﬁcantly outperforming the state of the art.
