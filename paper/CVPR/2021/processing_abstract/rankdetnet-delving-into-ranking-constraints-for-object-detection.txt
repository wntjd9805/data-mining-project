Modern object detection approaches cast detecting ob-jects as optimizing two subtasks of classiﬁcation and lo-calization simultaneously. Existing methods often learn the classiﬁcation task by optimizing each proposal sepa-rately and neglect the relationship among different propos-als. Such detection paradigm also encounters the mismatch between classiﬁcation and localization due to the inherent discrepancy of their optimization targets. In this work, we propose a ranking-based optimization algorithm for harmo-niously learning to rank and localize proposals in lieu of the classiﬁcation task. To this end, we comprehensively inves-tigate three types of ranking constraints, i.e., global rank-ing, class-speciﬁc ranking and IoU-guided ranking losses.The global ranking loss encourages foreground samples to rank higher than background. The class-speciﬁc ranking loss ensures that positive samples rank higher than negative ones for each speciﬁc class. The IoU-guided ranking loss aims to align each pair of conﬁdence scores with the asso-ciated pair of IoU overlap between two positive samples of a speciﬁc class. Our ranking constraints can sufﬁciently ex-plore the relationships between samples from three different perspectives. They are easy-to-implement, compatible with mainstream detection frameworks and computation-free for inference. Experiments demonstrate that our RankDetNet consistently surpasses prior anchor-based and anchor-free baselines, e.g., improving RetinaNet baseline by 2.5% AP on the COCO test-dev set without bells and whistles. We also apply the proposed ranking constraints for 3D object detection and achieve improved performance, which further validates the superiority and generality of our method.
