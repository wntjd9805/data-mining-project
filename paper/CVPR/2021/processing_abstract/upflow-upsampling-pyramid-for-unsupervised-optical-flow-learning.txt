We present an unsupervised learning approach for opti-cal ﬂow estimation by improving the upsampling and learn-ing of pyramid network. We design a self-guided upsample module to tackle the interpolation blur problem caused by bilinear upsampling between pyramid levels. Moreover, we propose a pyramid distillation loss to add supervision for intermediate levels via distilling the ﬁnest ﬂow as pseudo labels. By integrating these two components together, our method achieves the best performance for unsupervised op-tical ﬂow learning on multiple leading benchmarks, includ-ing MPI-SIntel, KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015. In particu-lar, we achieve EPE=1.4 on KITTI 2012 and F1=9.38% onKITTI 2015, which outperform the previous state-of-the-art methods by 22.2% and 15.7%, respectively.
