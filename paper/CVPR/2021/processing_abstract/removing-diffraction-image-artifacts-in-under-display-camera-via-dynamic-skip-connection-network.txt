Recent development of Under-Display Camera (UDC) systems provides a true bezel-less and notch-free viewing experience on smartphones (and TV, laptops, tablets), while allowing images to be captured from the selﬁe camera em-bedded underneath.In a typical UDC system, the mi-crostructure of the semi-transparent organic light-emitting diode (OLED) pixel array attenuates and diffracts the in-cident light on the camera, resulting in signiﬁcant image quality degradation. Oftentimes, noise, ﬂare, haze, and blur can be observed in UDC images. In this work, we aim to an-alyze and tackle the aforementioned degradation problems.We deﬁne a physics-based image formation model to bet-ter understand the degradation. In addition, we utilize one of the world’s ﬁrst commodity UDC smartphone prototypes to measure the real-world Point Spread Function (PSF) of the UDC system, and provide a model-based data synthesis pipeline to generate realistically degraded images. We spe-cially design a new domain knowledge-enabled DynamicSkip Connection Network (DISCNet) to restore the UDC images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and realUDC data. Our physics-based image formation model and proposed DISCNet can provide foundations for further ex-ploration in UDC image restoration, and even for general diffraction artifact removal in a broader sense. 1
