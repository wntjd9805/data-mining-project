Glass surfaces appear everywhere. Their existence can however pose a serious problem to computer vision tasks.Recently, a method is proposed to detect glass surfaces by learning multi-scale contextual information. However, as it is only based on a general context integration operation and does not consider any speciﬁc glass surface properties, it gets confused when the images contain objects that are sim-ilar to glass surfaces and degenerates in challenging scenes with insufﬁcient contexts. We observe that humans often rely on identifying reﬂections in order to sense the existence of glass and on locating the boundary in order to deter-mine the extent of the glass. Hence, we propose a model for glass surface detection, which consists of two novel mod-ules: (1) a rich context aggregation module (RCAM) to ex-tract multi-scale boundary features from rich context fea-tures for locating glass surface boundaries of different sizes and shapes, and (2) a reﬂection-based reﬁnement module (RRM) to detect reﬂection and then incorporate it so as to differentiate glass regions from non-glass regions. In ad-dition, we also propose a challenging dataset consisting of 4,012 glass images with annotations for glass surface detec-tion. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods from relevant ﬁelds.
