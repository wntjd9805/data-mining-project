Traditional methods for Unsupervised Domain Adapta-tion (UDA) targeting semantic segmentation exploit infor-mation common to the source and target domains, using both labeled source data and unlabeled target data. In this paper, we investigate a setting where the source data is un-available, but the classiﬁer trained on the source data is; hence named “model adaptation”. Such a scenario arises when data sharing is prohibited, for instance, because of privacy, or Intellectual Property (IP) issues.To tackle this problem, we propose a method that re-duces the uncertainty of predictions on the target domain data. We accomplish this in two ways: minimizing the en-tropy of the predicted posterior, and maximizing the noise robustness of the feature representation. We show the ef-ﬁcacy of our method on the transfer of segmentation from computer generated images to real-world driving images, and transfer between data collected in different cities, and surprisingly reach performance comparable with that of the methods that have access to source data.
