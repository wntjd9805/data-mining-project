Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to im-prove the classiﬁcation performance on an unlabeled tar-get domain by leveraging information from a fully la-beled source domain. Recent approaches explore domain-invariant and class-discriminant representations to tack-le this task. These methods, however, ignore the inter-action between domain alignment learning and class dis-crimination learning. As a result, the missing or inade-quate tradeoff between domain alignment and class dis-crimination are prone to the problem of negative trans-fer.In this paper, we propose Dynamic Weighted Learn-ing (DWL) to avoid the discriminability vanishing problem caused by excessive alignment learning and domain mis-alignment problem caused by excessive discriminant learn-ing. Technically, DWL dynamically weights the learning losses of alignment and discriminability by introducing the degree of alignment and discriminability. Besides, the prob-lem of sample imbalance across domains is ﬁrst consid-ered in our work, and we solve the problem by weighing the samples to guarantee information balance across do-mains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DWL has an excellent performance in several benchmark datasets.Code is available at https://github.com/NiXiao-cqu/TransferLearning-dwl-cvpr2021.
