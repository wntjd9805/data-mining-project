Scan sequenceWe tackle the problem of place recognition from point cloud data and introduce a self-attention and orientation encoding network (SOE-Net) that fully explores the rela-tionship between points and incorporates long-range con-text into point-wise local descriptors. Local information of each point from eight orientations is captured in aPointOE module, whereas long-range feature dependen-cies among local descriptors are captured with a self-attention unit. Moreover, we propose a novel loss func-tion called Hard Positive Hard Negative quadruplet loss (HPHN quadruplet), that achieves better performance than the commonly used metric learning loss. Experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate superior perfor-mance of the proposed network over the current state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is released publicly at https://github.com/Yan-Xia/SOE-Net.
