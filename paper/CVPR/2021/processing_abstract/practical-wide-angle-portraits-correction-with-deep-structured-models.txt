Wide-angle portraits often enjoy expanded views. How-ever, they contain perspective distortions, especially notice-able when capturing group portrait photos, where the back-ground is skewed and faces are stretched. This paper in-troduces the ﬁrst deep learning based approach to remove such artifacts from freely-shot photos. Speciﬁcally, given a wide-angle portrait as input, we build a cascaded net-work consisting of a LineNet, a ShapeNet, and a transition module (TM), which corrects perspective distortions on the background, adapts to the stereographic projection on fa-cial regions, and achieves smooth transitions between these two projections, accordingly. To train our network, we build the ﬁrst perspective portrait dataset with a large diversity in identities, scenes and camera modules. For the quantita-tive evaluation, we introduce two novel metrics, line consis-tency and face congruence. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art approach, our method does not require camera distortion parameters. We demonstrate that our approach signiﬁcantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art ap-proach both qualitatively and quantitatively.
