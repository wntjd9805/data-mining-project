We present SMURF, a method for unsupervised learning of optical ﬂow that improves state of the art on all bench-marks by 36% to 40% (over the prior best method UFlow) and even outperforms several supervised approaches such as PWC-Net and FlowNet2. Our method integrates ar-chitecture improvements from supervised optical ﬂow, i.e. the RAFT model, with new ideas for unsupervised learning that include a sequence-aware self-supervision loss, a tech-nique for handling out-of-frame motion, and an approach for learning effectively from multi-frame video data while still only requiring two frames for inference.
