Due to the memorization effect in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), training with noisy labels usually results in in-ferior model performance. Existing state-of-the-art meth-ods primarily adopt a sample selection strategy, which se-lects small-loss samples for subsequent training. However, prior literature tends to perform sample selection within each mini-batch, neglecting the imbalance of noise ratios in different mini-batches. Moreover, valuable knowledge within high-loss samples is wasted. To this end, we pro-pose a noise-robust approach named Jo-SRC (Joint SampleSelection and Model Regularization based on Consistency).Speciﬁcally, we train the network in a contrastive learning manner. Predictions from two different views of each sample are used to estimate its “likelihood” of being clean or out-of-distribution. Furthermore, we propose a joint loss to ad-vance the model generalization performance by introducing consistency regularization. Extensive experiments have val-idated the superiority of our approach over existing state-of-the-art methods.
