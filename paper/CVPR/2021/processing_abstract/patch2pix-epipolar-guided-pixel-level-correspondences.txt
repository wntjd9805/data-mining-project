The classical matching pipeline used for visual localiza-tion typically involves three steps: (i) local feature detec-tion and description, (ii) feature matching, and (iii) outlier rejection. Recently emerged correspondence networks pro-pose to perform those steps inside a single network but suf-fer from low matching resolution due to the memory bottle-neck. In this work, we propose a new perspective to esti-mate correspondences in a detect-to-reﬁne manner, where we ﬁrst predict patch-level match proposals and then re-ﬁne them. We present Patch2Pix, a novel reﬁnement net-work that reﬁnes match proposals by regressing pixel-level matches from the local regions deﬁned by those propos-als and jointly rejecting outlier matches with conﬁdence scores. Patch2Pix is weakly supervised to learn correspon-dences that are consistent with the epipolar geometry of an input image pair. We show that our reﬁnement net-work signiﬁcantly improves the performance of correspon-dence networks on image matching, homography estima-tion, and localization tasks. In addition, we show that our learned reﬁnement generalizes to fully-supervised methods without re-training, which leads us to state-of-the-art lo-calization performance.
