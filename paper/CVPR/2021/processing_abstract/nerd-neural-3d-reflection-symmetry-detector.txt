Correct symmetry normalRecent advances have shown that symmetry, a structural prior that most objects exhibit, can support a variety of single-view 3D understanding tasks. However, detecting 3D symmetry from an image remains a challenging task. Previ-ous works either assume the symmetry is given or detect the symmetry with a heuristic-based method. In this paper, we present NeRD, a Neural 3D Reﬂection Symmetry Detector, which combines the strength of learning-based recognition and geometry-based reconstruction to accurately recover the normal direction of objects’ mirror planes. Speciﬁcally, we enumerate the symmetry planes with a coarse-to-ﬁne strategy and ﬁnd the best ones by building 3D cost volumes to examine the intra-image pixel correspondence from the symmetry. Our experiments show that the symmetry planes detected with our method are signiﬁcantly more accurate than the planes from direct CNN regression on both syn-thetic and real datasets. More importantly, we also demon-strate that the detected symmetry can be used to improve the performance of downstream tasks such as pose estimation and depth map regression by a wide margin over existing methods.
