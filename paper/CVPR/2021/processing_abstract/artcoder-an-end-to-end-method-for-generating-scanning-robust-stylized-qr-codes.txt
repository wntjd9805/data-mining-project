Quick Response (QR) code is one of the most world-wide used two-dimensional codes. Traditional QR codes appear as random collections of black-and-white modules that lack visual semantics and aesthetic elements, which in-spires the recent works to beautify the appearances of QR codes. However, these works adopt ﬁxed generation algo-rithms and therefore can only generate QR codes with a pre-deﬁned style. In this paper, combining the Neural StyleTransfer technique, we propose a novel end-to-end method, named ArtCoder, to generate the stylized QR codes that are personalized, diverse, attractive, and scanning-robust. To guarantee that the generated stylized QR codes are still scanning-robust, we propose a Sampling-Simulation layer, a module-based code loss, and a competition mechanism.The experimental results show that our stylized QR codes have high-quality in both the visual effect and the scanning-robustness, and they are able to support the real-world ap-plication.∗The corresponding author.
