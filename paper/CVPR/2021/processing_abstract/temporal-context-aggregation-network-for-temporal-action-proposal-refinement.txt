Temporal action proposal generation aims to estimate temporal intervals of actions in untrimmed videos, which is a challenging yet important task in the video understandingﬁeld. The proposals generated by current methods still suf-fer from inaccurate temporal boundaries and inferior conﬁ-dence used for retrieval owing to the lack of efﬁcient tempo-ral modeling and effective boundary context utilization. In this paper, we propose Temporal Context Aggregation Net-work (TCANet) to generate high-quality action proposals through “local and global” temporal context aggregation and complementary as well as progressive boundary reﬁne-ment. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst design a Local-Global Tempo-ral Encoder (LGTE), which adopts the channel grouping strategy to efﬁciently encode both “local and global” tem-poral inter-dependencies. Furthermore, both the boundary and internal context of proposals are adopted for frame-level and segment-level boundary regressions, respectively.Temporal Boundary Regressor (TBR) is designed to com-bine these two regression granularities in an end-to-end fashion, which achieves the precise boundaries and reli-able conﬁdence of proposals through progressive reﬁne-ment. Extensive experiments are conducted on three chal-lenging datasets: HACS, ActivityNet-v1.3, and THUMOS-14, where TCANet can generate proposals with high pre-cision and recall. By combining with the existing action classiﬁer, TCANet can obtain remarkable temporal action detection performance compared with other methods. Not surprisingly, the proposed TCANet won the 1st place in theCVPR 2020 - HACS challenge leaderboard on temporal ac-tion localization task.∗ The work was done during an internship at SenseTime.† Corresponding author.Background (cid:2175)(cid:2202)(cid:2183)(cid:2200)(cid:2202)SkiingBackground (cid:2161)(cid:2196)(cid:2186)Local Temporal EncoderGlobal Temporal EncoderLGTEEncoded FeatureStarting ContextCandidate ProposalInternal ContextEnding ContextTBRStart-Boundary RegressionSegment- Level RegressionEnd-Boundary RegressionSegment-Level Regression OutputFrame-Level Regression OutputFused OutputFigure 1. Overview of our proposed method. Given an untrimmed video, TCANet captures the “local and global” temporal relation-ships in parallel by LGTE. In TBR, the internal and boundary con-text of proposals are utilized for segment-level boundary regres-sion and frame-level boundary regression, respectively.
