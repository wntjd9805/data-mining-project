Specialized domain knowledge is often necessary to ac-curately annotate training sets for in-depth analysis, but can be burdensome and time-consuming to acquire from do-main experts. This issue arises prominently in automated behavior analysis, in which agent movements or actions of interest are detected from video tracking data. To reduce annotation effort, we present TREBA: a method to learn annotation-sample efﬁcient trajectory embedding for be-havior analysis, based on multi-task self-supervised learn-ing. The tasks in our method can be efﬁciently engineered by domain experts through a process we call “task program-ming”, which uses programs to explicitly encode structured knowledge from domain experts. Total domain expert effort can be reduced by exchanging data annotation time for the construction of a small number of programmed tasks. We evaluate this trade-off using data from behavioral neuro-science, in which specialized domain knowledge is used to identify behaviors. We present experimental results in three datasets across two domains: mice and fruit ﬂies. Using embeddings from TREBA, we reduce annotation burden by up to a factor of 10 without compromising accuracy com-pared to state-of-the-art features. Our results thus suggest that task programming and self-supervision can be an ef-fective way to reduce annotation effort for domain experts.
