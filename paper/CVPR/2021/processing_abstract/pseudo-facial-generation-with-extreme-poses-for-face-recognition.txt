Face recognition has achieved a great success in recent years, it is still challenging to recognize those facial im-ages with extreme poses. Traditional methods consider it as a domain gap problem. Many of them settle it by gen-erating fake frontal faces from extreme ones, whereas they are tough to maintain the identity information with high computational consumption and uncontrolled disturbances.Our experimental analysis shows a dramatic precision drop with extreme poses. Meanwhile, those extreme poses just exist minor visual differences after small rotations. De-rived from this insight, we attempt to relieve such a huge precision drop by making minor changes to the input im-ages without modifying existing discriminators. A novel lightweight pseudo facial generation is proposed to relieve the problem of extreme poses without generating any frontal facial image. It can depict the facial contour information and make appropriate modiﬁcations to preserve the criti-cal identity information. Speciﬁcally, the proposed method reconstructs pseudo proﬁle faces by minimizing the pixel-wise differences with original proﬁle faces and maintaining the identity consistent information from their corresponding frontal faces simultaneously. The proposed framework can improve existing discriminators and obtain a great promo-tion on several benchmark datasets.
