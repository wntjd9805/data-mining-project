Temporal receptive ﬁelds of models play an important role in action segmentation. Large receptive ﬁelds facilitate the long-term relations among video clips while small re-ceptive ﬁelds help capture the local details. Existing meth-ods construct models with hand-designed receptive ﬁelds in layers. Can we effectively search for receptive ﬁeld combi-nations to replace hand-designed patterns? To answer this question, we propose to ﬁnd better receptive ﬁeld combina-tions through a global-to-local search scheme. Our search scheme exploits both global search to ﬁnd the coarse com-binations and local search to get the reﬁned receptive ﬁeld combination patterns further. The global search ﬁnds pos-sible coarse combinations other than human-designed pat-terns. On top of the global search, we propose an expecta-tion guided iterative local search scheme to reﬁne combina-tions effectively. Our global-to-local search can be plugged into existing action segmentation methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance. The source code is publicly avail-able on http://mmcheng.net/g2lsearch.
