We aim to tackle the challenging Few-Shot Object Detec-tion (FSOD), where data-scarce categories are presented during the model learning. The failure modes of Faster-RCNN in FSOD are investigated, and we ﬁnd that the per-formance degradation is mainly due to the classiﬁcation in-capability (false positives) caused by category confusion, which motivates us to address FSOD from a novel aspect of classiﬁcation reﬁnement. Speciﬁcally, we address the in-trinsic limitation from the aspects of both architectural en-hancement and hard-example mining. We introduce a novel few-shot classiﬁcation reﬁnement mechanism where a de-coupled Few-Shot Classiﬁcation Network (FSCN) is em-ployed to improve the ﬁnal classiﬁcation of a base detec-tor. Moreover, we especially probe a commonly-overlooked but destructive issue of FSOD, i.e., the presence of dis-tractor samples due to the incomplete annotations where images from the base set may contain novel-class objects but remain unlabelled. Retreatment solutions are developed to eliminate the incurred false positives. For FSCN train-ing, the distractor is formulated as a semi-supervised prob-lem, where a distractor utilization loss is proposed to make proper use of it for boosting the data-scarce classes, while a conﬁdence-guided dataset pruning (CGDP) technique is developed to facilitate the few-shot adaptation of base de-tector. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed frame-work achieves state-of-the-art FSOD performance on pub-lic datasets, e.g., Pascal VOC and MS-COCO.
