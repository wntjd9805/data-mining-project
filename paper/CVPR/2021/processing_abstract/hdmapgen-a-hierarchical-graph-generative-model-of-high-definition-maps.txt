High Deﬁnition (HD) maps are maps with precise def-initions of road lanes with rich semantics of the trafﬁc rules. They are critical for several key stages in an au-tonomous driving system, including motion forecasting and planning. However, there are only a small amount of real-world road topologies and geometries, which signiﬁcantly limits our ability to test out the self-driving stack to gen-eralize onto new unseen scenarios. To address this issue, we introduce a new challenging task to generate HD maps.In this work, we explore several autoregressive models us-ing different data representations, including sequence, plain graph, and hierarchical graph. We propose HDMapGen, a hierarchical graph generation model capable of producing high-quality and diverse HD maps through a coarse-to-ﬁne approach. Experiments on the Argoverse dataset and an in-house dataset show that HDMapGen signiﬁcantly outper-forms baseline methods. Additionally, we demonstrate thatHDMapGen achieves high scalability and efﬁciency.
