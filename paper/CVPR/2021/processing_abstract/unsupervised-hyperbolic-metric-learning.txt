Learning feature embedding directly from images with-out any human supervision is a very challenging and essen-tial task in the Ô¨Åeld of computer vision and machine learn-ing. Following the paradigm in supervised manner, most existing unsupervised metric learning approaches mainly focus on binary similarity in Euclidean space. However, these methods cannot achieve promising performance in many practical applications, where the manual information is lacking and data exhibits non-Euclidean latent anatomy.To address this limitation, we propose an Unsupervised Hy-perbolic Metric Learning method with Hierarchical Simi-larity. It considers the natural hierarchies of data by taking advantage of Hyperbolic metric learning and hierarchical clustering, which can effectively excavate richer similar-ity information beyond binary in modeling. More impor-tantly, we design a new loss function to capture the hier-archical similarity among samples to enhance the stability of the proposed method. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with current unsu-pervised deep metric learning approaches.
