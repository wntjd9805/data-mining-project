Video-based person re-identiﬁcation aims to match pedestrians from video sequences across non-overlappingThe key factor for video person re-camera views. identiﬁcation is to effectively exploit both spatial and tem-poral clues from video sequences. In this work, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Correlation and Topology Learn-ing framework (CTL) to pursue discriminative and robust representation by modeling cross-scale spatial-temporal correlation. Speciﬁcally, CTL utilizes a CNN backbone and a key-points estimator to extract semantic local features from human body at multiple granularities as graph nodes.It explores a context-reinforced topology to construct multi-scale graphs by considering both global contextual infor-mation and physical connections of human body. Moreover, a 3D graph convolution and a cross-scale graph convolu-tion are designed, which facilitate direct cross-spacetime and cross-scale information propagation for capturing hi-erarchical spatial-temporal dependencies and structural in-formation. By jointly performing the two convolutions, CTL effectively mines comprehensive clues that are complemen-tary with appearance information to enhance representa-tional capacity. Extensive experiments on two video bench-marks have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method and the state-of-the-art performance.
