Recent years have seen ﬂourishing research on both semi-supervised learning and 3D room layout reconstruction. In this work, we explore the intersection of these two ﬁelds to advance the research objective of enabling more accu-rate 3D indoor scene modeling with less labeled data. We propose the ﬁrst approach to learn representations of room corners and boundaries by using a combination of labeled and unlabeled data for improved layout estimation in a 360◦ panoramic scene. Through extensive comparative experi-ments, we demonstrate that our approach can advance lay-out estimation of complex indoor scenes using as few as 20 labeled examples. When coupled with a layout predictor pre-trained on synthetic data, our semi-supervised method matches the fully supervised counterpart using only 12% of the labels. Our work takes an important ﬁrst step towards ro-bust semi-supervised layout estimation that can enable many applications in 3D perception with limited labeled data.
