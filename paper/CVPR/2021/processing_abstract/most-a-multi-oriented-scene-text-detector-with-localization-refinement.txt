Over the past few years, the ﬁeld of scene text detec-tion has progressed rapidly that modern text detectors are able to hunt text in various challenging scenarios. How-ever, they might still fall short when handling text instances of extreme aspect ratios and varying scales. To tackle such difﬁculties, we propose in this paper a new algorithm for scene text detection, which puts forward a set of strate-gies to signiﬁcantly improve the quality of text localiza-tion. Speciﬁcally, a Text Feature Alignment Module (TFAM) is proposed to dynamically adjust the receptive ﬁelds of features based on initial raw detections; a Position-AwareNon-Maximum Suppression (PA-NMS) module is devised to selectively concentrate on reliable raw detections and ex-clude unreliable ones; besides, we propose an Instance-wise IoU loss for balanced training to deal with text in-stances of different scales. An extensive ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness and superiority of the pro-posed strategies. The resulting text detection system, which integrates the proposed strategies with a leading scene text detector EAST, achieves state-of-the-art or competitive per-formance on various standard benchmarks for text detection while keeping a fast running speed.
