While GANs have shown success in realistic image gen-eration, the idea of using GANs for other tasks unrelated to synthesis is underexplored. Do GANs learn meaning-ful structural parts of objects during their attempt to re-produce those objects? In this work, we test this hypoth-esis and propose a simple and effective approach based on GANs for semantic part segmentation that requires as few as one label example along with an unlabeled dataset.Our key idea is to leverage a trained GAN to extract a pixel-wise representation from the input image and use it as feature vectors for a segmentation network. Our ex-periments demonstrate that this GAN-derived representa-tion is “readily discriminative” and produces surprisingly good results that are comparable to those from supervised baselines trained with signiﬁcantly more labels. We be-lieve this novel repurposing of GANs underlies a new class of unsupervised representation learning, which can gener-alize to many other tasks.
