We propose a simple yet effective reﬂection-free cue for robust reﬂection removal from a pair of ﬂash and ambi-ent (no-ﬂash) images. The reﬂection-free cue exploits aﬂash-only image obtained by subtracting the ambient im-age from the corresponding ﬂash image in raw data space.The ﬂash-only image is equivalent to an image taken in a dark environment with only a ﬂash on. We observe that this ﬂash-only image is visually reﬂection-free, and thus it can provide robust cues to infer the reﬂection in the am-bient image. Since the ﬂash-only image usually has arti-facts, we further propose a dedicated model that not only utilizes the reﬂection-free cue but also avoids introducing artifacts, which helps accurately estimate reﬂection and transmission. Our experiments on real-world images with various types of reﬂection demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with reﬂection-free ﬂash-only cues: our model outperforms state-of-the-art reﬂection removal approaches by more than 5.23dB in PSNR, 0.04 in SSIM, and 0.068 inLPIPS.
