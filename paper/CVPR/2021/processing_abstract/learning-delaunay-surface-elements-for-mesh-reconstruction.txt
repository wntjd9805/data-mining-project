[35]We present a method for reconstructing triangle meshes from point clouds. Existing learning-based methods for mesh reconstruction mostly generate triangles individually, making it hard to create manifold meshes. We leverage the properties of 2D Delaunay triangulations to construct a mesh from manifold surface elements. Our method Ô¨Årst estimates local geodesic neighborhoods around each point.We then perform a 2D projection of these neighborhoods using a learned logarithmic map. A Delaunay triangula-tion in this 2D domain is guaranteed to produce a mani-fold patch, which we call a Delaunay surface element. We synchronize the local 2D projections of neighboring ele-ments to maximize the manifoldness of the reconstructed mesh. Our results show that we achieve better overall man-ifoldness of our reconstructed meshes than current meth-ods to reconstruct meshes with arbitrary topology.
