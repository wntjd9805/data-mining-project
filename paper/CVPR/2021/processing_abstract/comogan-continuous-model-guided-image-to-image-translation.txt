CoMoGAN is a continuous GAN relying on the unsu-pervised reorganization of the target data on a functional manifold. To that matter, we introduce a new Functional In-stance Normalization layer and residual mechanism, which together disentangle image content from position on target manifold. We rely on naive physics-inspired models to guide the training while allowing private model/translations fea-tures. CoMoGAN can be used with any GAN backbone and allows new types of image translation, such as cyclic im-age translation like timelapse generation, or detached lin-ear translation. On all datasets, it outperforms the litera-ture. Our code is available in this page: https://github.com/cv-rits/CoMoGAN .
