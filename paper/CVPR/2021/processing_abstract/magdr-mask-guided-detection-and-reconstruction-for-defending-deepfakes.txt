1Deepfakes raised serious concerns on the authenticity of visual contents. Prior works revealed the possibility to disrupt deepfakes by adding adversarial perturbations to the source data, but we argue that the threat has not been eliminated yet. This paper presents MagDR, a mask-guided detection and reconstruction pipeline for defending deep-fakes from adversarial attacks. MagDR starts with a detec-tion module that deÔ¨Ånes a few criteria to judge the abnor-mality of the output of deepfakes, and then uses it to guide 1This work was supported by NSFC under Grant 61972312 and by theKey Research and Development Program of Shaanxi under Grant 2020GY-002. a learnable reconstruction procedure. Adaptive masks are extracted to capture the change in local facial regions. In experiments, MagDR defends three main tasks of deepfakes, and the learned reconstruction pipeline transfers across in-put data, showing promising performance in defending both black-box and white-box attacks.
