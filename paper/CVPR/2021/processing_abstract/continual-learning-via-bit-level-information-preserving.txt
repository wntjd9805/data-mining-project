Continual learning tackles the setting of learning differ-ent tasks sequentially. Despite the lots of previous solutions, most of them still suffer signiﬁcant forgetting or expensive memory cost. In this work, targeted at these problems, weﬁrst study the continual learning process through the lens of information theory and observe that forgetting of a model stems from the loss of information gain on its parameters from the previous tasks when learning a new task. From this viewpoint, we then propose a novel continual learning approach called Bit-Level Information Preserving (BLIP) that preserves the information gain on model parameters through updating the parameters at the bit level, which can be conveniently implemented with parameter quantization.More speciﬁcally, BLIP ﬁrst trains a neural network with weight quantization on the new incoming task and then es-timates information gain on each parameter provided by the task data to determine the bits to be frozen to prevent forgetting. We conduct extensive experiments ranging from classiﬁcation tasks to reinforcement learning tasks, and the results show that our method produces better or on par re-sults comparing to previous state-of-the-arts. Indeed, BLIP achieves close to zero forgetting while only requiring con-stant memory overheads throughout continual learning1.
