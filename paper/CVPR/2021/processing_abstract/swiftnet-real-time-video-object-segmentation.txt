In this work we present SwiftNet for real-time semisu-pervised video object segmentation (one-shot VOS), which reports 77.8% J &F and 70 FPS on DAVIS 2017 val-idation dataset, leading all present solutions in over-all accuracy and speed performance. We achieve this by elaborately compressing spatiotemporal redundancy in matching-based VOS via Pixel-Adaptive Memory (PAM).Temporally, PAM adaptively triggers memory updates on frames where objects display noteworthy inter-frame vari-ations. Spatially, PAM selectively performs memory up-date and match on dynamic pixels while ignoring the static ones, signiﬁcantly reducing redundant computations wasted on segmentation-irrelevant pixels.To promote efﬁcient reference encoding, light-aggregation encoder is also in-troduced in SwiftNet deploying reversed sub-pixel. We hope SwiftNet could set a strong and efﬁcient baseline for real-time VOS and facilitate its application in mo-bile vision.
