Image virtual try-on replaces the clothes on a personIt is chal-image with a desired in-shop clothes image. lenging because the person and the in-shop clothes are un-paired. Existing methods formulate virtual try-on as either in-painting or cycle consistency. Both of these two formula-tions encourage the generation networks to reconstruct the input image in a self-supervised manner. However, exist-ing methods do not differentiate clothing and non-clothing regions. A straightforward generation impedes the virtual try-on quality because of the heavily coupled image con-tents.In this paper, we propose a Disentangled Cycle-consistency Try-On Network (DCTON). The DCTON is able to produce highly-realistic try-on images by disentangling important components of virtual try-on including clothes warping, skin synthesis, and image composition. Moreover,DCTON can be naturally trained in a self-supervised man-ner following cycle consistency learning. Extensive exper-iments on challenging benchmarks show that DCTON out-performs state-of-the-art approaches favorably.
