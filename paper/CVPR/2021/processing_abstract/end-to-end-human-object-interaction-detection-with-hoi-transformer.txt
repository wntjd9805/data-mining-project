We propose HOI Transformer to tackle human object in-teraction (HOI) detection in an end-to-end manner. Cur-rent approaches either decouple HOI task into separated stages of object detection and interaction classiﬁcation or introduce surrogate interaction problem.In contrast, our method, named HOI Transformer, streamlines the HOI pipeline by eliminating the need for many hand-designed components. HOI Transformer reasons about the rela-tions of objects and humans from global image context and directly predicts HOI instances in parallel. A quintuple matching loss is introduced to force HOI predictions in a uniﬁed way. Our method is conceptually much simpler and demonstrates improved accuracy. Without bells and whistles, HOI Transformer achieves 26.61% AP on HICO-DET and 52.9% AProle on V-COCO, surpassing previous methods with the advantage of being much simpler. We hope our approach will serve as a simple and effective al-ternative for HOI tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/bbepoch/HoiTransformer.
