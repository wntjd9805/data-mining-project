We present Meta Pseudo Labels, a semi-supervised learn-ing method that achieves a new state-of-the-art top-1 ac-curacy of 90.2% on ImageNet, which is 1.6% better than the existing state-of-the-art [16]. Like Pseudo Labels, MetaPseudo Labels has a teacher network to generate pseudo la-bels on unlabeled data to teach a student network. However, unlike Pseudo Labels where the teacher is ﬁxed, the teacher in Meta Pseudo Labels is constantly adapted by the feedback of the student’s performance on the labeled dataset. As a result, the teacher generates better pseudo labels to teach the student.1
