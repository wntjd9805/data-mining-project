Single-shot monocular birefractive stereo methods have been used for estimating sparse depth from double refrac-tion over edges. They also obtain an ordinary-ray (o-ray) image concurrently or subsequently through additional post-processing of depth densiÔ¨Åcation and deconvolution.However, when an extraordinary-ray (e-ray) image is re-stored to acquire stereo images, the existing methods suffer from very severe restoration artifacts due to a low signal-to-noise ratio of input e-ray image or depth/deconvolution er-rors. In this work, we present a novel stereo image restora-tion network that can restore stereo images directly from a double-refraction image. First, we built a physically faithful birefractive stereo imaging dataset by simulating the dou-ble refraction phenomenon with existing RGB-D datasets.Second, we formulated a joint stereo restoration problem that accounts for not only geometric relation between o-/e-ray images but also joint optimization of restoring both stereo images. We trained our model with our birefrac-tive image dataset in an end-to-end manner. Our model restores high-quality stereo images directly from double re-fraction in real-time, enabling high-quality stereo video us-ing a monocular camera. Our method also allows us to esti-mate dense depth maps from stereo images using a conven-tional stereo method. We evaluate the performance of our method experimentally and synthetically with the ground truth. Results validate that our stereo image restoration network outperforms the existing methods with high accu-racy. We demonstrate several image-editing applications using our high-quality stereo images and dense depth maps.
