(a) Apperance Only (b) Correlation BoostRecent works have shown that convolutional networks have substantially improved the performance of multiple object tracking by simultaneously learning detection and appearance features. However, due to the local perception of the convolutional network structure itself, the long-range dependencies in both the spatial and temporal cannot be obtained efﬁciently. To incorporate the spatial layout, we propose to exploit the local correlation module to model the topological relationship between targets and their sur-rounding environment, which can enhance the discrimina-tive power of our model in crowded scenes. Speciﬁcally, we establish dense correspondences of each spatial loca-tion and its context, and explicitly constrain the correla-tion volumes through self-supervised learning. To exploit the temporal context, existing approaches generally utilize two or more adjacent frames to construct an enhanced fea-ture representation, but the dynamic motion scene is inher-ently difﬁcult to depict via CNNs. Instead, our paper pro-poses a learnable correlation operator to establish frame-to-frame matches over convolutional feature maps in the different layers to align and propagate temporal context.With extensive experimental results on the MOT datasets, our approach demonstrates the effectiveness of correlation learning with the superior performance and obtains state-of-the-art MOTA of 76.5% and IDF1 of 73.6% on MOT17.
