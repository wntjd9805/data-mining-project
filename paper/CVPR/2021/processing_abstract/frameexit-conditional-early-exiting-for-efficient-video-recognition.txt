In this paper, we propose a conditional early exiting framework for efﬁcient video recognition. While existing works focus on selecting a subset of salient frames to re-duce the computation costs, we propose to use a simple sampling strategy combined with conditional early exiting to enable efﬁcient recognition. Our model automatically learns to process fewer frames for simpler videos and more frames for complex ones. To achieve this, we employ a cas-cade of gating modules to automatically determine the ear-liest point in processing where an inference is sufﬁciently reliable. We generate on-the-ﬂy supervision signals to the gates to provide a dynamic trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. Our proposed model outperforms com-peting methods on three large-scale video benchmarks. In particular, on ActivityNet1.3 and mini-kinetics, we outper-form the state-of-the-art efﬁcient video recognition methods with 1.3× and 2.1× less GFLOPs, respectively. Addition-ally, our method sets a new state of the art for efﬁcient video understanding on the HVU benchmark.
