The remarkable success in face forgery techniques has received considerable attention in computer vision due to security concerns. We observe that up-sampling is a nec-essary step of most face forgery techniques, and cumula-tive up-sampling will result in obvious changes in the fre-quency domain, especially in the phase spectrum. Accord-ing to the property of natural images, the phase spectrum preserves abundant frequency components that provide ex-tra information and complement the loss of the amplitude spectrum. To this end, we present a novel Spatial-PhaseShallow Learning (SPSL) method, which combines spa-tial image and phase spectrum to capture the up-sampling artifacts of face forgery to improve the transferability, for face forgery detection. And we also theoretically analyze the validity of utilizing the phase spectrum. Moreover, we notice that local texture information is more crucial than high-level semantic information for the face forgery detec-tion task. So we reduce the receptive ﬁelds by shallowing the network to suppress high-level features and focus on the local region. Extensive experiments show that SPSL can achieve the state-of-the-art performance on cross-datasets evaluation as well as multi-class classiﬁcation and obtain comparable results on single dataset evaluation.
