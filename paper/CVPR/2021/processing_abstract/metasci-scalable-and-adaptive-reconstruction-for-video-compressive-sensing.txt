To capture high-speed videos using a two-dimensional detector, video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) is a promising system, where the video frames are coded by dif-ferent masks and then compressed to a snapshot measure-ment. Following this, efﬁcient algorithms are desired to re-construct the high-speed frames, where the state-of-the-art results are achieved by deep learning networks. However, these networks are usually trained for speciﬁc small-scale masks and often have high demands of training time andGPU memory, which are hence not ﬂexible to i) a new mask with the same size and ii) a larger-scale mask. We address these challenges by developing a Meta Modulated Convo-lutional Network for SCI reconstruction, dubbed MetaSCI.MetaSCI is composed of a shared backbone for different masks, and light-weight meta-modulation parameters to evolve to different modulation parameters for each mask, thus having the properties of fast adaptation to new masks (or systems) and ready to scale to large data. Extensive sim-ulation and real data results demonstrate the superior per-formance of our proposed approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/xyvirtualgroup/MetaSCI-CVPR2021.
