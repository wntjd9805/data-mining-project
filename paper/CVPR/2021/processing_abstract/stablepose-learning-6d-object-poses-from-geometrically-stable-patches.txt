We introduce the concept of geometric stability to the problem of 6D object pose estimation and propose to learn pose inference based on geometrically stable patches ex-tracted from observed 3D point clouds. According to the theory of geometric stability analysis, a minimal set of three planar/cylindrical patches are geometrically stable and de-termine the full 6DoFs of the object pose. We train a deep neural network to regress 6D object pose based on geomet-rically stable patch groups via learning both intra-patch ge-ometric features and inter-patch contextual features. A sub-network is jointly trained to predict per-patch poses. This auxiliary task is a relaxation of the group pose prediction:A single patch cannot determine the full 6DoFs but is able to improve pose accuracy in its corresponding DoFs. Work-ing with patch groups makes our method generalize well for random occlusion and unseen instances. The method is eas-ily amenable to resolve symmetry ambiguities. Our method achieves the state-of-the-art results on public benchmarks compared not only to depth-only but also to RGBD meth-ods. It also performs well in category-level pose estimation.
