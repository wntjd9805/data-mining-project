This paper presents an end-to-end neural network for multiple rotation averaging in SfM. Due to the manifold constraint of rotations, conventional methods usually take two separate steps involving spanning tree based initial-ization and iterative nonlinear optimization respectively.These methods can suffer from bad initializations due to the noisy spanning tree or outliers in input relative rotations.To handle these problems, we propose to integrate initial-ization and optimization together in an uniﬁed graph neural network via a novel differentiable multi-source propagation module. Speciﬁcally, our network utilizes the image context and geometric cues in feature correspondences to reduce the impact of outliers. Furthermore, unlike the methods that utilize the spanning tree to initialize orientations according to a single reference node in a top-down manner, our net-work initializes orientations according to multiple sources while utilizing information from all neighbors in a differen-tiable way. More importantly, our end-to-end formulation also enables iterative re-weighting of input relative orienta-tions at test time to improve the accuracy of the ﬁnal estima-tion by minimizing the impact of outliers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
