Face synthesis, including face aging, in particular, has been one of the major topics that witnessed a substantial im-provement in image ﬁdelity by using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Most existing face aging approaches di-vide the dataset into several age groups and leverage group-based training strategies, which lacks the ability to provideﬁne-controlled continuous aging synthesis in nature. In this work, we propose a uniﬁed network structure that embeds a linear age estimator into a GAN-based model, where the embedded age estimator is trained jointly with the encoder and decoder to estimate the age of a face image and pro-vide a personalized target age embedding for age progres-sion/regression. The personalized target age embedding is synthesized by incorporating both personalized residual age embedding of the current age and exemplar-face aging basis of the target age, where all preceding aging bases are derived from the learned weights of the linear age estimator.This formulation brings the uniﬁed perspective of estimat-ing the age and generating personalized aged face, where self-estimated age embeddings can be learned for every sin-gle age. The qualitative and quantitative evaluations on dif-ferent datasets further demonstrate the signiﬁcant improve-ment in the continuous face aging aspect over the state-of-the-art.
