Existing rain image editing methods focus on either re-moving rain from rain images or rendering rain on rain-free images. This paper proposes to realize continuous con-trol of rain intensity bidirectionally, from clear rain-free to downpour image with a single rain image as input, with-out changing the scene-speciﬁc characteristics, e.g. the di-rection, appearance and distribution of rain. Speciﬁcally, we introduce a Rain Intensity Controlling Network (RIC-Net) that contains three sub-networks of background extrac-tion network, high-frequency rain-streak elimination net-work and main controlling network, which allows to con-trol rain image of different intensities continuously by in-terpolation in the deep feature space. The HOG loss and autocorrelation loss are proposed to enhance consistency in orientation and suppress repetitive rain streaks. Further-more, a decremental learning strategy that trains the net-work from downpour to drizzle images sequentially is pro-posed to further improve the performance and speedup the convergence. Extensive experiments on both rain dataset and real rain images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
