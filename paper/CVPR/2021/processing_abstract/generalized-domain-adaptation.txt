Class LabeledClass UnlabeledUnknownMany variants of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) problems have been proposed and solved individ-ually.Its side effect is that a method that works for one variant is often ineffective for or not even applicable to an-other, which has prevented practical applications. In this paper, we give a general representation of UDA problems, named Generalized Domain Adaptation (GDA). GDA cov-ers the major variants as special cases, which allows us to organize them in a comprehensive framework. Moreover, this generalization leads to a new challenging setting where existing methods fail, such as when domain labels are un-known, and class labels are only partially given to each domain. We propose a novel approach to the new setting.The key to our approach is self-supervised class-destructive learning, which enables the learning of class-invariant rep-resentations and domain-adversarial classiÔ¨Åers without us-ing any domain labels. Extensive experiments using three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outper-forms the state-of-the-art UDA methods in the new setting and that it is competitive in existing UDA variations as well.
