Recognition and reconstruction of residential ﬂoor plan drawings are important and challenging in design, deco-ration, and architectural remodeling ﬁelds. An automatic framework is provided that accurately recognizes the struc-ture, type, and size of the room, and outputs vectorized 3D reconstruction results. Deep segmentation and detection neural networks are utilized to extract room structural in-formation. Key points detection network and cluster anal-ysis are utilized to calculate scales of rooms. The vector-ization of room information is processed through an itera-tive optimization-based method. The system signiﬁcantly in-creases accuracy and generalization ability, compared with existing methods. It outperforms other systems in ﬂoor plan segmentation and vectorization process, especially inclined wall detection.
