Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in semantic segmentation is a fundamental yet promising task reliev-ing the need for laborious annotation works. However, the domain shifts/discrepancies problem in this task compro-mise the ﬁnal segmentation performance. Based on our observation, the main causes of the domain shifts are dif-ferences in imaging conditions, called image-level domain shifts, and differences in object category conﬁgurations called category-level domain shifts. In this paper, we pro-pose a novel UDA pipeline that uniﬁes image-level align-ment and category-level feature distribution regularization in a coarse-to-ﬁne manner. Speciﬁcally, on the coarse side, we propose a photometric alignment module that aligns an image in the source domain with a reference image from the target domain using a set of image-level operators; on the ﬁne side, we propose a category-oriented triplet loss that imposes a soft constraint to regularize category cen-ters in the source domain and a self-supervised consistency regularization method in the target domain. Experimental results show that our proposed pipeline improves the gen-eralization capability of the ﬁnal segmentation model and signiﬁcantly outperforms all previous state-of-the-arts.
