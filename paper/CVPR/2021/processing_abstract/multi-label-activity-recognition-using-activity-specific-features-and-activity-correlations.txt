Multi-label activity recognition is designed for recogniz-ing multiple activities that are performed simultaneously or sequentially in each video. Most recent activity recogni-tion networks focus on single-activities, that assume only one activity in each video. These networks extract shared features for all the activities, which are not designed for multi-label activities. We introduce an approach to multi-label activity recognition that extracts independent feature descriptors for each activity and learns activity correla-tions. This structure can be trained end-to-end and plugged into any existing network structures for video classiﬁcation.Our method outperformed state-of-the-art approaches on four multi-label activity recognition datasets. To better un-derstand the activity-speciﬁc features that the system gen-erated, we visualized these activity-speciﬁc features in theCharades dataset. The code will be released later.
