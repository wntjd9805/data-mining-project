We show that explicit modeling of composition rules beneﬁts image cropping. Image cropping is considered a promising way to automate aesthetic composition in profes-sional photography. Existing efforts, however, only model such professional knowledge implicitly, e.g., by ranking from comparative candidates. Inspired by the observation that natural composition traits always follow a speciﬁc rule, we propose to learn such rules in a discriminative manner, and more importantly, to incorporate learned composition clues explicitly in the model. To this end, we introduce the concept of the key composition map (KCM) to encode the composition rules. The KCM can reveal the common laws hidden behind different composition rules and can in-form the cropping model of what is important in compo-sition. With the KCM, we present a novel cropping-by-composition paradigm and instantiate a network to imple-ment composition-aware image cropping. Extensive experi-ments on two benchmarks justify that our approach enables effective, interpretable, and fast image cropping.
