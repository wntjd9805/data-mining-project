We present PatchmatchNet, a novel and learnable cas-cade formulation of Patchmatch for high-resolution multi-view stereo. With high computation speed and low memory requirement, PatchmatchNet can process higher resolution imagery and is more suited to run on resource limited de-vices than competitors that employ 3D cost volume regular-ization. For the ﬁrst time we introduce an iterative multi-scale Patchmatch in an end-to-end trainable architecture and improve the Patchmatch core algorithm with a novel and learned adaptive propagation and evaluation scheme for each iteration. Extensive experiments show a very com-petitive performance and generalization for our method onDTU, Tanks & Temples and ETH3D, but at a signiﬁcantly higher efﬁciency than all existing top-performing models: at least two and a half times faster than state-of-the-art methods with twice less memory usage.
