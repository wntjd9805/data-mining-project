Compositional Zero-Shot learning (CZSL) requires to recognize state-object compositions unseen during training.In this work, instead of assuming prior knowledge about the unseen compositions, we operate in the open world setting, where the search space includes a large number of unseen compositions some of which might be unfeasible. In this set-ting, we start from the cosine similarity between visual fea-tures and compositional embeddings. After estimating the feasibility score of each composition, we use these scores to either directly mask the output space or as a margin for the cosine similarity between visual features and compo-sitional embeddings during training. Our experiments on two standard CZSL benchmarks show that all the meth-ods suffer severe performance degradation when applied in the open world setting. While our simple CZSL model achieves state-of-the-art performances in the closed world scenario, our feasibility scores boost the performance of our approach in the open world setting, clearly outper-forming the previous state of the art.
