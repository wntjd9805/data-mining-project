Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) remains an open problem given the deﬁciency of ﬁnding object extent information using a classiﬁcation network. Although prior works struggled to localize objects through various spatial regularization strategies, we argue that how to extract object structural information from the trained classiﬁcation network is neglected. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach, termed structure-preserving activation (SPA), to-ward fully leveraging the structure information incorporated in convolutional features for WSOL. First, a restricted acti-vation module (RAM) is designed to alleviate the structure-missing issue caused by the classiﬁcation network on the ba-sis of the observation that the unbounded classiﬁcation map and global average pooling layer drive the network to focus only on object parts. Second, we designed a post-process approach, termed self-correlation map generating (SCG) module to obtain structure-preserving localization maps on the basis of the activation maps acquired from the ﬁrst stage. Speciﬁcally, we utilize the high-order self-correlation (HSC) to extract the inherent structural information retained in the learned model and then aggregate HSC of multiple points for precise object localization. Extensive experiments on two publicly available benchmarks including CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC show that the proposed SPA achieves substantial and consistent performance gains compared with baseline approaches.
