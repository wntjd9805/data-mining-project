Input ImageWith the development of deep learning techniques, the combination of deep learning with image compression has drawn lots of attention. Recently, learned image compres-sion methods had exceeded their classical counterparts in terms of rate-distortion performance. However, continuous rate adaptation remains an open question. Some learned image compression methods use multiple networks for mul-tiple rates, while others use one single model at the ex-pense of computational complexity increase and perfor-mance degradation.In this paper, we propose a contin-uously rate adjustable learned image compression frame-work, Asymmetric Gained Variational Autoencoder (AG-VAE). AG-VAE utilizes a pair of gain units to achieve dis-crete rate adaptation in one single model with a negligi-ble additional computation. Then, by using exponential in-terpolation, continuous rate adaptation is achieved without compromising performance. Besides, we propose the asym-metric Gaussian entropy model for more accurate entropy estimation. Exhaustive experiments show that our method achieves comparable quantitative performance with SOTA learned image compression methods and better qualitative performance than classical image codecs. In the ablation study, we conÔ¨Årm the usefulness and superiority of gain units and the asymmetric Gaussian entropy model.
