Input  Point Cloud PC1Input  Point Cloud PC2A novel 3D point cloud learning model for deep LiDAR odometry, named PWCLO-Net, using hierarchical embed-ding mask optimization is proposed in this paper. In this model, the Pyramid, Warping, and Cost volume (PWC) struc-ture for the LiDAR odometry task is built to reﬁne the esti-mated pose in a coarse-to-ﬁne approach hierarchically. An attentive cost volume is built to associate two point clouds and obtain embedding motion patterns. Then, a novel train-able embedding mask is proposed to weigh the local mo-tion patterns of all points to regress the overall pose andﬁlter outlier points. The estimated current pose is used to warp the ﬁrst point cloud to bridge the distance to the second point cloud, and then the cost volume of the resid-ual motion is built. At the same time, the embedding mask is optimized hierarchically from coarse to ﬁne to obtain more accurate ﬁltering information for pose reﬁnement. The trainable pose warp-reﬁnement process is iteratively used to make the pose estimation more robust for outliers. The superior performance and effectiveness of our LiDAR odom-etry model are demonstrated on KITTI odometry dataset.Our method outperforms all recent learning-based meth-ods and outperforms the geometry-based approach, LOAM with mapping optimization, on most sequences of KITTI odometry dataset. Our source codes will be released on https://github.com/IRMVLab/PWCLONet.
