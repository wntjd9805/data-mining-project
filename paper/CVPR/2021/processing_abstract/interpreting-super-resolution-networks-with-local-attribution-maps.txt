FSRCNNEDSRNon-local SRNImage super-resolution (SR) techniques have been de-veloping rapidly, beneﬁting from the invention of deep net-works and its successive breakthroughs. However, it is ac-knowledged that deep learning and deep neural networks are difﬁcult to interpret. SR networks inherit this mysterious nature and little works make attempt to understand them. In this paper, we perform attribution analysis of SR networks, which aims at ﬁnding the input pixels that strongly inﬂuence the SR results. We propose a novel attribution approach called local attribution map (LAM), which inherits the inte-gral gradient method yet with two unique features. One is to use the blurred image as the baseline input, and the other is to adopt the progressive blurring function as the path func-tion. Based on LAM, we show that: (1) SR networks with a wider range of involved input pixels could achieve bet-ter performance. (2) Attention networks and non-local net-works extract features from a wider range of input pixels. (3) Comparing with the range that actually contributes, the receptive ﬁeld is large enough for most deep networks. (4)For SR networks, textures with regular stripes or grids are more likely to be noticed, while complex semantics are difﬁ-cult to utilize. Our work opens new directions for designingSR networks and interpreting low-level vision deep models.
