Inception convolutionInception convolutionAs a variant of standard convolution, a dilated convolu-tion can control effective receptive ﬁelds and handle large scale variance of objects without introducing additional computational costs. To fully explore the potential of di-lated convolution, we proposed a new type of dilated con-volution (referred to as inception convolution), where the convolution operations have independent dilation patterns among different axes, channels and layers. To develop a practical method for learning complex inception convolu-tion based on the data, a simple but effective search algo-rithm, referred to as efﬁcient dilation optimization (EDO), is developed. Based on statistical optimization, the EDO method operates in a low-cost manner and is extremely fast when it is applied on large scale datasets. Empirical results validate that our method achieves consistent performance gains for image recognition, object detection, instance seg-mentation, human detection, and human pose estimation.For instance, by simply replacing the 3 × 3 standard con-volution in the ResNet-50 backbone with inception convolu-tion, we signiﬁcantly improve the AP of Faster R-CNN from 36.4% to 39.2% on MS COCO.
