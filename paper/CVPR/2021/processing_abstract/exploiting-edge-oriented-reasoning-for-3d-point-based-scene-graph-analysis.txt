Scene understanding is a critical problem in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a 3D point-based scene graph generation (SGGpoint) framework to effectively bridge perception and reasoning to achieve scene under-standing via three sequential stages, namely scene graph construction, reasoning, and inference. Within the reason-ing stage, an EDGE-oriented Graph Convolutional Net-work (EdgeGCN) is created to exploit multi-dimensional edge features for explicit relationship modeling, together with the exploration of two associated twinning interac-tion mechanisms between nodes and edges for the inde-pendent evolution of scene graph representations. Overall, our integrated SGGpoint framework is established to seek and infer scene structures of interest from both real-world and synthetic 3D point-based scenes. Our experimental results show promising edge-oriented reasoning effects on scene graph generation studies. We also demonstrate our method advantage on several traditional graph representa-tion learning benchmark datasets, including the node-wise classiÔ¨Åcation on citation networks and whole-graph recog-nition problems for molecular analysis.
