Perhaps surprisingly sewerage infrastructure is one of the most costly infrastructures in modern society. Sewer pipes are manually inspected to determine whether the pipes are defective. However, this process is limited by the number of qualiﬁed inspectors and the time it takes to in-spect a pipe. Automatization of this process is therefore of high interest. So far, the success of computer vision ap-proaches for sewer defect classiﬁcation has been limited when compared to the success in other ﬁelds mainly due to the lack of public datasets. To this end, in this work we present a large novel and publicly available multi-label classiﬁcation dataset for image-based sewer defect classiﬁ-cation called Sewer-ML.The Sewer-ML dataset consists of 1.3 million images annotated by professional sewer inspectors from three dif-ferent utility companies across nine years. Together with the dataset, we also present a benchmark algorithm and a novel metric for assessing performance. The benchmark algorithm is a result of evaluating 12 state-of-the-art al-gorithms, six from the sewer defect classiﬁcation domain and six from the multi-label classiﬁcation domain, and com-bining the best performing algorithms. The novel metric is a class-importance weighted F2 score, F2CIW, reﬂecting the economic impact of each class, used together with the normal pipe F1 score, F1Normal. The benchmark algorithm achieves an F2CIW score of 55.11% and F1Normal score of 90.94%, leaving ample room for improvement on the Sewer-ML dataset.
