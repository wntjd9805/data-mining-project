SourceFunctional MapAdjoint +Fast Sinkhorn FilterIn this paper, we provide a theoretical foundation for pointwise map recovery from functional maps and highlight its relation to a range of shape correspondence methods based on spectral alignment. With this analysis in hand, we develop a novel spectral registration technique: FastSinkhorn Filters, which allows for the recovery of accu-rate and bijective pointwise correspondences with a su-perior time and memory complexity in comparison to ex-isting approaches. Our method combines the simple and concise representation of correspondence using functional maps with the matrix scaling schemes from computational optimal transport. By exploiting the sparse structure of the kernel matrices involved in the transport map computation, we provide an efﬁcient trade-off between acceptable accu-racy and complexity for the problem of dense shape corre-spondence, while promoting bijectivity.1
