Spatial ModuleWe propose the Temporal Point Cloud Networks (TPCN), a novel and ﬂexible framework with joint spatial and tem-poral learning for trajectory prediction. Unlike existing ap-proaches that rasterize agents and map information as 2D images or operate in a graph representation, our approach extends ideas from point cloud learning with dynamic tem-poral learning to capture both spatial and temporal infor-mation by splitting trajectory prediction into both spatial and temporal dimensions. In the spatial dimension, agents can be viewed as an unordered point set, and thus it is straightforward to apply point cloud learning techniques to model agents’ locations. While the spatial dimension does not take kinematic and motion information into ac-count, we further propose dynamic temporal learning to model agents’ motion over time. Experiments on the Argov-erse motion forecasting benchmark show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results.
