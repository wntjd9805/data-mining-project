HR frame (SISO)LR frame (SISO)Recon. HR frameThis paper addresses the video rescaling task, which arises from the needs of adapting the video spatial reso-lution to suit individual viewing devices. We aim to jointly optimize video downscaling and upscaling as a combined task. Most recent studies focus on image-based solutions, which do not consider temporal information. We present two joint optimization approaches based on invertible neu-ral networks with coupling layers. Our Long Short-TermMemory Video Rescaling Network (LSTM-VRN) leverages temporal information in the low-resolution video to form an explicit prediction of the missing high-frequency infor-mation for upscaling. Our Multi-input Multi-output VideoRescaling Network (MIMO-VRN) proposes a new strategy for downscaling and upscaling a group of video frames si-multaneously. Not only do they outperform the image-based invertible model in terms of quantitative and qualitative re-sults, but also show much improved upscaling quality than the video rescaling methods without joint optimization. To our best knowledge, this work is the ﬁrst attempt at the joint optimization of video downscaling and upscaling.DU (a) SISO-down-SISO-upHR frame (SISO)LR frame (MISO)Recon. HR frameDUTemporal Info.
