It is nontrivial to store rapidly growing big data nowa-days, which demands high-performance lossless compres-sion techniques. Likelihood-based generative models have witnessed their success on lossless compression, where ﬂow based models are desirable in allowing exact data likeli-hood optimisation with bijective mappings. However, com-mon continuous ﬂows are in contradiction with the discrete-ness of coding schemes, which requires either 1) impos-ing strict constraints on ﬂow models that degrades the per-formance or 2) coding numerous bijective mapping errors which reduces the efﬁciency. In this paper, we investigate volume preserving ﬂows for lossless compression and show that a bijective mapping without error is possible. We pro-pose Numerical Invertible Volume Preserving Flow (iVPF) which is derived from the general volume preserving ﬂows.By introducing novel computation algorithms on ﬂow mod-els, an exact bijective mapping is achieved without any nu-merical error. We also propose a lossless compression al-gorithm based on iVPF. Experiments on various datasets show that the algorithm based on iVPF achieves state-of-the-art compression ratio over lightweight compression al-gorithms.
