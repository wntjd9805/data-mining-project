In this paper we reformulate few-shot classiﬁcation as a reconstruction problem in latent space. The ability of the network to reconstruct a query feature map from support features of a given class predicts membership of the query in that class. We introduce a novel mechanism for few-shot classiﬁcation by regressing directly from support features to query features in closed form, without introducing any new modules or large-scale learnable parameters. The result-ing Feature Map Reconstruction Networks are both more performant and computationally efﬁcient than previous ap-proaches. We demonstrate consistent and substantial ac-curacy gains on four ﬁne-grained benchmarks with vary-ing neural architectures. Our model is also competitive on the non-ﬁne-grained mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet benchmarks with minimal bells and whistles.1
