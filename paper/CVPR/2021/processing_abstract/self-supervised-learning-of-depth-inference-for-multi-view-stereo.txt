Recent supervised multi-view depth estimation networks have achieved promising results.Similar to all super-vised approaches, these networks require ground-truth data during training. However, collecting a large amount of multi-view depth data is very challenging. Here, we pro-pose a self-supervised learning framework for multi-view stereo that exploit pseudo labels from the input data. We start by learning to estimate depth maps as initial pseudo labels under an unsupervised learning framework rely-ing on image reconstruction loss as supervision. We then reÔ¨Åne the initial pseudo labels using a carefully de-signed pipeline leveraging depth information inferred from a higher resolution image and neighboring views. We use these high-quality pseudo labels as the supervision sig-nal to train the network and improve, iteratively, its per-formance by self-training. Extensive experiments on theDTU dataset show that our proposed self-supervised learn-ing framework outperforms existing unsupervised multi-view stereo networks by a large margin and performs on par compared to the supervised counterpart.
