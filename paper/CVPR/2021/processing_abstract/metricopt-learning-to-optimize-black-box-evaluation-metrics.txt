(a)Loss-based trajectory (b)Loss & metric-based trajectoryWe study the problem of directly optimizing arbitrary non-differentiable task evaluation metrics such as misclas-siﬁcation rate and recall. Our method, named MetricOpt, operates in a black-box setting where the computational de-tails of the target metric are unknown. We achieve this by learning a differentiable value function, which maps com-pact task-speciﬁc model parameters to metric observations.The learned value function is easily pluggable into existing optimizers like SGD and Adam, and is effective for rapidlyﬁnetuning a pre-trained model. This leads to consistent im-provements since the value function provides effective met-ric supervision during ﬁnetuning, and helps to correct the potential bias of loss-only supervision. MetricOpt achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of metrics for (im-age) classiﬁcation, image retrieval and object detection.Solid beneﬁts are found over competing methods, which of-ten involve complex loss design or adaptation. MetricOpt also generalizes well to new tasks and model architectures.
