In computer-aided design (CAD), the ability to “reverse engineer” the modeling steps used to create 3D shapes is a long-sought-after goal. This process can be decomposed into two sub-problems: converting an input mesh or point cloud into a boundary representation (or B-rep), and then inferring modeling operations which construct this B-rep.In this paper, we present a new system for solving the sec-ond sub-problem. Central to our approach is a new geo-metric representation: the zone graph. Zones are the set of solid regions formed by extending all B-Rep faces and partitioning space with them; a zone graph has these zones as its nodes, with edges denoting geometric adjacencies be-tween them. Zone graphs allow us to tractably work with industry-standard CAD operations, unlike prior work usingCSG with parametric primitives. We focus on CAD pro-grams consisting of sketch + extrude + Boolean operations, which are common in CAD practice. We phrase our prob-lem as search in the space of such extrusions permitted by the zone graph, and we train a graph neural network to score potential extrusions in order to accelerate the search.We show that our approach outperforms an existing CSG inference baseline in terms of geometric reconstruction ac-curacy and reconstruction time, while also creating more plausible modeling sequences.
