Recent advances in person re-identiﬁcation (ReID) ob-tain impressive accuracy in the supervised and unsuper-vised learning settings. However, most of the existing meth-ods need to train a new model for a new domain by access-ing data. Due to public privacy, the new domain data are not always accessible, leading to a limited applicability of these methods. In this paper, we study the problem of multi-source domain generalization in ReID, which aims to learn a model that can perform well on unseen domains with only several labeled source domains. To address this prob-lem, we propose the Memory-based Multi-Source Meta-Learning (M3L) framework to train a generalizable model for unseen domains. Speciﬁcally, a meta-learning strat-egy is introduced to simulate the train-test process of do-main generalization for learning more generalizable mod-els. To overcome the unstable meta-optimization caused by the parametric classiﬁer, we propose a memory-based iden-tiﬁcation loss that is non-parametric and harmonizes with meta-learning. We also present a meta batch normaliza-tion layer (MetaBN) to diversify meta-test features, further establishing the advantage of meta-learning. Experiments demonstrate that our M3L can effectively enhance the gen-eralization ability of the model for unseen domains and can outperform the state-of-the-art methods on four large-scaleReID datasets.
