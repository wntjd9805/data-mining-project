Shapes are often designed to satisfy structural proper-ties and serve a particular functionality in the physical world. Unfortunately, most existing generative models fo-cus primarily on the geometric or visual plausibility, ignor-ing the physical or structural constraints. To remedy this, we present a novel method aimed to endow deep generative models with physical reasoning. In particular, we introduce a loss and a learning framework that promote two key char-acteristics of the generated shapes: their connectivity and physical stability. The former ensures that each generated shape consists of a single connected component, while the latter promotes the stability of that shape when subjected to gravity. Our proposed physical losses are fully differ-entiable and we demonstrate their use in end-to-end learn-ing. Crucially we demonstrate that such physical objectives can be achieved without sacriﬁcing the expressive power of the model and variability of the generated results. We demonstrate through extensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art deep generative models, the utility and efﬁciency of our proposed approach, while avoiding the potentially costly differentiable physical simulation at training time.
