Recently, the transductive graph-based methods have achieved great success in the few-shot classiﬁcation task.However, most existing methods ignore exploring the class-level knowledge that can be easily learned by humans from just a handful of samples.In this paper, we propose anExplicit Class Knowledge Propagation Network (ECKPN), which is composed of the comparison, squeeze and cali-bration modules, to address this problem. Speciﬁcally, weﬁrst employ the comparison module to explore the pairwise sample relations to learn rich sample representations in the instance-level graph. Then, we squeeze the instance-level graph to generate the class-level graph, which can help obtain the class-level visual knowledge and facilitate mod-eling the relations of different classes. Next, the calibra-tion module is adopted to characterize the relations of the classes explicitly to obtain the more discriminative class-level knowledge representations. Finally, we combine the class-level knowledge with the instance-level sample repre-sentations to guide the inference of the query samples. We conduct extensive experiments on four few-shot classiﬁca-tion benchmarks, and the experimental results show that the proposed ECKPN signiﬁcantly outperforms the state-of-the art methods.
