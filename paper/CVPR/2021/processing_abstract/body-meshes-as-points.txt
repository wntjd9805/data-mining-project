We consider the challenging multi-person 3D body mesh estimation task in this work. Existing methods are mostly two-stage based—one stage for person localization and the other stage for individual body mesh estimation, lead-ing to redundant pipelines with high computation cost and degraded performance for complex scenes (e.g., occluded person instances).In this work, we present a single-stage model, Body Meshes as Points (BMP), to simplify the pipeline and lift both efﬁciency and performance. In par-ticular, BMP adopts a new method that represents multiple person instances as points in the spatial-depth space where each point is associated with one body mesh. Hinging on such representations, BMP can directly predict body meshes for multiple persons in a single stage by concurrently local-izing person instance points and estimating the correspond-ing body meshes. To better reason about depth ordering of all the persons within the same scene, BMP designs a simple yet effective inter-instance ordinal depth loss to ob-tain depth-coherent body mesh estimation. BMP also in-troduces a novel keypoint-aware augmentation to enhance model robustness to occluded person instances. Compre-hensive experiments on benchmarks Panoptic, MuPoTS-3D and 3DPW clearly demonstrate the state-of-the-art ef-ﬁciency of BMP for multi-person body mesh estimation, to-gether with outstanding accuracy.
