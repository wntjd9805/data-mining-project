Text segmentation is a prerequisite in many real-world text-related tasks, e.g., text style transfer, and scene text re-moval. However, facing the lack of high-quality datasets and dedicated investigations, this critical prerequisite has been left as an assumption in many works, and has been largely overlooked by current research. To bridge this gap, we proposed TextSeg, a large-scale ﬁne-annotated text dataset with six types of annotations: word- and character-wise bounding polygons, masks, and transcrip-tions. We also introduce Text Reﬁnement Network (TexR-Net), a novel text segmentation approach that adapts to the unique properties of text, e.g. non-convex boundary, di-verse texture, etc., which often impose burdens on tradi-tional segmentation models.In our TexRNet, we propose text-speciﬁc network designs to address such challenges, including key features pooling and attention-based similar-ity checking. We also introduce trimap and discriminator losses that show signiﬁcant improvement in text segmenta-tion. Extensive experiments are carried out on both ourTextSeg dataset and other existing datasets. We demon-strate that TexRNet consistently improves text segmenta-tion performance by nearly 2% compared to other state-of-the-art segmentation methods.
