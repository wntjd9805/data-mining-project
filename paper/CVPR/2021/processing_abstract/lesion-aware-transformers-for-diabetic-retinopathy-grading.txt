Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of per-manent blindness in the working-age population. And au-tomatic DR diagnosis can assist ophthalmologists to design tailored treatments for patients, including DR grading and lesion discovery. However, most of existing methods treatDR grading and lesion discovery as two independent tasks, which require lesion annotations as a learning guidance and limits the actual deployment. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel lesion-aware transformer (LAT) for DR grading and lesion discovery jointly in a uniﬁed deep model via an encoder-decoder structure including a pixel relation based encoder and a lesion ﬁlter based decoder. The pro-posed LAT enjoys several merits. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work to formulate lesion discov-ery as a weakly supervised lesion localization problem via a transformer decoder. Second, to learn lesion ﬁlters well with only image-level labels, we design two effective mecha-nisms including lesion region importance and lesion region diversity for identifying diverse lesion regions. Extensive experimental results on three challenging benchmarks in-cluding Messidor-1, Messidor-2 and EyePACS demonstrate that the proposed LAT performs favorably against state-of-the-art DR grading and lesion discovery methods.
