InputPONO meanPONO stdThe moments (a.k.a., mean and standard deviation) of latent features are often removed as noise when training image recognition models, to increase stability and reduce training time. However, in the ﬁeld of image generation, the moments play a much more central role. Studies have shown that the moments extracted from instance normal-ization and positional normalization can roughly capture style and shape information of an image. Instead of being discarded, these moments are instrumental to the genera-tion process. In this paper we propose Moment Exchange, an implicit data augmentation method that encourages the model to utilize the moment information also for recogni-tion models. Speciﬁcally, we replace the moments of the learned features of one training image by those of another, and also interpolate the target labels—forcing the model to extract training signal from the moments in addition to the normalized features. As our approach is fast, operates en-tirely in feature space, and mixes different signals than prior methods, one can effectively combine it with existing aug-mentation approaches. We demonstrate its efﬁcacy across several recognition benchmark data sets where it improves the generalization capability of highly competitive baseline networks with remarkable consistency.
