＊ RUASi+n(Ours)  18 ＊  17�RUAS i (Ours) Low-light image enhancement plays very important roles in low-level vision areas. Recent works have built a great deal of deep learning models to address this task. Howev-er, these approaches mostly rely on signiﬁcant architecture engineering and suffer from high computational burden.In this paper, we propose a new method, named Retinex-inspired Unrolling with Architecture Search (RUAS), to con-struct lightweight yet effective enhancement network for low-light images in real-world scenario. Speciﬁcally, build-ing upon Retinex rule, RUAS ﬁrst establishes models to characterize the intrinsic underexposed structure of low-light images and unroll their optimization processes to con-struct our holistic propagation structure. Then by design-ing a cooperative reference-free learning strategy to dis-cover low-light prior architectures from a compact search space, RUAS is able to obtain a top-performing image en-hancement network, which is with fast speed and requires few computational resources. Extensive experiments veri-fy the superiority of our RUAS framework against recent-ly proposed state-of-the-art methods. The project page is available at http://dutmedia.org/RUAS/.
