Graph convolution networks (GCNs) are a powerful deep learning approach and have been successfully applied to representation learning on graphs in a variety of real-world applications. Despite their success, two fundamental weaknesses of GCNs limit their ability to represent graph-structured data: poor performance when labeled data are severely scarce and indistinguishable features when more layers are stacked. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Self-Supervised Semantic Alignment Graph Con-volution Network (SelfSAGCN), which consists of two crux techniques: Identity Aggregation and Semantic Alignmen-t, to overcome these weaknesses. The behind basic idea is the node features in the same class but learned from seman-tic and graph structural aspects respectively, are expected to be mapped nearby. Speciﬁcally, the Identity Aggrega-tion is applied to extract semantic features from labeled n-odes, the Semantic Alignment is utilized to align node fea-tures obtained from different aspects using the class central similarity. In this way, the over-smoothing phenomenon is alleviated, while the similarities between the unlabeled fea-tures and labeled ones from the same class are enhanced.Experimental results on ﬁve popular datasets show that the proposed SelfSAGCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various classiﬁcation tasks.
