Recent works on localization and mapping from privacy preserving line features have made signiÔ¨Åcant progress to-wards addressing the privacy concerns arising from cloud-based solutions in mixed reality and robotics. The require-ment for calibrated cameras is a fundamental limitation for these approaches, which prevents their application in many crowd-sourced mapping scenarios. In this paper, we pro-pose a solution to the uncalibrated privacy preserving lo-calization and mapping problem. Our approach simulta-neously recovers the intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of a camera from line-features only. This enables uncalibrated devices to both localize themselves within an existing map as well as contribute to the map, while preserving the pri-vacy of the image contents. Furthermore, we also derive a solution to bootstrapping maps from scratch using only un-calibrated devices. Our approach provides comparable per-formance to the calibrated scenario and the privacy com-promising alternatives based on traditional point features.
