In this paper, we propose a Point-Voxel Recurrent All-Pairs Field Transforms (PV-RAFT) method to estimate scene ﬂow from point clouds. Since point clouds are irregu-lar and unordered, it is challenging to efﬁciently extract fea-tures from all-pairs ﬁelds in the 3D space, where all-pairs correlations play important roles in scene ﬂow estimation.To tackle this problem, we present point-voxel correlationﬁelds, which capture both local and long-range dependen-cies of point pairs. To capture point-based correlations, we adopt the K-Nearest Neighbors search that preserves ﬁne-grained information in the local region. By voxelizing point clouds in a multi-scale manner, we construct pyramid cor-relation voxels to model long-range correspondences. Inte-grating these two types of correlations, our PV-RAFT makes use of all-pairs relations to handle both small and large dis-placements. We evaluate the proposed method on the Fly-ingThings3D and KITTI Scene Flow 2015 datasets. Exper-imental results show that PV-RAFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods by remarkable margins.Figure 1: Illustration of the proposed point-voxel correla-tion ﬁelds. For a point in the source point cloud, we ﬁnd its k-nearest neighbors in the target point cloud to extract point-based correlations. Moreover, we model long-range interactions by building voxels centered around this source point. Combining these two types of correlations, our PV-RAFT captures all-pairs dependencies to deal with both large and small displacements.
