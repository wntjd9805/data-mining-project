While state of the art image segmentation models typ-ically output segmentations in raster format, applications in geographic information systems often require vector polygons. To help bridge the gap between deep network output and the format used in downstream tasks, we add a frame ﬁeld output to a deep segmentation model for extracting buildings from remote sensing images.We train a deep neural network that aligns a predictedThis additional frame ﬁeld to ground truth contours. objective improves segmentation quality by leveraging multi-task learning and provides structural information that later facilitates polygonization; we also introduce a polygonization algorithm that that utilizes the frameOur codeﬁeld along with the raster segmentation. is available at https://github.com/Lydorn/Polygonization-by-Frame-Field-Learning.
