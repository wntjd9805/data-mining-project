Finding correspondences between shapes is a fundamen-tal problem in computer vision and graphics, which is rel-evant for many applications, including 3D reconstruction, object tracking, and style transfer. The vast majority of cor-respondence methods aim to Ô¨Ånd a solution between pairs of shapes, even if multiple instances of the same class are available. While isometries are often studied in shape cor-respondence problems, they have not been considered ex-plicitly in the multi-matching setting. This paper closes this gap by proposing a novel optimisation formulation for isometric multi-shape matching. We present a suitable op-timisation algorithm for solving our formulation and pro-vide a convergence and complexity analysis. Our algorithm obtains multi-matchings that are by construction provably cycle-consistent. We demonstrate the superior performance of our method on various datasets and set the new state-of-the-art in isometric multi-shape matching.
