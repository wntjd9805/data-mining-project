Camouﬂaged object segmentation (COS) aims to iden-tify objects that are “perfectly” assimilate into their sur-roundings, which has a wide range of valuable applications.The key challenge of COS is that there exist high intrinsic similarities between the candidate objects and noise back-ground. In this paper, we strive to embrace challenges to-wards effective and efﬁcient COS. To this end, we develop a bio-inspired framework, termed Positioning and FocusNetwork (PFNet), which mimics the process of predation in nature. Speciﬁcally, our PFNet contains two key mod-ules, i.e., the positioning module (PM) and the focus module (FM). The PM is designed to mimic the detection process in predation for positioning the potential target objects from a global perspective and the FM is then used to perform the identiﬁcation process in predation for progressively re-ﬁning the coarse prediction via focusing on the ambiguous regions. Notably, in the FM, we develop a novel distraction mining strategy for the distraction discovery and removal, to beneﬁt the performance of estimation. Extensive exper-iments demonstrate that our PFNet runs in real-time (72FPS) and signiﬁcantly outperforms 18 cutting-edge models on three challenging datasets under four standard metrics.
