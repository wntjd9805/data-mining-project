Space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) aims to increase the spatial and temporal resolutions of low-resolution and low-frame-rate videos. Recently, deformable convolution based methods have achieved promising STVSR performance, but they could only infer the intermediate frame pre-deﬁned in the training stage. Besides, these meth-ods undervalued the short-term motion cues among adja-cent frames. In this paper, we propose a Temporal Modu-lation Network (TMNet) to interpolate arbitrary interme-diate frame(s) with accurate high-resolution reconstruc-tion. Speciﬁcally, we propose a Temporal Modulation Block (TMB) to modulate deformable convolution kernels for con-trollable feature interpolation. To well exploit the temporal information, we propose a Locally-temporal Feature Com-parison (LFC) module, along with the Bi-directional De-formable ConvLSTM, to extract short-term and long-term motion cues in videos. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our TMNet outperforms previ-ous STVSR methods. The code is available at https://github.com/CS-GangXu/TMNet.
