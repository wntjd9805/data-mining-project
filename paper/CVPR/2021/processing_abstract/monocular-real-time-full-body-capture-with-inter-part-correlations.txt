We present the ﬁrst method for real-time full body cap-ture that estimates shape and motion of body and hands to-gether with a dynamic 3D face model from a single color image. Our approach uses a new neural network architec-ture that exploits correlations between body and hands at high computational efﬁciency. Unlike previous works, our approach is jointly trained on multiple datasets focusing on hand, body or face separately, without requiring data where all the parts are annotated at the same time, which is much more difﬁcult to create at sufﬁcient variety. The possibility of such multi-dataset training enables superior generalization ability. In contrast to earlier monocular full body methods, our approach captures more expressive 3D face geometry and color by estimating the shape, expres-sion, albedo and illumination parameters of a statistical face model. Our method achieves competitive accuracy on public benchmarks, while being signiﬁcantly faster and pro-viding more complete face reconstructions.
