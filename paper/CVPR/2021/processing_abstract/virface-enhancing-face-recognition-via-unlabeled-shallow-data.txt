Recently, how to exploit unlabeled data for training face recognition models has been attracting increasing atten-tion. However, few works consider the unlabeled shallow data1 in real-world scenarios. The existing semi-supervised face recognition methods that focus on generating pseudo labels or minimizing softmax classiﬁcation probabilities of the unlabeled data do not work very well on the unlabeled shallow data. It is still a challenge on how to effectively uti-lize the unlabeled shallow face data to improve the perfor-mance of face recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel face recognition method, named VirFace, to effectively ex-ploit the unlabeled shallow data for face recognition. Vir-Face consists of VirClass and VirInstance. Speciﬁcally, Vir-Class enlarges the inter-class distance by injecting the unla-beled data as new identities, while VirInstance produces vir-tual instances sampled from the learned distribution of each identity to further enlarge the inter-class distance. To the best of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to tackle the problem of unlabeled shallow face data. Extensive experiments have been conducted on both the small- and large-scale datasets, e.g. LFW and IJB-C, etc, demonstrating the superiority of the proposed method.
