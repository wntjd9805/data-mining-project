New results suggest strong limits to the feasibility of ob-ject classiﬁcation from human brain activity evoked by im-age stimuli, as measured through EEG. Considerable prior work suffers from a confound between the stimulus class and the time since the start of the experiment. A prior at-tempt to avoid this confound using randomized trials was unable to achieve results above chance in a statistically sig-niﬁcant fashion when the data sets were of the same size as the original experiments. Here, we attempt object classiﬁ-cation from EEG using an array of methods that are rep-resentative of the state-of-the-art, with a far larger (20×) dataset of randomized EEG trials, 1,000 stimulus presenta-tions of each of forty classes, all from a single subject. To our knowledge, this is the largest such EEG data-collection effort from a single subject and is at the bounds of feasi-bility. We obtain classiﬁcation accuracy that is marginally above chance and above chance in a statistically signiﬁcant fashion, and further assess how accuracy depends on the classiﬁer used, the amount of training data used, and the number of classes. Reaching the limits of data collection with only marginally above-chance performance suggests that the prevailing literature substantially exaggerates the feasibility of object classiﬁcation from EEG.
