Image and video descriptors are an omnipresent tool in computer vision and its application ﬁelds like mobile robotics. Many hand-crafted and in particular learned im-age descriptors are numerical vectors with a potentially (very) large number of dimensions. Practical considera-tions like memory consumption or time for comparisons call for the creation of compact representations. In this paper, we use hyperdimensional computing (HDC) as an approach to systematically combine information from a set of vec-tors in a single vector of the same dimensionality. HDC is a known technique to perform symbolic processing with distributed representations in numerical vectors with thou-sands of dimensions. We present a HDC implementation that is suitable for processing the output of existing and fu-ture (deep learning based) image descriptors. We discuss how this can be used as a framework to process descriptors together with additional knowledge by simple and fast vec-tor operations. A concrete outcome is a novel HDC-based approach to aggregate a set of local image descriptors to-gether with their image positions in a single holistic de-scriptor. The comparison to available holistic descriptors and aggregation methods on a series of standard mobile robotics place recognition experiments shows a 20% im-provement in average performance and > 2 better worst-case performance compared to runner-up.×
