Existing approaches for unsupervised domain adap-tive object detection perform feature alignment via ad-versarial training. While these methods achieve reason-able improvements in performance, they typically perform category-agnostic domain alignment, thereby resulting in negative transfer of features. To overcome this issue, in this work, we attempt to incorporate category information into the domain adaptation process by proposing MemoryGuided Attention for Category-Aware Domain Adaptation (MeGA-CDA). The proposed method consists of employing category-wise discriminators to ensure category-aware fea-ture alignment for learning domain-invariant discrimina-tive features. However, since the category information is not available for the target samples, we propose to gener-ate memory-guided category-speciÔ¨Åc attention maps which are then used to route the features appropriately to the cor-responding category discriminator. The proposed method is evaluated on several benchmark datasets and is shown to outperform existing approaches.
