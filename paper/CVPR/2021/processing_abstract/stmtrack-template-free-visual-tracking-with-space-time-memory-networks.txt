#229#815#836Boosting performance of the ofﬂine trained siamese trackers is getting harder nowadays since the ﬁxed infor-mation of the template cropped from the ﬁrst frame has been almost thoroughly mined, but they are poorly capable of re-sisting target appearance changes. Existing trackers with template updating mechanisms rely on time-consuming nu-merical optimization and complex hand-designed strategies to achieve competitive performance, hindering them from real-time tracking and practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel tracking framework built on top of a space-time memory network that is competent to make full use of historical information related to the target for better adapting to appearance variations during tracking. Specif-ically, a novel memory mechanism is introduced, which stores the historical information of the target to guide the tracker to focus on the most informative regions in the cur-rent frame. Furthermore, the pixel-level similarity compu-tation of the memory network enables our tracker to gen-erate much more accurate bounding boxes of the target.Extensive experiments and comparisons with many com-petitive trackers on challenging large-scale benchmarks,OTB-2015, TrackingNet, GOT-10k, LaSOT, UAV123, andVOT2018, show that, without bells and whistles, our tracker outperforms all previous state-of-the-art real-time methods while running at 37 FPS.
