Mainstream object detectors based on the fully convolu-tional network has achieved impressive performance. While most of them still need a hand-designed non-maximum sup-pression (NMS) post-processing, which impedes fully end-to-end training. In this paper, we give the analysis of dis-carding NMS, where the results reveal that a proper label assignment plays a crucial role. To this end, for fully con-volutional detectors, we introduce a Prediction-aware One-To-One (POTO) label assignment for classiÔ¨Åcation to en-able end-to-end detection, which obtains comparable per-formance with NMS. Besides, a simple 3D Max Filtering (3DMF) is proposed to utilize the multi-scale features and improve the discriminability of convolutions in the local region. With these techniques, our end-to-end framework achieves competitive performance against many state-of-the-art detectors with NMS on COCO and CrowdHuman datasets.
