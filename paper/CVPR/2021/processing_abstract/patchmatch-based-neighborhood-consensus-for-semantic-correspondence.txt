We address estimating dense correspondences between two images depicting different but semantically related scenes. End-to-end trainable deep neural networks incor-porating neighborhood consensus cues are currently the best methods for this task. However, these architectures re-quire exhaustive matching and 4D convolutions over match-ing costs for all pairs of feature map pixels. This makes them computationally expensive. We present a more efﬁ-cient neighborhood consensus approach based on Patch-Match. For higher accuracy, we propose to use a learned local 4D scoring function for evaluating candidates during the PatchMatch iterations. We have devised an approach to jointly train the scoring function and the feature extrac-tion modules by embedding them into a proxy model which is end-to-end differentiable. The modules are trained in a supervised setting using a cross-entropy loss to directly in-corporate sparse keypoint supervision. Our evaluation onPF-PASCAL and SPAIR-71K shows that our method sig-niﬁcantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on both datasets while also being faster and using less memory.
