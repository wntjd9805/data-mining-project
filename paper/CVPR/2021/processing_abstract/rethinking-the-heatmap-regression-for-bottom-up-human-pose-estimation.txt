Heatmap regression has become the most prevalent choice for nowadays human pose estimation methods. The ground-truth heatmaps are usually constructed via cover-ing all skeletal keypoints by 2D gaussian kernels. The stan-dard deviations of these kernels are ﬁxed. However, for bottom-up methods, which need to handle a large vari-ance of human scales and labeling ambiguities, the cur-rent practice seems unreasonable. To better cope with these problems, we propose the scale-adaptive heatmap regres-sion (SAHR) method, which can adaptively adjust the stan-In this way, SAHR is dard deviation for each keypoint. more tolerant of various human scales and labeling am-biguities. However, SAHR may aggravate the imbalance between fore-background samples, which potentially hurts the improvement of SAHR. Thus, we further introduce the weight-adaptive heatmap regression (WAHR) to help bal-ance the fore-background samples. Extensive experiments show that SAHR together with WAHR largely improves the accuracy of bottom-up human pose estimation. As a result, we ﬁnally outperform the state-of-the-art model by +1.5AP and achieve 72.0AP on COCO test-dev2017, which is com-parable with the performances of most top-down methods.Source codes are available at https://github.com/ greatlog/SWAHR-HumanPose.
