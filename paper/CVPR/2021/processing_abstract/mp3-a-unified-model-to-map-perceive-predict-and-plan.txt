High-deﬁnition maps (HD maps) are a key component of most modern self-driving systems due to their valuable se-mantic and geometric information. Unfortunately, buildingHD maps has proven hard to scale due to their cost as well as the requirements they impose in the localization system that has to work everywhere with centimeter-level accuracy.Being able to drive without an HD map would be very bene-ﬁcial to scale self-driving solutions as well as to increase the failure tolerance of existing ones (e.g., if localization fails or the map is not up-to-date). Towards this goal, we proposeMP3, an end-to-end approach to mapless1 driving where the input is raw sensor data and a high-level command (e.g., turn left at the intersection). MP3 predicts intermediate representations in the form of an online map and the current and future state of dynamic agents, and exploits them in a novel neural motion planner to make interpretable decisions taking into account uncertainty. We show that our approach is signiﬁcantly safer, more comfortable, and can follow com-mands better than the baselines in challenging long-term closed-loop simulations, as well as when compared to an expert driver in a large-scale real-world dataset.
