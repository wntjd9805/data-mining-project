Pedestrian detection is used in many vision based ap-plications ranging from video surveillance to autonomous driving. Despite achieving high performance, it is still largely unknown how well existing detectors generalize to unseen data. This is important because a practical detec-tor should be ready to use in various scenarios in appli-cations. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive study in this paper, using a general principle of direct cross-dataset evaluation. Through this study, we ﬁnd that existing state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors, though perform quite well when trained and tested on the same dataset, gener-alize poorly in cross dataset evaluation. We demonstrate that there are two reasons for this trend. Firstly, their de-signs (e.g. anchor settings) may be biased towards pop-ular benchmarks in the traditional single-dataset training and test pipeline, but as a result largely limit their gener-alization capability. Secondly, the training source is gen-erally not dense in pedestrians and diverse in scenarios.Under direct cross-dataset evaluation, surprisingly, we ﬁnd that a general purpose object detector, without pedestrian-tailored adaptation in design, generalizes much better com-pared to existing state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors. Fur-thermore, we illustrate that diverse and dense datasets, col-lected by crawling the web, serve to be an efﬁcient source of pre-training for pedestrian detection. Accordingly, we pro-pose a progressive training pipeline and ﬁnd that it works well for autonomous-driving oriented pedestrian detection.Consequently, the study conducted in this paper suggests that more emphasis should be put on cross-dataset evalu-ation for the future design of generalizable pedestrian de-tectors.
