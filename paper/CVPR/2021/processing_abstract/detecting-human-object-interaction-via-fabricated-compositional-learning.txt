Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection, inferring the relationships between human and objects from im-ages/videos, is a fundamental task for high-level scene un-derstanding. However, HOI detection usually suffers from the open long-tailed nature of interactions with objects, while human has extremely powerful compositional percep-tion ability to cognize rare or unseen HOI samples.In-spired by this, we devise a novel HOI compositional learn-ing framework, termed as Fabricated Compositional Learn-ing (FCL), to address the problem of open long-tailed HOI detection. Speciﬁcally, we introduce an object fabricator to generate effective object representations, and then com-bine verbs and fabricated objects to compose new HOI sam-ples. With the proposed object fabricator, we are able to generate large-scale HOI samples for rare and unseen cat-egories to alleviate the open long-tailed issues in HOI de-tection. Extensive experiments on the most popular HOI detection dataset, HICO-DET, demonstrate the effective-ness of the proposed method for imbalanced HOI detection and signiﬁcantly improve the state-of-the-art performance on rare and unseen HOI categories.
