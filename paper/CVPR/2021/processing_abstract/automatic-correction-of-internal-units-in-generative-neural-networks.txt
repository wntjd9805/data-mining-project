Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown satisfactory performance in synthetic image generation by devising complex network structure and adversarial train-ing scheme. Even though GANs are able to synthesize re-alistic images, there exists a number of generated images with defective visual patterns which are known as artifacts.While most of the recent work tries to ﬁx artifact gener-ations by perturbing latent code, few investigate internal units of a generator to ﬁx them. In this work, we devise a method that automatically identiﬁes the internal units gen-erating various types of artifact images. We further pro-pose the sequential correction algorithm which adjusts the generation ﬂow by modifying the detected artifact units to improve the quality of generation while preserving the orig-inal outline. Our method outperforms the baseline method in terms of FID-score and shows satisfactory results with human evaluation.
