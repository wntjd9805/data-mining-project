Multi-source domain adaptation is a key technique that allows a model to be trained on data coming from various probability distribution. To overcome the challenges posed by this learning scenario, we propose a method for con-structing an intermediate domain between sources and tar-get domain, the Wasserstein Barycenter Transport (WBT).This method relies on the barycenter on Wasserstein spaces for aggregating the source probability distributions. Once the sources have been aggregated, they are transported to the target domain using standard Optimal Transport for Do-main Adaptation framework. Additionally, we revisit previ-ous single-source domain adaptation tasks in the context of multi-source scenario.In particular, we apply our al-gorithm to object and face recognition datasets. Moreover, to diversify the range of applications, we also examine the tasks of music genre recognition and music-speech discrim-ination. The experiments show that our method has similar performance with the existing state-of-the-art.
