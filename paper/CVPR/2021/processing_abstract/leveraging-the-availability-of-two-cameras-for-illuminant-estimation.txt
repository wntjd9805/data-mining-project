Most modern smartphones are now equipped with two rear-facing cameras – a main camera for standard imaging and an additional camera to provide wide-angle or tele-In this paper, we leverage the photo zoom capabilities. availability of these two cameras for the task of illumination estimation using a small neural network to perform the il-lumination prediction. Speciﬁcally, if the two cameras’ sen-sors have different spectral sensitivities, the two images pro-vide different spectral measurements of the physical scene.A linear 3×3 color transform that maps between these two observations – and that is unique to a given scene illumi-nant – can be used to train a lightweight neural network comprising no more than 1460 parameters to predict the scene illumination. We demonstrate that this two-camera approach with a lightweight network provides results on par or better than much more complicated illuminant estima-tion methods operating on a single image. We validate our method’s effectiveness through extensive experiments on ra-diometric data, a quasi-real two-camera dataset we gen-erated from an existing single camera dataset, as well as a new real image dataset that we captured using a smart-phone with two rear-facing cameras.
