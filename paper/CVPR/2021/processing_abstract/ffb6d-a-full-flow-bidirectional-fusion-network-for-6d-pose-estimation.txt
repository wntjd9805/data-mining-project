CNN EncoderCNN DecoderIn this work, we present FFB6D, a Full FlowBidirectional fusion network designed for 6D pose estima-tion from a single RGBD image. Our key insight is that appearance information in the RGB image and geometry information from the depth image are two complementary data sources, and it still remains unknown how to fully leverage them. Towards this end, we propose FFB6D, which learns to combine appearance and geometry information for representation learning as well as output representa-tion selection. Speciﬁcally, at the representation learning stage, we build bidirectional fusion modules in the fullﬂow of the two networks, where fusion is applied to each encoding and decoding layer.In this way, the two net-works can leverage local and global complementary in-formation from the other one to obtain better representa-tions. Moreover, at the output representation stage, we designed a simple but effective 3D keypoints selection al-gorithm considering the texture and geometry information of objects, which simpliﬁes keypoint localization for pre-cise pose estimation. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by large margins on several benchmarks.

Bidirec-tional fusion modules are added as bridges for information communication in the full ﬂow of the two networks, where fusion is applied on each encod-ing and decoding layers. Local and global supplementary information from each other is shared between the two networks for better appearance and geometry representation learning, which is crucial for 6D pose estimation.Figure 1: Network Comparison
