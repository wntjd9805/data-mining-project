Although vanilla Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based detectors can achieve satisfactory performance on fake face detection, we observe that the detectors tend to seek forgeries on a limited region of face, which re-veals that the detectors is short of understanding of forgery.Therefore, we propose an attention-based data augmenta-tion framework to guide detector reﬁne and enlarge its at-tention. Speciﬁcally, our method tracks and occludes theTop-N sensitive facial regions, encouraging the detector to mine deeper into the regions ignored before for more rep-resentative forgery. Especially, our method is simple-to-use and can be easily integrated with various CNN mod-els. Extensive experiments show that the detector trained with our method is capable to separately point out the representative forgery of fake faces generated by differ-ent manipulation techniques, and our method enables a vanilla CNN-based detector to achieve state-of-the-art per-formance without structure modiﬁcation.
