In this paper, we present a regression-based pose recog-nition method using cascade Transformers. One way to cat-egorize the existing approaches in this domain is to sep-arate them into 1). heatmap-based and 2). regression-based. In general, heatmap-based methods achieve higher accuracy but are subject to various heuristic designs (not end-to-end mostly), whereas regression-based approaches attain relatively lower accuracy but they have less interme-diate non-differentiable steps. Here we utilize the encoder-decoder structure in Transformers to perform regression-based person and keypoint detection that is general-purpose and requires less heuristic design compared with the ex-isting approaches. We demonstrate the keypoint hypothe-sis (query) reÔ¨Ånement process across different self-attention layers to reveal the recursive self-attention mechanism inTransformers. In the experiments, we report competitive re-sults for pose recognition when compared with the compet-ing regression-based methods.
