and smoking scenes.Most of the existing deep learning-based dehazing meth-ods are trained and evaluated on the image dehazing datasets, where the dehazed images are generated by only exploiting the information from the corresponding hazy ones.On the other hand, video dehazing algorithms, which can acquire more satisfying dehazing results by exploiting the temporal redundancy from neighborhood hazy frames, re-ceive less attention due to the absence of the video dehazing datasets. Therefore, we propose the ﬁrst REal-world VIdeoDEhazing (REVIDE) dataset which can be used for the su-pervised learning of the video dehazing algorithms. By utilizing a well-designed video acquisition system, we can capture paired real-world hazy and haze-free videos that are perfectly aligned by recording the same scene (with or without haze) twice. Considering the challenge of exploit-ing temporal redundancy among the hazy frames, we also develop a Conﬁdence Guided and Improved DeformableNetwork (CG-IDN) for video dehazing. The experiments demonstrate that the hazy scenes in the REVIDE dataset are more realistic than the synthetic datasets and the proposed algorithm also performs favorably against state-of-the-art dehazing methods.
