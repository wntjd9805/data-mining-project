We present Zillow Indoor Dataset (ZInD): A large in-door dataset with 71,474 panoramas from 1,524 real unfur-nished homes. ZInD provides annotations of 3D room lay-outs, 2D and 3D ﬂoor plans, panorama location in the ﬂoor plan, and locations of windows and doors. The ground truth construction took over 1,500 hours of annotation work. To the best of our knowledge, ZInD is the largest real dataset with layout annotations. A unique property is the room lay-out data, which follows a real world distribution (cuboid, more general Manhattan, and non-Manhattan layouts) as opposed to the mostly cuboid or Manhattan layouts in cur-rent publicly available datasets. Also, the scale and annota-tions provided are valuable for effective research related to room layout and ﬂoor plan analysis. To demonstrate ZInD’s beneﬁts, we benchmark on room layout estimation from sin-gle panoramas and multi-view registration.
