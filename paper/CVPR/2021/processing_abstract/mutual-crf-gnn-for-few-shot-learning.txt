Graph-neural-networks (GNN) is a rising trend for few-shot learning. A critical component in GNN is the afﬁnity.Typically, afﬁnity in GNN is mainly computed in the feature space, e.g., pairwise features, and does not take fully advan-tage of semantic labels associated to these features. In this paper, we propose a novel Mutual CRF-GNN (MCGN). In this MCGN, the labels and features of support data are used by the CRF for inferring GNN afﬁnities in a principled and probabilistic way. Speciﬁcally, we construct a ConditionalRandom Field (CRF) conditioned on labels and features of support data to infer a afﬁnity in the label space. Such afﬁnity is fed to the GNN as the node-wise afﬁnity. GNN and CRF mutually contributes to each other in MCGN. ForGNN, CRF provides valuable afﬁnity information. For CRF,GNN provides better features for inferring afﬁnity. Exper-imental results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-arts on datasets miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, andCIFAR-FS on both 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot settings.
