The facial expression analysis requires a compact andIn this paper, identity-ignored expression representation. we model the expression as the deviation from the iden-tity by a subtraction operation, extracting a continuous and identity-invariant expression embedding. We propose a De-viation Learning Network (DLN) with a pseudo-siamese structure to extract the deviation feature vector. To reduce the optimization difﬁculty caused by additional fully con-nection layers, DLN directly provides high-order polyno-mial to nonlinearly project the high-dimensional feature to a low-dimensional manifold. Taking label noise into ac-count, we add a crowd layer to DLN for robust embedding extraction. Also, to achieve a more compact representa-tion, we use hierarchical annotation for data augmenta-tion. We evaluate our facial expression embedding on theFEC validation set. The quantitative results prove that we achieve the state-of-the-art, both in terms of ﬁne-grained and identity-invariant property. We further conduct exten-sive experiments to show that our expression embedding is of high quality for expression recognition, image retrieval, and face manipulation.
