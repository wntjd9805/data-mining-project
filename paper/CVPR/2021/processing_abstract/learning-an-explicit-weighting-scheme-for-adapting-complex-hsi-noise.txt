An efﬁcient approach for handling hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising issue is to impose weights on different HSI pixels to suppress negative inﬂuence brought by noisy ele-ments. Such weighting scheme, however, largely depends on the prior understanding or subjective distribution assump-tion on HSI noises, making them easily biased to compli-cated real noises, and hardly generalizable to diverse prac-tical scenarios. Against this issue, this paper proposes a new scheme aiming to capture general weighting princi-ple in a data-driven manner. Speciﬁcally, such weighting principle is delivered by an explicit function, called hyper-weight-net (HWnet), mapping from an input noisy image to its properly imposed weights. A Bayesian framework as well as a variational inference algorithm for inferringHWnet parameters is elaborately designed, expecting to ex-tract the latent weighting rule for general diverse and com-plicated noisy HSIs. Comprehensive experiments substanti-ate that the learned HWnet can be not only ﬁnely general-ized to different noise types from those used in training, but also effectively transferred to other weighted models. Be-sides, as a sounder guidance, HWnet can help to more faith-fully and robustly achieve deep hyperspectral prior(DHP).The extracted weights by HWnet are veriﬁed to be able to effectively capture complex noise knowledge underlying in-put HSI, revealing its working insight in experiments.
