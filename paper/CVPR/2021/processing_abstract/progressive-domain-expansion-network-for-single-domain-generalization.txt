Single domain generalization is a challenging case of model generalization, where the models are trained on a single domain and tested on other unseen domains. A promising solution is to learn cross-domain invariant rep-resentations by expanding the coverage of the training do-main. These methods have limited generalization perfor-mance gains in practical applications due to the lack of ap-propriate safety and effectiveness constraints. In this pa-per, we propose a novel learning framework called pro-gressive domain expansion network (PDEN) for single do-main generalization. The domain expansion subnetwork and representation learning subnetwork in PDEN mutu-ally beneﬁt from each other by joint learning. For the domain expansion subnetwork, multiple domains are pro-gressively generated in order to simulate various photo-metric and geometric transforms in unseen domains. A series of strategies are introduced to guarantee the safety and effectiveness of the expanded domains. For the do-main invariant representation learning subnetwork, con-trastive learning is introduced to learn the domain invari-ant representation in which each class is well clustered so that a better decision boundary can be learned to improve it’s generalization. Extensive experiments on classiﬁcation and segmentation have shown that PDEN can achieve up to 15.28% improvement compared with the state-of-the-art single-domain generalization methods.
