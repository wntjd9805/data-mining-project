Is critical input information encoded in speciﬁc sparse pathways within the neural network? In this work, we dis-cuss the problem of identifying these critical pathways and subsequently leverage them for interpreting the network’s response to an input. The pruning objective — selecting the smallest group of neurons for which the response remains equivalent to the original network — has been previously proposed for identifying critical pathways. We demonstrate that sparse pathways derived from pruning do not neces-sarily encode critical input information. To ensure sparse pathways include critical fragments of the encoded input in-formation, we propose pathway selection via neurons’ con-tribution to the response. We proceed to explain how critical pathways can reveal critical input features. We prove that pathways selected via neuron contribution are locally linear (in an ℓ2-ball), a property that we use for proposing a fea-ture attribution method: “pathway gradient”. We validate our interpretation method using mainstream evaluation ex-periments. The validation of pathway gradient interpreta-tion method further conﬁrms that selected pathways using neuron contributions correspond to critical input features.The code1 2 is publicly available.
