Deep denoiser, the deep network for denoising, has been the focus of the recent development on image denoising. In the last few years, there is an increasing interest in devel-oping unsupervised deep denoisers which only call unorga-nized noisy images without ground truth for training. Nev-ertheless, the performance of these unsupervised deep de-noisers is not competitive to their supervised counterparts.Aiming at developing a more powerful unsupervised deep denoiser, this paper proposed a data augmentation tech-nique, called recorrupted-to-recorrupted (R2R), to address the overﬁtting caused by the absence of truth images. For each noisy image, we showed that the cost function de-ﬁned on the noisy/noisy image pairs constructed by the R2R method is statistically equivalent to its supervised counter-part deﬁned on the noisy/truth image pairs. Extensive ex-periments showed that the proposed R2R method noticeably outperformed existing unsupervised deep denoisers, and is competitive to representative supervised deep denoisers.
