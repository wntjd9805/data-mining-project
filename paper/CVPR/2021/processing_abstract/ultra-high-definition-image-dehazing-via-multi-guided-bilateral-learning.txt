Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved signiﬁcant success in the single image dehazing task. Un-fortunately, most existing deep dehazing models have high computational complexity, which hinders their application to high-resolution images, especially for UHD (ultra-high-deﬁnition) or 4K resolution images. To address the problem, we propose a novel network capable of real-time dehazing of 4K images on a single GPU, which consists of three deepCNNs. The ﬁrst CNN extracts haze-relevant features at a reduced resolution of the hazy input and then ﬁts locally-afﬁne models in the bilateral space. Another CNN is used to learn multiple full-resolution guidance maps corresponding to the learned bilateral model. As a result, the feature maps with high-frequency can be reconstructed by multi-guided bilateral upsampling. Finally, the third CNN fuses the high-quality feature maps into a dehazed image. In addition, we create a large-scale 4K image dehazing dataset to support the training and testing of compared models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art dehazing approaches on various benchmarks.
