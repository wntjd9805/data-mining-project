Many modern object detectors demonstrate outstanding performances by using the mechanism of looking and think-ing twice. In this paper, we explore this mechanism in the backbone design for object detection. At the macro level, we propose Recursive Feature Pyramid, which incorporates extra feedback connections from Feature Pyramid Networks into the bottom-up backbone layers. At the micro level, we propose Switchable Atrous Convolution, which convolves the features with different atrous rates and gathers the results us-ing switch functions. Combining them results in DetectoRS, which signiﬁcantly improves the performances of object de-tection. On COCO test-dev, DetectoRS achieves state-of-the-art 55.7% box AP for object detection, 48.5% mask AP for instance segmentation, and 50.0% PQ for panoptic segmen-tation. The code is made publicly available1.
