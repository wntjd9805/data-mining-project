While mesh saliency aims to predict regional importance of 3D surfaces in agreement with human visual perception and is well researched in computer vision and graphics, lat-est work with eye-tracking experiments shows that state-of-the-art mesh saliency methods remain poor at predicting human ﬁxations. Cues emerging prominently from these ex-periments suggest that mesh saliency might associate with the saliency of 2D natural images. This paper proposes a novel deep neural network for learning mesh saliency using image saliency ground truth to 1) investigate whether mesh saliency is an independent perceptual measure or just a derivative of image saliency and 2) provide a weakly super-vised method for more accurately predicting mesh saliency.Through extensive experiments, we not only demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art mesh saliency method by 116% and 21% in terms of linear correlation coefﬁcient and AUC respectively, but also re-veal that mesh saliency is intrinsically related with both im-age saliency and object categorical information.
