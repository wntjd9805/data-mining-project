Fast and light-weight methods for animating 3D charac-ters are desirable in various applications such as computer games. We present a learning-based approach to enhance skinning-based animations of 3D characters with vivid sec-ondary motion effects. We design a neural network that encodes each local patch of a character simulation mesh where the edges implicitly encode the internal forces be-tween the neighboring vertices. The network emulates the ordinary differential equations of the character dynamics, predicting new vertex positions from the current accelera-tions, velocities and positions. Being a local method, our network is independent of the mesh topology and general-izes to arbitrarily shaped 3D character meshes at test time.We further represent per-vertex constraints and material properties such as stiffness, enabling us to easily adjust the dynamics in different parts of the mesh. We evaluate our method on various character meshes and complex motion sequences. Our method can be over 30 times more efÔ¨Åcient than ground-truth physically based simulation, and outper-forms alternative solutions that provide fast approximations.
