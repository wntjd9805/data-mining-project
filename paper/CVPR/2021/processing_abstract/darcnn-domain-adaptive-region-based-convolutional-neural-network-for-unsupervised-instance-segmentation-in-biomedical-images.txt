In the biomedical domain, there is an abundance of dense, complex data where objects of interest may be chal-lenging to detect or constrained by limits of human knowl-edge. Labelled domain speciﬁc datasets for supervised tasks are often expensive to obtain, and furthermore dis-covery of novel distinct objects may be desirable for un-biased scientiﬁc discovery. Therefore, we propose leverag-ing the wealth of annotations in benchmark computer vision datasets to conduct unsupervised instance segmentation for diverse biomedical datasets. The key obstacle is thus over-coming the large domain shift from common to biomedical images. We propose a Domain Adaptive Region-based Con-volutional Neural Network (DARCNN), that adapts knowl-edge of object deﬁnition from COCO, a large labelled vision dataset, to multiple biomedical datasets. We introduce a do-main separation module, a self-supervised representation consistency loss, and an augmented pseudo-labelling stage within DARCNN to effectively perform domain adaptation across such large domain shifts. We showcase DARCNN’s performance for unsupervised instance segmentation on nu-merous biomedical datasets.
