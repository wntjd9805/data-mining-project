Text recognition is a popular research subject with many associated challenges. Despite the considerable progress made in recent years, the text recognition task itself is still constrained to solve the problem of reading cropped line text images and serves as a subtask of optical character recognition (OCR) systems. As a result, the ﬁnal text recog-nition result is limited by the performance of the text de-tector. In this paper, we propose a simple, elegant and ef-fective paradigm called Implicit Feature Alignment (IFA), which can be easily integrated into current text recogniz-ers, resulting in a novel inference mechanism called IFA-inference. This enables an ordinary text recognizer to pro-cess multi-line text such that text detection can be com-pletely freed. Speciﬁcally, we integrate IFA into the two most prevailing text recognition streams (attention-based and CTC-based) and propose attention-guided dense pre-diction (ADP) and Extended CTC (ExCTC). Furthermore, the Wasserstein-based Hollow Aggregation Cross-Entropy (WH-ACE) is proposed to suppress negative predictions to assist in training ADP and ExCTC. We experimentally demonstrate that IFA achieves state-of-the-art performance on end-to-end document recognition tasks while maintain-ing the fastest speed, and ADP and ExCTC complement each other on the perspective of different application sce-narios.
