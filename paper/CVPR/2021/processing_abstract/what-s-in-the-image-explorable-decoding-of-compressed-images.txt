The ever-growing amounts of visual contents captured on a daily basis necessitate the use of lossy compression methods in order to save storage space and transmission bandwidth. While extensive research efforts are devoted to improving compression techniques, every method inevitably discards information. Especially at low bit rates, this in-formation often corresponds to semantically meaningful vi-sual cues, so that decompression involves signiﬁcant am-biguity. In spite of this fact, existing decompression algo-rithms typically produce only a single output, and do not allow the viewer to explore the set of images that map to the given compressed code. In this work we propose the ﬁrst image decompression method to facilitate user-exploration of the diverse set of natural images that could have given rise to the compressed input code, thus granting users the ability to determine what could and what could not have been there in the original scene. Speciﬁcally, we develop a novel deep-network based decoder architecture for the ubiquitous JPEG standard, which allows traversing the set of decompressed images that are consistent with the com-pressed JPEG ﬁle. To allow for simple user interaction, we develop a graphical user interface comprising several intuitive exploration tools, including an automatic tool for examining speciﬁc solutions of interest. We exemplify our framework on graphical, medical and forensic use cases, demonstrating its wide range of potential applications.
