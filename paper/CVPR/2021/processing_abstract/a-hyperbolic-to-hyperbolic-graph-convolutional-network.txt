Hyperbolic graph convolutional networks (GCNs) demonstrate powerful representation ability to model graphs with hierarchical structure. Existing hyperbolicGCNs resort to tangent spaces to realize graph convolution on hyperbolic manifolds, which is inferior because tangent space is only a local approximation of a manifold. In this paper, we propose a hyperbolic-to-hyperbolic graph con-volutional network (H2H-GCN) that directly works on hy-perbolic manifolds. Speciﬁcally, we developed a manifold-preserving graph convolution that consists of a hyperbolic feature transformation and a hyperbolic neighborhood ag-gregation. The hyperbolic feature transformation works as linear transformation on hyperbolic manifolds. It ensures the transformed node representations still lie on the hy-perbolic manifold by imposing the orthogonal constraint on the transformation sub-matrix. The hyperbolic neigh-borhood aggregation updates each node representation via the Einstein midpoint. The H2H-GCN avoids the distor-tion caused by tangent space approximations and keeps the global hyperbolic structure. Extensive experiments show that the H2H-GCN achieves substantial improvements on the link prediction, node classiﬁcation, and graph classiﬁ-cation tasks.
