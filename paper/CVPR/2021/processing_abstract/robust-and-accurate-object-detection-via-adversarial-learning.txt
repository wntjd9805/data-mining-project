Data augmentation has become a de facto component for training high-performance deep image classiﬁers, but its potential is under-explored for object detection. Not-ing that most state-of-the-art object detectors beneﬁt fromﬁne-tuning a pre-trained classiﬁer, we ﬁrst study how the classiﬁers’ gains from various data augmentations trans-fer to object detection. The results are discouraging; the gains diminish after ﬁne-tuning in terms of either accuracy or robustness. This work instead augments the ﬁne-tuning stage for object detectors by exploring adversarial exam-ples, which can be viewed as a model-dependent data aug-mentation. Our method dynamically selects the stronger adversarial images sourced from a detector’s classiﬁcation and localization branches and evolves with the detector to ensure the augmentation policy stays current and relevant.This model-dependent augmentation generalizes to different object detectors better than AutoAugment, a model-agnostic augmentation policy searched based on one particular de-tector. Our approach boosts the performance of state-of-the-art EfﬁcientDets by +1.1 mAP on the COCO object de-tection benchmark. It also improves the detectors’ robust-ness against natural distortions by +3.8 mAP and against domain shift by +1.3 mAP.
