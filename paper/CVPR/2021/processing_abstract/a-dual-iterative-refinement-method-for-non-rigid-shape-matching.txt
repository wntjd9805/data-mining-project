In this work, a robust and efﬁcient dual iterative reﬁne-ment (DIR) method is proposed for dense correspondence between two nearly isometric shapes. The key idea is to use dual information, such as spatial and spectral, or local and global features, in a complementary and effective way, and extract more accurate information from current iteration to use for the next iteration. In each DIR iteration, starting from current correspondence, a zoom-in process at each point is used to select well matched anchor pairs by a local mapping distortion criterion. These selected anchor pairs are then used to align spectral features (or other appropri-ate global features) whose dimension adaptively matches the capacity of the selected anchor pairs. Thanks to the effective combination of complementary information in a data-adaptive way, DIR is not only efﬁcient but also robust to render accurate results within a few iterations. By choos-ing appropriate dual features, DIR has the ﬂexibility to han-dle patch and partial matching as well. Our comprehensive experiments on various data sets demonstrate the superior-ity of DIR over other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and efﬁciency.
