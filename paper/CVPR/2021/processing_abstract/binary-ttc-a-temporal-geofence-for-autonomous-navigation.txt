Time-to-contact (TTC), the time for an object to collide with the observer’s plane, is a powerful tool for path plan-ning: it is potentially more informative than the depth, ve-locity, and acceleration of objects in the scene—even for humans. TTC presents several advantages, including re-quiring only a monocular, uncalibrated camera. However, regressing TTC for each pixel is not straightforward, and most existing methods make over-simplifying assumptions about the scene. We address this challenge by estimatingTTC via a series of simpler, binary classiﬁcations. We pre-dict with low latency whether the observer will collide with an obstacle within a certain time, which is often more criti-cal than knowing exact, per-pixel TTC. For such scenarios, our method offers a temporal geofence in 6.4 ms—over 25× faster than existing methods. Our approach can also esti-mate per-pixel TTC with arbitrarily ﬁne quantization (in-cluding continuous values), when the computational budget allows for it. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the ﬁrst to offer TTC information (binary or coarsely quan-tized) at sufﬁciently high frame-rates for practical use.
