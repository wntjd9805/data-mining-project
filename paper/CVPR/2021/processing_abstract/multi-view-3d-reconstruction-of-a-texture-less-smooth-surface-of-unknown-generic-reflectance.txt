Recovering the 3D geometry of a purely texture-less ob-ject with generally unknown surface reﬂectance (e.g. non-Lambertian) is regarded as a challenging task in multi-view reconstruction. The major obstacle revolves around establishing cross-view correspondences where photomet-ric constancy is violated. This paper proposes a simple and practical solution to overcome this challenge based on a co-located camera-light scanner device. Unlike existing solutions, we do not explicitly solve for correspondence.Instead, we argue the problem is generally well-posed by multi-view geometrical and photometric constraints, and can be solved from a small number of input views. We for-mulate the reconstruction task as a joint energy minimiza-tion over the surface geometry and reﬂectance. Despite this energy is highly non-convex, we develop an optimization al-gorithm that robustly recovers globally optimal shape and reﬂectance even from a random initialization. Extensive ex-periments on both simulated and real data have validated our method, and possible future extensions are discussed.
