Despite stereo matching accuracy has greatly improved by deep learning in the last few years, recovering sharp boundaries and high-resolution outputs efﬁciently remains challenging. In this paper, we propose Stereo Mixture Den-sity Networks (SMD-Nets), a simple yet effective learning framework compatible with a wide class of 2D and 3D architectures which ameliorates both issues. Speciﬁcally, we exploit bimodal mixture densities as output representa-tion and show that this allows for sharp and precise dis-parity estimates near discontinuities while explicitly mod-eling the aleatoric uncertainty inherent in the observations.Moreover, we formulate disparity estimation as a continu-ous problem in the image domain, allowing our model to query disparities at arbitrary spatial precision. We carry out comprehensive experiments on a new high-resolution and highly realistic synthetic stereo dataset, consisting of stereo pairs at 8Mpx resolution, as well as on real-world stereo datasets. Our experiments demonstrate increased depth accuracy near object boundaries and prediction of ul-tra high-resolution disparity maps on standard GPUs. We demonstrate the ﬂexibility of our technique by improving the performance of a variety of stereo backbones.
