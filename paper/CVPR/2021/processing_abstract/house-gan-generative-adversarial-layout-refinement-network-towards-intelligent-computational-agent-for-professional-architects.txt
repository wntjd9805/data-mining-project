This paper proposes a generative adversarial layout re-ﬁnement network for automated ﬂoorplan generation. Our architecture is an integration of a graph-constrained rela-tional GAN and a conditional GAN, where a previously gen-erated layout becomes the next input constraint, enabling iterative reﬁnement. A surprising discovery of our research is that a simple non-iterative training process, dubbed component-wise GT-conditioning, is effective in learning such a generator. The iterative generator further allows us to improve a metric of choice via meta-optimization tech-niques by controlling when to pass which input constraints during iterative reﬁnement. Our qualitative and quantita-tive evaluation based on the three standard metrics demon-strate that the proposed system makes signiﬁcant improve-ments over the current state-of-the-art, even competitive against the ground-truth ﬂoorplans, designed by profes-sional architects.
