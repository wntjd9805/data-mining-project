Despite recent progress in depth sensing and 3D recon-struction, mirror surfaces are a signiﬁcant source of errors.To address this problem, we create the Mirror3D dataset: a 3D mirror plane dataset based on three RGBD datasets (Matterpot3D, NYUv2 and ScanNet) containing 7,011 mir-ror instance masks and 3D planes. We then develop Mir-ror3DNet: a module that reﬁnes raw sensor depth or esti-mated depth to correct errors on mirror surfaces. Our key idea is to estimate the 3D mirror plane based on RGB input and surrounding depth context, and use this estimate to di-rectly regress mirror surface depth. Our experiments show that Mirror3DNet signiﬁcantly mitigates errors from a va-riety of input depth data, including raw sensor depth and depth estimation or completion methods.
