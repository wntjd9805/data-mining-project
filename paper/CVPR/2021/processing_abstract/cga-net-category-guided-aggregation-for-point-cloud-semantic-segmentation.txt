Previous point cloud semantic segmentation networks use the same process to aggregate features from neighbors of the same category and different categories. However, the joint area between two objects usually only occupies a small percentage in the whole scene. Thus the networks are well-trained for aggregating features from the same category point while not fully trained on aggregating points of dif-ferent categories. To address this issue, this paper proposes to utilize different aggregation strategies between the same category and different categories. Speciﬁcally, it presents a customized module, termed as Category Guided Aggre-gation (CGA), where it ﬁrst identiﬁes whether the neigh-bors belong to the same category with the center point or not, and then handles the two types of neighbors with two carefully-designed modules. Our CGA presents a general network module and could be leveraged in any existing se-mantic segmentation network. Experiments on three differ-ent backbones demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
