Temporal grounding aims to localize temporal bound-aries within untrimmed videos by language queries, but it faces the challenge of two types of inevitable human un-certainties: query uncertainty and label uncertainty. The two uncertainties stem from human subjectivity, leading to limited generalization ability of temporal grounding.In this work, we propose a novel DeNet (Decoupling and De-bias) to embrace human uncertainty: Decoupling — We ex-plicitly disentangle each query into a relation feature and a modiﬁed feature. The relation feature, which is mainly based on skeleton-like words (including nouns and verbs), aims to extract basic and consistent information in the pres-ence of query uncertainty. Meanwhile, modiﬁed feature as-signed with style-like words (including adjectives, adverbs, etc) represents the subjective information, and thus brings personalized predictions; De-bias — We propose a de-bias mechanism to generate diverse predictions, aim to allevi-ate the bias caused by single-style annotations in the pres-ence of label uncertainty. Moreover, we put forward new multi-label metrics to diversify the performance evaluation.Extensive experiments show that our approach is more ef-fective and robust than state-of-the-arts on Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions datasets.
