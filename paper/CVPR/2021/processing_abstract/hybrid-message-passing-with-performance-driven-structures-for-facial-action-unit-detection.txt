Message passing neural network has been an effective method to represent dependencies among nodes by propa-gating messages. However, most of message passing algo-rithms focus on one structure and messages are estimated by one single approach. For real-world data, like facial action units (AUs), the dependencies may vary in terms of different expressions and individuals. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid message passing neural network with performance-driven structures (HMP-PS), which com-bines complementary message passing methods and cap-tures more possible structures in a Bayesian manner. Par-ticularly, a performance-driven Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling method is proposed for generating high perfor-mance graph structures. Besides, hybrid message passing is proposed to combine different types of messages, which provide the complementary information. The contribution of each type of message is adaptively adjusted along with different inputs. The experiments on two widely used bench-mark datasets, i.e., BP4D and DISFA, validate that our pro-posed method can achieve the state-of-the-art performance.
