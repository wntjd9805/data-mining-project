Face clustering is a promising method for annotating un-labeled face images. Recent supervised approaches have boosted the face clustering accuracy greatly, however their performance is still far from satisfactory. These methods can be roughly divided into global-based and local-based ones. Global-based methods suffer from the limitation of training data scale, while local-based ones are difﬁcult to grasp the whole graph structure information and usually take a long time for inference. Previous approaches fail to tackle these two challenges simultaneously. To address the dilemma of large-scale training and efﬁcient inference, we propose the STructure-AwaRe Face Clustering (STAR-FC) method. Speciﬁcally, we design a structure-preserved sub-graph sampling strategy to explore the power of large-scale training data, which can increase the training data scale from 105 to 107. During inference, the STAR-FC performs efﬁcient full-graph clustering with two steps: graph parsing and graph reﬁnement. And the concept of node intimacy is introduced in the second step to mine the local structural information. The STAR-FC gets 91.97 pairwise F-score on partial MS1M within 310s which surpasses the state-of-the-arts. Furthermore, we are the ﬁrst to train on very large-scale graph with 20M nodes, and achieve superior infer-ence results on 12M testing data. Overall, as a simple and effective method, the proposed STAR-FC provides a strong baseline for large-scale face clustering. Code is available at https://sstzal.github.io/STAR-FC/.
