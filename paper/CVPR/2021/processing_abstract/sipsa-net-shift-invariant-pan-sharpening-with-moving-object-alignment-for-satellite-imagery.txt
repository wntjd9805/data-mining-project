Pan-sharpening is a process of merging a high-resolution (HR) panchromatic (PAN) image and its cor-responding low-resolution (LR) multi-spectral (MS) image to create an HR-MS and pan-sharpened image. However, due to the different sensors’ locations, characteristics and acquisition time, PAN and MS image pairs often tend to have various amounts of misalignment. Conventional deep-learning-based methods that were trained with such mis-aligned PAN-MS image pairs suffer from diverse artifacts such as double-edge and blur artifacts in the resultant PAN-sharpened images. In this paper, we propose a novel frame-work called shift-invariant pan-sharpening with moving ob-ject alignment (SIPSA-Net) which is the ﬁrst method to take into account such large misalignment of moving object re-gions for PAN sharpening. The SISPA-Net has a feature alignment module (FAM) that can adjust one feature to be aligned to another feature, even between the two differ-ent PAN and MS domains. For better alignment in pan-sharpened images, a shift-invariant spectral loss is newly designed, which ignores the inherent misalignment in the original MS input, thereby having the same effect as opti-mizing the spectral loss with a well-aligned MS image. Ex-tensive experimental results show that our SIPSA-Net can generate pan-sharpened images with remarkable improve-ments in terms of visual quality and alignment, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.
