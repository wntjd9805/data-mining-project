Predicting future trajectories of trafﬁc agents in highly interactive environments is an essential and challenging problem for the safe operation of autonomous driving sys-tems. On the basis of the fact that self-driving vehicles are equipped with various types of sensors (e.g., LiDAR scan-ner, RGB camera, radar, etc.), we propose a Cross-ModalEmbedding framework that aims to beneﬁt from the use of multiple input modalities. At training time, our model learns to embed a set of complementary features in a shared latent space by jointly optimizing the objective functions across different types of input data. At test time, a single input modality (e.g., LiDAR data) is required to generate predictions from the input perspective (i.e., in the LiDAR space), while taking advantages from the model trained with multiple sensor modalities. An extensive evaluation is con-ducted to show the efﬁcacy of the proposed framework using two benchmark driving datasets.
