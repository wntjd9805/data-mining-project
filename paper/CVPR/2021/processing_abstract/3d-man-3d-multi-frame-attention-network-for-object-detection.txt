3D object detection is an important module in au-tonomous driving and robotics. However, many existing methods focus on using single frames to perform 3D de-tection, and do not fully utilize information from multi-ple frames.In this paper, we present 3D-MAN: a 3D multi-frame attention network that effectively aggregates features from multiple perspectives and achieves state-of-the-art performance on Waymo Open Dataset. 3D-MANÔ¨Årst uses a novel fast single-frame detector to produce box proposals. The box proposals and their corresponding fea-ture maps are then stored in a memory bank. We design a multi-view alignment and aggregation module, using atten-tion networks, to extract and aggregate the temporal fea-tures stored in the memory bank. This effectively combines the features coming from different perspectives of the scene.We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the large-scale complex Waymo Open Dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results compared to published single-frame and multi-frame methods.
