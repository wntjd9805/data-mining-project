Fovea, located in the centre of the retina, is specialized for high-acuity vision. Mimicking the sampling mechanism of the fovea, a retina-inspired camera, named spiking cam-era, is developed to record the external information with a sampling rate of 40,000 Hz, and outputs asynchronous bi-nary spike streams. Although the temporal resolution of vi-sual information is improved, how to reconstruct the scenes is still a challenging problem. In this paper, we present a novel high-speed image reconstruction model through the short-term plasticity (STP) mechanism of the brain. We de-rive the relationship between postsynaptic potential regu-lated by STP and the ﬁring frequency of each pixel. By set-ting up the STP model at each pixel of the spiking camera, we can infer the scene radiance with the temporal regular-ity of the spike stream. Moreover, we show that STP can be used to distinguish the static and motion areas and fur-ther enhance the reconstruction results. The experimental results show that our methods achieve state-of-the-art per-formance in both image quality and computing time.Figure 1. Illustration of working mechanism for traditional cam-eras, event cameras, and spiking cameras. Traditional cameras acquire images according to the constant frame rate, event cam-eras generate asynchronous events for all pixels when brightness changes exceed a certain threshold, and spiking cameras continu-ously capture photons and generate asynchronous spike for all pix-els when the accumulated intensity reaches a predeﬁned threshold.
