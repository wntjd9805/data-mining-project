This paper introduces a method to encode the blur op-erators of an arbitrary dataset of sharp-blur image pairs into a blur kernel space. Assuming the encoded kernel space is close enough to in-the-wild blur operators, we pro-pose an alternating optimization algorithm for blind im-age deblurring.It approximates an unseen blur opera-tor by a kernel in the encoded space and searches for the corresponding sharp image. Unlike recent deep-learning-based methods, our system can handle unseen blur ker-nel, while avoiding using complicated handcrafted priors on the blur operator often found in classical methods. Due to the method’s design, the encoded kernel space is fully differentiable, thus can be easily adopted in deep neu-ral network models. Moreover, our method can be used for blur synthesis by transferring existing blur operators from a given dataset into a new domain. Finally, we pro-vide experimental results to conﬁrm the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/VinAIResearch/blur-kernel-space-exploring.
