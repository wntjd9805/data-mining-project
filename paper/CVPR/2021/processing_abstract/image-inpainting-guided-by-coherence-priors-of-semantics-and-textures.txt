Existing inpainting methods have achieved promising performance in recovering defective images of speciﬁc scenes. However, ﬁlling holes involving multiple seman-tic categories remains challenging due to the obscure se-mantic boundaries and the mixture of different semantic textures. In this paper, we introduce coherence priors be-tween the semantics and textures which make it possible to concentrate on completing separate textures in a semantic-wise manner. Speciﬁcally, we adopt a multi-scale joint op-timization framework to ﬁrst model the coherence priors and then accordingly interleaving optimize image inpaint-ing and semantic segmentation in a coarse-to-ﬁne manner.A Semantic-Wise Attention Propagation (SWAP) module is devised to reﬁne completed image textures across scales by exploring non-local semantic coherence, which effectively mitigates the mix-up of textures. We also propose two coher-ence losses to constrain the consistency between the seman-tics and the inpainted image in terms of the overall structure and detailed textures. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method for challenging cases with complex holes.
