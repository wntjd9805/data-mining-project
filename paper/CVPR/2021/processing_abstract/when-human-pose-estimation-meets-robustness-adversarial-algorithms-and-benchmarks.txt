Human pose estimation is a fundamental yet challeng-ing task in computer vision, which aims at localizing hu-man anatomical keypoints. However, unlike human vision that is robust to various data corruptions such as blur and pixelation, current pose estimators are easily confused by these corruptions. This work comprehensively studies and addresses this problem by building rigorous robust bench-marks, termed COCO-C, MPII-C, and OCHuman-C, to evaluate the weaknesses of current advanced pose estima-tors, and a new algorithm termed AdvMix is proposed to improve their robustness in different corruptions. Our work has several unique beneﬁts. (1) AdvMix is model-agnostic and capable in a wide-spectrum of pose estimation mod-els. (2) AdvMix consists of adversarial augmentation and knowledge distillation. Adversarial augmentation contains two neural network modules that are trained jointly and competitively in an adversarial manner, where a genera-tor network mixes different corrupted images to confuse a pose estimator, improving the robustness of the pose estima-tor by learning from harder samples. To compensate for the noise patterns by adversarial augmentation, knowledge dis-tillation is applied to transfer clean pose structure knowl-edge to the target pose estimator. (3) Extensive experiments show that AdvMix signiﬁcantly increases the robustness of pose estimations across a wide range of corruptions, while maintaining accuracy on clean data in various challenging benchmark datasets.
