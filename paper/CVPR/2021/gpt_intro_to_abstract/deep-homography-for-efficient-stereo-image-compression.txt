Stereo image compression (SIC) is a critical technique in the fields of autonomous driving, virtual reality, and video surveillance. It aims to compress a pair of stereoscopic left and right images to achieve a high compression rate for both images. Compared with single image compression, SIC is more challenging as it requires the exploitation of the inner relationship between the stereo images. Previous approaches relied on hand-crafted features and traditional optimization theory, which limited compression efficiency.This paper proposes an efficient stereo image compression network called HESIC based on homography transformation. HESIC overcomes the drawbacks of previous deep learning-based methods by using homography transformation instead of dense warp, reducing computational complexity. It also allows for stereo images that are not in the same horizontal line. HESIC outperforms state-of-the-art single image compression methods and achieves a 31.7% bit-rate reduction compared to DSIC, a recent SIC method, with similar image quality.The contributions of this paper include the proposal of HESIC, a novel stereo image compression network based on homography transformation. Two conditional entropy models are introduced to reduce redundancy between the stereo images. Additionally, a cross-quality enhancement module is developed in the decoder to enhance image quality using inverse homography matrix.
