Time series analysis of satellite imagery presents unique challenges in the field of computer vision, particularly in relation to disaster response, disease preparedness, and environmental monitoring. In order to advance this field, we have introduced the MUDS dataset, also known as SpaceNet 7, consisting of a large collection of satellite imagery and precise building footprint labels over dynamic areas spanning two dozen months. Each building in the dataset is assigned a unique identifier, enabling tracking of buildings over time. The ability to track building footprints in satellite imagery is crucial for monitoring construction and demolition activities. High-fidelity foundational maps derived from satellite imagery are essential in various domains, such as identifying at-risk communities, estimating population size based on new building construction, and assessing the burden on infrastructure.One of the key features of the MUDS dataset is the inclusion of unique building identifiers, which allow for more granular analysis of population growth and correlation with other features such as road access and distance to medical facilities. This unique feature sets the dataset apart from others and has the potential to improve existing population estimates.Satellite imagery presents several challenges, including small object size, high object density, significant image-to-image differences, limited texture information, and drastic changes in shadows and repeating patterns. These challenges are also relevant to other computer vision tasks, such as pathology slide images and microscopy data, making the lessons learned from this dataset applicable to a broader range of computer vision research.In addition to being a dataset, SpaceNet 7 is also a competition held at NeurIPS 2020. This paper provides detailed information about the dataset, evaluation metric, and a baseline algorithm. Further details about the SpaceNet 7 Challenge can be found in [9].
