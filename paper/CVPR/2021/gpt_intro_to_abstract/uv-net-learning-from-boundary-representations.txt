Parametric curves and surfaces are fundamental in computer-aided design (CAD) and are commonly used in design, simulation, and manufacturing. The industry standard for representing solid models is the Boundary representation (B-rep), a versatile data structure consisting of faces, edges, and vertices. However, there is limited research on applying deep neural networks directly to B-rep data. This is due to challenges such as the disparate nature of B-rep entities, the non-uniqueness of shape-surface mapping, and the consideration of topology. Preprocessing B-rep data into well-established representations like images, voxels, point clouds, or triangle meshes is possible but not without drawbacks. To address these challenges, this paper introduces UV-Net, a novel neural network architecture and representation designed specifically for B-rep entities. UV-Net captures geometric features as a regular grid in the parameter domain and represents topological information as a graph. The proposed architecture combines an image convolutional neural network (CNN) and a hierarchical graph-neural network in a computationally and memory-efficient manner. The paper also presents a synthetic labeled dataset called SolidLetters, which is balanced and includes variations in both geometry and topology. UV-Net is evaluated on multiple tasks, including 3D shape classification, segmentation, and self-supervised shape retrieval. The results demonstrate that UV-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance on both classification and segmentation tasks by leveraging the full B-rep data structure.
