Deep neural networks have greatly improved computer vision applications, such as image classification and object detection. However, these models require a large amount of accurately labeled data for training, which may not always be available. To address this issue, semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods have been developed to use unlabeled data to enhance model learning with limited annotated data. While SSL has been extensively studied in image classification tasks, there is limited research on semi-supervised object detection (SSOD). This paper proposes a new SSOD framework called Instant-Teaching, which utilizes instant pseudo labeling with extended weak-strong data augmentations for teaching during each training iteration. The framework improves the quality of pseudo annotations as the model converges during training. Additionally, a co-rectify scheme is introduced to alleviate confirmation bias and enhance the accuracy of pseudo annotations. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC and MS-COCO datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework, outperforming existing SSOD methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance in semi-supervised object detection.
