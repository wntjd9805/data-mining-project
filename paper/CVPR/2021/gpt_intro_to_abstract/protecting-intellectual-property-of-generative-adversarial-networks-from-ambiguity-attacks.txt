This paper focuses on the protection of intellectual property (IP) related to deep learning (DL) models, specifically generative adversarial networks (GANs). The authors highlight that while IP protection methods have been developed for convolutional neural networks (CNNs), similar protection mechanisms for GANs are lacking. The paper introduces two common approaches to IP protection: black-box trigger-set based solutions and white-box feature-based methods. However, these approaches have not been extensively applied to GANs. The authors propose a novel IP protection framework for GANs, which includes a new regularization term and an ownership verification method for different GANs variants. Extensive experiments show that this framework effectively protects the ownership of GAN models without compromising their performance. The proposed method is also tested against removal and ambiguity attacks, demonstrating its robustness. Overall, this paper presents a comprehensive framework for IP protection in the field of GANs.
