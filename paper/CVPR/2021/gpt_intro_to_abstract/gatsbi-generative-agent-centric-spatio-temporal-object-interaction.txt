This paper introduces a fully-unsupervised action-conditioned video prediction model called GATSBI (Generative Agent-cenTric Spatio-temporal oBject Interaction). The goal of GATSBI is to learn a decomposed latent representation of the observation sequence and predict associated latent dynamics in an agent-centric manner. GATSBI is explicitly designed for vision-based learning of robot agents and is able to distinguish the active, passive, and static components from the robot-object interaction sequence. By conditioning on actions and a few frames, GATSBI can predict long-term future observations without the need for prior labels or physics models. To accomplish this, GATSBI uses unsupervised networks to factorize each video frame into individual components and extract the latent dynamics. The large scene components are modeled using a 2D-Gaussian mixture model (GMM), while actively moving pixels are captured using a group of 2D-Gaussian keypoints. The best-matching GMM mode is selected and refined to learn the latent dynamics of the active agent. Additionally, small passive objects are extracted using attention-based object discovery models. Finally, graph neural networks (GNN) encode the interactions between the active agent, passive objects, and static background, reflecting the inherent physical properties within the graphical model.By inferring this decomposed latent representation and modeling the latent dynamics, GATSBI is able to understand the causal relationship between different components in a sequence of visual observations without requiring specific labels or prior knowledge. The acquired latent representation is aware of the dynamics in response to control actions and can be applied to make physically-plausible decisions for the agent. The paper includes extensive investigations on the qualitative and quantitative performance of GATSBI for video prediction in various robot-object interaction scenarios. The model is also compared with previous methods for spatio-temporal representation learning, demonstrating its promise and limitations.
