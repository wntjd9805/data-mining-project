This paper introduces a novel approach to address the problems of current scene text detection and recognition pipelines. The traditional approach of using a dictionary and the Levenshtein distance for recognition has several limitations, including incorrect outcomes for foreign or made-up words, lack of feedback loop, and inappropriate treatment of special symbols. The proposed approach incorporates a dictionary to generate a list of candidates, which are then scored to find the most compatible output. Additionally, the dictionary is incorporated into the end-to-end training procedure, allowing for training with hard examples. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the benefits of using a dictionary in both training and inference stages. The effectiveness of the approach is further demonstrated in recognizing non-English text, particularly Vietnamese, which is similar to other scripts such as Portuguese. An annotated dataset for Vietnamese scene text is introduced, showcasing the advantages of the proposed language incorporation approach. Overall, this paper presents a novel method for incorporating a language model into scene text recognition and provides valuable contributions in terms of datasets and improved recognition techniques.
