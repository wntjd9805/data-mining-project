Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are valuable for capturing detailed information compared to grayscale or RGB images. They have been widely used in various practical applications such as food security, disease diagnosis, and remote sensing. However, HSIs collected in real-world scenarios often suffer from complex noises due to sensor errors, atmospheric interference, and photon interference. These noises can negatively impact subsequent processing tasks and necessitate a denoising step. In this paper, we propose a novel weighting scheme for denoising HSIs that can adapt to diverse and complex noise distributions. We introduce a parametric function called Hyper-Weight-Net (HWnet) to explicitly capture the mapping relationship between the noisy HSI and the desired weighting scheme. By learning this explicit mapping, our method can adaptively assign weights to different HSI pixels, suppressing the negative effects of noisy elements. Our contributions include providing a data-driven method for capturing the general weighting principle for HSI denoising, validating the excellent generalization capability of our learned weighting scheme, and demonstrating the effectiveness of the weights in revealing complex noise insights. Experimental results validate the performance of our proposed method.
