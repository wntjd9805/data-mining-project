The goal of single image deblurring is to estimate a desirable clear image from a blurry input. This paper focuses on non-blind image deblurring, where the blur kernel is known or estimated. Non-blind image deblurring is an ill-posed problem and is typically formulated as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. The MAP framework requires carefully designing the data and regularization terms.Existing methods for non-blind image deblurring have made progress by improving either the data term or the regularization term. However, improving only one term limits the power of the MAP framework and can result in deblurred images with artifacts. In this paper, we propose a joint learning approach, where both the data term and the regularization term are learned simultaneously. This allows for a more expressive deblurring model and enables the interplay between these two terms, resulting in higher fidelity deblurred images.We also address the limitation of spatially invariant data and regularization terms, which cannot effectively capture the spatially variant properties of the image. To overcome this, we propose a spatially-variant MAP model (SVMAP) that predicts pixel-dependent filters to adjust the regularization behavior and treatment of data-term residuals.The contributions of this paper are as follows: (i) We propose an expressive filter-based MAP deblurring framework, where the data and regularization terms are jointly learned using deep neural networks. (ii) We introduce spatially-variant data and regularization terms by predicting pixel-dependent filters, allowing for better modeling of spatially-variant image structures and finer-scale details. (iii) We develop an end-to-end learning approach that integrates the MAP-based optimization framework as a constraint in the deep neural network. (iv) We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, showing improved deblurred results for images with Gaussian noise and outliers.Overall, our approach addresses the limitations of existing non-blind image deblurring methods by jointly learning the data and regularization terms and incorporating spatially-variant information. The experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our method in restoring high-quality clear images.
