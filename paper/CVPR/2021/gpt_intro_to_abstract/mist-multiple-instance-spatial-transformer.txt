Finding and processing instances of characteristic entities in a scene is crucial for computer vision applications such as object detection, pedestrian detection, and keypoint localization. Traditional approaches use top-K responses in a heatmap to localize entities, but this method lacks a gradient and cannot be integrated into neural network-based systems. Previous work introduced grids and optimization over multiple branches, but these approaches require additional supervision and have limited generalization capabilities.This paper presents a novel approach called Multiple Instance Spatial Transformer (MIST) to address this challenge. MIST utilizes a deep network to compute a heatmap, where the local maxima represent locations of interest. The parameters of the top-K local maxima are used to extract corresponding image patches, which are independently processed by task-specific networks. The outputs of these networks are then aggregated across patches.Training a pipeline with a non-differentiable selection/gather operation is complex. To overcome this, the parameters defining the interest points are treated as slack variables and a hard constraint is introduced to ensure their correspondence with the heatmap network output. This constraint is enforced by an auxiliary function that generates a heatmap based on the interest point parameters. The problem is solved in a relaxed version, where the hard constraint becomes soft and the slack variables are optimized during training. This training strategy allows the network to incorporate non-maximum suppression and top-K selection.The proposed approach is evaluated in three tasks: recovering basis functions for a given texture, detection and classification of handwritten digits in cluttered scenes, and object detection in natural images. Remarkably, our framework achieves these tasks without any location supervision and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in various scenarios, including natural images.Overall, this paper makes the following contributions: 1. Proposes an end-to-end training method that enables the use of top-K selection.2. Demonstrates the capability of the framework to reconstruct images as parts and detect/classify instances without any location supervision.3. Outperforms existing approaches in multiple scenarios, including natural image-based object detection.
