At night, capturing clear images can be challenging due to camera shake and the presence of lights, resulting in images that are both blurry and partially saturated. This paper focuses on the problem of blind deblurring, which involves recovering a sharp image from a single blurry image. While previous methods have been proposed to address this problem, they often struggle when dealing with images that contain saturated regions. These methods typically exclude saturated pixels from the deblurring process, resulting in limited effectiveness when dealing with large saturated regions. In this paper, we propose a novel blur model that considers both saturated and unsaturated pixels, allowing for the estimation of the blur kernel while avoiding the negative impact of saturated pixels. This model is differentiable, enabling further optimization. We develop a MAP-based optimization framework based on this model, which effectively estimates both the latent image and the blur kernel. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our contributions include the introduction of a new blur model that utilizes both saturated and unsaturated pixels, the development of an efficient MAP-based deblurring framework, and the demonstration of superior performance compared to existing methods.
