Video object segmentation (VOS) is a crucial task in various applications such as video editing, autonomous driving, robotics, and human-computer interaction. VOS can be divided into two settings: unsupervised and semi-supervised. This paper focuses on semi-supervised VOS, where the initial annotation of the objects is provided in the first frame. Most current semi-supervised VOS approaches treat the task as a binary classification problem and segment each instance separately. However, this approach has limitations in terms of computation efficiency and capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between instances. Some methods use region proposal networks to generate instance masks, but these approaches rely heavily on the region proposal model and lack temporal information. Recent methods have incorporated instance masks as prior knowledge during the input stream, but this can result in unclear segmentation boundaries and accumulation of ambiguity due to unstable temporal mask propagation. This paper introduces a new approach that handles multiple instances simultaneously, taking into account their relationships and achieving better performance and faster computation than previous methods.
