Weakly-supervised instance segmentation (WSIS) is a valuable technique in computer vision that reduces the need for human annotation efforts and aims to mimic human perception in visual learning systems. In this paper, we focus on the problem of weakly-supervised instance segmentation using bounding box annotations. We propose a joint training scheme that combines salient object segmentation with box-annotated images to simulate humans' historical memory and enhance segmentation accuracy. We also introduce mask merging and dropping strategies to generate high-quality proxy masks for training a Mask R-CNN model. Our experimental results on the PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving comparable or better performance than fully supervised instance segmentation methods. Our contributions include a novel weakly-supervised instance segmentation method, improved mask generation strategies, and a class-agnostic segmentation model with strong generalization ability.
