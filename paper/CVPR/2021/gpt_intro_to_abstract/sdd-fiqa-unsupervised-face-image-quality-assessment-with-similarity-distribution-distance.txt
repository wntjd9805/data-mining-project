Abstract:Face recognition systems often encounter challenges in real-world applications where environmental factors such as pose, illumination, and occlusion affect recognition accuracy. To ensure stable and reliable performance, Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) methods have been developed to evaluate the quality of face images. Existing FIQA methods can be analytics-based or learning-based. The learning-based approach, which generates quality scores from the recognition model, has shown promise but still has limitations. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based method called SDD-FIQA that considers both intra-class and inter-class recognition similarity distributions. By calculating the Wasserstein Distance between these distributions, we establish a quality pseudo-label for face image quality. We train a quality regression network under the constraint of Huber loss to accurately predict the face image quality score. Our SDD-FIQA method outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and generalization on benchmark datasets.
