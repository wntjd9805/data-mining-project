Graph edit distance (GED) is a widely used similarity measure in various computer vision and pattern recognition tasks. GED algorithms aim to find an optimal edit path from a source graph to a target graph with the minimum edit cost, which is a complex combinatorial problem. Existing exact GED solvers provide optimal solutions but lack scalability on large graphs and heavily rely on heuristics. Deep graph similarity learning approaches fail to recover the edit path. This paper proposes a hybrid solver that combines the strengths of both exact solvers and deep learning-based methods. The proposed Graph Edit Neural Network (GENN) integrates the A* algorithm with neural networks to predict similarity scores and guide the search process. The paper introduces two key contributions of GENN: reusing previous embedding information for efficient graph modification and learning more effective heuristics to enhance search speed. Experimental results demonstrate that GENN outperforms traditional heuristics in accuracy and offers a significant reduction in running time compared to exact solvers. This paper presents the first deep network solver for GED and provides a novel approach to dynamic graph embedding. The experiments show that GENN achieves better accuracy than inexact solvers and runs faster than exact GED solvers while ensuring comparable accuracy.
