This paper introduces a zero-shot approach for image restoration using the Koschmieder's light scattering model. It addresses the issue of poor visibility and color cast in images captured in hazy and underwater environments. The proposed approach does not rely on hand-crafted priors and instead learns the restoration task from the input image alone. By perturbing the Koschmieder's model parameters, an image-specific network model is designed to estimate the degradation and restore the image accordingly. The approach is evaluated on various real-world image datasets and demonstrates promising results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. This work contributes as the first zero-shot learning approach for dehazing and underwater image restoration without the need for prior-based loss functions or regularizers. It also highlights the versatility of the approach in different application domains where the degradation can be formulated using the Koschmieder's model. Additionally, the approach shows potential for low-light image enhancement.
