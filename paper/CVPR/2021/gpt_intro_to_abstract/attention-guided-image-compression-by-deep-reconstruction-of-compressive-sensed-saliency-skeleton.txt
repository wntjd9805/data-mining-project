Visual signal compression techniques have reached their performance limits, necessitating the exploration of alternative approaches to further improve bandwidth economy in visual communications. One promising approach is region-of-interest (ROI) image compression, which capitalizes on the inherent property of human vision: attention is not evenly distributed across all parts of an image. Instead, our focus is concentrated on specific regions of greater interest, usually corresponding to salient foreground objects. The concept of ROI compression emerged around twenty years ago, and this paper aims to explore and evaluate the potential benefits and limitations of this technique. By selectively compressing regions of interest while reducing the compression quality of less relevant areas, ROI compression offers the opportunity to achieve higher compression ratios without compromising perceptual quality. This paper presents an overview of the current state of ROI compression research and proposes experiments to evaluate its effectiveness compared to traditional compression methods. The results of these experiments will provide insights into the potential applications and limitations of ROI compression in improving bandwidth efficiency in visual communications.
