We present a regression-based 2D human pose recognition method called Pose Regression Transformers (PRTR). This method utilizes cascade Transformers consisting of a person detection Transformer and a keypoint detection Transformer. We offer two variations of PRTR: a two-stage process and a sequential process, where the two Transformers are learned sequentially and jointly, respectively. We incorporate multi-scale features in the keypoint detection Transformer and visualize the keypoint queries across different attention layers to illustrate the internal detection process. PRTR is a general-purpose approach for keypoint regression and shows competitive results in pose recognition compared to existing regression-based methods. Our contributions include proposing a regression-based method using cascade Transformers, developing two types of cascade Transformers, and providing visualizations to understand the internal process of the Transformer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PRTR on the COCO 2D human pose recognition dataset.
