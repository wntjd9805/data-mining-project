This paper introduces a hierarchical predictive model for learning what is predictable from unlabeled video. The central challenge in computer vision is selecting what to predict in the future, and while most representations are not adaptive to the uncertainties in video, there is still something predictable: the hyperonym that can be inferred from visual data. The proposed framework leverages the observation that hyperbolic geometry naturally encodes hierarchical structure and learns predictive models in hyperbolic space. The model can predict at different levels of abstraction based on its confidence, and experiments demonstrate its superiority in recognizing and forecasting actions compared to baselines. The model also automatically generates action hierarchies in the hyperbolic representation, highlighting the importance of hierarchical representations for prediction. The paper concludes with the availability of code and models for further exploration.
