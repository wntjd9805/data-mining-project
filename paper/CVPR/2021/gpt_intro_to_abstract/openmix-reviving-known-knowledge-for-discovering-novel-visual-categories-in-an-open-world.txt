Recent advances in deep learning have led to significant progress in visual recognition, specifically image classification. However, existing models that can identify thousands of classes with high accuracy require a large number of labeled training samples. While semi-supervised learning and noisy label learning can mitigate the need for annotations, they still require some form of clean or noisy annotations for every class of interest. Additionally, these models often fail to generalize to unseen (new) classes. Novel class discovery, a recently proposed problem, aims to identify new classes in unlabeled data with the support of knowledge from old classes. Current methods follow a two-step learning strategy, where the first step involves pre-training the model with labeled data to obtain basic discriminative ability, and the second step involves recognizing new classes in unlabeled data through unsupervised learning. However, labeled data are typically only used to learn off-the-shelf features and largely ignored in the second step. This paper argues that labeled data can provide essential knowledge about underlying object structures and common visual patterns, but exploiting labeled data in novel class discovery is challenging since labeled and unlabeled samples are from disjoint classes. To address this, the paper proposes a method called OpenMix, which incorporates labeled and unlabeled samples during unsupervised clustering. OpenMix leverages two priors in novel class discovery: the accuracy of labels for labeled samples of old classes and the fact that labeled and unlabeled samples belong to completely different classes. By mixing labeled and unlabeled samples, OpenMix generates training samples with reliable pseudo-labels, preventing the model from overfitting on incorrect pseudo-labels. The paper also introduces the concept of reliable anchors from unlabeled samples, which can be used to generate diverse smooth samples of new classes. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in novel class discovery on three datasets. Overall, this paper presents OpenMix as an effective approach for leveraging known knowledge in novel class discovery, allowing for the identification of new classes in unlabeled data.
