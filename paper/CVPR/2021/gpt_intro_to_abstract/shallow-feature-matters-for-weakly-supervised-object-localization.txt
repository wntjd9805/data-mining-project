Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) has gained attention in various applications, as it allows for object localization using only image-level labels. Existing WSOL methods mainly rely on class activation maps (CAMs), which are derived from deep layers of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, CAM-based models are originally designed for classification, leading to inconsistencies with localization objectives. Moreover, direct fusion of shallow and deep features in WSOL is flawed due to the interference of background noise and the activation of only the most discriminative regions.To address these limitations, we propose a Shallow feature-aware Pseudo supervised Object Localization (SPOL) model for accurate WSOL. The SPOL model consists of two stages: CAM generation and class-agnostic segmentation. In the CAM generation stage, a multiplicative feature fusion network (MFF-Net) is designed to aggregate shallow and deep features synergistically. This approach allows deep features to suppress noise from shallow features, while shallow features enhance object boundaries. In the class-agnostic segmentation stage, initial CAMs are refined using the Gaussian prior pseudo label (GPPL) module, which generates a pseudo label for class-agnostic segmentation module training. The refined CAMs combined with GPPL produce better localization results.We further develop a class-agnostic segmentation model using GPPL and CAMs as pseudo labels through another MFF-Net. During training, foreground and background regions are binarized based on CAM response thresholds, avoiding label conflicts. The obtained object mask is then refined using a bounding box extractor to achieve the final object localization.Our contributions can be summarized as follows:1. We propose the SPOL model, leveraging multiplicative feature fusion to fully utilize shallow features for WSOL.2. We introduce GPPL and a class-agnostic segmentation model to obtain a better object mask for WSOL.3. SPOL outperforms previous methods significantly on both CUB-200 and ImageNet-1K benchmarks.Overall, our proposed SPOL model addresses the limitations of existing WSOL approaches, leading to improved object localization performance.
