This paper addresses the problem of instance segmentation of point clouds. Instance segmentation involves assigning two labels to each point in a point cloud: the class label and the instance ID. While instance segmentation has seen success in the image domain, this paper argues that it is not sufficiently explored in the point clouds domain. The authors propose to use embedding-based instance segmentation, a popular approach in the image and volume domains, and apply it to point clouds. This approach involves embedding each point in a feature space and then grouping points using a clustering algorithm. The authors suggest that the dimensionality of the feature space is an important design choice, with some methods using high dimensional spaces and others using low dimensional spaces. The main goal of this work is to extend the expressiveness of the embedding space by employing probabilistic embeddings, where each point in the embedding space is encoded by a distribution. Incorporating uncertainty through probabilistic embeddings leads to improved segmentation performance. The authors introduce this idea to the task of instance segmentation and demonstrate its effectiveness on the PartNet dataset. The paper provides more details on the probabilistic embedding algorithm, as well as the embedding and clustering steps. The main contributions of this work are the proposal of using probabilistic embeddings for instance segmentation, the development of a new loss function for clustering, and the demonstration of how probabilistic embeddings can be incorporated into existing embedding-based methods.
