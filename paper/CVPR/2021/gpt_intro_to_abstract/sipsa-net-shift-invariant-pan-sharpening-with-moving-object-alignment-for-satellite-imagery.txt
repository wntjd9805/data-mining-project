Satellite images have become crucial in various applications, including environmental monitoring, surveillance systems, and mapping services. Google EarthTM is a popular virtual globe application that relies on high-resolution multi-spectral (MS) images obtained through pan-sharpening software. Pan-sharpening involves fusing low-resolution MS images with high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images to generate pan-sharpened (PS) images that should possess both the high-frequency details of PAN images and the color accuracy of MS images. However, PS images often exhibit artifacts, with less sharp details compared to PAN images and distorted colors compared to MS images. Deep-learning-based pan-sharpening methods have shown promising results, outperforming previous methods, but they still face challenges due to misalignment between PAN and MS image pairs caused by sensor differences, physical locations, and capturing time. This misalignment results in artifacts, especially on moving objects. In this paper, we propose SIPSA-Net, a novel framework that tackles the misalignment issue and considers both global and local misalignments. SIPSA-Net includes a feature alignment module (FAM) to align MS colors with PAN shapes, and a shift-invariant spectral loss to address misalignment in MS inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that SIPSA-Net produces well-aligned PS images, particularly in regions with moving objects. Our contributions include the development of an alignment-aware pan-sharpening method, the introduction of a feature alignment module, and the proposal of a shift-invariant spectral loss for color registration in misaligned MS images.
