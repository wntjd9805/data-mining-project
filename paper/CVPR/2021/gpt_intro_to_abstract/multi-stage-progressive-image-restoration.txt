Image restoration is the process of recovering a clean image from a degraded version with common degradations such as noise, blur, rain, and haze. Existing restoration techniques use handcrafted image priors based on empirical observations, but designing such priors is challenging and not easily generalizable. To address this, recent approaches have utilized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn more general priors from large-scale data. CNN-based methods have shown superior performance in image restoration due to their model design, which includes various network modules and functional units. However, most models for low-level vision problems are based on single-stage design, while multi-stage networks have been found to be more effective in high-level vision problems. Limited efforts have been made to apply multi-stage design to image deblurring and deraining, and we analyze these approaches to identify the architectural bottlenecks that hinder their performance. We propose a multi-stage progressive image restoration architecture, called MPRNet, which employs an encoder-decoder architecture for multi-scale contextual information and preserves fine spatial details. We introduce a supervised attention module (SAM) between stages for progressive learning and a cross-stage feature fusion (CSFF) mechanism to propagate features across stages. Our MPRNet achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple restoration tasks while maintaining low complexity. We provide detailed ablations, qualitative results, and generalization tests to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
