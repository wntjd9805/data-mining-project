Due to the presence of haze, outdoor images often suffer from low contrast and limited visibility, which negatively impacts computer vision tasks such as object detection and recognition. Image dehazing, which aims to recover clean images from hazy inputs, has gained considerable attention in recent years. This paper introduces a Principled Synthetic-to-real Dehazing (PSD) framework that can be used to generalize existing dehazing models to the real domain. The framework consists of two phases: supervised pre-training and unsupervised fine-tuning. In the pre-training phase, a chosen dehazing model backbone is modified into a physics-based network and trained using synthetic data. This produces a pre-trained model with reliable dehazing performance on the synthetic domain. In the fine-tuning phase, real hazy images are used to train the model in an unsupervised manner. The framework leverages three physical priors to guide the fine-tuning process, ensuring that the model generalizes well to the real domain. Experimental results demonstrate that the PSD framework outperforms existing domain adaptation dehazing models, establishing a new state-of-the-art in real-world dehazing performance. The contributions of this work include re-formulating the dehazing task as a synthetic-to-real generalization framework, leveraging physical priors for fine-tuning guidance, and achieving superior dehazing performance through comprehensive evaluation.
