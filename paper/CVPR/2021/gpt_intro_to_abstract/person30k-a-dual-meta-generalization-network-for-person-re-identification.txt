Person re-identification (ReID) is the task of matching individuals across different cameras. While learning-based ReID methods have shown promise, they often struggle with generalizing to unseen cameras due to domain gaps in data. This paper aims to enhance the generalization capability of ReID models. Additionally, the limitations of existing datasets are discussed, leading to the creation of a new dataset called Person30K. This dataset has a larger scale, higher data diversity, and more varied scenes compared to previous benchmarks. The proposed Dual-Meta Generalization Network (DMG-Net) utilizes a meta-learning scheme to improve generalization and discrimination in ReID. The DMG-Net is trained using a virtual "learning then generalization evaluation" process and incorporates a meta-discrimination loss to improve the metric space. The contributions of this paper include the creation of the Person30K dataset and the introduction of the DMG-Net for generalizable person ReID.
