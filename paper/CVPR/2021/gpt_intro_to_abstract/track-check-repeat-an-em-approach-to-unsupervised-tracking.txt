Humans have the remarkable ability to detect and delineate moving objects without any explicit supervision. This ability is thought to be influenced by perceptual grouping cues that make certain regions appear more object-like. In computer vision literature, objectness cues have been studied, but they have not yet been effectively incorporated into self-supervised object detectors. Existing recognition and tracking methods heavily rely on manual annotations, while unsupervised deep learning-based approaches mainly focus on simple toy worlds. This paper aims to leverage the successes of classic object discovery techniques and use them to bootstrap the learning of more general detectors. The authors propose an optimization algorithm based on expectation maximization to learn detectors of moving objects. By starting with a conservative handcrafted detector and generating diverse training examples, the learned models can generalize and expand recall. The ensemble of models outperforms both traditional methods and current learning-based approaches, demonstrating success in synthetic and real-world environments. The main contribution lies in the combination of components to train a learning-based method without annotations, utilizing successful outcomes from traditional methods.
