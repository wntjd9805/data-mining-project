Surface reconstruction from point clouds is a challenging problem in computational geometry and computer vision. The goal is to triangulate the given point cloud to create a connected, manifold, and watertight surface. Existing methods have different limitations, such as oversmoothing sharp features or requiring dense and uniformly sampled point sets. In recent years, learning-based approaches have been developed, but they either disregard triangle quality or struggle with reconstructing sharp features. In this paper, we propose a method that combines classical methods with data priors learned through blending Delaunay surface elements. Our approach involves predicting a local projection using learned logarithmic maps and using local Delaunay triangulations to propose likely triangles. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive experiments on diverse surface point sets, comparing it to both classical and learning-based methods. Our method generalizes well across different test sets, is more robust than classical approaches, and produces higher-quality triangulations than recent learning-based methods.This research addresses the limitations of existing methods by directly meshing the input point set, allowing better control over the final shape and avoiding oversmoothing. Our approach offers a promising solution for surface reconstruction from point clouds, ensuring preservation of the original point set and capturing sharp features accurately.
