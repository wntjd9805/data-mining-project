Self-driving vehicles (SDV) are critical applications that require comprehensive testing before real-world deployment. As SDV systems improve in natural and well-behaved scenarios, it becomes crucial to identify scenarios in which the system is likely to fail. However, searching exhaustively over all possible scenarios is computationally infeasible due to the exponential number of scenario variations.The current industry practice for comprehensive testing relies on human expertise to create an initial scenario set. However, these scenarios only evaluate simple interactions and do not test complex multi-actor interactions. Additionally, manual design is time-consuming and may result in missing testing configurations.To address this problem, recent works aim to automate scenario generation by searching for high-risk scenarios using a cost function. However, most previous works only consider motion planning modules that have access to ground-truth actor states, overlooking issues in perception and motion forecasting modules.In this paper, we propose an adversarial scenario generation pipeline to find complex and realistic safety-critical scenarios at scale for SDV systems. We frame the generation of worst-case scenarios as a black box adversarial attack, exploring physically feasible changes in actor behavior. We leverage real-world traffic scenarios and optimize actors' trajectories while adjusting sensor data using a high-fidelity LiDAR simulator.Our approach captures multiple safety factors and generates over 4000 adversarial scenarios for a wide range of autonomy systems. We demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of our approach and leverage the generated safety-critical scenarios for training and improving the safety of autonomy systems.
