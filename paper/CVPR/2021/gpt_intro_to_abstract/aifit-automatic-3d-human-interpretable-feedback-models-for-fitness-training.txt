In this paper, we propose AIFit, an AI-enhanced training system for fitness. The system utilizes 3D human sensing and AI to reconstruct human pose, count repetitions, and provide localized feedback. To support our research, we introduce Fit3D, a large-scale dataset consisting of over 3 million images and ground truth 3D motion capture poses. Our methodology includes evaluating 3D human pose reconstruction, developing models for automatic identification of exercise repetitions, and comparing instructors' and trainees' performances. We introduce a statistical coach parameter that adapts to a student's level of fitness and the accuracy of pose reconstruction. Our feedback system based on 3D pose estimates achieves high accuracy when compared to ground-truth motion capture. The statistical coach provides visually grounded, easy-to-understand spatio-temporal feedback in natural language.
