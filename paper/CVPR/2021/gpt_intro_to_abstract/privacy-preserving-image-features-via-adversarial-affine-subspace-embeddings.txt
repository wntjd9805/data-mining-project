Image feature extraction and matching are essential steps in various computer vision applications, including 3D reconstruction, image retrieval, and face recognition. These features can be categorized as low-level, mid-level, or high-level, depending on their information content. They can be hand-crafted or learned using data-driven techniques and are typically represented as high-dimensional vectors. Comparing these feature vectors using distance metrics forms the basis for retrieval and recognition techniques.However, recent advancements in feature inversion methods have raised privacy concerns. These methods allow the reconstruction of the original image appearance from extracted features, potentially exposing sensitive information. To address this concern, significant efforts have been made to develop privacy-preserving machine learning systems, including homomorphic cryptosystems, differential privacy, federated learning, and specific solutions for camera localization.In this paper, we propose a new feature representation for visual recognition and matching tasks that make it challenging for adversaries to reconstruct image contents. Our approach introduces marginal computational overhead and is applicable to various practical scenarios. The core idea is to represent a descriptor point as an affine subspace passing through the original point. We refer to this process as lifting. The dimension of the subspace allows a trade-off between accuracy, runtime, and privacy level. To enhance the difficulty of inversion, we propose a strategy for constructing lifted subspaces that contain additional adversarial feature points. Experimental results demonstrate strong privacy preservation even for low-dimensional affine subspaces.We present the concept of lifting and the technique for matching lifted features. Additionally, we analyze the performance of these features in image matching for visual localization and mapping, as well as face authentication. Finally, we demonstrate the resilience of our proposed representation against potential privacy attacks. The code and evaluation protocol of our method will be made available as open-source.
