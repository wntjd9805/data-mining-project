Image denoising is a fundamental task in computer vision, as noise contamination can degrade the visual quality of images and affect subsequent image analysis tasks. While traditional denoising methods use local or non-local structures, recent convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown superior performance. However, CNN-based denoisers rely on large amounts of noisy-clean image pairs for training, which is challenging and expensive to collect. To address this issue, unsupervised and self-supervised methods have been proposed, but they have their own limitations. In this paper, we propose Neighbor2Neighbor, a novel self-supervised image denoising framework that overcomes these limitations. Our approach includes a training image pairs generation strategy based on sub-sampling and a self-supervised training scheme with a regularization term. By utilizing the sub-sampled paired images, which are assumed to be independent given the ground-truth, we train a denoising network. We also introduce a regularization term to account for the difference in pixel ground-truth values between neighbors. Our framework does not require clean targets, network modifications, or noise model assumptions. Experimental results show that Neighbor2Neighbor outperforms traditional denoisers and existing self-supervised methods on both synthetic and real-world noisy images. Our contributions include the proposal of a novel self-supervised framework for image denoising, a theoretical motivation for the framework, and the demonstration of its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
