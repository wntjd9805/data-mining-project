This paper addresses the problem of generating paintings in the style of Amedeo Modigliani with a limited amount of training data. Existing generative models require thousands of images to train properly, but in many domains, such as the Artistic-Faces dataset, there is only a small collection of images available. Transfer learning has been explored as an alternative, but most methods are designed for scenarios with more than 100 training images. In this work, the authors propose a novel approach that transfers information about the relationships between images from a source domain to a target domain. They introduce a cross-domain distance consistency loss to enforce similarity in the distribution of pairwise distances of generated samples before and after adaptation. The authors show that this approach can automatically discover correspondences between related domains, leading to more diverse and realistic image generation. The proposed method also handles unrelated domains by still discovering interesting part-level correspondences. To balance realism and diversity, the authors apply both image-level and patch-level adversarial losses. The main contribution of this paper is a new GAN adaptation framework that achieves impressive results in generating images with limited training data.
