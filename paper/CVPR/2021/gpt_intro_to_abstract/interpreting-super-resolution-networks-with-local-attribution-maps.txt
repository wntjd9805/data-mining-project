Deep learning has gained popularity in the field of image super-resolution (SR) due to its superior performance. However, the workings of these SR networks remain unclear, and understanding what has been learned and how it contributes to performance improvement is still a challenge. This paper proposes an attribution analysis of SR networks to identify the input pixels that strongly influence network outputs. The analysis is visualized through attribution maps, highlighting the most important pixels. The paper introduces the Local Attribution Map (LAM) method, employing path integral gradients, blurred images as baseline inputs, and a novel progressively blurring function. Using LAM, several observations are made: the range of pixels involved in the SR process significantly impacts performance, attention and non-local schemes enhance feature extraction from a wider range of input pixels, simply expanding the receptive field does not involve more influential pixels, and existing SR networks are better at extracting textures with regular patterns but struggle with complex semantics. These observations have scientific and practical benefits, aiding in understanding SR network mechanisms, designing more efficient architectures, and advancing deep learning in low-level vision tasks. The paper hopes to contribute to a formal understanding of SR networks.
