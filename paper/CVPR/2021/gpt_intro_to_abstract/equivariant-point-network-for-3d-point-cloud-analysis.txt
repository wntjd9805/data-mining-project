This paper introduces an effective and practical framework for learning SE(3)-equivariant features of point clouds in the 3D learning tasks. The authors address two main problems in extending convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyzing point clouds: the computational cost of computing convolutions in the SE(3) space and the challenge of fully harnessing the expressiveness of equivariant features without losing structural information. To tackle the computational cost issue, the authors propose SE(3) separable convolution, a novel paradigm that breaks down the 6D convolution into two separable convolutional operators performed in the 3D Euclidean and SO(3) spaces. This significantly reduces the computational cost and makes the framework practical for deployment on commodity hardware. To address the challenge of fusing equivariant features, the authors introduce group attentive pooling (GA pooling), an attention mechanism specially tailored for fusing rotation-equivariant features. GA pooling adaptively fuses rotation-equivariant features into their invariant counterparts by generating attention weights based on an implicitly learned local frame of the feature space. Furthermore, the authors highlight the discriminative nature of equivariant features, which preserve the spatial structure and can be utilized for inferring 3D rotations. They demonstrate the superiority of the equivariant framework over a non-equivariant framework in a shape alignment task.The proposed framework is validated on various tasks and consistently outperforms strong baselines. The authors also conduct ablation analysis and provide qualitative visualization to evaluate the effectiveness of each algorithmic component. Overall, this paper provides a promising approach for learning SE(3)-equivariant features of point clouds, opening new possibilities for 3D learning tasks.
