This paper focuses on the important role of 3D sensors in perceiving the environment geometry, particularly in home service robots, autonomous cars, and mobile devices. The use of point clouds as an efficient data type to represent 3D scenes has led to the development of point-cloud-based neural networks for analyzing semantic labels for each point. These networks typically employ an "Encoder-Decoder" architecture, where the encoder extracts features from neighbors progressively, and the decoder combines low-level and propagated neighboring features to parse semantic labels. In real scenes, certain objects are distinctive and easily classifiable, while others are easily confused due to their similarity in 3D contour. The dependency between multiple objects in a scene can be leveraged by considering neighbor context to identify these categories. The context for points located in the center area of an object mainly focuses on the object itself, while in joint areas of two different category objects, points gather features from both the same and different categories, serving as components for object classification and inferring co-occurrence relations. Previous works often use a unified operator for both types of feature learning, resulting in ambiguity in joint areas. JSENet detects edge areas but falls short in addressing semantic segmentation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a neighbor category-guided-aggregation method for enhancing representation in semantic segmentation. The method explicitly models inter-relations between objects of different categories and enhances intra-consistency within a single object. By finding k nearest neighbors for each point and identifying whether they belong to the same category, the feature of the center point is augmented through weighted sum aggregation. For different category points, a novel module is designed to learn how information from different objects supports the feature learning of the center point. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on various datasets, improving both joint areas and objects with internal noise. The contributions of this paper include the two-path feature augmentation architecture, the relational module, and the experimental validation of the method's effectiveness.
