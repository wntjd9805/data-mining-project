Face detection is an important research topic in computer vision, with various downstream applications relying on its accuracy and speed. As camera hardware evolves to support higher resolutions, such as 8K, existing face detection models often struggle to perform well on these inputs. This is due to limitations in anchor size and training data. Most anchors are designed for lower resolution datasets, and predicting large residuals for 8K resolutions is challenging. Collecting labeled 8K training data is also expensive and designing large anchors can decrease average precision. Multi-scale approaches have been used to address these challenges, but they are slower and rely on majority confidence. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning approach to refine confidence in face detection. We replace prediction confidence with the intersect-over-union (IoU) between predicted and ground truth boxes, and show that this "oracle" confidence significantly outperforms existing methods. We formulate confidence refinement as a supervised learning problem and propose a confidence ranking network that operates on a single scale, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-scale methods while remaining faster. This model-agnostic network can be used with various face detectors. Our method also solves the GPU memory issue and allows for indirect training on 8K resolution, leading to further improvement in average precision. We provide a new benchmark dataset for future camera hardware. Our contributions include refining confidence in a local relative setting, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a single scale, and addressing the GPU memory issue while improving average precision on 8K resolution.
