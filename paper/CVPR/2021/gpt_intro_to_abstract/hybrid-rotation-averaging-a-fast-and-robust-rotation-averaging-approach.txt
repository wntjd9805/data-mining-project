Rotation averaging is a fundamental problem in computer vision that involves estimating absolute camera orientations based on pairwise relative orientations. This estimation is crucial in tasks like Structure from Motion (SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), as it can accelerate camera pose estimation and reduce drift accumulation. In global SfM, a view graph is constructed to capture all connections between pairs of views, and rotation averaging provides the absolute orientation of each view. In SLAM, rotation averaging is used in the back-end pose graph optimization to handle large drift accumulations. Previous approaches to rotation averaging have focused on local optimization or global optimization, each with their own advantages and limitations. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that combines a global solver and a local solver to improve the efficiency and robustness of rotation averaging. By formulating rotation averaging as a semidefinite program with a low-rank constraint, we can leverage globally optimal Riemannian-Staircase-based methods. We also employ fast view graph filtering and block coordinate minimization to exploit graph sparsity and accelerate the optimization. Our approach is embedded into an incremental SfM pipeline, where camera rotations are estimated globally and camera centers are estimated incrementally. We introduce a novel cost function that incorporates the global rotations obtained from rotation averaging to alleviate drift accumulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach through extensive experiments on large-scale real-world datasets. Our proposed method, called RA-SfM (Rotation-Averaged Structure from Motion), outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.
