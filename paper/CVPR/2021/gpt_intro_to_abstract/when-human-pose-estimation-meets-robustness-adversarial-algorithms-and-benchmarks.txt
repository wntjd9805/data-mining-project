Human pose estimation (HPE) is a critical task in action recognition and video surveillance. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown great progress on clean and high-resolution datasets, deploying models in real-world scenarios requires robustness to commonly occurring image corruptions. However, existing pose estimation methods have limited robustness in outdoor environments due to noise or blur caused by weather conditions or camera systems. In this work, we address the challenge of improving the robustness of pose estimators by analyzing and enhancing their performance in the face of image corruptions. Unlike previous studies on common robustness for classification, detection, and segmentation, human pose estimation poses unique challenges due to the use of both classification and regression methods to model the structures of the human body. We outline three key challenges in improving robust human pose estimation: the lack of robustness benchmark, the trade-off between accuracy on clean and corrupted data, and the need to effectively combine existing data augmentation techniques. To address these challenges, we propose robust pose benchmarks, consisting of challenging datasets with a full spectrum of unforeseen corruption types. We evaluate existing pose estimators on these benchmarks and identify their weaknesses, including severe performance drops on corrupted images. Our empirical evaluations also reveal that existing models are more robust to brightness and weather changes, but less robust to motion and zoom blur. To improve model robustness, we propose an augmentation generator that learns to combine augmented images using weight mixing. Additionally, we introduce a pre-trained teacher pose estimator to transfer structure knowledge to the target pose estimator, reducing the negative impact of drift in augmented images on clean data performance. Our proposed method, AdvMix, significantly improves model robustness while maintaining or slightly improving performance on clean data, without introducing computational overhead at inference time. We propose three robust benchmarks and provide insights and conclusions to help improve the accuracy and robustness of future pose estimation models. Overall, our contributions include the introduction of robust benchmarks, the proposal of AdvMix, an adversarial data augmentation method combined with knowledge distillation, and extensive experimentation to evaluate and improve the robustness of pose estimation models.
