Estimating the relative pose between two images is a fundamental task in computer vision with important applications such as 3D reconstruction and camera localization. While traditional approaches rely on iterative model fitting using corresponding points, recent advancements have explored the use of deep learning modules to directly estimate the essential matrix. However, supervised deep learning for pose estimation is challenging, especially in difficult scenarios with low image overlap or changes in scale or perspective.In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model for relative pose estimation, specifically targeting the wide-baseline case. Our model generates a discrete probability distribution over relative poses and computes the final pose estimate as the expectation of this distribution. This approach builds upon the idea that estimating a discrete distribution consistently outperforms direct regression in various computer vision tasks. However, directly applying this concept to complex higher dimensional output spaces, such as relative camera pose, is currently intractable for neural networks.To overcome this challenge, we introduce a formulation that utilizes a parameterization of the motion space based on 3D direction vectors. We also propose a convolutional encoder-decoder model called DirectionNet, which predicts sets of 3D direction vectors and generates discrete distributions on the sphere. Our core contributions are in recognizing the advantages of incorporating a dense structured output and in introducing an efficient technique to execute this idea. DirectionNet is fully-convolutional and allows for additional supervision, improving wide-baseline relative pose estimation.We evaluate DirectionNet on two challenging wide-baseline pose estimation datasets and compare its performance with direct regression approaches and classic feature-based methods. Our results consistently show that DirectionNet outperforms these approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of estimating discrete probability distributions for relative pose estimation. Furthermore, our findings validate the success of supervised data-driven approaches in extreme cases where traditional methods struggle.
