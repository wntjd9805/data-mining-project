Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a key task in human-centric scene understanding, which involves detecting both persons and objects in an image and identifying the interactions between them. Existing HOI detection methods can be categorized into one-stage and two-stage approaches based on the order in which object detection and interaction detection are performed. One-stage methods perform both tasks simultaneously, making them more efficient and structurally elegant, while two-stage methods tend to be more accurate. However, one of the challenges for one-stage methods is accurately representing the "interaction area" for each human-object pair. Existing approaches define this area artificially, which often leads to semantic ambiguity or overlaps between pairs. To address this challenge, we propose a novel model called Glance and Gaze Network (GGNet) that adapts a set of action-aware points to represent the interaction area. GGNet mimics the two steps taken by humans to identify human-object interactions: first glancing at the scene to identify possible pairs and then gazing at discriminative areas to identify the interaction class. The model determines interaction points (ActPoints) through a glance step and refines their location through a gaze step. We also introduce an action-aware point matching (AP-M) approach to match each interaction with its associated human-object pair, considering that the spatial layout can be influenced by the interaction category. Furthermore, we propose a novel focal loss, called Hard Negative Attentive (HNA) loss, to address the imbalance problem between positive and negative samples for each interaction category. HNA loss highlights hard negative samples, which are inferred between meaningful HOI categories containing the same object, to clarify the decision boundary between easily confused interaction categories.Experimental results on popular HOI detection databases demonstrate that GGNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The proposed AP-M and HNA loss can also be applied to other interaction point-based HOI detection methods. Overall, our approach offers a more efficient and accurate solution for HOI detection.
