Introduction:Image classification is a widely studied problem in computer vision, with evaluations typically performed on meticulously constructed datasets that are meticulously curated, ensuring they are both clean and balanced. In this paper, we present a study conducted by authors from Stanford University, Carnegie Mellon University, and Google Research, focusing on rare category classification. Existing datasets often have a very low percentage of positive samples for rare categories, which poses significant challenges for traditional classification models. To address this issue, we propose a Rare Category Classification Dataset (RCCD) that includes labels for rare categories, as well as a standard training label distribution. The main objective of this research is to investigate the performance of various image classifiers on the RCCD dataset and compare their effectiveness in correctly classifying rare category samples. The findings of this study will provide insights into the efficacy of existing classifiers and offer potential solutions to improve the accuracy of classifying rare category samples in image classification tasks.
