Computer vision has experienced a remarkable period of growth and advancement due to the breakthroughs in deep learning. This has resulted in increased interest and participation in the field, as evidenced by the growing number of attendees and paper submissions at conferences. The impact of computer vision is widely recognized, with CVPR being ranked as one of the most influential publication venues. Furthermore, governments, academic institutions, and tech companies have made significant investments in AI research.However, despite the apparent success, computer vision faces several challenges. The sheer volume of papers being published and the popularity of instant publication venues like arXiv have made it difficult for individuals to keep up with the latest developments. Peer review processes are strained, leading to potentially arbitrary acceptance decisions. Additionally, the lack of diversity in the field, both in terms of gender and race, raises concerns.Ethical considerations surrounding computer vision have also emerged, such as safety issues with self-driving cars, potential misuse of surveillance technology, exploitation of workers, and biases in face recognition algorithms. Major datasets used in computer vision research have been found to contain biased and derogatory content, leading to their retraction.In this study, the researchers sought to investigate the emotional experiences of computer vision researchers and practitioners. They collected and analyzed stories from various individuals, showcasing their emotions and perspectives on their work within the field. The findings reveal a mix of excitement for progress and concerns about the future, with some individuals feeling isolated and struggling to find their place. The researchers argue that understanding and addressing these emotional experiences is crucial for the continued growth and inclusivity of the computer vision community.While this paper does not present any technical contributions, it highlights the importance of considering emotional aspects and fostering a broader conversation about the future of the field. By amplifying these emotions, the researchers aim to initiate discussions and actions to ensure a vibrant and inclusive community.
