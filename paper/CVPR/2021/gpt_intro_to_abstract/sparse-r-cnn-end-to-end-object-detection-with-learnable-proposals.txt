Object detection is a widely studied problem in computer vision, involving the localization and recognition of objects in images. Traditional methods have relied on dense prior information, such as applying classifiers on a dense image grid or using dense feature maps with pre-defined marks. While these methods have shown robust performance, they suffer from limitations such as producing redundant results and being sensitive to heuristic assignment rules. In recent years, there has been interest in developing sparse object detectors that overcome these limitations.One approach, known as DETR, formulates object detection as a sparse set prediction problem. However, DETR still requires each object query to interact with dense image features, limiting its sparsity. In this paper, we propose Sparse R-CNN, a purely sparse method for object detection. Unlike traditional methods, Sparse R-CNN does not rely on enumerating object positional candidates on dense image grids or interacting with global dense image features. Instead, it uses a fixed set of learnable bounding boxes as proposal boxes and extracts features using region of interest pooling.One key concept in Sparse R-CNN is the use of proposal features, which are high-dimensional latent vectors that encode rich instance characteristics. These proposal features generate customized parameters for the object recognition head, resulting in improved accuracy compared to traditional methods. Importantly, both the proposal boxes and proposal features are randomly initialized and optimized together with other parameters in the network.Sparse R-CNN follows a sparse-in, sparse-out paradigm throughout the entire pipeline, without the need for dense candidates or interactions with global dense features. Experimental results on the COCO dataset demonstrate that Sparse R-CNN achieves comparable accuracy, runtime, and training convergence performance to well-established detectors. It achieves an average precision of 45.0% with a training schedule of 3x and runs at 22 frames per second using a ResNet-50 FPN model. To the best of our knowledge, Sparse R-CNN is the first method that demonstrates the effectiveness of a considerably sparse design for object detection. We hope our work inspires further exploration of sparse object detection methods and rethinking the importance of dense prior information in this field.
