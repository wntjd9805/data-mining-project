Recent advancements in deep learning-based instance segmentation have relied heavily on large-scale labeled data, making them impractical for real-world applications that involve time-consuming data collection and labeling processes. Additionally, for open-set instance segmentation tasks, where not all categories can be labeled, there is a need for segmenting unlabeled unseen classes. In response to these challenges, zero-shot learning methods have been proposed, primarily focusing on zero-shot classification. However, these approaches are limited to reasoning a single dominant unseen object, making them unsuitable for real-world scenarios where multiple unseen objects of different classes can appear simultaneously. To address this limitation, zero-shot object detection and zero-shot semantic segmentation have been introduced. However, both methods fail to provide fine pixel-level segmentation results. In order to meet this demand, a new problem setting called zero-shot instance segmentation (ZSI) is introduced. ZSI aims to not only detect all unseen objects but also precisely segment each unseen instance. The main challenges in ZSI are how to perform instance segmentation for unseen classes and how to reduce confusion between background and unseen classes. To address the first challenge, semantic knowledge contained in pre-trained word vectors is utilized to establish a visual-semantic mapping relationship between seen and unseen classes, enabling the transfer of segmentation capabilities from seen to unseen classes. A zero-shot detector and Semantic Mask Head (SMH) are proposed to achieve this. To tackle the second challenge, the representation of the background class is crucial. Existing semantic representations of the background class are deemed unreasonable and fixed, posing difficulties in adapting to changing backgrounds in different images. To overcome this, a reasonable and dynamic adaptive word vector for the background class is proposed. Overall, this paper presents a comprehensive solution for zero-shot instance segmentation, addressing the limitations of previous approaches and providing fine-grained results for real-world scenarios.
