Co-salient object detection (CoSOD) is a challenging task in computer vision that aims to identify common salient objects across multiple relevant images. Unlike standard salient object detection (SOD), CoSOD requires distinguishing co-occurring objects in the presence of other objects. In this paper, we propose a novel group collaborative learning framework called GCoNet to address the limitations of existing CoSOD models. GCoNet consists of three key components: the group affinity module (GAM), the group collaborating module (GCM), and the auxiliary classification module (ACM). GAM enables the network to learn consensus features within the same image group, while GCM discriminates target attributes between different groups to promote intra-group compactness and inter-group separability. Additionally, ACM enhances the feature representation at a global semantic level. Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging CoSOD benchmarks demonstrate that GCoNet achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we present two downstream applications based on our contributions: co-segmentation and co-localization. Our work addresses the limitations of current CoSOD models and provides a promising approach for accurate and efficient co-salient object detection.
