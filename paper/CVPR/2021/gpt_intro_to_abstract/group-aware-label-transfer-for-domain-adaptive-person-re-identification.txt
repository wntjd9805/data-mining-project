Person re-identification (ReID) is a crucial task in computer vision, which involves matching person images from different camera networks. While existing approaches have achieved remarkable performance when the training and testing data are from the same application scenario, they often fail to generalize well to other scenarios due to domain gaps. Therefore, there is a need to study the problem of Unsupervised Domain Adaptive (UDA) person re-identification.Existing UDA ReID approaches typically include feature pre-training, clustering-based pseudo-label prediction, and feature representation learning/ fine-tuning with pseudo-labels. However, the pseudo-labels assigned through clustering often contain incorrect labels, which can mislead feature learning and harm domain adaptation performance. Additionally, clustering person images according to human identity is challenging in the absence of ID information in the target domain.To address these challenges, we propose a Group-aware Label Transfer (GLT) algorithm that combines online label refinement with a group-aware strategy. Our method simultaneously trains the data using pseudo-labels and refines the pseudo-labels using the label transfer algorithm. We treat the label refinement problem as optimal transport, which can be solved using the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm. We introduce a group-aware strategy to assign implicit attribute group IDs to samples, which reduces the search space and enables flexible embedding of identities into an embedding feature. Experimental results on Market-to-Duke, Duke-to-Market, Market-to-MSMT, and Duke-to-MSMT datasets demonstrate that our GLT framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised person re-identification tasks, closing the gap between unsupervised and supervised performance. Our contributions include integrating clustering and feature learning in a unified framework, proposing a group-aware feature learning strategy, and achieving significant performance improvements compared to existing approaches.
