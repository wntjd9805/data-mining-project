This paper introduces a novel approach to tackle the blind single image super-resolution (SISR) problem, which involves estimating a high-resolution image from its low-resolution counterpart with unknown blur kernels. Previous techniques decompose the problem into sequential subproblems, but this approach is suboptimal and computationally expensive. To address this, the authors propose an adaptive modulation network (AMNet) equipped with a modified adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) module to control the image SR process. They also introduce a reinforcement learning (RL) framework to optimize the blur kernel estimation task using non-differentiable evaluation metrics. The proposed method achieves comparable results on commonly used datasets and offers lower computational cost and faster training and testing speed compared to previous methods.
