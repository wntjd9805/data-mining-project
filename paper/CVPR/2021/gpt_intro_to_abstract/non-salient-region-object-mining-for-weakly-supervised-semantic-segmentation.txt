Semantic segmentation, the task of classifying every pixel of an input image, is crucial in various computer vision applications. With advancements in deep learning, significant progress has been made in semantic segmentation. However, training deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for semantic segmentation requires large-scale datasets and precise pixel-wise annotations, which are labor-intensive. One approach to address this annotation problem is to learn from weak labels, such as image-level annotations, bounding boxes, points, and scribbles. Image-level labels are the most easily annotated weak supervision format and have been extensively studied. Still, semantic segmentation with image-level labels remains challenging. This paper focuses on leveraging image-level labels for weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS). Visualization-based approaches have been widely used to bridge the annotation gap between classification and segmentation. These methods train a classification network with image-level labels and then utilize class activation maps (CAMs) to generate pseudo labels for training the segmentation network. However, existing activation maps are sparse and incomplete, mainly locating the most discriminative parts of objects. Few approaches address object mining in non-salient areas. This paper proposes a non-salient region object mining method for weakly supervised semantic segmentation to overcome these limitations. The proposed method incorporates a graph-based global reasoning unit to strengthen the classification network's ability to activate object features outside the salient region. Additionally, a potential object mining module is introduced to reduce the false-negative rate and improve the quality of pseudo labels. Furthermore, a non-salient region masking module is proposed for complex images, leading to a more robust segmentation model that discovers objects outside the salient region. The contributions of this work include leveraging a global reasoning unit, a potential object mining module, and a non-salient region masking module for improved weakly supervised semantic segmentation.
