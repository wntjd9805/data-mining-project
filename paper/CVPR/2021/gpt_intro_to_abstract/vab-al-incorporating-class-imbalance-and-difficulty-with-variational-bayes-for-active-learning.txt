Active learning has gained much attention due to its focus on efficient labeling of data, especially in domains like biomedical imaging and industrial imaging where data acquisition can be costly. While there have been studies on semi-supervised and unsupervised learning to improve training efficiency, the performance of these methods is significantly worse than supervised learning with additional labeled data. Existing methods assume that all classes are equal and do not consider class difficulty or prevalence in the dataset. This can lead to bias in the labeled data pool and the trained classifier, damaging the capabilities of active learning methods. In this work, a novel formulation for active learning based on Bayes' rule is proposed, considering the difficulty of classes, classifier performance, and class abundance. A Variational Auto Encoder (VAE) is used to model the lower bound of the likelihood of a sample, conditioned on the predicted label. The VAE is trained with deep feature representations of the classifier, tying it with the classifier and utilizing unlabelled data. Experimental results demonstrate the significant performance improvement of the proposed method compared to the state of the art. The contributions of this work include the derivation of a novel formulation for active learning, a VAE-based framework to realize the formulation, the importance of considering class differences, and outperforming existing methods in various experiments.
