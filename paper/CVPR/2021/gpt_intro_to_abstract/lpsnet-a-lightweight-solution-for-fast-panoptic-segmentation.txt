In this computer science paper, the authors present a novel approach called Lightweight Panoptic Segmentation Network (LPSNet) for the task of Panoptic Segmentation (PS), which aims to assign semantic categories to pixels and segment objects in an image. The authors argue that existing methods for PS, which merge instance segmentation and semantic segmentation predictions, are inefficient and resource-consuming. They propose LPSNet, which decomposes PS into object detection and semantic segmentation sub-tasks. By utilizing fully convolutional networks and a one-stage anchor-free detector, LPSNet achieves faster inference and lower memory consumption compared to existing two-stage methods. The authors conduct comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets to demonstrate the competitive performance and efficiency of LPSNet. They highlight the contributions of their approach, including its efficient computation, memory, and hyper-parameter usage, its simplicity in training, its generality across different scenarios, and its ability to handle overlapping or deformable objects accurately.
