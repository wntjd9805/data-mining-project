Monitoring treatment response in radiological workflows is crucial for identifying and measuring lesions. Manual procedures for this task are labor-intensive and subject to inter-observer variability. Computer aided tools have the potential to improve efficiency and reliability in this process. This paper focuses on automatic image-based lesion monitoring, which involves detecting lesions, tracking instances across different time points, and measuring changes. While progress has been made in object detection and segmentation, lesion tracking remains underdeveloped due to the lack of benchmark datasets. The paper introduces a public benchmark and proposes a powerful lesion tracking solution called DLT, which accurately matches instances of the same lesion using appearance and anatomical signals. The challenges in lesion tracking include changes in size and appearance, which are addressed through a combination of image registration and appearance-based recognition under anatomical constraints. The paper presents a dataset of 3891 lesion pairs for training and evaluating the tracker, along with a self-supervised learning strategy to train trackers using non-longitudinal datasets. The proposed DLT achieves high matching accuracy on test sets and demonstrates robustness to inaccurate tracking initializations. It is further applied to real-life clinical longitudinal studies, showing excellent generalizability and accuracy in lesion monitoring. Overall, the paper offers a comprehensive approach to automated lesion monitoring in radiological workflows.
