Optical flow estimation is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications in various downstream tasks such as visual odometry, depth estimation, and object tracking. Classical methods formulate optical flow estimation as an optimization problem, while recent supervised learning approaches train deep neural networks using ground-truth annotated image pairs. However, the limited availability of ground truth flow for real images hampers the generalization of these supervised methods. To address this limitation, unsupervised learning has emerged as a promising approach, allowing the training of optical flow models from unlabeled videos. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Self-Teaching Multi-frame Unsupervised RAFT with Full-Image Warping (SMURF) that combines ideas from classical methods and supervised learning. We integrate the RAFT supervised model with unsupervised learning and make key changes to loss functions and data augmentation techniques. Additionally, we introduce full-image warping to improve flow quality near image boundaries and leverage a classical method for multi-frame flow labels to generate better refinement supervision. Experimental results on major benchmarks demonstrate that SMURF outperforms the prior state-of-the-art unsupervised optical flow method and closes the gap with supervised approaches. Specifically, SMURF reduces errors by 40/36/39% compared to the previous state-of-the-art on the Sintel Clean/Sintel Final/KITTI 2015 benchmarks, respectively, and outperforms supervised methods on all benchmarks.
