Video super-resolution (VSR) is a challenging task that involves aggregating information from multiple misaligned frames in video sequences, in contrast to single-image super-resolution. While various approaches have been proposed to tackle VSR, many of these designs are complex and hinder reproducibility and fair comparisons. In this paper, we aim to find a more generic, efficient, and easy-to-implement baseline for VSR by decomposing existing approaches into submodules based on functionalities. Through extensive experiments, we introduce BasicVSR, which achieves strong performance and efficiency by streamlining the propagation and alignment components with commonly-adopted designs for aggregation and upsampling. We further present IconVSR, an extension of BasicVSR that improves the aggregation and propagation components through the use of an information-refill mechanism and a coupled propagation scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that BasicVSR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance and efficiency, and IconVSR achieves even better performance. This work provides a timely contribution in the search for a strong, simple, and extensible baseline for VSR and highlights opportunities for further extending these baseline models.
