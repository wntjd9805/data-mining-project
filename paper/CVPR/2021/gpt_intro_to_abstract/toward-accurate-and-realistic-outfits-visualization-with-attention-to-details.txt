This paper discusses the challenges faced by fashion consumers when shopping online and the limitations of current methods in capturing the details of garments and their interactions. The authors propose a novel method that improves the synthesis of garment details, including textures, necklines, and shading. They also address the challenge of warping multiple garments with complicated shapes and accurately transferring textures between them. The proposed method outperforms previous approaches in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. The authors also introduce a garment-pose matching procedure and demonstrate the effectiveness of their method through user studies and comparisons with real commercial photos. The contributions of this work include the introduction of OVNet, a multi-garment try-on framework, the development of a warping-based method for all garment types, and the evaluation on a diverse dataset.
