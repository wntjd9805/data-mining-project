Benefiting from the progress in deep learning, face manipulation technology using Variational AutoEncoders and Generative Adversarial Networks has allowed ordinary people to generate high-quality forged faces. However, this technology can be misused for malicious purposes, leading to trust issues in society. Various methods have been proposed to detect face forgery, but they have limitations in reliability. Current detection methods utilize neural networks to extract discriminative features, but they are not effective in encouraging intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Additionally, existing methods that incorporate frequency information have limitations in feature extraction. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Frequency-aware Discriminative Feature Learning framework (FDFL). This framework consists of two sub-modules: single-center loss (SCL) and adaptive frequency feature generation module (AFFGM). SCL aims to reduce intra-class variations of natural faces and increase inter-class differences, without restricting the intra-class compactness of manipulated faces. AFFGM preprocesses data to maintain spatial and frequency domain relationships and adaptively mines frequency clues in a data-driven manner. Our experiments show that the FDFL framework achieves state-of-the-art results in face forgery detection.
