This paper introduces a novel and efficient attention mechanism, called coordinate attention, for mobile networks. Current attention mechanisms are not widely used in mobile networks due to their computational overhead. The most popular attention mechanism for mobile networks is the Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) attention, which only considers encoding inter-channel information and neglects positional information. This paper proposes a method that embeds positional information into channel attention to enable mobile networks to attend over large regions without significant computation overhead. The proposed method factorizes channel attention into two parallel 1D feature encoding processes to integrate spatial coordinate information. Two feature maps with direction-specific information are separately encoded into attention maps, which capture long-range dependencies along one spatial direction. The positional information is preserved in the generated attention maps, which are then applied to the input feature map to emphasize the representations of interest. The proposed coordinate attention captures cross-channel, direction-aware, and position-sensitive information and can be easily integrated into classic building blocks of mobile networks. Experimental results demonstrate performance gains in ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks compared to models with other attention mechanisms. The proposed method offers a simple and efficient design for attention mechanisms in mobile networks, with potential for future development.
