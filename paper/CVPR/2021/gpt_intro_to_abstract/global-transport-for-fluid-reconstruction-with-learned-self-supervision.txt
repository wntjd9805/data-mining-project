In this paper, we address the challenge of reconstructing fluid motion from sparse observations. Fluid motion reconstruction is important for various applications, but the complex nature of turbulent fluids and the need for sparse markers pose significant challenges. Existing approaches use a physical model and volumetric observations over time to reconstruct the motion. However, these methods often find undesirable minimizers due to the non-linearity of the reconstruction problem and ambiguous observations.To overcome these challenges, we propose a different approach. We enforce the physical model over the complete trajectory of the observed fluid, resulting in a single initial state of the density. This state is then evolved over time using the physical model and the temporal reconstruction of the motion field. By strictly adhering to the physical model, we achieve a better reconstruction of the motion.In order to constrain the degrees of freedom in a single-viewpoint scenario, we introduce a method inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs). We use a small dataset of example motions and train a convolutional neural network as a discriminator alongside the motion reconstruction. This discriminator provides image space constraints, which are coupled over time through our global transport formulation.Furthermore, we combine visual and transport constraints with a fully differentiable volumetric rendering pipeline. This allows us to capture complex lighting effects, such as absorption and self-shadowing, that are crucial for realistic marker observations.The main contributions of our work are: a global multi-scale transport optimization using a differentiable physical model for purely transport-based reconstructions, a learned visual prior for motions from sparse and single input views, and the inclusion of differentiable rendering with explicit lighting and volumetric self-shadowing. These contributions enable the construction of fluid motion from sparse views in an end-to-end optimization, even from a single viewpoint.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such a reconstruction approach has been proposed. Our method offers a comprehensive solution for reconstructing fluid motion and is demonstrated through visualizations of the reconstructed motion.
