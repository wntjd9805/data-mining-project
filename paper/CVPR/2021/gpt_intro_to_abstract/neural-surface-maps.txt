Maps play a vital role in geometry processing tasks operating on surfaces, as they define correspondences between different parts of surfaces and enable various downstream tasks such as texturing, surface correspondence, and deformations. However, computing surface maps becomes challenging when dealing with 3D meshes due to their combinatorial nature. Although solutions such as discrete differential geometry and functional maps have been proposed, they lack easy end-to-end optimization and generalization capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages neural networks as a parametric representation of surfaces and inter-surface maps. We introduce the concept of neural surface maps, where neural networks approximate surface maps from 2D points to 3D, enabling differentiable algebra for surface maps. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in various geometry processing applications, including parameterization, surface-to-surface distortion-minimizing mapping, and mapping across shape collections. Our modular representation allows us to harness the power of current deep learning frameworks for classical shape analysis tasks. The availability of code on our project page further promotes reproducibility and accessibility.
