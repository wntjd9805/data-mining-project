Computer vision research has produced various methods for processing information from 2D and 3D cameras. While these algorithms excel at processing single frames or sequences of images, the problem of combining multi-view cues without a specific order remains open. Synchronization has been proposed as a solution to this problem, involving distributing the discrepancies among multiple viewpoints to ensure consistent estimates. This procedure is an essential component of state-of-the-art multi-view reconstruction and analysis pipelines. In this paper, we focus on permutation synchronization, where the correspondences between images or shapes are represented by permutation matrices. However, finding an absolute ordering for each point in each frame is a combinatorial non-convex optimization problem that is intractable for classical computers. We propose a formulation of this problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) that is compatible with quantum computers. By turning permutation constraints into linear ones and embedding the problem to a real quantum computer, we demonstrate the likelihood of achieving the global optimum solution. Our contributions include formulating synchronization for adiabatic quantum computers, introducing permutations as linear constraints in QUBO, and providing experimental validation on both simulated and real quantum hardware. Our approach shows promising results for synchronization with multiple views and points and provides valuable insights into quantum computing for computer vision tasks. While practical quantum computing is still a distant reality, our work serves as a proof of concept for synchronization on quantum hardware and opens up possibilities for quantum matching of multiple point sets.
