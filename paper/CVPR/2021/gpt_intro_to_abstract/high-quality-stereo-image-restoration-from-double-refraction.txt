Double refraction, a phenomenon caused by birefringence in certain materials, splits an incident ray into two rays: ordinary (o-ray) and extraordinary (e-ray). These rays create a double-refraction image with displacement, which contains depth information. Monocular birefractive stereo methods have been developed to estimate sparse depth from double refraction, enabling 3D imaging. Existing methods for obtaining stereo images from double refraction involve densifying the depth map or subtracting the o-ray image. However, these approaches suffer from artifacts and low signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to restore stereo images directly from double refraction. To address the ill-posedness of the problem, we generate a birefractive stereo dataset and formulate a joint stereo restoration problem. Our model is trained with supervised signals and can restore high-quality stereo images without requiring depth information. The restored stereo images agree with epipolar geometry, allowing for accurate depth estimation. Our model is computationally efficient, enabling real-time stereo video restoration. Experimental and synthetic evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing approaches. We showcase various image-editing applications using the high-quality stereo images and dense depth maps produced by our model. The codes and models are made publicly available for reproducibility.
