This paper introduces a novel framework for semantic segmentation in the Open Compound Domain Adaptation (OCDA) setting. The goal is to transfer knowledge across different but related domains using unlabeled images from the target domain. The proposed framework, called Meta-based Open Compound Domain Adaptation (MOCDA), leverages meta-learning to dynamically fuse knowledge and perform online updates during the inference stage. MOCDA treats the target domain as a compound of multiple unknown sub-domains, making it suitable for challenging real-world scenarios with diverse factors. The framework consists of four modules: cluster, split, fuse, and update. Experimental results demonstrate that MOCDA outperforms existing methods in synthetic-to-real knowledge transfer benchmarks for both compound and open domains. The contributions of this paper include addressing the limitations of previous work, modeling the compound target domain continuously, and showing the adequacy of unsupervised image style features for the MOCDA framework.
