Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) aims to adapt a model from a labeled source domain to a target domain using only unlabeled data. However, UDA still lags behind supervised learning in terms of accuracy. Active Domain Adaptation (ADA) addresses this issue by annotating a small portion of target data to benefit the model. Pool-based active learning is a common approach for query selection, but traditional criteria fail to select informative target samples under domain shift. In this paper, we propose Transferable Query Selection (TQS) as a transferable criterion for ADA. TQS incorporates transferable committee, transferable uncertainty, and transferable domainness to overcome the challenge of domain shift. We also introduce a randomized selection mechanism to increase sample diversity. Experimental results demonstrate that TQS outperforms unsupervised domain adaptation, active learning, and other active domain adaptation methods in terms of target domain accuracy.
