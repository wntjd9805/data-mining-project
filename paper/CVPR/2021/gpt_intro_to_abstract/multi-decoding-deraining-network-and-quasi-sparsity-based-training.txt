Rain streaks removal from images is a challenging task that has not been fully solved. Conventional methods often use over-complete dictionaries to remove rain streaks, but they struggle with complex patterns such as overlapping and interweaving streaks. Recent deep learning techniques have shown promising results in removing rain streaks, but they struggle with wide or blurry streaks. This paper proposes a novel approach that introduces intrinsic priors to construct loss functions for rain streak removal. The approach incorporates the sparsity of rainy images to achieve sparse image decomposition, ensuring that rain streaks and other image contents are not split during the deraining process. To make the loss functions tractable, a quasi-sparsity prior is developed as an approximation of the sincere sparsity. This quasi-sparsity maintains the sparsity property while simplifying the formula. Additionally, auxiliary decoders are introduced to decode deep features from different spaces, enabling the comparison of different types of deep features and improving the encoding process. Information sharing among the multi-type features is implemented to stabilize feature values and reduce undesired artifacts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.
