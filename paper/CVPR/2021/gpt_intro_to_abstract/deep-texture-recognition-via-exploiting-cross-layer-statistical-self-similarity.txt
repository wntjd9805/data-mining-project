Texture recognition is a challenging problem in computer vision with applications in material classification, terrain recognition, and microscopic image analysis. Deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has been successful in addressing the variability and distortion of textures. However, typical CNNs with fully-connected layers are not ideal for texture recognition due to their sensitivity to spatial transformations. To overcome this limitation, a feature aggregation module is needed to generate a distinct description of textures that is robust to spatial transforms. In this paper, a novel aggregation module called CLASS (Cross-Layer Aggregation of Statistical Self-similarity) is proposed for CNN-based texture recognition. CLASS utilizes cross-layer statistics and exploits statistical self-similarity (SSS) to improve feature aggregation. The module leverages the wavelet representation of CNNs and models the cross-layer SSS of feature maps. The differential box-counting dimension is used to characterize SSS, and the histogram of these dimensions serves as the descriptor. The proposed CLASSNet, which incorporates the CLASS module into a ResNet backbone, achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. The contributions of this work include the exploitation of cross-layer statistics, the incorporation of SSS into deep representations, the development of an efficient SSS-based pooling method, and the achievement of SOTA performance in texture recognition.
