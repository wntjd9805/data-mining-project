Spatio-temporal action localization, the task of localizing persons and recognizing their actions in videos, has gained significant attention in recent years. Unlike object detection, activity recognition requires reasoning about actors' interactions with their surrounding context. Previous approaches focused on modeling pairwise relations between entities, but higher-order relations provide crucial clues for accurate action detection. To address this, we propose the Actor-Context-Actor Relation Network (ACAR-Net), which models second-order relations between multiple actors and the context. ACAR-Net uses actor and context features as inputs, eliminating the need for a pre-trained object detector. It encodes first-order actor-context relations and applies a High-Order Relation Reasoning Operator to model interactions between them. We also introduce an Actor-Context Feature Bank to support relation reasoning between actors and context at different time periods. Experimental results on the AVA and UCF101-24 datasets demonstrate significant improvements in recognizing human-object and human-human interactions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and ranks first on the ActivityNet leaderboard.
