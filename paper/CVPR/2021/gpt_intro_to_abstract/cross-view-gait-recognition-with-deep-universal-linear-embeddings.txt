Gait recognition is a biometric identification technique that aims to identify individuals based on their body shape and walking patterns. Compared to other biometrics such as fingerprints or iris scans, gait recognition requires less cooperation from the individual and can be performed at a longer distance. This makes it suitable for applications such as criminal investigation. However, gait recognition systems are still affected by external factors such as carrying conditions, varying pace, clothing, and camera viewpoints, with the latter being the most challenging factor. Previous research has shown that the performance of a gait recognition system drops significantly when the viewpoint is changed. To address these challenges, deep learning models have been proposed for cross-view gait recognition, achieving impressive results. These models can be categorized into appearance-based approaches and model-based approaches. Appearance-based approaches extract features from gait silhouette images, while model-based approaches focus on reconstructing body structures from gait sequences. However, both approaches have limitations. Appearance-based methods suffer from insufficient data, while model-based methods are more robust to view differences but difficult to construct accurately. Inspired by the analysis of gait using inertial sensors, biomechanical gait analysis, and dynamical analysis, this paper proposes a new perspective for cross-view gait recognition based on dynamical features. Specifically, the paper introduces the Koopman theory, a tool for analyzing nonlinear systems, to represent the motion process of gait. The proposed framework combines a convolutional variational autoencoder and deep Koopman embedding to extract dynamic features from gait silhouettes. Experimental results on a large gait database demonstrate the effectiveness of the method in understanding the connections between gait recognition and human walking dynamics. In summary, this paper makes three major contributions: the application of Koopman analysis for dynamic feature extraction in gait recognition, the proposal of a novel framework for cross-view gait recognition combining convolutional variational autoencoder and deep Koopman embedding, and the experimental validation of the method's effectiveness on a widely used gait database.
