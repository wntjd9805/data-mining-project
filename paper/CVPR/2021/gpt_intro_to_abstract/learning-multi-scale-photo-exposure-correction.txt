This paper introduces a deep learning method for correcting exposure errors in digital photographs. Exposure is controlled by three main factors: shutter speed, f-number, and ISO value. Exposure errors can occur due to various factors, such as TTL metering errors and lighting conditions. Correcting exposure errors is challenging due to the nonlinear operations applied during image processing. Most prior work focuses on correcting underexposure errors, while this paper addresses both over- and underexposure errors. The proposed method formulates exposure correction as color and detail enhancement sub-problems and utilizes a coarse-to-fine deep neural network model. The paper also introduces a new dataset with over 24,000 images for evaluation. Extensive evaluations and comparisons demonstrate that the proposed method achieves results comparable to previous methods for underexposed images and provides significant improvements for overexposed images. The model's generalization ability is also demonstrated by its performance on images outside the dataset.
