The Embodied-AI (E-AI) field, which focuses on agents performing egocentric perception tasks, has seen increased interest in recent years. Numerous datasets and simulators have been developed to support tasks such as Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) and Embodied Question Answering. However, a new task called Remote Embodied Visual referring Expression in Real Indoor Environments (REVERIE) presents unique challenges that require further investigation. REVERIE aims to have a robot navigate and locate a target object based on high-level instructions in a photo-realistic 3D indoor environment. Traditional approaches used in VLN tasks are insufficient for this task. The challenges of REVERIE include the absence of step-by-step navigation guidance, the need for goal-oriented exploration, the requirement for cross-modal comprehension, the integration of commonsense knowledge, and the consideration of efficiency during exploration. To address these challenges, this paper proposes several innovations. Firstly, a Cross-modality Knowledge Reasoning (CKR) model is introduced to perform the REVERIE task. The model incorporates visual and linguistic clues within a scene memory token and utilizes a learnable multi-layer attention mechanism to extract informative clues for decision-making. Secondly, a Room-and-Object Aware Attention (ROAA) mechanism is developed to enhance the recognition of rooms and objects from both instruction and visual input, bridging the semantic gap between modalities. Thirdly, external commonsense knowledge from ConceptNet is integrated into the task through a Knowledge-enabled Entity Relationship Reasoning (KERR) module, which considers the relationships between rooms and objects. The KERR module leverages internal and external knowledge graph reasoning to dynamically learn and extract commonsense knowledge. Lastly, a Direction-Aware Loss (DAL) and distance-aware policy are introduced to penalize actions with more angle deviation and encourage efficient navigation, respectively.Experiments conducted on the REVERIE benchmark show that the proposed CKR model significantly improves performance metrics such as success rate and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL). Ablation studies and qualitative results confirm the effectiveness of each component. This research contributes to the advancement of embodied agents in understanding and navigating real indoor environments based on high-level instructions.
