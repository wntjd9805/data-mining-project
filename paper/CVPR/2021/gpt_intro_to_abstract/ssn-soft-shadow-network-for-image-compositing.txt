Image compositing is an important technique in image creation, and shadow synthesis is a challenging task in this field. Manual shadow creation for 2D object cutouts is time-consuming and requires expertise due to the complex interaction between object geometry and light sources. Our work introduces the Soft Shadow Network (SSN), a deep neural network framework that generates soft shadows for 2D object cutouts using 3D shape and pose priors. SSN is agnostic to image types and provides full user control through an input image-based environmental light map. The network consists of an Ambient Occlusion Prediction (AOP) module and a Shadow Rendering (SR) module. We generate training data using 3D object models and complex light patterns with an efficient on-the-fly data pipeline. Additionally, we propose an inverse shadow map representation to handle the high dynamic range of shadow maps. A user study confirms that the soft shadows generated by SSN are visually indistinguishable from physics-based renderings. Furthermore, our approach allows for real-time shadow manipulation with fast system response. This interactive soft shadow generation framework contributes to generic image compositing and provides a method for generating diverse training data and improving training on HDR shadow maps.
