Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced the performance of 2D human pose estimation. It has been demonstrated that using the detected 2D joint positions, accurate regression of the 3D human pose can be achieved. Various approaches have employed Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), a generalized form of CNN, to perform the 2D-to-3D human pose estimation task. The graph convolution in GCN has shown excellent feature extraction capabilities for graph-structured data, leading to state-of-the-art results in this task.However, existing GCN-based approaches have limitations. Firstly, they process all node information at only "one scale," which hinders the extraction of features representing spatial local and global information. Secondly, these approaches often adopt a simple architecture that sequentially connects graph convolution layers, limiting the benefits of model depth.To address these issues, we propose a novel architecture for 2D-to-3D human pose estimation called Graph Stacked Hourglass Networks. Instead of focusing on specific graph convolution operations, our architecture aims to integrate them effectively to achieve the best performance improvement. Inspired by the advantages of 2D human pose estimation approaches, we employ a repeated encoder-decoder applicable to graph-structured data for multi-scale feature extraction. Additionally, we leverage intermediate features at each depth of the model for multi-level feature extraction. By incorporating multi-scale and multi-level feature information, our model becomes more expressive and capable of achieving high-precision 3D human pose estimation.Our work makes two main contributions. Firstly, we introduce Graph Hourglass modules designed to extract multi-scale human skeletal features. These modules include novel pooling and unpooling operations, known as Skeletal Pool and Skeletal Unpool, respectively, which consider the underlying human skeletal structure. Secondly, we propose Graph Stacked Hourglass Networks (GraphSH), which incorporates the Graph Hourglass module and exploits multi-level feature representations at various depths of the architecture. By incorporating multi-scale, multi-level features, and prior knowledge of the human skeleton, our architecture demonstrates impressive performance improvement in 2D-to-3D human pose estimation tasks.
