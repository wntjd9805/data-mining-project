Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) is an extension of unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) in computer science. SSDA has the potential to significantly improve performance compared to UDA by leveraging a small number of labeled samples in the target domain. To achieve domain adaptation, it is necessary to reduce both the inter-domain gap (differences in feature distributions between domains) and the intra-domain gap (differences among class-wise sub-distributions within a domain). Existing approaches in domain adaptation primarily focus on inter-domain adaptation, using techniques such as sample-wise or distribution-wise feature alignment. However, these approaches often ignore the extra information provided by class-wise sub-distributions in the target domain, leading to cross-domain feature mismatch during model training and reduced generalization performance on novel test data. In recent years, there has been a shift towards intra-domain adaptation, optimizing class-wise sub-distributions within the target domain to improve adaptation model performance. In the context of SSDA, a model trained with supervision on a few labeled target samples and labeled source data can only ensure partial cross-domain feature alignment and may result in biased feature representation towards the source domain. This can lead to disconnection between labeled and unlabeled target samples as well as misalignment between unlabeled target samples and the source domain. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called Cross-domain Adaptive Clustering (CDAC) that performs cluster-wise feature alignment across the source and target domains. CDAC utilizes minimax optimization to guide the features of unlabeled target samples by labeled target samples, forming clusters corresponding to the classes of labeled samples. Additionally, we employ pseudo labeling to expand the number of "labeled" samples in the target domain, producing more robust and powerful cluster cores. Our approach achieves both inter-domain adaptation and intra-domain adaptation simultaneously. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that CDAC achieves state-of-the-art performance in semi-supervised domain adaptation. Overall, our contributions include introducing an adversarial adaptive clustering loss for cross-domain cluster-wise feature alignment, integrating an adapted version of pseudo labeling to enhance the robustness of cluster cores, and demonstrating the effectiveness of the CDAC approach through extensive experiments.
