This paper introduces a new solution pipeline called ClassSR for accelerating image super-resolution (SR) algorithms on "large" input images. With the increasing demand for high-resolution images and videos, the memory and computational cost of SR algorithms built on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) grow exponentially with the input size. To address this issue, the paper proposes decomposing the input into sub-images and using different network complexities for different image regions. The authors observe that simpler regions (e.g., flat areas) can be processed with smaller networks, significantly reducing the computational cost. Sub-image decomposition is particularly beneficial for large images, as more regions are relatively simple to restore. Additionally, it helps save memory space and enables parallel processing on low-memory chips. To implement this approach, the ClassSR pipeline consists of two modules: the Class-Module and the SR-Module. The Class-Module classifies the input sub-images into specific classes based on restoration difficulty, while the SR-Module processes the sub-images using the SR network of the corresponding class. Both modules are connected and trained jointly. The paper introduces two new losses, the Class-Loss and the Average-Loss, to constrain the classification results and ensure meaningful and well-distributed classifications. The Image-Loss (L1 loss) is also added to guarantee reconstruction performance. The proposed training strategy includes pre-training the SR-Module with Image-Loss, optimizing the Class-Module with all three losses while fixing the SR-Module, and finally optimizing both modules simultaneously until convergence. The efficacy of the ClassSR pipeline is demonstrated on various SR networks, including FSRCNN, CARN, SRResNet, and RCAN. Experimental results show that ClassSR can achieve significant computational cost savings for these networks. The paper concludes with three main contributions: the introduction of ClassSR as the first SR pipeline that combines classification and super-resolution on the sub-image level, the orthogonal nature of ClassSR to other acceleration networks, and the proposal of a classification method with two novel losses that can be directly applied to other low-level vision tasks. The code for ClassSR will be made available on GitHub.
