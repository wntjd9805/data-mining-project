This paper introduces the concept of approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search in information retrieval, specifically focusing on hashing as a solution. Hashing maps high-dimensional data to compact binary codes while preserving semantic similarities, leading to advantages in storage cost and retrieval speed. Deep hashing, which employs deep neural networks (DNNs) to automatically extract features, has been successful in learning to hash. However, recent studies have shown that DNNs are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which can fool the networks into making incorrect predictions. This poses a serious security threat to deep hashing-based image retrieval systems. While many works have studied adversarial examples in image classification, very few have focused on the security of deep hashing-based retrieval. Existing adversarial attack methods for deep hashing have limitations in terms of efficiency and accuracy. This paper proposes a prototype-supervised adversarial network (ProS-GAN) for targeted attack in deep hashing-based retrieval. ProS-GAN generates targeted adversarial examples using an original image and a target label, misleading the attacked hashing network to retrieve semantically related images. The network consists of a prototype network, an adversarial generator network, and a discriminator network. Experiments show that ProS-GAN outperforms existing targeted attack methods in terms of efficiency and transferability. This work presents a novel approach to targeted attack in deep hashing and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method.
