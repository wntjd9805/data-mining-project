Introducing PointNetLK: A Robust and Fidelity-Enhanced Approach for 3D Point AlignmentIn many industrial robotic and vision applications, aligning two point clouds without prior knowledge of sensor noise, point density, or scene complexity can be challenging. While modern learning-based 3D point alignment methods have shown impressive performance, they often struggle in such unknown conditions. As a result, classical non-learning methods like Iterative Closest Point (ICP) are often preferred due to their ability to generalize well to unfamiliar situations, albeit with inferior performance compared to learning-based approaches.However, relying solely on non-learning methods introduces the drawback of hand-crafted guesswork and less desirable performance. To address this limitation, we propose a revisiting of the recent PointNetLK algorithm. In this paper, we present a novel derivation that overcomes the current limitations of PointNetLK in terms of robustness and fidelity.Our approach leverages an analytical Jacobian matrix that can be decomposed into feature and warp components. A key advantage of this decomposition is the ability to modify the warp Jacobian analytically without the need for retraining the PointNet features. This property allows us to effectively align complex real-world scenes, such as those found in the 3DMatch dataset, by training solely on clean, dense synthetic objects from the Model-Net dataset.Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art hybrid methods, including correspondence-based methods, and the original PointNetLK, under matched train-test conditions. Even when compared to the Deep Global Registration (DGR) method, which is trained under matched conditions, our approach achieves competitive results on real-world scenes. These results are in contrast to previous experiments by Aoki et al., whose evaluations were limited to synthetic objects.The motivation behind revisiting PointNetLK lies in the popularity of hybrid methods that combine learning and classical algorithms for point alignment. While most hybrid methods focus on predicting point correspondences followed by a deterministic alignment step, PointNetLK stands out by aligning directly with a learned feature representation. Our analytical re-visiting of the PointNetLK framework sheds light on its remarkable generalization properties for real-world problems.By proposing a robust and fidelity-enhanced approach to 3D point alignment, we aim to improve the performance of learning-based methods in unknown conditions. We provide experimental evidence of the effectiveness of our approach and make our code available for further exploration.
