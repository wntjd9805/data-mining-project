Image denoising is a crucial task in image processing and computer vision. The main challenge is to recover a clean image from a noisy observation. This problem is difficult because both the image and noise terms are unknown and difficult to separate. To address this challenge, many denoising methods utilize prior information about the image and noise models to estimate either the image or the noise. Traditional methods, like NLM and BM3D, rely on local similarity and wavelet denoising. Recent deep neural network-based methods implicitly capture image priors and noise distributions from large training datasets. However, recovering high-quality images in challenging scenes with weak textures or high-frequency details remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel approach that utilizes non-local image information through image projection. By generating image basis vectors and reconstructing the image within the subspace spanned by these basis vectors, our method effectively separates noise and signal. We adapt a UNet architecture with a subspace attention module to learn the subspace basis and image projection. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) with a smaller computational cost. Overall, this paper contributes a new perspective on image denoising and proposes a simple and efficient approach that harnesses subspace projection for improved performance.
