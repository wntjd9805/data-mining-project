Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) is a challenging problem in computer vision with applications in safety monitoring, autonomous driving, and video analytics. Current MOT methods mainly follow the tracking-by-detection paradigm, where objects are detected in each frame and then associated based on their similarity. However, the spatial proximity heuristic used for association breaks down in complex scenarios with occlusions or crowded scenes. To address this issue, some methods incorporate motion estimation or displacement regression to improve distance estimation. However, these methods often overlook the importance of object appearance similarity for object association and re-identification. This paper introduces quasi-dense similarity learning, which densely matches hundreds of regions of interest on a pair of images for contrastive learning. By utilizing more positive examples and hard negatives, this approach provides stronger supervision for instance similarity learning. Furthermore, the paper proposes an inference process that considers false positives, identity switches, new objects, and terminated tracks. Quasi-dense similarity learning can be easily integrated with existing detectors, and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in multiple tracking benchmarks, outperforming other methods without additional training data. This approach simplifies the training and testing procedures of multi-object tracking frameworks, with the potential to benefit further research in this field.
