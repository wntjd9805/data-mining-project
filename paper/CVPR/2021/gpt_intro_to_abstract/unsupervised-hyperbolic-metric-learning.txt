Learning a precise distance metric is essential in various computer vision tasks, such as face recognition, image classification, and person re-identification. Traditional methods for metric learning have been proposed, but with the rise of deep neural networks, Deep Metric Learning (DML) has become a powerful tool. DML aims to find a reliable embedding space using nonlinear deep neural networks, where a well-designed metric loss function brings positive samples closer to anchors and pushes negative samples away.Most existing DML methods use large-scale data for training and can be categorized into structure-learning methods and hard mining methods. Structure-learning methods focus on constructing a proper loss function, such as contrastive loss, triplet loss, and lifted structure loss, to mine similarity relationships among training data. Hard mining approaches aim to enhance the discriminative ability of the learned embedding by sampling meaningful hard examples.However, supervised DML methods are often not applicable in real-world tasks where labeled data is unavailable. To address this issue, unsupervised deep learning algorithms have been introduced. These algorithms learn the inherent structure of training data without explicit labels and typically rely on an auxiliary algorithm like clustering to mine potential sample relationships. Unsupervised DML methods face challenges in discovering more semantic information as supervision and often overlook the latent metric information of unlabeled data.In this paper, the authors propose a novel unsupervised DML method called Unsupervised Hyperbolic Metric Learning with Hierarchical Similarity. The method effectively excavates the inherent semantic information from unlabeled data by considering the hierarchical relations between images. The authors first embed the data points from the original Euclidean space into the Hyperbolic space, inducing a new Hyperbolic DML framework. Hierarchical clustering is used to generate pseudo hierarchical labels as supervision for the DML task. A novel loss function is designed to enhance the stability of the model using the richer similarity information discovered by hierarchical clustering.The contributions of the proposed method include the first hyperbolic unsupervised deep metric learning framework that captures the hierarchical structure of data, a new metric loss function for hierarchical relations that discovers richer similarity information, and state-of-the-art performances on clustering and retrieval tasks over three benchmark datasets.Overall, the paper addresses the challenges of unsupervised DML and introduces a novel approach that improves the model's performance by capturing the hierarchical structure of data and utilizing richer similarity information.
