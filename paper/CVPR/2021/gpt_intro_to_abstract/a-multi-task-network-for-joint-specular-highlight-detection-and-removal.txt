This paper addresses the problem of highlight detection and removal in computer vision. Specular highlights, which appear as bright spots on shiny surfaces when illuminated, have been a long-standing challenge in the field. Detecting highlights allows for inferring light direction, scene geometry, and camera location, while removing highlights improves the performance of various vision tasks. Early approaches often treated the brightest pixels as highlights, leading to low accuracy. Traditional methods based on optimization, clustering, and filtering struggled with large-scale highlight removal. Recent deep learning-based methods achieved significant progress but had limitations in terms of training on synthetic or limited real data and focusing solely on detection or removal. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a large-scale dataset for highlight detection and removal, comprising 16K real images with corresponding highlight information. A multi-task network with Dilated Spatial Contextual Feature Aggregation (DSCFA) modules is proposed for joint highlight detection and removal. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to previous methods.
