Face recognition systems have been found to exhibit biased behavior towards certain demographic groups, such as gender, race, and age. This raises ethical concerns, especially when these biased systems are deployed in law enforcement. To avoid negative societal impact, it is crucial to develop fair and unbiased face recognition systems. Unlike machine learning's inductive bias, we define face recognition bias as the uneven performance of recognition with respect to demographic groups.State-of-the-art face recognition algorithms rely on convolutional neural networks trained on large-scale face datasets. However, biases in the data are transmitted to the models through network learning. This results in unequal discriminabilities, as the network tends to learn a better representation for faces in the majority group. Even when using a demographic balanced dataset or training separate classifiers for each group, performance on certain groups remains inferior.Traditional methods for mitigating dataset-induced bias involve re-weighting data proportions or cost values, but they are limited when applied to large-scale imbalanced datasets. Recent imbalance learning methods focus on objective functions for class-skewed datasets or enforcing margins between hard clusters. However, adapting these methods to mitigate racial bias requires additional networks and hinders learning efficiency.To mitigate face recognition bias, we propose optimizing face representation learning on every demographic group within a single network, despite imbalanced training data. We categorize face features into general patterns shared by all faces and differential patterns relevant to demographic attributes. By giving the network more capacity to learn from multiple face patterns from different groups, we can mitigate bias. Our proposed method, the group adaptive classifier (GAC), explicitly learns these different feature patterns using adaptive convolution kernels and channel-wise attention maps for each demographic group.In contrast to previous dynamic CNN methods, which introduce adaptive convolutions to all or manually specified layers, we propose an automation module to dynamically select which layers require adaptation. By progressively learning the optimal structure for demographic-adaptive learning, our network achieves unbiased face recognition.The contributions of our work include a new face recognition algorithm that reduces demographic bias by tailoring representations for every demographic group using adaptive convolutions and attention techniques. We also introduce an automation mechanism for determining the layers to employ dynamic kernels and attention maps. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a demographic-balanced dataset and three benchmarks.
