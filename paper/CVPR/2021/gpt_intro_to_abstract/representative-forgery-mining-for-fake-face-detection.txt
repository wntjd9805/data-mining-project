The rapid advancement of face manipulation technology has made it easier to create and spread fake facial images on social media platforms. This has raised concerns about the credibility of digital content, as it has become increasingly difficult for humans to distinguish between real and fake faces. To address this issue, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been widely used to develop detectors for fake face detection. However, vanilla CNN-based detectors often have a limited understanding of forgery compared to humans, focusing on specific regions of the face rather than the entire face. For example, while human observers tend to identify representative forgeries across the entire face, vanilla CNN-based detectors may only focus on certain regions. This discrepancy can result in suboptimal detection performance. To improve detection accuracy, detectors should allocate more attention to forgeries that represent the manipulation technique used, rather than just minimizing the classification loss on the training set. Recent advancements in this area have focused on extracting digital fingerprints of manipulation techniques, dividing the face into multiple patches for independent detection, and leveraging well-designed training datasets. These approaches have shown promise in enhancing detection performance and addressing the challenge of fake face detection.
