Proteins play a vital role in all living organisms and understanding their function is crucial for developing new drug therapies. One challenge in protein science is predicting the functional properties of proteins, which can be achieved through analyzing their complex 3D structures. Protein surfaces exhibit various geometric and chemical features that determine their interactions with other molecules. This analysis is fundamental for understanding protein function and predicting interactions with the environment. The study of protein interactions is particularly important in drug development, as proteins are common drug targets. However, targets with flat surfaces and no noticeable pockets have been difficult to target with traditional small molecules. The emergence of biological drugs, designed proteins, holds promise for addressing these challenging targets. Deep learning methods, such as DeepMind's AlphaFold, have shown success in predicting protein structure from sequence. The study by Gainza et al. introduced MaSIF, a geometric deep learning approach for predicting protein surface binding. However, MaSIF has limitations such as reliance on pre-computed meshes, handcrafted features, and computational requirements. In this paper, we present dMaSIF, a deep learning approach that overcomes these limitations. dMaSIF operates directly on protein atoms, generates a point cloud representation of the protein surface, learns task-specific geometric and chemical features, and applies a new convolutional operator. This approach is memory-efficient, fully differentiable, and significantly faster than MaSIF, allowing for predictions on larger protein collections. The advancements in dMaSIF open the door for end-to-end protein optimization and de novo protein design using geometric deep learning.
