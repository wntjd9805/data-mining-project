Visual localization, the process of determining the position and orientation of an image in a known environment, is essential in various computer vision applications, including self-driving cars, augmented reality, structure-from-motion, and simultaneous localization and mapping. Traditional approaches rely on local features and descriptor matching with a 3D point cloud constructed using structure-from-motion. These methods have primarily focused on accuracy, scalability, and real-time performance, with little consideration for privacy concerns.Recent studies have demonstrated that images can be recovered from 3D point clouds, posing privacy risks in storing user-generated content. To address this, some researchers have proposed replacing each point in the point cloud with a random line passing through it. This line representation preserves privacy and still allows for accurate camera pose estimation. However, this paper reveals that it is possible to recover the original 3D point positions approximately from a line cloud, thereby enabling the extraction of detailed images.This paper makes several contributions. Firstly, it demonstrates that knowledge about local neighborhoods can be used to recover the original 3D points from pairs of lines. Based on this insight, a two-stage approach is proposed, which first recovers the neighborhoods and then estimates the 3D points corresponding to the input lines. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated through experiments on indoor and outdoor datasets, showing the faithful reproduction of the original point clouds. Furthermore, applying a point cloud-to-image translation approach allows for the recovery of image details.The results emphasize the need for further research on privacy-preserving scene representations. While using line clouds alone is not sufficient in obfuscating the underlying 3D scene geometry, sparse line clouds prevent the recovery of image details. Overall, this paper highlights the importance of developing privacy-preserving techniques in visual localization applications.
