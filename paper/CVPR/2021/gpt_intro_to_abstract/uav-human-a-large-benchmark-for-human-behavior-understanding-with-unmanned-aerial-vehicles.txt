This paper presents the introduction to the field of UAV-based human behavior understanding and surveillance. Specifically, it focuses on the challenges and limitations of existing datasets in this domain, including limited sample size, diversity of subjects, constrained capturing conditions, limited UAV viewpoints, limited data modalities, and limited categories of provided tasks and annotations. To address these limitations, the authors introduce UAV-Human, a large-scale multi-modal benchmark dataset that incorporates different sensors, various capturing environments, and diverse UAV flying attitudes and speeds. The dataset contains video sequences for action recognition, annotated frames for pose estimation, frames with identities for person re-identification, and frames with distinct characteristics for attribute recognition. Additionally, the paper proposes a method for action recognition in fish-eye UAV videos, which addresses the challenges posed by the distortion caused by wide-angle views. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for enhancing action recognition using fish-eye cameras. Overall, this work contributes to the development of human behavior understanding methods specifically designed for UAV application scenarios.
