Abstract:Multi-view clustering is an important unsupervised method for separating data points into different clusters based on heterogeneous multi-view data. However, in practice, some views of the data may be missing, introducing the challenge of incomplete multi-view clustering. Existing approaches treat consistency learning and data recovery as separate problems, lacking a unified theoretical understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called COMPLETER (inCOMPlete muLti-view clustEring via method, conTrastivE pRediction) that addresses these challenges by leveraging contrastive learning and dual prediction. Our approach consists of three jointly learning objectives: within-view reconstruction, cross-view consistency through maximizing mutual information, and data recovery through dual prediction by minimizing conditional entropy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of COMPLETER through extensive experiments and highlight the intrinsic connection between data recovery and consistency learning in incomplete multi-view clustering, offering a novel theoretical perspective in contrast to existing approaches.
