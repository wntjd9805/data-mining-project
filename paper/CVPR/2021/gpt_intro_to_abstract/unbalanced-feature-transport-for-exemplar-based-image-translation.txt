Conditional image-to-image translation has rapidly advanced with the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) but still lacks optimal control over the translation process. Existing methods struggle with achieving high-quality translations, hindering their wide application in various tasks. Prior works have attempted to address this challenge by encoding a latent code using either a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) or style encoder. However, latent codes often compromise style control accuracy. Another approach injects specific style codes for different semantic regions, but this is limited to conditional inputs of semantic segmentation. Zhang et al. explored establishing dense semantic correspondence between conditioned input and a style exemplar, but their method suffers from many-to-one matching due to cosine similarity. To overcome these limitations, we propose UNITE (UNbalanced optImal feature Transport for Exemplar-based image translation), which achieves high-fidelity image generation with faithful style to given exemplars. UNITE utilizes a feature transport network and a translation network that are jointly optimized during training. The feature transport network employs optimal transport to match sets of features as a whole, overcoming many-to-one matching issues. To handle distribution deviations between conditional inputs and exemplars, we introduce an unbalanced optimal transport technique that adaptively learns the mass or weight of each individual feature for efficient transport between different distributions. In the translation network, we incorporate a semantic-activation normalization scheme to effectively inject aligned features into the translation process. Our experiments demonstrate that UNITE produces images with superior realism and fidelity. Our contributions include proposing a conditional image translation framework that incorporates optimal transport for proper feature alignment and style control, designing an unbalanced optimal transport technique with adaptive mass learning to align features with deviational distributions, and introducing a semantic-activation normalization method for effective style feature injection during image translation.
