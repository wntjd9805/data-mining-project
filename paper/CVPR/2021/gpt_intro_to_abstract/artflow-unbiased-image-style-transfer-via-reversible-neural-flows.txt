Neural style transfer is a technique that aims to transfer the artistic style from a reference image to a content image. While there have been many approaches based on iterative optimization and feed-forward networks, these methods often lack generalization capabilities for multiple types of style transfer. Universal style transfer (UST) has been proposed as a way to improve this generalization ability. Representative UST methods include AdaIN, WCT, and Avatar-Net, which have been continuously extended in subsequent works. However, these methods are limited in their ability to preserve image content during the stylization process, leading to a phenomenon known as content leak.Content leak occurs due to the fixed encoder used in UST methods, resulting in accumulated image reconstruction errors or biases in the training process. For example, the content leak in WCT and its variants is caused by reconstruction errors, while the content leak in AdaIN and Avatar-Net is caused by biased decoder training and style transfer module, respectively. In this paper, we propose an unbiased style transfer framework called ArtFlow to address the content leak issue. Unlike existing methods, ArtFlow incorporates both forward and backward inferences in a projection-transfer-reversion pipeline, based on a neural flow model called PFN. By avoiding image reconstruction errors and biases, ArtFlow allows for unbiased and lossless feature extraction and image recovery, leading to more accurate style transfer results.The contributions of this work are three-fold: firstly, we identify the content leak issue in state-of-the-art style transfer algorithms and analyze the main causes; secondly, we propose PFN, an unbiased and reversible network based on neural flows, which facilitates the analysis of inherent biases in popular style transfer modules; and finally, we present ArtFlow, a novel style transfer framework that achieves comparable results to existing methods while avoiding content leak. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of ArtFlow in preserving image content and improving overall style transfer quality.
