Multiple object tracking (MOT) is a long-standing problem with various applications in robotics, surveillance, and autonomous driving. Recent research in MOT has largely followed the tracking-by-detection paradigm, where object detections are obtained independently in each frame and then linked across frames through data association to form trajectories using identity embeddings. However, existing online methods typically focus on addressing either the detection augmentation or the data association via embeddings, while neglecting the common source of error: occlusions. Occlusions can lead to missed detections and difficulties in data association. Although some recent works attempted to address both aspects simultaneously, position prediction and embedding association were treated as separate tasks, with little exploration on how to make them benefit each other.In this paper, we propose a unified model for MOT that optimizes position prediction and embedding association jointly, leading to improved tracking performance and robustness to occlusions. We establish a real synergy between the two tasks by making one task participate in the other's process. This is achieved through a link composed of a target attention module, a distractor attention module, and a discriminative memory aggregation. By incorporating identity-awareness into position prediction, our model produces more accurate predictions under occlusions, reducing drifts in bounding box predictions. The improved predictions, coupled with attention mechanisms, allow for the extraction of higher-quality embeddings. These embeddings, in turn, contribute to better attention generation and focus on the target. This results in a positive feedback loop between position prediction and embedding association, enhancing tracking performance in complex scenarios with occlusions. We optimize the position prediction, embedding association, and proposed modules under a unified end-to-end model, achieving synergistic joint optimization.The main contributions of this paper are:- Proposal of a unified online MOT model that establishes mutual benefits between position prediction and embedding association, improving robustness to occlusions.- Introduction of temporal-aware target attention, distractor attention, and identity-aware memory aggregation to bridge the two tasks.- Demonstration of state-of-the-art performance on MOTChallenge benchmarks with public detections.
