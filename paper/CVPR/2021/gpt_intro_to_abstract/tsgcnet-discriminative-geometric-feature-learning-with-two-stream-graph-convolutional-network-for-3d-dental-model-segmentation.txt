In computer-aided design systems for orthodontic treatment, accurate segmentation of teeth on digitalized 3D dental models is crucial. This segmentation information is used for various purposes such as clinical diagnosis, surgical planning, and adjusting treatment plans. However, segmenting each tooth from the gingiva is challenging due to the unique and varied shapes of human teeth, atypical conditions in orthodontic patients, and noise and occlusion during scanning. Various methods, including conventional and deep learning-based approaches, have been proposed for tooth segmentation. Conventional methods rely on pre-selected geometric properties and manual initialization, while deep learning-based methods learn task-oriented feature representations for fully automated tooth segmentation. However, these approaches have limitations in accurately segmenting teeth with extreme appearances and dealing with the unordered nature of geometric data. To address these issues, we propose a two-stream graph convolutional network (TSGCNet) that independently processes coordinates and normal vectors to learn discriminative geometric features for tooth segmentation. The network consists of two parallel branches and utilizes different graph-learning strategies to capture coarse structures and extract distinctive structural details. The multi-scale geometric representations from the two streams are fused to obtain complementary multi-view information for dense labeling of all cells on the mesh surface. Our TSGCNet outperforms state-of-the-art 3D shape segmentation methods in experiments conducted on a clinical dataset of 3D dental models.
