Shadows are a common occurrence in natural images when the light source is obstructed. These shadows often introduce spatial-variant color and illumination distortion in the affected regions. Detecting and removing shadows from images is a challenging task, as they can significantly impact the performance of various computer vision tasks such as object recognition and tracking. In recent years, there has been substantial research in the field of shadow detection and removal, with numerous algorithms proposed to tackle this problem. However, existing methods still face certain limitations in terms of robustness, accuracy, and efficiency. This paper presents a novel approach for shadow detection and removal in natural images. Our method leverages the concept of image segmentation and employs a combination of color and texture features to accurately identify shadow regions. Additionally, we propose a robust shadow removal technique that takes into account the color and illumination distortion present in the shadow regions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. The proposed method not only achieves high accuracy in shadow detection but also ensures the preservation of important image details during the removal process. Our approach can find applications in various domains, including autonomous driving, surveillance systems, and image processing. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section II provides a review of the related work in shadow detection and removal. Section III describes the proposed methodology in detail. Section IV presents the experimental setup and evaluation results. Finally, Section V concludes the paper and discusses potential future research directions in this field.
