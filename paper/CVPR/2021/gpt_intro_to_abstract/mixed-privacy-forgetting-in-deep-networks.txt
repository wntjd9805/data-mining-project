In this paper, we address the problem of forgetting or unlearning data in large-scale computer vision models without compromising accuracy. Traditional methods of forgetting, such as zeroing weights or replacing them with random noise, result in decreased model performance. Thus, we propose Mixed-Linear Forgetting (ML-Forgetting), which allows for selective removal of a subset of data while retaining close to state-of-the-art accuracy on tasks.Previous research on forgetting has focused on simpler machine learning problems, like linear or logistic regression. The highly non-convex loss-landscape of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) makes it challenging to remove information from the weights of a standard convolutional network. The influence of specific samples on optimization trajectory and final weights is highly non-trivial to model.To overcome these challenges, ML-Forgetting uses a mixed-privacy setting, distinguishing a core dataset of data that will not need to be forgotten. This core dataset can be a large pre-training dataset or a collection of task-specific data. ML-Forgetting trains two sets of weights: a non-linear core set trained on the core dataset using standard training algorithms and a linear set of user weights trained to minimize a quadratic loss function on the changeable user data.The combination of non-linear core weights and linear user weights enables ML-Forgetting to achieve both high accuracy and strong privacy guarantees. Simply erasing the user weights allows for complete forgetting of user data with minimal impact on performance.Our contributions include introducing the problem of forgetting in a mixed-privacy setting, proposing the ML-Forgetting algorithm, demonstrating its effectiveness on large-scale vision datasets, and showcasing its ability to handle multiple sequential forgetting requests without performance degradation.In summary, our approach, ML-Forgetting, enables selective removal of data from large-scale computer vision models while maintaining high accuracy. It provides a solution in a mixed-privacy setting and outperforms previous forgetting algorithms in terms of performance and capability to handle multiple forgetting requests.
