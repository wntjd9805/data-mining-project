Abstract:Object detection in aerial images with arbitrary orientations and dissimilar layouts poses challenges for traditional deep network-based detectors. In this paper, we propose a convex-hull feature adaptation (CFA) approach for detecting oriented and densely packed objects. The CFA approach involves adapting features within regular convolutional grids to objects with irregular layouts using convex-hull representations. This allows for improved object localization and classification. The proposed detector consists of two stages: generating convex-hulls based on feature point offsets and refining the convex-hulls for accurate object coverage and classification. CFA incorporates gradient consistency and dynamic categorization of convex-hulls to alleviate feature aliasing and pursue optimal feature adaptation. During inference, single convex-hulls are used for efficient object localization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. This study contributes to the advancement of object detection in aerial images by proposing a promising feature configuration approach based on convex-hull representations. Additionally, the CFA approach addresses the challenges of detecting oriented and densely packed objects, leading to improved performance compared to baseline methods.
