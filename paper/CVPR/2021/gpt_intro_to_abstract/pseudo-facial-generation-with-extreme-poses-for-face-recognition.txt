Face recognition has seen rapid improvement with the development of deep learning techniques. However, pose variations pose a challenge in real-world applications. While the model LightCNN performs well on benchmark datasets, it struggles with extreme poses, resulting in a significant drop in recognition accuracy. This paper investigates why the recognition rate decreases for extreme profile faces and proposes a novel approach to address this issue.Existing methods for handling pose variations can be categorized into embedding-based and rotation-based approaches. Embedding-based methods aim to learn pose-invariant embeddings, often using metric learning or multi-view learning techniques. Rotation-based methods, on the other hand, rotate facial images to the frontal pose and recognize them directly. However, both these approaches have limitations in addressing the imbalance of data distribution and domain gap, which contribute to the drop in recognition performance for extreme poses.To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a lightweight generator that makes minor pixel-wise changes to input facial images. This approach is motivated by the observation that there is a significant drop in precision between ±75◦ and ±90◦, but visually, the corresponding facial images may not be distinguishable. The generated pseudo profile facial images preserve critical identity information by making appropriate modifications.Compared to traditional GAN-based methods, the proposed lightweight generator reduces the number of parameters and computational burden. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed method, showing superior performance compared to the baseline LightCNN-29-v2 model. The proposed framework can be easily integrated with any existing facial discriminator, offering a promising solution for improving recognition accuracy, particularly for extreme poses.In conclusion, the contributions of this paper include a novel method for generating pseudo profile facial images to address the drop in recognition accuracy for extreme poses. The proposed lightweight generator preserves identity information and shows superior performance compared to the baseline model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets support the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving recognition accuracy for extreme poses.
