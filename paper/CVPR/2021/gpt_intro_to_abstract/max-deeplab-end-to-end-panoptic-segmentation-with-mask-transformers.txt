The goal of panoptic segmentation is to predict non-overlapping masks along with their corresponding class labels. Current methods address this problem by approximating the task with multiple surrogate sub-tasks. However, these approaches often introduce artifacts and perform suboptimally, especially in challenging conditions. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end approach called MaX-DeepLab for panoptic segmentation. Inspired by DETR, our model directly predicts masks and their semantic labels using a mask transformer. We train our model using a panoptic quality (PQ)-style objective, maximizing the similarity between predicted and ground truth masks. Our approach removes the need for hand-designed components and achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging COCO dataset. We also introduce a dual-path transformer architecture that combines CNNs with transformers, enabling communication with a global memory at any layer. Our contributions include the development of an end-to-end model for panoptic segmentation, a novel training objective based on PQ, a dual-path transformer architecture, and closing the gap between box-based and box-free methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in achieving state-of-the-art performance on the COCO dataset.
