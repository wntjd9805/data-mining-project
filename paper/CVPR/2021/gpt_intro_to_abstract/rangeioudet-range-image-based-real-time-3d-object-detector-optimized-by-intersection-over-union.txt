Abstract:The detection of 3D objects from point clouds is a vital component of autonomous driving systems. Although various methods have been proposed for processing point clouds, many of them are impractical due to their complex framework, high memory complexity, and slow inference times. Practical applications require methods that have a simple framework, fast inference times, and use 2D convolution based models without extra customized operations. Existing methods for processing point clouds can be categorized into voxel-based, point-based, and range image-based methods. Voxel-based and point-based methods are popular but suffer from memory and time complexity issues. Range image-based methods have been explored before but have been largely ignored due to their unsatisfactory performance. This paper proposes a high-performance and fast-speed single-stage 3D detection method based on the range image representation. The method utilizes a point-based module to learn hidden spatial information encoded in the range image and enhance pointwise features. It also introduces a 3D Hybrid GIoU loss to improve the accuracy and quality evaluation of 3D bounding boxes. The proposed single-stage model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI 3D detection benchmark and actual operation scenario dataset.
