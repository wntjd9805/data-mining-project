The development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has greatly improved general object detection. However, deep detectors require a large amount of annotated training data to perform well. In few-shot learning scenarios, deep detectors face severe overfitting, resulting in a significant performance gap between few-shot detection and general object detection. Previous approaches to few-shot object detection have utilized meta-learning strategies and fine-tuning based approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Few-Shot object detection via Contrastive proposals Encoding (FSCE) that leverages contrastive learning to improve few-shot object detection. FSCE introduces a contrastive branch to the primary Region-of-Interest (RoI) head, which measures the similarity between object proposal encodings. We optimize a supervised contrastive objective, called contrastive proposal encoding (CPE) loss, to reduce variance within the same category and increase difference between different categories. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks, with improvements of up to 8.8% and 2.7%, respectively. We believe that our work contributes to closing the gap between few-shot and general object detection, leading to more successful machine perception.
