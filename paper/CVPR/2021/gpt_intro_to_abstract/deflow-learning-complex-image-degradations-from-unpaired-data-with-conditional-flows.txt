Deep learning has shown remarkable performance in image restoration and enhancement tasks when large amounts of paired training data are available. However, collecting paired data remains challenging and expensive for many real-world applications, such as super-resolution and denoising. Additionally, there are cases where paired data is impossible to obtain, like in the enhancement of existing image collections or restoration of historic photographs. To address this problem, researchers have explored the generation of paired training data by applying synthetic degradations and noise to high-quality images. This approach allows for effective supervised learning techniques to be applied. However, modeling the complex degradation process by hand is challenging, necessitating learnable alternatives. In this paper, the authors propose a novel method called DeFlow for learning image degradations from unpaired data. DeFlow employs a conditional normalizing flow-based approach to model the conditional distribution of a degraded image given its clean counterpart. This enables the sampling of multiple degraded versions of any clean image that closely resemble the characteristics of the unknown degradations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on deterministic mappings, DeFlow acknowledges the stochastic nature of natural degradations and noise. To enable unpaired learning, the authors introduce a unique formulation for conditional flows that leverages observations of the marginal distributions of both domains. By modeling both the clean and degraded domains in the latent space of a joint flow network, DeFlow ensures effective unpaired learning while preserving flexibility in modeling the conditional distribution.The authors apply their DeFlow formulation to the problem of joint image restoration and super-resolution in real-world settings. DeFlow learns complex image degradations, which are then used to synthesize training data for a baseline super-resolution model. Comprehensive experiments and analysis on real-world super-resolution challenge datasets demonstrate that DeFlow outperforms alternative GAN-based methods for generating image degradations from unpaired data, setting a new state-of-the-art performance.
