Scene text recognition (STR) is a topic of great interest in computer vision due to its numerous applications in license plate recognition and ID card recognition. However, recognition performance on low-resolution (LR) text images remains unsatisfactory. Existing methods typically employ interpolation techniques or generic super-resolution (SR) methods, but they do not consider text-specific properties, resulting in blurred and inaccurate results. In this paper, we propose a text-focused super-resolution framework called Scene Text Telescope (STT), which addresses the limitations of previous methods. We introduce a Transformer-Based Super-Resolution Network (TBSRN) to capture sequential information, allowing us to handle texts in arbitrary orientations effectively. We also propose a Position-Aware Module and a Content-Aware Module, which focus on the position and content of each character, respectively. To address the issue of confusable characters in LR situations, we employ a weighted cross-entropy loss in the Content-Aware Module. Our method is evaluated on the TextZoom dataset, and experimental results demonstrate that STT outperforms existing methods in terms of recognition accuracy. In summary, our contributions include the development of TBSRN to capture sequential information, the introduction of the Position-Aware Module and Content-Aware Module, and the generation of text-focused SR images that achieve higher recognition accuracy compared to other methods.
