Multiple object tracking (MOT) is a challenging problem in computer vision with applications in mobile robotics, autonomous driving, and video surveillance analyses. MOT requires accurate detection and association of objects throughout a video sequence, as well as fast running speeds. Many state-of-the-art methods address MOT by integrating detection and Re-ID modules, achieving high accuracy and speed. However, these methods still struggle with robust object association, especially in crowded scenes. This paper proposes a novel MOT architecture that extends the CenterNet detector by adding a single object tracking (SOT) branch for tracking objects. Unlike existing SOT methods, the SOT branch trains separate SOT models per target online to focus on specific discrimination. In offline training, the network is trained with image pairs, allowing the joint optimization of feature embeddings for object detection and distinguishing targets from similar objects. In online tracking, the proposed tracker, SOTMOT, achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and fast running speed on MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of combining SOT and MOT.
