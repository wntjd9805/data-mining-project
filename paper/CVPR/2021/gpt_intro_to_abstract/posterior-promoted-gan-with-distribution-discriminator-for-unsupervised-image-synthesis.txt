The introduction of the paper presents the problem of insufficient real information in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which leads to training difficulties and limited generator performance. Previous approaches have either used supervised techniques with attribute constraints or introduced additional loss functions or priors to improve the real information in the generator. However, these methods still suffer from indirect and brittle support for the generator or a gradual decay of real information. To address these limitations, the paper proposes a novel GAN framework called Posterior Promoted GAN (P2GAN). The P2GAN framework enhances the real information in the generator by learning abundant real information in the posterior distribution through a discriminator that maps images to a multivariate Gaussian distribution. In addition, the generator is promoted by introducing external real information into each convolutional layer using Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) and a latent code regularizer, which yields more powerful and direct impact on the features in convolutional layers.The paper also modifies the losses used in Least Squares Generative Adversarial Network (LSGAN) to a distribution version and provides theoretical guarantees for its convergence. Practical stability is ensured through the use of the reparameterization trick training and a pre-training step.The contributions of the paper include the introduction of the P2GAN framework, which leverages a posterior distribution for real/fake classification and extracts abundant real information for the generator. The paper also presents a distribution-based version of the LSGAN losses, theoretical proofs of convergence, and a new latent code regularizer to prevent fading of real information. Furthermore, practical stability is addressed through the reparameterization trick training and pre-training step.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed P2GAN model achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple image datasets in a fully unsupervised manner.
