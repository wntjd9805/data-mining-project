Recognizing faces in unconstrained settings is a challenging task due to the variability in face images caused by factors such as illumination, background, pose, occlusion, and expression. Most face analysis systems for unconstrained environments consist of face acquisition, feature extraction, and facial application stages. The accuracy of these systems can be improved by selecting the optimal reference image in the acquisition stage and by learning discriminative representations in the feature extraction stage.Traditional methods for face quality assessment estimate the quality of a face image based on factors like luminance, distortions, and pose angles. However, these factors may not directly contribute to face feature learning. Learning-based methods that train quality assessment models using labeled quality values are also error-prone, as there is no clear definition of quality and humans may not know the best characteristics for the system.To improve end-to-end performance in face feature learning, metric-learning or classification losses have been used to represent each face image as a deterministic point embedding in the latent space. However, these methods fail to account for low-quality or large-pose images, which can lead to false recognition. Confidence-aware methods address this issue by representing each face image as a Gaussian distribution in the latent space, but they introduce additional network blocks and do not directly improve conventional metrics for comparing face features.This paper proposes MagFace, a universal and quality-aware face representation approach. MagFace aims to learn a within-class distribution for face images of the same subject, where high-quality images are closer to the class center and low-quality images are distributed around the boundary. The design of MagFace is based on two principles: using magnitude, an independent property of the feature vector, as an indicator for quality assessment, and maintaining a cone-like within-class structure in the feature space. Ambiguous samples are down-weighted during training, and the learned feature vectors are encouraged to have large magnitudes.MagFace improves previous work by considering both the direction and magnitude of the feature vector in face recognition. The magnitude is shown to be indicative of face quality and can be incorporated into recognition characteristics without requiring quality labels. Furthermore, MagFace explicitly distributes features structurally in the angular direction to prevent overfitting and learn well-structured distributions that are suitable for recognition and clustering purposes. Extensive experiments and mathematical proof support the effectiveness of MagFace in improving face recognition performance.
