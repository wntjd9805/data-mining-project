Precise box estimation is crucial for the success of object trackers. Traditional methods, such as multi-scale search or sampling-then-regression strategies, have limitations in accuracy, thus hindering the performance of trackers. To address this, state-of-the-art trackers employ a multiple-stage tracking strategy that involves coarsely locating the target and refining the initial results for more precise box prediction. However, even with these advancements, box estimation can still be improved. An oracle experiment conducted on the LaSOT benchmark confirms this, showing that existing trackers' AUC scores are far from perfection. Our proposed method, Alpha-Refine, achieves significantly better performance in box estimation when the tracker's search region is perfectly centered on the ground truth. Furthermore, unlike existing refinement methods that lack transferability, Alpha-Refine is trained independently and can be directly applied to any existing tracker without additional training or modification. In this work, we explore various design options for Alpha-Refine, such as feature fusion modules, prediction heads, and an auxiliary mask head. Our experiments demonstrate that precise spatial information extraction and maintenance are key to accurate box estimation. Additionally, the use of an auxiliary mask head improves the extraction of detailed spatial information. The effectiveness of Alpha-Refine is validated on multiple tracking benchmarks, where it outperforms competing methods and strengthens existing trackers. Notably, AR-DiMPsuper achieves state-of-the-art performance at real-time speed. Overall, Alpha-Refine enhances the precision and robustness of object tracking algorithms, showcasing its potential for practical applications.
