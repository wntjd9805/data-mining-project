This paper focuses on the challenging task of removing reflections from images taken in front of glass surfaces. Reflection removal is important in computational photography, as it can significantly improve image quality. However, distinguishing between reflection and transmission components in an image is difficult. Existing methods rely on assumptions about the appearance of reflections, but these assumptions do not always hold in real-world scenarios. To address this problem, the authors propose a novel reflection-free flash-only cue that helps infer the presence of reflection in an ambient image. This cue is robust and does not depend on the appearance or strength of reflection. By subtracting the ambient image from the corresponding flash image, the authors obtain a flash-only image that is free of reflections. However, flash-only images often suffer from artifacts such as color distortion and occlusions. To overcome this, the authors design a dedicated architecture that estimates the reflection image first, and then uses the estimated reflection and the input ambient image to estimate the transmission image. This approach allows for robust and accurate removal of various types of reflections. The authors evaluate their method on a real-world dataset and demonstrate its superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics. They also provide a dataset that includes both raw data and RGB data for flash-based reflection removal. Overall, this work contributes a novel cue and a dedicated framework for reflection removal, enabling users to easily remove reflections in their images.
