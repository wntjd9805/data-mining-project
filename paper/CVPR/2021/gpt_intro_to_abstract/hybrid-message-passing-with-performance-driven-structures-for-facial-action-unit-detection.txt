Facial action units (AUs) detection plays a crucial role in analyzing human expressions in the field of artificial intelligence. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) proposed by Ekman has been widely used to model the relationship between facial muscle movements (AUs) and facial expressions. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successful in various classification and regression tasks due to their powerful feature representation capabilities. However, for facial AU detection, the structural information and dependencies among different AUs need to be considered. Recent studies have shown that graph neural networks, also known as message passing neural networks (MPNN), can effectively capture these dependencies. Previous studies have used prior knowledge from FACS or training labels to define the graph structure, but these methods do not fully capture the complex correlations among AUs. Moreover, individual differences can also lead to different correlations among AUs. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel hybrid message passing neural network with performance-driven structures (HMP-PS) for facial AU detection. The HMP-PS model generates predictions by considering different graph structures in a Bayesian manner using performance-driven Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling (P-MCMC). In addition, the model dynamically combines different types of messages to capture diverse dependencies and propagate complementary information. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in facial AU detection.
