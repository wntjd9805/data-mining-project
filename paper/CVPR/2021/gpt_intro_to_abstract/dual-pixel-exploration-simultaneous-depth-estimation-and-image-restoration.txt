This paper introduces the use of Dual-Pixel (DP) sensors in DSLR and smartphone cameras for various applications beyond auto-focus. These include depth estimation, defocus deblurring, reflection removal, and shallow depth-of-field image synthesis. The paper aims to model the imaging process of DP sensors and demonstrate their effectiveness for simultaneous depth estimation and image deblurring. The authors propose a theoretical DP model and develop an end-to-end DP-based Depth and Deblur Network (DDDNet) to estimate depth and restore sharp images. They also introduce a reblur loss based on the DP model for training regularization. Additionally, a DP image simulator is created to generate DP datasets, and a real dataset is collected for further research. Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data shows that the proposed approach achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
