In this paper, we introduce the concept of Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) and identify a fundamental limitation in current CZSL methods. These methods assume a closed world scenario where the test time search space is limited to a predefined set of compositions. To address this limitation, we propose the Open World CZSL (OW-CZSL) task, where there is no constraint on the test time search space. We present a novel model called Compositional Cosine Logits (CompCos) that embeds images and compositional representations into a shared space and computes scores for each composition using cosine similarity. We also introduce a mechanism to assign feasibility scores to unseen compositions based on similarities among primitives. These feasibility scores are then used as margins in a cross-entropy loss to eliminate unfeasible distractors. Our proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on standard CZSL benchmarks as well as the challenging OW-CZSL task. We contribute a new problem formulation, a novel model, and significantly improved performance on existing and newly proposed CZSL settings.
