Human motion capture from a single color image is a widely studied topic in computer vision. However, most current solutions are limited in their ability to capture local motions of hands and faces along with full body motions, making them unsuitable for applications such as AR, VR, and tele-presence. In these applications, it is crucial to capture the full human body pose and shape, including hands and face, in real-time. While significant progress has been made in body pose estimation, hand pose estimation, and face capture individually, joint full body capture in real-time remains an open problem. In this paper, we present the first real-time monocular approach that jointly captures the shape and pose of the body and hands, as well as facial geometry and color, from a single color image. Our approach aims to recover the full body pose, facial expression, and a dense surface representation that contains person-specific information. To achieve real-time performance without compromising accuracy, we propose a novel network architecture that exploits inter-part correlations by streaming body features into the hand pose estimation branch. This feature composition, utilizing body information for hand keypoint detection, improves runtime efficiency and accuracy.Unlike previous methods that require specific training data with annotations for body, hands, and face altogether, which is costly to collect, our approach only relies on existing part-specific datasets. We introduce four task-specific modules that are trained individually with different types of data but work together in an end-to-end manner during inference. This modular network design enables us to use images with varying annotations, motion capture data, and face images with 2D landmarks. To handle the diverse data types during training, we propose an attention mechanism and a two-stage body keypoint detection structure.Our contribution includes the first real-time approach that captures 3D body, hands, and face from a single color image. We also introduce a novel network structure that combines local and global features and exploits inter-part correlations, resulting in computational efficiency and improved accuracy. Furthermore, our approach utilizes various data modalities, supported by decoupled modules, an attention mechanism, and a two-stage body keypoint detection structure, leading to superior generalization across different benchmarks.
