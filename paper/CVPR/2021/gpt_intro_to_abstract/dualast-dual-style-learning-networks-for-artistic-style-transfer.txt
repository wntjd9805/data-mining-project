Artistic style transfer, which involves transferring the styles of artwork onto photographs, has gained significant attention in recent years due to its scientific and artistic value. Understanding the characteristics of artwork creation is crucial for achieving satisfying and convincing stylizations. Each artist has a specific painting style, distinguishable from others, and studying a collection of an artist's artworks allows for a deeper understanding of their style. Additionally, there are variations within one style, where artworks may differ in terms of color and texture. Existing style transfer methods only consider one of these perspectives, limiting their ability to address the other perspective's challenges. Some methods focus on the holistic artist-style but neglect variations among different images, resulting in limited style controllability and lack of variety. On the other hand, other methods focus on specific artwork-style but are inferior in visual quality due to not leveraging rich style information from artwork datasets. To address these limitations, we propose the DualAST framework, which simultaneously learns both holistic artist-style and specific artwork-style. We introduce a Style-Control Block (SCB) to better control the style of the generated image based on the input reference image. Our SCB treats style information as a modulator, producing learnable style-control factors for adjusting the generated image's style. Through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate that DualAST produces high-quality, style-controllable stylization results with plenty of variations.
