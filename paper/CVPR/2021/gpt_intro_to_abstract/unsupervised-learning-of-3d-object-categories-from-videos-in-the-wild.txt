Understanding and reconstructing 3D objects from 2D images is a challenging problem in computer vision. Deep learning methods have shown promise in this area, but still have limitations due to the difficulty of the task. Previous methods have relied on synthetic data or manual annotations, but we aim to relax these assumptions. We propose a novel deep neural network architecture to learn 3D object categories from multiple views of real-world objects, without manual annotations or constraints on shape. We introduce a new dataset of videos captured in the wild, which allows for the evaluation of current reconstruction techniques. We find that existing models struggle when applied to multiple videos of different but related objects. To address this, we propose a new neural rendering approach called Warp-Conditioned Ray Embeddings (WCR) that is less sensitive to inaccurate 3D alignment. Our method achieves better reconstruction quality compared to existing techniques on challenging real-world object datasets.
