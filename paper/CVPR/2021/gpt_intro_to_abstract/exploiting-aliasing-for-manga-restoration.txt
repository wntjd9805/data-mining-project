This paper introduces a novel two-stage manga restoration method aimed at restoring low-quality legacy mangas to their original appearances. The main challenge lies in the presence of screentones, regular black-and-white patterns used to render intensity and textures in manga images. Undersampling the images can result in incoherent visual effects and screentone artifacts. Existing image restoration methods and single image super-resolution methods are not feasible in this context. The proposed method utilizes a Scale Estimation Network (SE-Net) to predict the target resolution from the degraded screentones and a Manga Restoration Network (MR-Net) to restore the bitonal screentones. The MR-Net restores screentones for pattern-identifiable regions and synthesizes random screentones for pattern-agnostic regions based on a learned confidence map. The method is evaluated on synthetic and real-world data, demonstrating high PSNR and SSIM values and expressing potential for practical usage. The contributions of this paper include the first manga restoration method that restores bitonal screentones at a learned resolution and a manga restoration network that adaptively restores screentones based on a confidence map. Furthermore, the proposed framework has potential for extension to natural images containing regular textures.
