Facial age classification, or facial age estimation, has applications in computer vision such as human-computer interaction and facial attribute analysis. Despite recent efforts, the performance of facial age classification in wild conditions is still limited due to the long-tailed distribution of datasets, with many minority classes and few common classes. Learning with long-tailed age data often results in the head classes dominating the training convergence, leading to a degradation in performance for tail classes. This motivates the development of a robust facial age classification approach for imbalanced age data. Existing approaches can be categorized as single label learning (SLL)-based or label distribution learning (LDL)-based. SLL-based methods treat each age independently but ignore the gradual changes in facial appearance with progressive ages. LDL-based methods introduce age correlation but suffer in long-tailed cases where minority features are suppressed. To address the long-tailed data issue, this paper proposes a progressive margin loss (PML) approach for age classification. The PML method leverages semantic margins to reduce intra-class variance and enlarge inter-class variance simultaneously. The proposed PML consists of an ordinal margin learning and a variational margin learning, which extract discriminative features while preserving the age order relation. Indicators are developed using the curriculum-learning method for efficient optimization. Extensive experiments are conducted on three widely-used face aging datasets with varying degrees of imbalance, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially with fewer samples. For example, without using any external datasets, the proposed method achieves a decrease in mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.56 compared to a recently reported benchmark with sparse and limited samples.
