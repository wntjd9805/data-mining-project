The rise of cloud-based localization and mapping systems for mixed reality and robotics is driven by the need for scalable solutions that enable multi-device experiences and crowd-sourced mapping. However, these systems have raised privacy concerns due to their reliance on acquiring imagery of the environment. Existing privacy-preserving localization and mapping techniques conceal the appearance of images by lifting traditional point-based features to lines. However, these techniques assume calibrated cameras, which limits their applicability in various scenarios where camera calibration continuously changes over time. Additionally, inaccurate or incorrect focal length estimates from mobile cameras and dashboard cameras further hinder camera localization and mapping accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a principled solution for privacy-preserving localization from uncalibrated cameras. The approach self-calibrates the focal length and estimates the absolute pose of the camera using privacy-preserving line features. The method allows localized cameras to contribute to existing maps incrementally without additional assumptions. Furthermore, the paper presents a solution for initializing maps from scratch using only uncalibrated cameras. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in various localization and crowd-sourced mapping scenarios. The paper is organized into sections that review related methods, describe the proposed solution for camera localization with unknown focal length, outline the approach for initializing maps with uncalibrated cameras, and present experimental validation of the proposed methods.
