Facial muscle movements play a crucial role in human communication and convey a wide range of emotions. The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) provides a way to analyze and quantify these movements by annotating the intensities of different action units (AUs). With the recent advancements in high-performance computing and the availability of large-scale datasets, deep neural networks have emerged as a dominant approach for computer vision tasks. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) have shown excellent performance in extracting local features and capturing temporal dependencies, respectively, in various applications, including facial AU recognition.However, the success of deep learning methods in facial AU intensity estimation heavily relies on the availability of training data, which is often difficult and time-consuming to obtain due to the annotation process requiring strong domain expertise. Moreover, the distribution of AU intensities is generally imbalanced, further limiting the performance of deep learning models under insufficient data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called dynamic probabilistic graph convolution (DPG) for AU intensity estimation.Our method leverages semantic dependencies among AUs and integrates this probabilistic information into a dynamic deep model. We capture these semantic dependencies using a Bayesian Network, which allows us to capture causal relationships and interpret AU dependencies. Instead of using a deterministic graph, we use a sampling method to estimate the posterior distribution of the graph structure given the AU intensity estimation. We then introduce the probabilistic graph convolution by incorporating all possible semantic structures with their probabilities into the conventional graph convolution. Finally, our proposed model is embedded in a dynamic deep model to simultaneously capture AU appearance, semantic structural, and dynamic features for AU intensity estimation.Our contributions include:1. Proposing a dynamic probabilistic deep framework that integrates AU appearance information, dynamics, and structural dependencies for AU intensity estimation.2. Introducing a probabilistic graph convolution that enables learning structural features over probabilistic graphs.3. Achieving comparable or better performance than state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark AU intensity estimation datasets.Our approach addresses the limitations of deep learning methods in facial AU intensity estimation by leveraging prior knowledge and capturing the dynamics and semantic dependencies of the facial muscle movements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in accurately estimating AU intensities.
