Deep learning has proven to be highly effective in domains that have a sufficient amount of labeled data. However, its performance suffers significantly in domains with limited or no labeled data. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to solve this problem by transferring a model learned from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Various variants of UDA, such as multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA), partial domain adaptation (PDA), and open set domain adaptation (OSDA), have been proposed to address more complex and practical problems. The challenge with these variants is that methods developed for one variant may not be applicable to another, leading to a costly and time-consuming trial-and-error process to find a suitable solution. In this work, the authors propose a general representation called Generalized Domain Adaptation (GDA) that encompasses all major UDA variants. GDA considers the distinctions between domains and class labels on a sample-by-sample basis, rather than domain-by-domain. By doing so, GDA can represent all major UDA variants and their combinations as special cases within its framework.Furthermore, GDA introduces a new challenge where domain labels are completely unknown for all samples and class labels are only given to a subset of classes in each domain. This setting arises in practical scenarios such as data from multiple institutions with unknown acquisition processes. The authors propose a self-supervised class-destructive learning method to accurately estimate the domain of each sample. This method transforms an image into a "class-indistinguishable" form by shuffling its pixel blocks, allowing for the learning of class-invariant and domain-variant representations without using domain labels. A simple domain-adversarial learning approach is used to train a domain-invariant classifier. The method also handles cases where class labels are only partially available for each domain and can be adapted to open set settings.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in the new UDA setting and remains highly competitive in existing UDA problems. The main contributions of this work include the general representation of UDA problems with GDA, the identification of UDA settings where existing methods fail, and the introduction of a novel domain label estimation method based on self-supervised class-destructive learning.
