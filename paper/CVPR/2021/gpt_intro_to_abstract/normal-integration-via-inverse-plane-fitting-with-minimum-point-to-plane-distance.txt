Reconstructing a surface from its surface normal map, known as normal integration, plays a significant role in photometric 3D reconstruction techniques such as shape from shading, photometric stereo, and shape from polarization. Variational-based methods, which involve functional optimization, have been extensively studied for normal integration. These methods typically involve solving linear systems, either by discretizing the functional or its optimal conditions. More recently, a non-variational approach based on discrete geometry processing (DGP) was proposed for normal integration.However, existing linear system-solving approaches suffer from several issues, including the checkerboard artifact, sensitivity to outliers, and Gibbs phenomenon near sharp features. Several remedies have been investigated to improve robustness against these artifacts, such as regularization and replacing the 2-norm of the residual vector with the p-norm. While these methods offer some improvement, they come with their own drawbacks.In this paper, we focus on the residual vector of the linear systems and introduce the concept of point-to-plane distance to the problem of normal integration. We formulate normal integration as an inverse problem of local plane fitting in camera coordinates. By simultaneously optimizing the positions of points and local plane displacements, we minimize the sum of squared point-to-plane distances. Our method is flexible and can be applied to various types of normal maps and different domains.Our contributions include proposing a new method for normal integration based on point-to-plane distances, highlighting the source of the checkerboard artifact in the central-difference discretized functional, and demonstrating that our method is more robust against outliers and sharp features compared to existing approaches like discrete Poisson's equation and DGP.
