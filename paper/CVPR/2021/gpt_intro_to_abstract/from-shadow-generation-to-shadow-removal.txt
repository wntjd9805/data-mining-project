Shadows are common in natural images and present challenges for various computer vision tasks. Removing shadows by restoring image information in shadow regions has been extensively studied, leading to improved performance in many applications. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently been used for learning-based shadow removal, resulting in better performance than traditional methods. Most existing approaches rely on paired shadow and shadow-free images for supervised training, but obtaining such data in uncontrolled environments is difficult. Unsupervised methods using unpaired shadow and shadow-free images have been explored, but they introduce domain gaps and suffer from limited variety in the training set. To address these limitations, a recent method leverages the fact that shadow images contain both shadow and non-shadow regions, allowing the cropping of unpaired patches from the same images. However, this approach requires meticulous design, strict constraints, and heavy computational load. In this paper, we propose G2R-ShadowNet, a novel approach that incorporates a shadow generation module to address these challenges. G2R-ShadowNet consists of sub-networks for shadow generation, shadow removal, and refinement. We generate pseudo shadows for each shadow-free region and pair them with the corresponding original shadow-free region to form training data. The shadow removal sub-net is then trained to remove the generated shadows, and the results are refined to ensure consistency with surrounding areas. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive performance and outperforming existing patch-based shadow removal methods. Our contributions include the construction of paired shadow and non-shadow data using only shadow images, the development of G2R-ShadowNet, and the demonstration of its superior performance compared to current state-of-the-art methods.
