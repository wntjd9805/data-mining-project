In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm to detect an optimal set of semantic lines in images, based on harmonious composition. Semantic lines are defined as meaningful lines that separate different semantic regions in a scene. They play a crucial role in high-level image understanding and composition, as well as in autonomous driving systems for road lane detection. However, detecting semantic lines is challenging due to their subtle nature and complex boundaries.Previous techniques for line detection have focused on extracting hand-crafted or deep features to identify line segments. While some recent attempts have been made to detect semantic lines, they often fail to consider the harmony between detected lines, resulting in sub-optimal results. In this work, we propose a new algorithm that formulates semantic line detection as finding a maximal weight clique in a complete graph.To achieve this, we design two networks: a selection network (S-Net) and a harmonization network (H-Net). The S-Net computes the classification probability and regression offsets for each line candidate, and then filters out irrelevant lines through a selection-and-removal process. The selected lines form the nodes in the complete graph, and the H-Net computes the edge weights. Finally, we identify a maximal weight clique that represents harmonious semantic lines.We also introduce a novel metric, called Harmonious Intersection over Union (HIoU), to assess the overall harmony of semantic lines. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm accurately and efficiently detects harmonious semantic lines. Additionally, the algorithm achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art techniques while reducing the computational complexity by a factor of 1/20.In summary, our contributions include formulating semantic line detection as finding a maximal weight clique in a complete graph, developing S-Net and H-Net for constructing the complete graph, introducing the HIoU metric for assessing line harmony, and achieving accurate and efficient semantic line detection.
