The task of reconstructing surfaces from real-world observations in computer vision has long been a focus of research. Recently, the use of neural implicit functions for representing 3D geometry has gained significant attention. Compared to other shape representations like point clouds, polygons, and voxels, neural implicit functions offer a versatile representation with infinite resolution and unrestricted topology.Fitting a neural implicit surface to noisy and incomplete observations is an optimization problem that arises in various applications such as surface reconstruction from point clouds and multi-view reconstruction from images. However, imperfect data can lead to geometric and topological issues in the reconstructed surface, as the network may overfit to the noise and incompleteness of the input data. These problems have become more prominent with the use of powerful architectural features like sine activations and Fourier features.The paper illustrates the challenges in fitting neural implicit functions using various examples, showcasing issues like droplets and bumps in surfaces reconstructed from noisy point clouds, loss of fine-grained geometric features in image-based reconstructions, and topological noise due to inadequate views.To address these challenges, the paper proposes a hybrid neural surface representation that combines implicit and explicit representations using iso-points. This allows for on-the-fly conversion between the two representations during training, enabling the incorporation of geometry-aware regularization and optimization methods. The paper introduces a multi-stage strategy for extracting iso-points efficiently, involving projection, resampling, and upsampling techniques inspired by point-based geometry processing. These operations are GPU-friendly and computationally efficient, making them practical for training purposes.The benefits and utility of the proposed approach are demonstrated through various applications, including multi-view reconstruction and surface reconstruction from noisy point clouds. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that the hybrid neural surface representation enables fast convergence, robust optimization, and accurate reconstruction of details and topology.
