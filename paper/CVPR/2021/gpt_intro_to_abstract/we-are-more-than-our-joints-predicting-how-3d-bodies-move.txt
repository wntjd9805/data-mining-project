This paper introduces the problem of human motion prediction, which aims to predict future human movements given past motion data. While existing methods have been able to predict 3D joint locations, they often lack realism and do not capture the nuanced details of how the body moves. To address these limitations, the authors propose a novel solution called MOJO (More than Our JOints) that predicts realistic 3D body motion.The authors note that existing methods treat the body as a skeleton and predict a small set of 3D joints. However, animating a full 3D body based on sparse joint locations can be ambiguous and limited in terms of capturing realistic motion. To overcome this, the authors propose modeling the body with a sparse set of surface markers, which can be used to fit a statistical body shape model and produce more realistic animations.To model fine-grained interactions between markers and improve motion realism, the authors design a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a latent cosine space. This model preserves full temporal resolution and decomposes motion into independent frequency bands using a discrete cosine transform. The authors also use diversifying latent flows to sample from the latent space and produce informative features.To retain natural body shape and pose throughout the sequence, the authors propose a recursive projection scheme supported by the marker-based representation. After each prediction step, the markers are projected back to the valid body manifold by fitting a body mesh to the markers. This not only keeps the solution valid but also yields realistic body meshes and body model parameters.The authors evaluate their approach using the AMASS dataset and compare their results with state-of-the-art methods on the Human3.6M and HumanEva-I datasets. They show that their model with the latent DCT space outperforms existing methods in terms of motion prediction and realism. They also conduct a foot skating measure and a perceptual study to evaluate the realism of the generated motion.In summary, the contributions of this paper include the proposal of a marker-based representation for bodies in motion, the design of a new CVAE with a latent DCT space, and the introduction of a recursive projection scheme to preserve valid bodies at test time. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in generating realistic 3D body motion.
