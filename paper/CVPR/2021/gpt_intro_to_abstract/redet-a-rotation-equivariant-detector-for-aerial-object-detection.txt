This paper addresses the problem of object detection in aerial images, which poses unique challenges due to the arbitrary orientation of objects. Traditional approaches rely on Oriented Bounding Boxes (OBBs) to represent objects instead of Horizontal Bounding Boxes (HBBs). To achieve accurate object detection, most methods focus on extracting rotation-invariant features using techniques like RRoI warping. However, regular CNN features are not equivariant to rotation, resulting in unstable and delicate region features. To overcome this limitation, the paper proposes a Rotation-equivariant Detector (ReDet) that extracts rotation-equivariant features and then transforms them into completely rotation-invariant features using a novel Rotation-invariant RoI Align (RiRoI Align) method. Extensive experiments on challenging aerial image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving state-of-the-art results and reducing model size while maintaining accuracy. The contributions of the paper include the introduction of rotation equivariance into oriented object detection, the design of RiRoI Align for extracting rotation-invariant features, and the achievement of substantial improvements in performance compared to previous methods.
