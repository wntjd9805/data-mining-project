Faithfully reconstructing 3D shapes of human faces from 2D images is a challenging task with various applications such as face recognition and animation. Existing methods for 3D face reconstruction can be classified into learning-based and optimization-based approaches. Learning-based methods regress 3D morphable model (3DMM) parameters from facial images, but require large amounts of labeled data, making it difficult to acquire ground truth 3DMM parameters. Optimization-based methods treat face imaging as a generative process, taking geometry coefficients as inputs and producing rendered images based on graphics rules. However, these rules often fail to capture all the complexities of the imaging process, leading to optimization difficulties.Differentiable renderers have emerged as a promising tool for both learning-based and optimization-based methods. They allow for efficient rendering of regressed parameters in learning-based approaches, enabling the use of photometric loss for optimization. In optimization-based methods, differentiable renderers introduce gradient-based optimization, allowing for more complex loss functions and stabilizing training. However, traditional differentiable renderers have limitations. They often cannot produce realistic images due to domain gaps between rendered and real images, and are challenging to optimize as they only propagate errors to local vertices.To address these issues, we propose a novel conditional neural renderer for face reconstruction. Our renderer takes a face normal map as the geometry condition and a latent code vector to model other influencing factors. We decouple the normal map from other condition factors to improve geometry reconstruction. Additionally, we introduce a Normal Injection Module (NIM) to enhance control over the normal map, and a normal consistency loss for self-supervised training. Our proposed renderer faithfully renders realistic face images.In conjunction with the neural renderer, we propose an optimization algorithm for face geometry reconstruction. We also present a separate neural network to predict good initial 3D face parameters for more efficient optimization. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple face reconstruction datasets.In summary, our contributions include the use of a conditional neural renderer for face reconstruction, the development of a normal-conditioning neural renderer, and the proposal of an optimization algorithm that outperforms existing methods.
