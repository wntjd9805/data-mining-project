This paper focuses on Generic Multiple Object Tracking (GMOT), a tracking problem that does not rely on prior knowledge of the objects being tracked. The authors highlight the limitations of existing Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) studies, which often focus on specific object categories and use models trained on those objects. GMOT, on the other hand, has applications in various domains and does not require object-specific models. However, GMOT is under-explored compared to MOT, with a lack of benchmarks and baselines that incorporate deep learning techniques.To address these issues, the authors make three main contributions in this paper. First, they introduce GMOT-40, a dense GMOT dataset consisting of 40 sequences covering ten categories. The dataset is carefully annotated and includes challenging factors such as blur and occlusion. Second, the authors propose a series of baseline tracking algorithms specifically designed for one-shot GMOT. These baselines incorporate a one-shot detection stage based on the GlobalTrack algorithm and a target association stage using established MOT algorithms. Finally, the authors conduct thorough evaluations and analysis on GMOT-40, comparing the performance of different tracking algorithms.In summary, this paper contributes a publicly available GMOT dataset, baseline algorithms, and evaluation results, providing a foundation for future research and improvement in GMOT. The authors demonstrate the potential of GMOT as a versatile tracking problem that can be effectively addressed with deep learning techniques.
