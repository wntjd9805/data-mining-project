Image descriptors are widely used in computer vision for recognition tasks. These descriptors, which can be hand-crafted or based on deep learning, are typically numerical vectors with a high number of dimensions. To reduce memory consumption and computational efforts during comparison, techniques like BoW, VLAD, and ASMK aggregate multiple descriptors into a single holistic vector representation. However, for tasks like place recognition, it is advantageous to include additional information, such as the image locations of the aggregated vectors, in the final representation. This paper introduces the use of binding and bundling of vectors as a flexible framework to combine image descriptors with additional information. The concept of binding and bundling vectors is derived from hyperdimensional computing (HDC) or vector symbolic architectures (VSA), which involve mathematical operations on large numerical vectors with thousands of dimensions. The bundling operator combines information from multiple vectors into a single vector, while the binding operator associates role-filler or variable-value pairs, similar to symbolic processing. The paper presents an HDC implementation that allows the processing of existing and future image descriptors, including deep learning-based descriptors. It demonstrates how HDC can be used to aggregate holistic or local image descriptors and combine them with additional information. In particular, a novel approach for creating a holistic image descriptor from a set of local descriptors with image position information is proposed. The positions serve as roles associated with landmarks as fillers. To compare two holistic descriptors, the similarity of the roles determines the extent to which the similarities of the associated local descriptors contribute to the overall similarity. Proper preprocessing of the descriptors and suitable encoding of image positions in the same vector space as the descriptors are essential. The paper presents the necessary preprocessing techniques and encoding methods. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated through a series of mobile robotics place recognition experiments. The code and additional materials are available for further exploration and implementation.
