Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a crucial role in surveillance for public safety, but the concept of 'anomaly' is often ambiguous, making it challenging to gather data for all possible anomalies. Anomaly detection is typically approached as an unsupervised learning problem, where a model is trained to identify regular patterns using only normal data. Deep Auto-Encoder (AE) has emerged as a popular approach for video anomaly detection by modeling normal patterns and predicting the current or upcoming frames. However, existing methods face the challenge of over-generalizing, where all frames are predicted well regardless of their normalcy. To address this issue, we propose a Dynamic Prototype Unit (DPU) that encodes normal dynamics in an attention manner. The DPU incorporates a novel attention operation to create a normalcy map and derive diverse prototypes representing compact dynamics of shared normal patterns. Additionally, we recognize the need for an anomaly detector with adaptability to different scenes. Therefore, we introduce meta-learning techniques to formulate the DPU as a few-shot normalcy learner, named Meta Prototype Unit (MPU), for fast and effective adaptation to new scenes. Our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on several unsupervised anomaly detection benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of the DPU-based AE and the adaptability of the MPU in the few-shot setting.
