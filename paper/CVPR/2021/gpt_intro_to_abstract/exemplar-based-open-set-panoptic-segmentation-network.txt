In this computer science paper, the authors introduce the concept of open-set panoptic segmentation (OPS), which combines instance segmentation and semantic segmentation to identify instances and estimate semantic labels in natural scenes. They argue that OPS is important for advancing visual understanding and has practical applications in dataset construction, scene analysis, and image editing. The authors address critical challenges in OPS, such as dealing with objects that consist of multiple components and handling unknown categories that belong to stuff. They propose an exemplar-based open-set panoptic segmentation network (EOPSN) as a baseline model, which integrates the exemplar theory from psychology to search for unknown class labels. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of EOPSN through experimental results, outperforming simple baselines. The contributions of this paper include defining the OPS task, constructing a new OPS benchmark, and presenting the EOPSN framework.
