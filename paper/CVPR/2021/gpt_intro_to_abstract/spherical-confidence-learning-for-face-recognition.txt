A plethora of research has demonstrated the advantage of spherical latent space over Euclidean space in modeling certain types of data, such as face images. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) that map face images from input space into spherical space have shown empirical benefits for face recognition methods. Various approaches have been proposed to enhance the discriminative power of these models, including normalization operations, angular discriminative constraints, and margin penalties. However, while these deterministic mapping approaches have achieved successes in face recognition, they fail to capture the inherent data uncertainty in face recognition in the wild. This issue, referred to as the Feature Ambiguity Dilemma, causes ambiguous faces to be mapped into poorly learned regions, resulting in bias and distorted distance metrics. Probabilistic face representation learning presents a promising avenue to address this problem, but existing approaches have limitations when applied to spherical embeddings. The independent Gaussian assumption fails in the case of spherical embeddings, and empirical studies suggest unstable training when using spherical densities. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Sphere Confidence Face (SCF) for face confidence learning in a spherical space. Unlike previous approaches, SCF captures the most likely feature representation and its local concentration value on spheres. We theoretically show that the concentration value can be interpreted as a measure of confidence. Compared to existing approaches, SCF minimizes KL divergence between spherical Dirac delta and r-radius von Mises Fisher, which proves to be superior for face uncertainty learning in extensive experiments.
