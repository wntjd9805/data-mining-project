Anomaly detection has become increasingly important in various fields such as industrial inspection, medical diagnosis, and surveillance. The goal of anomaly detection is to identify anomalies from normal data, often approached as a binary classification problem. Due to the ambiguous definition of anomaly types and the significant imbalance between normal and abnormal data, a common practice is to learn the distribution of anomaly-free data and use it as a criterion for detecting outliers. Recent advancements in deep neural networks have greatly improved anomaly detection by enhancing the model's capability in representation learning. Most existing algorithms utilize deep models to detect anomalies at the instance level by extracting global features from the entire image. However, in many real cases, anomalies only occur in certain local areas of the image. Therefore, localizing anomalous regions at the pixel level is more practical. To address this challenge, this work proposes a novel framework for unsupervised anomaly localization that considers both global and local information. During the training stage, a normal image is randomly cropped to generate a patch. Features from the patch and its surrounding are extracted using a Local-Net and Global-Net, respectively. The global feature is then matched with the local feature to encourage the Global-Net to predict the missing patch's features based on its context. Multiple anomaly detection heads, including Inconsistency Anomaly Detection (IAD) and Distortion Anomaly Detection (DAD) heads, are jointly learned to measure the similarity between global and local features, resulting in a fused metric. At the inference stage, a scoring function derived from multi-head feature comparison is used to produce a score map for anomaly localization in test images. The proposed framework achieves promising results on real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods. For instance, on the MVTec AD dataset designed for benchmarking anomaly localization, the proposed framework improves the performance by 4.7% compared to the second-best competitor under the per-region-overlap metric.
