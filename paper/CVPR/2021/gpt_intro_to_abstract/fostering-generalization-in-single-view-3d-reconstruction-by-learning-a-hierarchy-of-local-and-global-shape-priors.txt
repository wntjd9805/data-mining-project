Abstract:This paper addresses the problem of single-view 3D reconstruction, focusing on the reconstruction of both visible and invisible parts of a dominant object in an input image. Existing approaches, mostly encoder-decoder networks, have shown limited generalization to novel shape categories. To improve generalization, the authors propose a hierarchical approach that splits the problem into two parts: predicting the geometric representation of visible parts and predicting the final shape from the representation. The authors introduce a hierarchical shape prior that enables recombination of partial shapes observed during training, improving generalization compared to conventional global shape priors. They demonstrate the effectiveness of the hierarchical reconstruction concept on various generalization tasks using the ShapeNet dataset. The results show the significant impact of the ability to recombine parts and improve data efficiency. The proposed hierarchical approach, called the Hierarchical Prior Network (HPN), can be applied to enhance the generalization of any method based on implicit functions.
