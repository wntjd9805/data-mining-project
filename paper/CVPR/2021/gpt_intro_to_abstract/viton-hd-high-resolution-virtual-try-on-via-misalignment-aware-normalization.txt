Image-based virtual try-on is an emerging technology that aims to generate images of people wearing different clothing items virtually. This technology is particularly relevant in the context of online shopping, as it allows customers to visualize how clothes would look on them before making a purchase. However, virtual try-on presents unique challenges as it requires preserving the person's pose, body shape, and identity while naturally deforming the clothing item to fit the person's body and maintaining the details of the clothing. Previous methods have achieved limited success in generating high-resolution virtual try-on images. This is mainly due to misalignment between the clothing and the person's body, which leads to artifacts in the generated images, as well as the difficulty of synthesizing initially occluded body parts in high-resolution images.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel high-resolution virtual try-on method called VITON-HD. The method introduces a clothing-agnostic person representation that leverages pose information and segmentation maps to eliminate clothing information. This representation is then used by an ALIAS generator that employs ALIAS normalization to remove irrelevant information in misaligned regions and propagate semantic information throughout the network. The ALIAS generator synthetizes high-resolution person images wearing the desired clothing item while preserving clothing details through multi-scale refinement.The proposed VITON-HD method significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of generating high-resolution images, both quantitatively and qualitatively. The experiments conducted on a newly collected dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the ALIAS normalization module in addressing misalignment issues. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of VITON-HD as a high-resolution virtual try-on approach, the proposal of a clothing-agnostic person representation, and the development of ALIAS normalization and ALIAS generator to maintain clothing details and improve synthesis quality.
