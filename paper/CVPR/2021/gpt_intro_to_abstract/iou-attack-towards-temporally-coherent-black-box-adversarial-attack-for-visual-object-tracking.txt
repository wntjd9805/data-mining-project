Visual object tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision with numerous applications. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have significantly improved tracking performance but have also introduced challenges in interpreting their behavior. Previous work has shown that injecting imperceptible perturbations into input images can cause CNNs to make incorrect predictions. Recent approaches have focused on white-box attacks, where the model structure of the deep tracking algorithms is known. However, in real applications, the concrete structures and parameters of deep trackers are often unknown, requiring a black-box approach.Existing black-box attack algorithms that inject imperceptible perturbations into images to decrease network classification accuracies are effective for attacking static images. However, they are not suitable for attacking temporally moving objects in videos. Deep trackers maintain temporal motion information within tracking models, making it challenging to degrade temporally coherent bounding boxes using perturbations based on CNN classification scores. Therefore, there is a need to investigate black-box attacks on both individual frames and temporal motions in videos.This paper proposes an Intersection over Union (IoU) attack for visual tracking, which is a decision-based black-box attack method that considers image content and target motion. The attack starts with two bounding boxes for each frame, one predicted by the deep tracker using the original frame and the other predicted by the same tracker using the same frame with perturbations. An IoU score between these two bounding boxes is used as feedback for the attack. The attack iteratively applies orthogonal composition to generate perturbations for image content attack. Tangential perturbations are randomly generated at each iteration, and the one with the lowest IoU score is selected. A normal perturbation is then added to reinforce the attack. The IoU score between the current and previous frames is also considered in the attack process to degrade the tracker's performance over time.The proposed IoU attack method is evaluated on state-of-the-art tracking methods, including detection-based, correlation filter-based, and long-term trackers. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the black-box IoU attack.Keywords: visual object tracking, convolutional neural networks, black-box attack, intersection over union, perturbations, decision-based approach.
