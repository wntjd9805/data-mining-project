This paper addresses the problem of few-shot instance segmentation, where the goal is to segment instances of a target object class in a query image given a few support images with their ground-truth instance segmentation masks. The training and test image sets do not share the same object classes, making few-shot instance segmentation a challenging vision problem. The paper introduces a common framework for few-shot instance segmentation that leverages Mask-RCNN. However, this approach has limitations, such as potential overfitting to specific object sizes and aspect ratios and the inability to segment new object classes with different shapes in testing. To address these limitations, the paper proposes FAPIS, a few-shot anchor-free part-based instance segmenter. FAPIS explicitly models latent object parts, which capture smaller components of objects that are important for segmentation. The paper makes two contributions: a new anchor-free object detector (AFD) and a new part-based instance segmenter (PIS). The AFD performs dense scoring, regression, and estimation of the importance of latent parts, while the PIS localizes and integrates latent object parts to produce the final instance segmentation. The evaluation on the COCO-20i dataset shows that FAPIS outperforms the state of the art. The paper concludes with a review of prior work and implementation details.
