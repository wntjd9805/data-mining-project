Scene text detection is a challenging task in computer vision with various applications such as scene understanding, visual search, and automatic driving. To localize explicit contours of text instances, bottom-up methods have become popular, but they require complicated post-processing and can generate ambiguous predictions. Top-down methods, on the other hand, localize arbitrary-shape scene texts but rely on elaborate anchors and can be sensitive to inaccurate localization. In this paper, a novel method called Progressive Contour Regression (PCR) is proposed to effectively localize arbitrary-shape scene text. PCR utilizes a progressive strategy to evolve the contours of oriented text proposals and iteratively refine them. A contour information aggregation technique is used to enhance feature representation and avoid the influence of redundant or noisy points. Additionally, a reliable contour localization mechanism is developed to increase the confidence of localized contours. PCR achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple public benchmarks and addresses the limitations of existing methods in detecting arbitrary-shape scene texts.
