This paper introduces the concept of panoptic segmentation forecasting, which aims to forecast the panoptic segmentation for a set of unobserved frames in an image sequence. Panoptic segmentation, which classifies each pixel as belonging to foreground instances or background classes, provides a rich representation of a scene. The authors propose a method that models the motion of individual object instances and the background separately, allowing for persistent instance information during forecasting and a better understanding of the motion of each moving object. The authors establish a leaderboard for this task on the Cityscapes dataset and provide baseline algorithms. Their method achieves state-of-the-art results on future semantic and instance segmentation tasks as well. Code implementing their models and experiments is available on GitHub.
