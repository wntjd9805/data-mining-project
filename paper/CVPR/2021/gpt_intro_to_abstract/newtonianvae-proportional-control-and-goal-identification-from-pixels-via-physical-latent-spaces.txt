Vision-based control is widely used in various industrial applications, such as robotics and process control. However, the current approach of building perception modules using supervised learning can be costly and time-consuming. As a result, there is a growing interest in developing model-based approaches for direct vision-based control. These model-based approaches typically involve learning latent dynamics models that are used within planning or model predictive control frameworks. However, this decoupling of dynamics and control can be computationally expensive and unnecessary. In this paper, we propose a structured latent dynamical model that allows for direct proportional control to be applied. We leverage the ubiquity and simplicity of Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) feedback control, which produces commands based on the error or cost term between the current system state and the desired target state. We demonstrate that by learning the state encoding from visual inputs, robots can be controlled from pixels using PID control. By structuring the latent dynamics, we eliminate the need for complex planning or reinforcement learning strategies. Additionally, we show that imitation learning from demonstrations can be framed as a goal inference problem under a proportional control model in the latent space. This allows for one-shot interpretable imitation learning of switching controllers from high-dimensional visual observations. We also showcase the application of our proposed model in fitting dynamic movement primitives for trajectory tracking problems.Our results demonstrate that embedding for proportional controllability leads to more interpretable latent spaces and enables the use of simple and efficient controllers that cannot be applied with less structured models. Furthermore, our model enables one-shot learning of control and interpretable goal identification in sequential multi-task imitation learning settings. Overall, our approach offers a promising solution for vision-based control in industrial applications.
