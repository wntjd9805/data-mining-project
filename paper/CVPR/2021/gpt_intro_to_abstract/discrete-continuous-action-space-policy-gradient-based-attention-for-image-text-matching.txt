Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing are two important areas of artificial intelligence that can be processed jointly in cross-modal tasks. Image-text matching or retrieval is a critical topic in this area, as it has a wide range of applications in real-world scenarios. Existing methods use deep learning models to extract image and language features and apply metric learning techniques to measure similarities between the two modalities. However, these methods do not perform explicit transformations between modalities, which can lead to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a policy gradient optimized attention adjustment approach for image-text matching, which provides explicit transformation and supervision to the attention mechanism. The attention weights are trained using the policy gradient method with batch-wise ranking metrics and instance-wise Average Precision as the reward function. This supervised attention mechanism improves ranking results and achieves higher Average Precision metrics. We consider the attention weights generation as an action selecting process, and propose a Discrete-continuous policy gradient algorithm that samples actions from multiple Normal distributions. We use a Gumbel-softmax relaxation to make the sampled actions trainable. This approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two benchmark datasets for image-text matching. Our contributions include a novel attention supervision scheme based on policy gradient, a new Discrete-continuous policy gradient algorithm, and validation of the effectiveness of these schemes through experimental results.
