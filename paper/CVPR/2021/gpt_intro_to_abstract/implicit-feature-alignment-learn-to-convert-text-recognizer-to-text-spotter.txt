This paper introduces the concept of Implicit Feature Alignment (IFA) for detection-free full-page text recognition. Traditionally, OCR systems follow a pipeline approach with a text detector and a text recognizer. However, performance degradation in each module can lead to overall performance deterioration. Recent end-to-end OCR methods have attempted to bridge the gap between text detectors and text recognizers but the error accumulation problem remains. In this paper, a new paradigm called IFA is proposed to achieve full-page text recognition without the need for detection. The core issue in text recognition is alignment, teaching the recognizer the location and category of each character. The paper discusses the evolution of text recognition methods and the limitations of approaches like the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and attention mechanisms. IFA leverages deep learning models to automatically align and train positive pixels, enabling the conversion from a text recognizer to a text spotter. The authors integrate IFA with CTC and the attention mechanism, resulting in two new methods called attention-guided dense prediction (ADP) and extended CTC (ExCTC). The paper also introduces modifications to the Aggregation Cross-Entropy (ACE) and proposes Wasserstein-based Hollow ACE (WH-ACE) to suppress negative noise. Both ADP and ExCTC have a unified inference form called IFA-inference, which can handle single-line, multi-line, and full-page text recognition tasks. Overall, IFA offers a simple yet effective solution for detection-free full-page text recognition with improved performance and faster inference speed compared to previous models.
