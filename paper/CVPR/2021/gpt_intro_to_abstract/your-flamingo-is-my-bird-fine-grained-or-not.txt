Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) has been a topic of interest in the computer vision community for nearly two decades. The ability of machines to recognize objects at a fine-grained level, such as distinguishing between a "flamingo" and a "bird," has been a critical question. Previous research has focused on mining fine-grained discriminative features to improve classification performance. In this paper, we challenge the definition and usefulness of fine-grained labels in current FGVC datasets. We conduct a human study to assess the usefulness of pre-defined fine-grained labels and whether a single label output is preferred. The results show that participants do not always choose the fine-grained labels as their preferred choice, and many prefer multiple label choices. Based on these findings, we propose a new approach to FGVC that extends from single-label classification to multiple label predictions on a pre-defined label hierarchy. Our model offers a coarse-to-fine series of labels, allowing users to choose the level of detail that suits their needs. We demonstrate that exploring the hierarchical relationship among labels improves both the new FGVC problem and the traditional single-label classification. Our contributions include re-envisioning the problem setting of FGVC, insights into the hierarchical relationship of labels, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the new problem and traditional FGVC.
