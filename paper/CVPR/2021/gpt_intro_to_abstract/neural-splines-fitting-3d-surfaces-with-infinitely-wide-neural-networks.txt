Estimating a 3D surface from a scattered point cloud is a challenging problem in computer vision and computer graphics. Traditional methods such as kernel-based surface reconstruction and Poisson surface reconstruction have limitations in terms of performance and theoretical understanding. Recently, neural networks have been employed to reconstruct surfaces, but their complex optimization process and overparameterization raise questions about generalization and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose using shallow ReLU network kernels for 3D surface reconstruction, which offer theoretical understanding, linear system solving, explicit inductive biases, and scalability. We demonstrate that these kernels outperform traditional methods and complex neural network approaches. We provide explicit expressions for two types of ReLU kernels and their corresponding RKHS norms, and we show that Poisson surface reconstruction can also be viewed as a kernel method. Overall, our work suggests that kernels offer a broad framework for understanding and improving surface reconstruction techniques.
