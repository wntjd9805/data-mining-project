Multi-person human pose estimation (HPE) plays a crucial role in various applications such as human activity recognition, human-computer interaction, and animation. Existing HPE methods can be classified into top-down and bottom-up approaches. However, both approaches have their limitations. Top-down methods require cropping and resizing each individual before detecting their keypoints, while bottom-up methods simultaneously detect keypoints but struggle with variations in human scales. Heatmap regression, a commonly used technique in HPE, relies on 2D Gaussian kernels to construct ground-truth heatmaps for keypoint supervision. However, current practices often assign the same standard deviation to different keypoints, which poses two problems. Firstly, keypoints of different scales have varying semantic significance in different spatial regions, causing confusion when using the same Gaussian kernel for all keypoints. Secondly, the labeling ambiguities of keypoints should be considered when setting their standard deviations. Adapting standard deviations manually is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address these issues, this paper proposes scale-adaptive heatmap regression (SAHR) that adjusts the standard deviation of each keypoint adaptively. By predicting scale maps, SAHR can effectively handle variations in human scales and labeling ambiguities. However, SAHR may lead to an imbalance between foreground and background samples. To address this drawback, weight-adaptive heatmap regression (WAHR) is introduced to down-weight easier samples and prioritize harder ones, further enhancing the performance of SAHR. The proposed approach achieves significant improvements compared to existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art results on COCO test-dev2017, showcasing its effectiveness in handling large variance in human scales and labeling ambiguities.
