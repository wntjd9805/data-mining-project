Abstract:This paper introduces a novel Adaptive Class Suppression loss (ACSL) approach to address the challenges of imbalanced class distribution in object detection tasks. Traditional methods use data re-sampling techniques to rebalance the distribution, but they often suffer from overfitting or information loss. ACSL treats all categories as scarce categories, eliminating the need for manual categorization into head and tail classes. It also introduces an adaptive suppression loss to balance the negative gradients between different categories, improving the discriminative ability of tail classifiers. The proposed method avoids the problems of over-sampling and under-sampling, ensures training consistency, and promotes learning of rare or similar categories. Experimental results on LVIS and Open Images datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ACSL, achieving significant improvements in detection performance.
