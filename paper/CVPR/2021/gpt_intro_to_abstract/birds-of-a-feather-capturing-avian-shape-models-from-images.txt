Automated capture of animal shape and motion is a challenging problem with widespread application in various fields, such as agriculture, biomechanics, animal behavior, and neuroscience. Extracting signals from images using articulated mesh models has the potential to transform these fields. However, a major challenge is obtaining suitable models for new species. Current methods rely on 3D scans, which are impractical due to the non-cooperative nature of animals.To address this challenge, we propose a method to directly capture articulated shapes from species-specific image collections, even when a strong deformable shape prior is not available. We focus on the CUB dataset, which provides image collections for bird species. Our approach involves aligning a generic template model to each annotated instance in the collection and updating the template model through deformations to better fit the silhouettes. This allows us to recover new species-specific shapes and individual variations within the species.Our work builds upon SMALR, which reconstructs quadrupeds using a deformable shape model and a video sequence of the same instance. However, we relax the assumption of using the same instance and instead work with a collection of different instances, making a naive adaptation of SMALR infeasible. By solving the "multiple instances" problem, we can directly build species-specific morphable shape models from images.To handle the challenges of species-specific shape modeling, we explicitly model two levels of the shape hierarchy: the difference between the generic template model and the average shape of a new species, and the variation among individuals within the species. We optimize a per-vertex deformation to bridge the difference between the template model and the new species and learn the variation within the collection as a blend shape basis. This allows us to reconstruct each sample as a combination of shape basis vectors on top of the estimated mean shape.Additionally, we learn a new parametric shape model, AVES, that can represent multiple avian species. We demonstrate that AVES captures meaningful shape variations correlated with avian phylogeny and can be integrated into a deep learning pipeline. Our contributions include a method for recovering detailed, species-specific shape models, the AVES shape model, and the demonstration of AVES's effectiveness in downstream tasks.In summary, our method enables the recovery of detailed, species-specific shape models for a range of bird species using an articulated 3D mesh and images of different instances. The AVES shape model captures meaningful variations and outperforms previous approaches in reconstruction tasks.
