Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection plays a crucial role in scene and action understanding. However, HOI detection is challenged by the long-tailed distributions of actions/verbs and objects in real-world scenarios. Open long-tailed HOI detection, which addresses the problems of imbalanced learning and zero-shot learning, is poorly investigated. Existing approaches for imbalanced training data mainly focus on re-sampling, re-weighted loss functions, and knowledge transfer. Knowledge transfer methods such as data generation and visual-semantic embedding have gained attention. In this paper, we propose the concept of open long-tailed HOI detection and introduce a new approach called Fabricated Compositional Learning (FCL) to address this problem. FCL leverages an object fabricator to generate balanced objects for HOI composition, improving the performance of rare and unseen HOI detection. Our experimental results on the HICO-DET dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of FCL and show significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in rare and unseen categories.
