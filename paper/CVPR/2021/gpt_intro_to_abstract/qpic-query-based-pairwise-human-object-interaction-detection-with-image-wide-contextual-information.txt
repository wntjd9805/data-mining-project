Abstract:Human-object interaction (HOI) detection plays a crucial role in scene understanding. The task involves localizing humans and objects in an image and identifying their interactions. Existing HOI detection methods can be divided into two categories: two-stage methods and single-stage methods. However, both types suffer from errors caused by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the heuristic use of CNN features. This paper proposes a novel query-based HOI detector, QPIC, which leverages attention mechanisms and query-based detection in a transformer. QPIC addresses the limitations of conventional methods by utilizing image-wide contextual information and ensuring the extraction of features for multiple HOI instances without contamination. The proposed method achieves significantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods on challenging HOI detection benchmarks. Detailed analysis of QPIC's behavior highlights its ability to capture important characteristics of HOI detection tasks that conventional methods struggle with. Overall, this work introduces a new approach to HOI detection and contributes to improvements in performance and understanding of the task.
