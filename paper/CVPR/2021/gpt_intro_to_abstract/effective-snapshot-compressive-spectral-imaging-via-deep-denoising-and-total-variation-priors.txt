Compressive sensing (CS) has become a popular imaging technology for capturing video and hyperspectral images. One important CS system is the snapshot compressive imaging (SCI), which uses 2D sensors and corresponding algorithms to reconstruct high-dimensional image data. Compared to traditional CS, SCI offers advantages such as low memory, power consumption, bandwidth, and cost, making it efficient for capturing hyperspectral images. Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) is a representative SCI system that combines hyperspectral images of different wavelengths into a single 2D image.Various reconstruction algorithms have been proposed for SCI, including GAP-TV and DeSCI. While DeSCI achieves state-of-the-art results, its computational speed is limiting for practical applications. To address this, previous work incorporated a deep denoiser network, FFDNet, into the plug-and-play (PnP) algorithm. However, this approach mainly focused on video reconstruction, and its performance on hyperspectral images is not satisfactory.In this paper, we propose a new method that combines deep denoising and total variation (TV) priors to enhance hyperspectral image reconstruction in SCI. By leveraging the strengths of both priors, our approach can achieve better reconstruction results. Our contributions include the development of a general framework for combining these priors, extensive experiments on simulated and real datasets to validate the effectiveness of our algorithm, and a convergence analysis of our proposed algorithm for SCI reconstruction.The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the SCI model and reconstruction algorithms. Section 3 describes our proposed method and the convergence analysis. Section 4 presents the experimental results.
