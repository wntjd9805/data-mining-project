When light interacts with a glass surface, it can be absorbed, reflected, and transmitted. The task of recovering the transmission image from a single reflection-contaminated image is challenging due to the ill-posedness of the problem. Existing methods either rely on image content or consider multiple images to remove reflections, but these approaches do not take the absorption effect into account. In this paper, we propose a two-step solution that considers the absorption effect. We first estimate the average refractive amplitude coefficient map, which numerically represents the absorption effect. To accurately estimate this variable, we adopt a two-branch training strategy that reduces the influence of image content. In the second step, we use neural networks and a Lipschitz condition to recover the transmission image. Our method outperforms existing approaches on public datasets and successfully removes reflection artifacts while restoring intensity distortions caused by the absorption effect. We demonstrate good model generalization capacity and overall intensity recovery performance.
