This paper introduces SCANimate (Skinned Clothed Avatar Networks for animation), a method for generating high-quality animatable clothed human avatars called Scanimats from raw 3D scans. Unlike existing models, SCANimate supports realistic clothing that moves and deforms naturally, with detailed 3D wrinkles and textured rendering. The key contributions of this work are as follows:1. Learning from raw scans: SCANimate learns an articulated clothed human model directly from raw scans, eliminating the need for surface registration of a custom template or synthetic clothing simulation data. This allows for capturing complex and detailed clothing deformations present in the original scans.2. Animation using SMPL pose parameters: Scanimats can be animated directly using pose parameters from existing models like SMPL. The approach predicts pose-dependent clothing deformations, providing generalization to unseen poses.3. Canonicalization and implicit skinning fields: A novel approach is proposed to transform raw scans to a common pose, allowing for modeling pose-dependent surface deformations. This is achieved by extending the linear blend skinning (LBS) concept to define skinning weights implicitly everywhere in 3D space. This enables the handling of raw scans with unknown topology and arbitrary non-watertight meshes.4. Cycle consistency: To address the lack of ground truth training data for skinning weights, the paper leverages two key observations. Firstly, the skinning weights of existing parametric body models like SMPL are used to regularize the more general skinning function. Secondly, the transformations between the posed space and the canonical space are enforced to be cycle-consistent.5. Learning implicit pose correctives: Pose-dependent deformations are captured using an implicit surface representation. This approach complements the missing regions in the canonicalized scans and retains details from the original inputs. Irrelevant pose features are spatially filtered out to achieve plausible pose correctives for unseen poses.The results demonstrate that SCANimate outperforms existing solutions in terms of generality and accuracy. The paper also includes an extensive study evaluating the critical technical contributions. The code and example Scanimats are available at https://scanimate.is.tue.mpg.de.
