In this paper, we address the problem of natural image matting, which involves extracting the alpha matte from an image. This problem has various applications in image and video editing. However, it is a challenging task due to the wide range of foreground objects and their complex shapes. Existing methods rely on low-level features or user-supplied clues to solve this problem. Traditional methods often fail when foreground and background pixels mingle deeply. Deep learning-based methods have improved the performance by utilizing high-level semantic representations. However, they still do not adequately consider the underlying cause of matting due to different object semantics.To address this limitation, we propose a matting framework that incorporates semantic classification of matting regions. We cluster different matting classes based on regional patterns and create a semantic trimap, which consists of a confidence map for each matting class in the unknown region. This semantic trimap, along with the RGB image, is used as input. We also introduce a multi-class discriminator for supervision, providing regularization from a semantic level for alpha predictions. Additionally, we introduce gradient constraints with content-sensitive weights to improve prediction with semantics inclusion.Our contributions include the incorporation of semantics into the matting task, the introduction of the semantic trimap, the proposal of learnable content-sensitive weights, and the usage of a multi-class discriminator for regularization. We also contribute a large-scale Semantic Image Matting Dataset that covers a wide range of matting patterns, facilitating future matting research and providing insights into algorithm performance. Overall, our approach achieves competitive performance by leveraging semantic information in natural image matting.
