Neural style transfer (NST) in non-photorealistic rendering has gained significant attention due to its ability to mimic artistic styles and enhance digital images. However, current NST techniques mainly focus on capturing textural elements of style and overlook the geometric warping techniques employed by artists. This paper addresses the problem of image stylization using deep neural networks and proposes a novel NST architecture that incorporates geometric warping. Unlike previous methods, this architecture is not limited to a single semantic class, trains a feed-forward network for warp field generation, achieves faster warping speeds, supports non-parametric warp fields, and allows for the use of two style images. Experimental results demonstrate that geometric warping plays a crucial role in human recognition of artistic style. The code for our technique is available for public use.
