Recent research has shown that deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples, which are manipulations of model inputs that are imperceptible to humans but cause the models to produce attacker-desired outputs. Previous work in this area focused on digital adversarial examples where the attacker can directly modify the input vector, such as altering pixel values in an image classification task. However, as deep learning is increasingly applied in real-world systems like self-driving cars, UAVs, and robots, the computer vision community has made progress in understanding physical adversarial examples. These physical attacks involve adding visible artifacts to objects, such as stickers or patterns, that deceive the models. In this paper, we present a novel approach to generating adversarial perturbations on real-world objects that are invisible to human eyes but result in misclassifications by the deep learning models. Our method exploits the radiometric rolling shutter effect, which is a phenomenon observed in cameras with rolling shutter technology. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by generating an invisible physical adversarial example using manipulated light on an object. This example contains adversarial patterns that are only perceived by a camera. We also address the challenges associated with creating these attacks, such as robustness to dynamic environmental conditions and limited perturbation options. To overcome these challenges, we develop a simulation framework that captures the environmental and camera imaging conditions involved in the attacks. Using this framework, we formulate an optimization objective that can be solved using gradient-based methods to compute the adversarial light signal. Our approach offers advantages over existing physical attacks, including stealthiness, invisibility to human eyes, and the ability to change the attack effect on-the-fly. We evaluate the effectiveness of our invisible physical adversarial examples on a ResNet-101 classifier trained on ImageNet and conduct physical testing under various viewpoints, lighting conditions, and camera exposure settings. Our contributions include the development of techniques for creating invisible physical adversarial examples, a differentiable analytical model for image formation under the radiometric rolling shutter effect, and the instantiation and characterization of these attacks in a physical setting. The code for our approach is available on GitHub.
