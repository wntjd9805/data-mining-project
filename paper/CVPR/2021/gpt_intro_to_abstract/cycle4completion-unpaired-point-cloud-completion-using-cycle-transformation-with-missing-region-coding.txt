The paper introduces the problem of sparse, noisy, and partial point clouds produced by 3D scanning devices and depth cameras, which require shape completion before further analysis. While data-driven supervised completion methods have achieved impressive performance, they rely on paired training data that is not always easily accessible. The paper proposes an unpaired point cloud completion network called Cycle4Completion, which establishes the geometric correspondence between incomplete and complete shapes in both directions. This is achieved through the use of cycle transformations and specific loss functions. The paper also introduces missing region coding to address target confusion. The contributions of the paper include the novel completion network, the cycle transformation framework, and the missing region coding approach.
