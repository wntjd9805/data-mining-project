Lossless compression plays a crucial role in efficiently storing the ever-increasing amount of data in the big data era. According to Shannon's source coding theorem, the optimal codeword length is determined by the entropy of the data distribution. Many coding methods have been successful in achieving this theoretical code length and are widely used in various compression algorithms.Probabilistic modeling techniques have also been applied to lossless compression, where the minimum code length is fundamentally bounded by the negative log-likelihood of the probabilistic model. Recent advancements in deep generative models have shown remarkable success in maximizing the likelihood of different data types, such as images, videos, and audios. This has led to the development of various lossless compression algorithms based on different types of generative models, which have demonstrated better compression ratios compared to traditional methods without machine learning techniques.In this paper, the focus lies on coding with flow-based generative models. While variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and auto-regressive models are both probabilistic models, they either suffer from inferior likelihood estimation or involve significant computational overhead. To address these limitations, the proposed iVPF (Numerical Invertible Volume Preserving Flow) model is introduced. iVPF utilizes volume preserving flow and achieves a bijective mapping on discrete data, making it suitable for lossless compression tasks. Furthermore, an efficient lossless compression algorithm based on iVPF is developed.The main contributions of this work include the investigation of the importance of volume preserving flow in lossless compression and the proposal of a novel computation algorithm called Modular Affine Transformation (MAT), which ensures exact bijective mapping without numerical errors for coupling layers of volume preserving flows. Additionally, the Numerical Invertible Volume Preserving Flow (iVPF) model and an efficient lossless compression algorithm for iVPF are introduced. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed compression algorithm, which outperforms state-of-the-art lightweight methods in terms of compression performance.
