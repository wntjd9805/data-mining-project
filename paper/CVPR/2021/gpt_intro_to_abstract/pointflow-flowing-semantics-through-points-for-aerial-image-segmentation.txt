This paper introduces the problem of object understanding in high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing images, which contain various geospatial objects such as airplanes, ships, vehicles, and buildings. The authors highlight the importance of aerial image segmentation in remote sensing understanding and its potential for providing semantic and localization information cues for interest targets. However, aerial images present unique challenges, including high background complexity, background and foreground imbalance, and the presence of tiny foreground objects in high resolution. Existing semantic segmentation methods are not adequately equipped to handle these challenges, particularly in modeling foreground objects explicitly. The authors propose a point-based information propagation module called PointFlow Module (PFM) to address these problems. PFM is designed based on the FPN framework and bridges the semantic gap between high-resolution features and low-resolution features with different levels of semantic information. The module selects representative points and propagates them between adjacent feature pyramid levels, effectively handling both the semantic gap and the foreground-background imbalance. The proposed PFNet, which incorporates PFMs into the FPN architecture, outperforms existing methods in aerial image segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency. Additionally, the authors validate the generality of their method on three general semantic segmentation datasets. The contributions of this work include the introduction of PFM, the design of a Dual Point Matcher, the integration of PFM into PFNet, and the extensive experiments and analysis that validate the efficacy of PFM in aerial image segmentation tasks.
