Recent advancements in unsupervised representation learning have led to significant progress in various visual recognition tasks, including image classification, object detection, and object re-identification (re-ID). Object re-ID involves retrieving objects of interest in large-scale gallery images without any annotations. Unsupervised object re-ID requires learning discriminative representations to model inter-/intra-identity affinities accurately. Pseudo-label-based methods with clustering-based label generation schemes have shown promise in semi-supervised/unsupervised object re-ID approaches. However, the presence of label noise hinders training and leads to noticeable performance gaps compared to ground-truth identities. In this paper, we propose a pseudo label refinement strategy inspired by temporal ensembling. We leverage the valuable temporal knowledge encoded in pseudo labels and mitigate label noise by smoothing label variations across generations. Our proposed method, called ReÔ¨Åning pseudo Labels with Clustering Consensus (RLCC), estimates pseudo-label similarities over consecutive generations and propagates hard or soft pseudo labels from the previous generation. By refining noisy pseudo labels through a momentum averaging formulation, our method improves the performance of existing unsupervised re-ID approaches. The contributions of our work include leveraging the temporal ensembling technique to regularize noisy pseudo labels in unsupervised object re-ID, proposing a simple and effective pseudo label refinement strategy, and outperforming the state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks with significant mAP improvements.
