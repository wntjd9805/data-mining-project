In the field of computer vision, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved impressive results in various tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and semantic segmentation, thanks to large-scale and high-quality datasets like ImageNet, COCO, and Places. However, these datasets are often artificially balanced, with an equal number of instances for each object or class. In real-world applications, data often follows long-tailed distributions, where the number of instances for different classes is severely imbalanced. This poses a challenge for training CNNs on these long-tailed datasets, as performance tends to significantly degrade.To address this issue, several methods have been proposed for long-tailed recognition. Two-stage approaches, such as deferred re-sampling (DRS) and deferred re-weighting (DRW), have shown significant improvements compared to one-stage methods. DRS tunes CNNs by resampling the datasets with class-balanced and instance-balanced strategies in Stage-1, while DRW assigns different weights to classes in Stage-2. Another approach, bilateral branch network (BBN), combines instance-balanced and reverse-balanced sampling in a single stage to simulate the process of DRS. Decoupling models, including classifier re-training (cRT) and learnable weight scaling (LWS), have also been proposed to further enhance performance. These models freeze the backbone and only train the classifier with class-balanced resampling in Stage-2.In addition to tackling the issue of imbalanced datasets, confidence calibration is important for recognition models in various applications. It involves predicting probabilities by estimating the likelihood of true correctness. Expected calibration error (ECE) is a widely used metric for measuring the calibration of a network, which computes the difference between predicted confidence and true correctness likelihood.In this paper, we present our proposed method, MiSLAS, for addressing long-tailed recognition. We extensively validate our approach on multiple benchmark datasets, and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in long-tailed recognition tasks.
