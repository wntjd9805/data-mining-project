The rise of photorealistic facial forgery technologies, particularly those driven by deep learning, has led to significant concerns regarding the potential malicious misuse of these techniques for forging media of human faces. This has created a crucial need to develop reliable methods for face forgery analysis to detect and locate manipulated areas in images and videos. While recent progress has been made in forgery detection through the gathering of datasets and profiling intrinsic characteristics of forgery images, the performance on these datasets has already saturated due to their limited scales and diversity. Additionally, the practical application often requires more than just a binary label, necessitating the localization of tampered areas. To address these challenges, this paper presents the construction of a new mega-scale dataset called ForgeryNet, with comprehensive annotations, consisting of image- and video-level groups and four tasks for real-world digital forgery analysis. The existing forensics methods are benchmarked on ForgeryNet, and the results demonstrate the dataset's ability to boost the development of next-generation forgery analysis algorithms. ForgeryNet offers various advantages over existing datasets, including wild original data captured under diverse conditions, a larger number of forgery approaches, diverse re-rendering processes, and rich annotations for comprehensive tasks. These tasks include image forgery classification, spatial forgery localization, video forgery classification, and temporal forgery localization, providing comprehensive spatio-temporal forgery annotations. Overall, ForgeryNet represents a significant contribution to the field of forgery analysis and provides a valuable resource for the development of advanced forgery detection algorithms.
