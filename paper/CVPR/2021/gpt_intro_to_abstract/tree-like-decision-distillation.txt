Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a popular research topic in deep learning, aiming to create a lightweight student model with the help of a capable but cumbersome teacher model. The success of KD lies in the utilization of the dark knowledge learned by the over-parameterized teacher model, which is used to regularize the learning of a low-capacity student model without sacrificing performance. However, most existing KD methods focus on mimicking shallow behaviors of the teacher, such as soft targets, features, or attentions, without considering the problem-solving process underlying the teacher model. This leaves the student produced by KD as a black box.In this paper, the authors argue that the intrinsic problem-solving process captured by the teacher is crucial for knowledge distillation. By dissecting the decision process in the teacher model, they observe that the decision-making procedure is conducted in a coarse-to-fine manner distributed over multiple layers, rather than solely in the last classification layer. Early layers capture salient visual cues and distinguish visually diverse categories, while later layers handle fine-grained recognition. Based on this observation, the authors propose a new method called Tree-like Decision Distillation (TDD) to imbue the student with the same problem-solving process as the teacher.TDD analyzes the decisions made in different layers of the teacher model and imposes the same decision constraints on the student model. This allows the student to master the same problem-solving solution without the need to explore the solution flow again during training, resulting in faster convergence and higher final accuracy. Moreover, TDD offers better interpretability compared to prior methods as it explores the underlying decision process rather than simply imitating dark knowledge.The main contributions of this paper are threefold: (1) empirical demonstration of the coarse-to-fine decision process in deep networks similar to a decision tree; (2) the proposal of TDD to distill the decision process from teacher to student, relieving the student of the burden of searching in the solution space; and (3) extensive experiments showcasing the competitive accuracy and better interpretability achieved by TDD compared to state-of-the-art methods.
