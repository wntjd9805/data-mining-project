Image semantic segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision, but the pixel-level manual labeling required for the training data is expensive. As a result, semi-supervised segmentation, which utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data, has become an important area of research. Consistency regularization, which ensures the consistency of predictions with various perturbations, has been widely studied for semi-supervised semantic segmentation. Self-training, which incorporates pseudo segmentation maps obtained from the trained model on labeled images, has also been explored. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called cross pseudo supervision for consistency regularization in semi-supervised segmentation. Our approach utilizes network perturbation by feeding labeled and unlabeled images into two segmentation networks with the same structure but different initializations. The outputs of these networks on the labeled data are supervised separately by the ground-truth segmentation map. The key aspect of our approach is enforcing consistency between the two segmentation networks by using the pseudo segmentation maps generated by each network as additional supervision for the other network. This cross pseudo supervision scheme has two main benefits. Firstly, it encourages consistency among predictions from differently initialized networks for the same input image and ensures that the decision boundary lies in low-density regions. Secondly, during the optimization stage, the pseudo segmentation maps become more stable and accurate than those obtained through normal supervised training. This pseudo labeled data effectively expands the training data, improving the quality of segmentation network training. Experimental results on the Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 benchmarks demonstrate that our cross pseudo supervision approach outperforms existing consistency schemes for semi-supervised segmentation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both benchmarks.
