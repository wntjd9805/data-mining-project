Optical flow estimation is a crucial task in computer vision with applications in areas such as video editing, behavior recognition, and object tracking. Traditional methods focused on minimizing energy functions using optimization tools. However, deep learning algorithms have gained popularity, particularly supervised and unsupervised approaches. Supervised methods use labeled or synthetic optical flow as ground truth, achieving impressive results but at the cost of expensive data acquisition. Unsupervised approaches have gained attention as they do not require ground truth labels. In unsupervised methods, the photometric loss between images is commonly used to train the optical flow estimation network. The pyramid network structure is often employed to capture both global and local motions in a coarse-to-fine manner. However, there are two issues with the pyramid learning approach that have been overlooked in previous research. The first issue, called the "bottom-up" problem, refers to the upsampling module in the pyramid network, which often introduces blur artifacts. The second issue, called the "top-down" problem, pertains to the lack of guidance at intermediate pyramid levels, which results in accumulated errors and damages the estimation at finer levels. To address these problems, we propose an enhanced pyramid learning framework for unsupervised optical flow estimation. This framework includes a self-guided upsampling module that generates blur-free optical flow by using a learned interpolation flow. Additionally, we introduce a pyramid distillation loss that provides explicit supervision for learning the intermediate pyramid levels by using the finest output flow as pseudo labels. Our contributions include the self-guided upsampling module, the pyramid distillation loss, and superior performance compared to state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on multiple benchmarks.
