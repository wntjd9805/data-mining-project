Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a crucial task in computer vision, as it involves identifying the interaction between humans and objects in an image. Previous methods for HOI detection can be categorized into two-stage methods and one-stage methods. Two-stage methods detect instances of humans and objects separately and then match them to form pairwise proposals. In contrast, one-stage methods directly detect HOI triplets from the entire image.However, determining which regions of the image to focus on is a challenge for HOI detectors. Two-stage methods often rely on additional features like human pose or language, but they are limited by the accuracy of the detected instances. One-stage methods address this issue by inferring interactions directly from the entire image. These methods can be further divided into anchor-based and point-based approaches. Anchor-based methods predict interactions based on union boxes, while point-based methods predict interaction midpoints.In this paper, we propose a novel approach called Adaptive Set-based one-stage network (AS-Net) to overcome the limitations of previous methods. We reframe interaction detection as a set-based prediction problem, where we define an interaction query set with learnable embeddings and an interaction prediction set. Each embedding in the query set is mapped to an interaction prediction set using a transformer-based interaction decoder. We use a multi-head co-attention module to adaptively aggregate features from global contexts.Our method also introduces adaptive supervision by matching each ground-truth interaction with the most resembling interaction prediction. This allows us to concentrate on the most suitable features for each prediction, free from the location limitations of previous one-stage methods. We evaluate our AS-Net on three datasets and demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods.In summary, our contributions include formulating HOI detection as a set prediction problem to improve accuracy, proposing the AS-Net framework with a transformer encoder-decoder structure, and achieving state-of-the-art performance without the need for additional features.
