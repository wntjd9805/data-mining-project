This paper introduces the concept of Open World Object Detection, which addresses the challenge of detecting and classifying unknown objects in images. Existing object detection approaches assume that all classes to be detected are known during the training phase. However, in real-world scenarios, test images may contain objects from unknown classes. The proposed Open World Object Detection framework aims to identify unknown objects as unknown and incrementally learn to recognize them as new training data becomes available. The paper presents a novel methodology called ORE, which utilizes contrastive clustering, an unknown-aware proposal network, and energy-based unknown identification. The authors also provide a comprehensive experimental setting to evaluate open world characteristics and benchmark ORE against competitive baseline methods. Additionally, the proposed methodology achieves state-of-the-art performance on Incremental Object Detection. The Open World Object Detection setting reflects the natural diversity and dynamic nature of the real world, making it a more practical approach for applications such as robotics, self-driving cars, and surveillance. By confidently identifying unknown objects and incorporating new information, this framework strives to create smarter object detection systems. The paper's contributions include introducing the problem setting, proposing the ORE methodology, presenting an experimental evaluation, and achieving state-of-the-art performance in Incremental Object Detection.
