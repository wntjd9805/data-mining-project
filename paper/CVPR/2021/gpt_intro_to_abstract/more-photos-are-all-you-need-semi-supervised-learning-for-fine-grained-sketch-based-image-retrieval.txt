Abstract: Sketch-based image retrieval (SBIR) has become increasingly popular due to the rise of touch screen devices. Fine-grained SBIR (FG-SBIR) focuses on retrieving specific photos based on query sketches within the same category. Previous FG-SBIR works rely on fully-supervised deep networks, assuming that additional labeled data can easily be obtained. However, the scarcity of sketch-photo pairs hinders the scalability of FG-SBIR datasets. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised FG-SBIR framework that leverages unlabelled photo data to improve performance. We introduce a sequential photo-to-sketch generation model that generates pseudo sketches for unlabelled photos. We also propose a discriminator to measure the reliability of generated pseudo photo-sketch pairs. Additionally, we employ a policy-gradient based reinforcement learning scheme to exchange training signals between the generator and retrieval model. Our approach overcomes data scarcity in FG-SBIR and achieves performances comparable to fully-supervised alternatives with a fraction of the training pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on QMUL-Shoe and QMUL-Chair datasets.
