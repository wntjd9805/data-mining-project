Human pose estimation is a crucial problem in computer vision, aiming to predict the keypoint positions of each person in an image. This task involves both localizing the keypoints and identifying which keypoints belong to the same person. The applications of human pose estimation are extensive, including action recognition, human-computer interaction, smart photo editing, and pedestrian tracking. This research was conducted by Zigang Geng and Ke Sun during their internship at Microsoft Research, Beijing.There are two main paradigms for human pose estimation: top-down and bottom-up. The top-down approach involves detecting the person first and then estimating the pose for each individual. On the other hand, the bottom-up approach directly regresses the positions of the keypoints belonging to the same person or detects and groups the keypoints using techniques like affinity linking and associative embedding. While the top-down paradigm tends to be more accurate, it incurs additional computational cost due to the person detection step. In contrast, the bottom-up paradigm, which is the focus of this paper, is more efficient.Recent advancements in pixel-wise keypoint regression, such as CenterNet, have achieved promising results. However, the regressed keypoints may not be spatially accurate, leading to suboptimal performance compared to keypoint detection and grouping methods. This paper proposes a simple yet effective approach called Disentangled Keypoint Regression (DEKR) to address this issue.DEKR leverages adaptive convolutions through pixel-wise spatial transformers to activate pixels within the keypoint regions, enabling learning of representations that focus on these regions. Furthermore, DEKR introduces a multi-branch structure to decouple the representation learning for each keypoint. Each branch learns a representation specific to a keypoint, enabling accurate regression of its position. Experimental results demonstrate that DEKR significantly improves the localization quality of the regressed keypoint positions.Moreover, DEKR achieves superior performance compared to keypoint detection and grouping methods on benchmark datasets such as COCO and CrowdPose. The proposed direct regression approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art bottom-up pose estimation methods, highlighting its effectiveness in accurately regressing keypoints. The contributions of this work include emphasizing the importance of focusing on keypoint regions for accurate regression, introducing DEKR as a simple yet effective approach to learn disentangled representations, and achieving new state-of-the-art results in bottom-up pose estimation.
