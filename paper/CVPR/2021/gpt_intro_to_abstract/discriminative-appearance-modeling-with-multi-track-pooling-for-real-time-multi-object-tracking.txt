This paper introduces a novel approach to appearance modeling in multi-object tracking, aiming to improve the discriminative power of the appearance model and achieve real-time online performance. The standard approach in multi-object tracking involves building appearance and motion models for each target being tracked. However, the use of sophisticated data association schemes and individual matching of tracks and detections limits real-time performance. The authors propose a new multi-track pooling module that considers all tracked objects during the matching process. This module stores a max-pooled version of the memory from all tracks, allowing the appearance model to utilize online negative examples from other objects. The authors demonstrate that multi-track pooling enhances the discriminative power of the appearance model and improves overall performance. They leverage this improved matching approach to achieve real-time online tracking using a simple, greedy data association method. In addition, the authors incorporate components from recent tracking works, such as the Bilinear LSTM framework and training strategies for handling long tracks. The proposed online tracking framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard tracking benchmarks. Overall, this paper contributes a novel multi-track pooling module, an adapted training strategy, and a real-time online multi-object tracking algorithm.
