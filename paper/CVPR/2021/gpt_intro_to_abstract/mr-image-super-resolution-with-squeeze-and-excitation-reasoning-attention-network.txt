This paper introduces a novel approach for accurate magnetic resonance (MR) image super-resolution (SR) using the squeeze and excitation reasoning attention network (SERAN). While deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise for image SR, they often neglect the characteristics of MR images and suffer from drawbacks such as overfitting, inability to distinguish between target and background regions, and failure to capture global features. In order to address these issues, SERAN utilizes a second-order attention pooling operation to squeeze global spatial information into global descriptors, allowing the model to focus on informative regions and structures in MR images. The model also incorporates primitive relationship reasoning attention to refine the global descriptors and adaptively recalibrate feature responses with learned adaptive attention vectors. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SERAN in achieving accurate MR image SR. The contributions of this work include the introduction of semantic reasoning attention in MR image SR, the collection of global visual primitives from features, and the allocation of these primitives to local features. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that SERAN outperforms other state-of-the-art image SR methods.
