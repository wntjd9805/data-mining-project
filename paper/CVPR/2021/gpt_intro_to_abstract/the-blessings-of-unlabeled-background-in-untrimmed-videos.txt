Temporal action localization is a significant task in computer vision that involves accurately identifying the start and end frames of specific actions in untrimmed videos. While fully-supervised methods require precise annotations for each action instance, weakly-supervised approaches, such as Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WTAL), utilize only video-level annotations, making them particularly useful in scenarios where videos have only user-generated tags.Although WTAL offers advantages in terms of annotation requirements, it generally falls short in performance compared to fully-supervised methods. In Figure 1, we can observe that any WTAL method encounters three main challenges: temporal ambiguity, intra-class variability, and background noise. These factors make it challenging for WTAL methods to accurately localize actions within the videos.In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges in the context of WTAL. We introduce a framework that combines multiple weakly-supervised cues to improve the accuracy of action localization. Specifically, our approach leverages video-level annotations, such as the presence of a specific action, and simultaneously models the spatio-temporal dynamics of the action instances.To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets commonly used for WTAL evaluation. The results demonstrate significant improvements in action localization performance compared to state-of-the-art WTAL methods. Additionally, we analyze the impact of different weakly-supervised cues and provide insights into their contributions.In conclusion, our work contributes to the field of temporal action localization by proposing an effective approach that harnesses multiple weakly-supervised cues to enhance the accuracy of action localization. The experimental results highlight the potential of our method in improving overall performance, bridging the performance gap between weakly-supervised and fully-supervised methods in the context of temporal action localization.
