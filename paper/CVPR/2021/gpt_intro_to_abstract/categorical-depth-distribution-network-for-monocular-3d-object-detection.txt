This paper introduces CaDDN, a monocular 3D object detection method that addresses the challenges of depth information loss and feature smearing in monocular perception. CaDDN leverages probabilistic depth estimation to generate accurate bird's-eye-view (BEV) feature representations. The proposed method makes three contributions: (1) Categorical Depth Distributions, which predict pixel-wise depth probabilities to locate image information in 3D space; (2) End-To-End Depth Reasoning, which jointly optimizes depth estimation and 3D object detection, resulting in improved performance; and (3) BEV Scene Representation, which generates high-quality BEV representations using categorical depth distributions and projective geometry. CaDDN achieves top performance on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark and provides the first reported results on the Waymo Open Dataset.
