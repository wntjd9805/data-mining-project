High-quality rendering of virtual scenes has traditionally been associated with traditional computer graphics. However, promising developments in using neural networks for photo-realistic rendering have emerged. These neural rendering methods have the potential to reduce the amount of human interaction needed for digitizing the real world. Among these methods, 3D neural rendering has garnered significant interest. Unlike convolutional neural network-based methods, these techniques operate in volumetric representations and train fine functions that can be queried in space during volume rendering operations.However, neural volume rendering still faces challenges in terms of development. The two main axes of development are generality, for adapting to a wider range of visual phenomena, and performance, for enhancing efficiency in training and inference. This paper focuses on performance, specifically the inference performance of neural volume rendering models.One of the prominent examples, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), requires multiple multilayer perceptron invocations per pixel, resulting in computationally intensive inference processes. To accelerate inference without sacrificing rendering quality, the paper explores the concept of spatial decomposition. By dividing the scene into multiple areas and employing smaller networks in each area, the authors propose a method to exploit the diminishing returns of neural network capacity.To determine an appropriate decomposition that minimizes random memory access, the paper suggests using Voronoi Diagrams. The convex cells of the Voronoi diagram can be independently rendered and later composited using the Painter's Algorithm to create the final image. The authors formulate a differentiable Voronoi decomposition that can be trained end-to-end to find an optimal cell arrangement. By implementing this decomposition approach, the rendering process becomes up to three times more efficient without any loss in quality or enhances the rendering quality by up to 1.0dB, as measured by Peak Signal to Noise Ratio.The main contributions of this paper include highlighting the diminishing returns of network capacity in NeRF and proposing spatial decompositions to address this issue. The authors demonstrate how Voronoi Diagrams can be learned to optimally represent a scene and how this decomposition enables independent rendering of each part, followed by compositing to create the final image using the Painter's Algorithm. Compared to the NeRF baseline, these modifications result in improved rendering quality for the same computational budget or faster rendering of images with the same visual quality.
