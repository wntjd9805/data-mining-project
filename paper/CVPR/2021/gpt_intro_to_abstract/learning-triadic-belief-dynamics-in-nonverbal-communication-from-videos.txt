This paper introduces the concept of triadic belief dynamics in nonverbal communication and proposes a novel structural mind representation called "five minds." The authors aim to incorporate crucial social cognition components into computer vision to address the task of learning and inferring belief dynamics in natural scenes with rich social interactions. The "five minds" model includes two first-order self mental states, two second-order estimated mental states of each other's mind, and a third-level "common mind." The model is designed to track, maintain, and predict the mental states of all "five minds" using a hierarchical energy-based model with Bayesian inference. The authors collect a new 3D video dataset with eye-tracking devices to facilitate ground-truth labeling and densely annotate nonverbal communication events and belief dynamics. They propose a beam-search-based algorithm to optimize the learning and inference of nonverbal communication events and belief dynamics. The proposed method is demonstrated to be effective in a keyframe-based video summary. This paper provides a benchmark for high-level social learning and addresses challenging problems in the field of computer vision.
