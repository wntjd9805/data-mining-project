Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have garnered attention in graph representation learning, typically embedding graph nodes into Euclidean spaces. However, recent studies have shown that hyperbolic spaces can better capture the hierarchical structure found in many graphs, such as social networks and citation networks. Hyperbolic spaces possess a constant negative curvature and allow for exponential growth of space volume, making them suitable for representing hierarchical data. Existing hyperbolic GCNs rely on tangent spaces for graph convolution in hyperbolic spaces, flattening the manifold and applying Euclidean graph convolutional operations in the tangent space. However, this approach may distort the global structure of the hyperbolic manifold. In this paper, we propose H2H-GCN, a hyperbolic-to-hyperbolic graph convolutional network that directly performs graph convolution on the hyperbolic manifold to preserve the global hyperbolic structure. H2H-GCN consists of a hyperbolic feature transformation and a hyperbolic neighborhood aggregation. The feature transformation applies a linear transformation on the hyperbolic manifold using a block diagonal matrix composed of a scalar 1 and an orthogonal matrix, ensuring that the transformed representations remain on the hyperbolic manifold. The neighborhood aggregation updates node representations using the Einstein midpoint as the weighted message of neighbor nodes. The proposed H2H-GCN avoids the distortion caused by tangent space approximations and preserves the global hyperbolic structure underlying graphs. This is the first hyperbolic GCN that does not rely on tangent spaces. The contributions of this paper include the development of a hyperbolic feature transformation and the presentation of H2H-GCN, which directly performs graph convolution on hyperbolic manifolds, preserving the global hyperbolic structure.
