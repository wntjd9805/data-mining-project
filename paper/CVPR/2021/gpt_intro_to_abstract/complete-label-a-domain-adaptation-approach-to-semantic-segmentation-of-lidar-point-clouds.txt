Semantic segmentation of LiDAR point clouds is a crucial task for various applications like autonomous driving and semantic mapping. However, the performance of deep neural networks in this task is limited due to the scarcity of labeled training data. Although autonomous driving companies have released datasets, each with different LiDAR sensor configurations and scene distributions, leading to poor generalization across datasets. This presents a domain adaptation problem unique to 3D point clouds.To address the domain gap caused by sampling discrepancies, this paper proposes leveraging the underlying geometric structure of LiDAR samples. By transforming the domain adaptation problem into a 3D surface completion task, the authors aim to train networks that can operate on any LiDAR data using labeled data from any other dataset. Surface completion is deemed easier than semantic segmentation due to strong priors on 3D surface shapes encountered in the real world and the possibility of self-supervision or synthetic datasets for training, eliminating the need for manual labels.The network architecture consists of two phases: surface completion using a sparse voxel completion network (SVCN) and semantic labeling using a sparse convolutional U-Net. Extensive experiments on different autonomous vehicle datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. For instance, using a network trained on one dataset to perform semantic segmentation on another dataset yields significant improvements in mean intersection over union (mIoU) compared to state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods.The contributions of this paper are three-fold. Firstly, it identifies the domain gap caused by sampling differences in LiDAR point clouds and proposes complete surface recovery to address this issue. Secondly, it introduces a novel sparse voxel completion network that efficiently processes sparse and incomplete LiDAR data for high-resolution surface completion. Lastly, thorough quantitative evaluations on three datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.
