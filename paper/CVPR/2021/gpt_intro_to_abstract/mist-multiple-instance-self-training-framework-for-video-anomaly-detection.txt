Video anomaly detection (VAD) plays a crucial role in intelligent surveillance systems by localizing anomalous events in videos. However, developing accurate models for anomaly detection remains challenging, particularly for rare and varied anomalous events. Previous works have treated VAD as an unsupervised learning task, relying on distinguishing normal and abnormal events using unsupervised encoding methods. In this paper, we aim to address the weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WS-VAD) problem, which leverages video-level labels to improve the performance of anomaly detection models. Existing WS-VAD methods can be categorized into encoder-agnostic and encoder-based methods. Encoder-agnostic methods utilize task-agnostic features from vanilla feature encoders for anomaly scoring, while encoder-based methods train both the feature encoder and classifier simultaneously. However, these methods do not efficiently train a task-specific feature encoder that provides discriminative representations for surveillance videos. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Multiple Instance Self-Training framework (MIST) that consists of a multiple instance pseudo label generator and a self-guided attention boosted feature encoder. The MIST framework utilizes the MIL framework for more accurate pseudo label generation and introduces a sparse continuous sampling strategy to emphasize the anomalous parts of the videos. Additionally, a self-guided attention module is used in the feature encoder to highlight anomalous regions without external annotation. To optimize the framework, we employ a two-stage self-training scheme, refining the feature encoder using pseudo labels and corresponding anomalous and normal videos. Extensive experiments on two different feature encoders demonstrate the effectiveness of MIST in producing a task-specific feature encoder for WS-VAD. Comparison with other encoder-agnostic methods on two large datasets further validates the superior performance of MIST. Ablation studies and visualized results provide additional insight into the proposed framework. Overall, MIST offers an efficient and effective solution for video anomaly detection in surveillance systems.
