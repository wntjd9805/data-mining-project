Image denoising is an important task in computer vision, aiming to restore clean images from noisy observations. Traditional approaches often make assumptions about the noise distribution and natural image priors, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising results in denoising by learning features from clean and noisy image pairs. However, CNN denoising models struggle with complex real noise and may not be practical for edge equipment like smartphones. In this paper, we propose an invertible denoising network, InvDN, which addresses these challenges by using two latent variables, one encoding noise and high-frequency clean contents and the other encoding only the clean part. InvDN transforms the input image to a downscaled latent representation and trains to preserve the low-resolution clean image while discarding noisy channels. To reconstruct missing information, a new latent variable is sampled from a prior distribution and combined with the low-resolution image for clean image restoration. Our contributions include being the first to design invertible networks for real image denoising and achieving state-of-the-art results on the SIDD test set with fewer parameters and less runtime. Additionally, InvDN can generate new noisy images that are more similar to the original ones. This research opens up possibilities for practical and efficient image denoising methods in real-world scenarios.
