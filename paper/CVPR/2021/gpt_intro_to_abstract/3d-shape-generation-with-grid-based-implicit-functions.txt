This paper focuses on addressing the challenges in training stable 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The traditional approach involves training an autoencoder (AE) to obtain a compressed latent representation, which is then used to train a GAN. However, this approach has limitations in modeling localized variations and constraints in shape generation. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a localized grid-based implicit function representation for shape generation. This representation allows for more flexibility in combining different local parts to create new shapes and enables spatial control in the generation process. The authors also argue that this representation offers higher quality results compared to global implicit functions.Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of existing evaluation techniques for 3D shape generation. To address these limitations, the authors propose a new robust score inspired by statistical analysis.Overall, the paper's key contributions include demonstrating the advantages of localized grid-based implicit functions for 3D shape generation with GANs and proposing a new evaluation technique for assessing the quality of generated shapes.
