3D human pose and mesh reconstruction from a single image is a challenging problem with numerous applications in fields such as virtual reality, sports motion analysis, and neurodegenerative condition diagnosis. Recent work in this area can be categorized into two approaches: those using parametric models and those that do not. Parametric models have shown great success due to their robustness to environment variations but are limited by the constraints of the exemplars used to construct the model. Methods that do not use parametric models either use graph convolutional neural networks or regress vertex coordinates using 1D heatmaps, but they are inefficient in modeling non-local vertex-vertex interactions. This paper proposes a framework called METRO that utilizes a transformer to model global vertex-vertex interactions. The transformer's self-attention mechanism allows it to effectively model dependencies without regard to distance, enabling the discovery of short- and long-range interactions among body joints and mesh vertices. Experimental results demonstrate that METRO outperforms previous methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets. METRO is also a versatile framework that can be applied to other types of 3D mesh reconstruction, such as reconstructing a 3D hand. Overall, this paper introduces METRO as a transformer-based method for 3D human pose and mesh reconstruction and highlights its key contributions and superior performance compared to prior works.
