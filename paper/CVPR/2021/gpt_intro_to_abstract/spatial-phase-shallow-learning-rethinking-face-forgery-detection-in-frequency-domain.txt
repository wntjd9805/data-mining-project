Benefiting from the success of generative techniques like Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), face forgery has become a prominent research topic in recent years. However, these forgery techniques pose serious security and ethical concerns. To mitigate the risks associated with face forgery, various detection methods have been proposed, primarily based on supervised learning with knowledge of face manipulation methods. While these approaches achieve excellent performance on public datasets, there is a need for more general and practical methods. This paper introduces a novel approach that leverages the phase spectrum for forged face detection. Through extensive experiments, the paper demonstrates that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can capture implicit features from the phase spectrum, which are beneficial for accurate forgery detection. The approach also focuses on local texture information, suppressing high-level semantic information. Experimental results show that this approach outperforms existing methods in terms of transferability and achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-dataset evaluations. The contributions of this paper include the utilization of the phase spectrum for forgery detection, experimental validation of the hypothesis concerning high-level semantic information, and achieving superior performance in cross-dataset evaluations.
