Facial expressions are a crucial aspect of non-verbal communication of human emotions, but understanding the relationship between emotions and facial expressions is complex and not fully understood. This paper explores the use of machine learning for emotion modeling, highlighting the advantages of machines in observing diverse emotions compared to individual psychologists with limited observations and personal biases. The paper discusses the current issues in emotion modeling, including the challenges of understanding spontaneous expressions and the limitations of existing emotion models. The necessity of developing a learning algorithm that can learn from imperfect emotion labels is emphasized. The paper proposes a learning algorithm for conditional space in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) specifically tailored for emotion modeling and manipulation. The novel scheme for training conditional GANs aims to search for condition interpretability and enable the generation of a wide range of emotions using categorical emotion labels. The proposed method is demonstrated to be superior to existing methods in terms of qualitative and quantitative measures through experiments on a benchmark dataset. Additionally, the paper introduces an alternative approach using a mixture of Gaussians to represent emotions, which yields a better mixture of emotions in terms of compound emotions.
