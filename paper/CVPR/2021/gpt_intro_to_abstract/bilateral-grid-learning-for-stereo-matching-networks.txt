Stereo matching plays a crucial role in 3D reconstruction and has applications in various fields such as 3D modeling, robotics, augmented reality, and autonomous driving. Despite being studied for over four decades, stereo matching remains challenging due to factors like sensor noise, occlusion, weak textures, and reflective or transparent objects. Recent advancements in deep learning show promise in this field, particularly with 3D convolutions improving the accuracy of disparity estimation networks. However, the computational cost of 3D convolutions limits their real-time application. Bilateral filter, known for edge preservation, has been used in tasks like image denoising, disparity estimation, and depth upsampling but is time-consuming. The bilateral grid technique, introduced by Chen et al., provides a faster implementation of bilateral filtering by splatting pixel values onto grid vertices, blurring them, and ultimately obtaining filtered pixel values through interpolation. This technique has also been utilized in real-time image enhancement networks. Existing stereo matching networks like StereoNet achieve speed by regressing a low-resolution disparity map from a 4D cost volume and then upsample it through bilinear interpolation. However, their accuracy lags behind more complex networks that perform 3D convolutions at higher resolutions. In this paper, we propose a solution that combines high-resolution disparity map regression with efficiency. Our contributions include a novel edge-preserving cost volume upsampling module based on the learned bilateral grid, which allows cost volume aggregations at low resolutions and can be integrated into existing networks. This module significantly accelerates the resulting networks (e.g., GCNet, PSMNet, and GANet) by 4-29 times while maintaining comparable accuracy. Additionally, we design a real-time stereo matching network called BGNet, which outperforms existing real-time deep stereo matching networks, as well as some complex ones, on the KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
