Deep neural network approaches for semantic image segmentation have achieved significant success but rely on large datasets with pixel-level annotations. However, the process of data labeling for semantic segmentation is laborious and expensive, especially in expert-dependent domains such as medical image segmentation. To address the challenge of limited data, unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches have been explored, leveraging annotated images from a simulated source domain and unlabeled images from a real target domain. Adversarial methods dominate the literature on UDA for semantic segmentation, aiming to learn domain-invariant representations through adversarial losses. However, these methods are known to be sensitive to hyperparameters and difficult to train. Alternatively, a new line of work on UDA for semantic segmentation focuses on self-training methods that encourage more confident predictions on the target domain. This paper proposes a consistency training-based framework called PixMatch, which enforces the smoothness of a segmentation model's predictions in the target domain. It introduces a loss term that promotes pixelwise consistency between a target domain image and a perturbed version of the same image. The authors experiment with different perturbation functions inspired by self-supervised learning and domain adaptation techniques. Surprisingly, the baseline model, which utilizes heavy data augmentation as its perturbation function, performs the best. It outperforms previous methods that employed combinations of source, adversarial, and self-training losses on challenging benchmarks.PixMatch offers advantages over existing adversarial approaches, including ease of implementation, stability during training, and lower memory requirements. It introduces only one hyperparameter to control the weighting between the source loss and the target consistency loss. Furthermore, PixMatch can be readily integrated into existing UDA methods and pipelines, and combining it with self-training leads to state-of-the-art results.The main contributions of this paper include the introduction of a novel consistency-based framework for unsupervised domain adaptation in semantic segmentation, the investigation of diverse perturbation functions with data augmentation yielding outstanding performance, extensive ablation studies to understand its efficacy, and the demonstration that combining PixMatch with self-training achieves superior performance on challenging benchmarks.
