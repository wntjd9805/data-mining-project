Hyperspectral imaging systems are widely used in computer vision tasks due to their ability to capture rich spectral information. Conventional systems scan the scene with multiple exposures to obtain 3D hyperspectral images, but this approach is not suitable for dynamic scenes. Snapshot hyperspectral imaging systems, based on compressive sensing theory, have been developed to capture dynamic targets. However, the bottleneck of these systems is the limited quality of reconstructing 3D hyperspectral images from 2D compressive measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network that exploits the tensor low-rank prior of hyperspectral images in the feature domain to improve reconstruction performance. Inspired by canonical-polyadic decomposition theory, our network characterizes the tensor low-rank prior by generating rank-1 tensors with discriminative components and aggregating them into a low-rank tensor as a 3D attention map. We integrate this prior into the half quadratic splitting based optimization algorithm to achieve end-to-end hyperspectral image reconstruction. Experimental results on both synthetic and real data demonstrate the superiority of our method. Overall, our contributions include the proposal of a deep neural network for characterizing the tensor low-rank prior, the use of CP decomposition to characterize the prior, and the integration of the prior into the HQS algorithm for end-to-end reconstruction.
