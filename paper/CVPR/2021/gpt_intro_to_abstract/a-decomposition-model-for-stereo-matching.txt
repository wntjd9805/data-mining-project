Stereo matching is a fundamental task in computer vision that aims to estimate the disparity between two images. It has various applications in fields such as 3D reconstruction, augmented reality, autonomous driving, and robot navigation. Despite years of research, many state-of-the-art methods still suffer from the issues of high computational cost and memory consumption, especially as the resolution of the images increases. This limitation hinders the practical use of stereo matching in scenarios with memory and speed constraints.In this paper, we propose a novel decomposition model for stereo matching to address the problem of excessive growth in computational cost and memory consumption. Our model significantly reduces the growth rate compared to existing methods. Inspired by two observations, we design our model to estimate disparities at different resolutions. First, we observe that it is unnecessary to estimate disparities for all pixels at the highest resolution. By efficiently estimating disparities at a lower resolution and refining them at a higher resolution, the computational cost can be significantly reduced. Second, we observe that the details lost during downsampling are sparse and can be matched sparsely, which results in lower time and memory costs compared to dense matching.Our model runs dense matching at a very low resolution for most regions and uses a series of sparse matching operations at higher resolutions to recover the disparities of lost details. The specific pipeline of our model consists of modules for detail loss detection, sparse matching, disparity upsampling, and disparity fusion. We analyze the complexity of stereo matching in our model and prove that it grows logarithmically instead of cubically as the resolution increases. This provides a significant improvement in computational efficiency.In our experiments, we compare our model with state-of-the-art methods in terms of computational cost and memory consumption. The results demonstrate that our model reduces the growth rate by several orders of magnitude, making it more suitable for practical use. We also compare our model with existing methods on popular datasets, and the results show that our model achieves comparable or even better performance in terms of running time and memory usage.Overall, our proposed decomposition model for stereo matching offers significant improvements in computational efficiency and memory consumption, making it highly suitable for real-world applications with memory and speed constraints.
