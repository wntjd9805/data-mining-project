Methods for 3D reconstruction have been a prominent topic in computer vision, with applications in various fields such as robotics, extended reality, and medicine. The main challenge lies in accurately reconstructing the fine geometry of surfaces based on pixel intensities and incident illumination. This paper focuses on recovering per-pixel surface normals, which involves decoding the incident illumination from its reflectance-modulated pixel intensity. Different surface interactions with light, such as Lambertian surfaces and ideal mirrors, have been studied to understand the relationship between appearance and surface normals. However, real-world scenarios often involve complex illumination patterns and unknown reflectance properties, making the problem ill-posed. Various methods, including photometric stereo and inverse rendering, have been proposed to address this challenge. The authors explore the possibility of leveraging a unique lighting setup in the real world to overcome these issues. They propose using the sky as a convenient lighting source, which has an angular polarization distribution determined by the latitude, longitude, and position of the sun. The Rayleigh sky model predicts the angle and degree of polarization across the sky. By exploiting the polarization cues present in the sky, the authors demonstrate the ability to robustly recover spatially varying reflectance and per-pixel surface normals. The authors conduct experiments using real outdoor images captured with a linear polarizer or a quad-Bayer polarization camera. The results show that their method can accurately reconstruct the fine geometry of objects with complex reflectance properties from a single or a few polarimetric images taken passively. This work has significant implications, particularly with the advancements in polarization cameras, as it enables 3D reconstruction under natural lighting conditions without the need for point matching. Additionally, the proposed method proves to be well-suited for reconstructing specular surfaces, which are typically challenging to address with geometric methods.
