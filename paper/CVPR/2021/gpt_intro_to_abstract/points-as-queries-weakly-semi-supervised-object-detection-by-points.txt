Object detection is a critical task in computer vision, but the cost of annotating large amounts of detection data is significant. To address this issue, weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) and semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) methods have been proposed, which utilize weak annotations such as image labels to reduce annotation costs. However, these methods still underperform compared to supervised counterparts. To bridge this gap, weakly semi-supervised object detection (WSSOD) methods have been studied, where both weakly labeled images and a small number of box-level labeled images are used. In this paper, we introduce a novel setting for WSSOD where instances in the image are annotated by points instead of image-level annotations. This brings richer information and a stronger prior on object location, while maintaining a marginal increase in annotation cost. We propose Point DETR, a new detector that utilizes a single-level feature map and a point encoder to predict object boxes precisely from point annotations. We evaluate our proposed detector on the MS-COCO dataset and show its superiority over other modern detectors in various data settings. Our contributions include the introduction of a new setting for weakly semi-supervised object detection, the analysis of existing detector drawbacks, and the development of Point DETR as a simple and effective solution for object detection using point annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our proposed detector.
