This paper introduces a novel challenge in the field of perceptual organization called perceptual question answering (PQA). The goal of PQA is to generate answers to perceptual questions by solving unseen problems using an agent. To facilitate this research, the authors construct a perceptual question and answer (PQA) dataset that focuses on specific Gestalt principles. Unlike existing datasets that are built around real-world scenarios, this dataset explicitly models each Gestalt principle. Inspired by the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), the authors use color-coded patterns to spell out specific grouping insights in visual questions. Additionally, the PQA dataset can be deterministically generated, allowing for potentially unlimited instances. To train an agent for PQA, the authors propose a model based on a self-attention mechanism, specifically tailored for the grid-to-grid mapping problem. This model is built on the Transformer architecture but incorporates problem-specific extensions such as a context embedding module, positional encoding for 2D grids, and a tailored decoder. The authors demonstrate that their proposed model outperforms baseline models for PQA, although it requires significantly more data to learn than an average human. Overall, this paper contributes to the study of perceptual organization by introducing the PQA challenge, providing a specific dataset for PQA, formulating perceptual organization through a self-attention mechanism, and proposing a grid-to-grid mapping network for generating answer grids.
