This paper addresses the challenge of imaging through scattering media, such as fog or snow, which can significantly reduce the perceptible quality of images and impact computer vision tasks like object detection. Adverse weather conditions that involve severe scattering are often underrepresented in training datasets, despite being a significant contributing factor to fatal automotive accidents. Traditional supervised imaging and vision approaches are limited in adverse weather conditions due to the scarcity of data and the difficulty of acquiring clear images in real-world automotive scenes. Existing approaches attempt to solve this problem by using simulated scattering media or unsupervised learning, but these methods have their limitations.In this paper, we propose a novel domain transfer method called ZeroScatter, which converts RGB images corrupted by adverse weather effects into clear day scenes. ZeroScatter exploits various training signals to achieve robust descattering performance. Firstly, a synthetic weather model is employed using cycle consistency training. Secondly, temporal and multi-view consistency are utilized to eliminate spurious adverse weather effects. Thirdly, multi-modal supervision is utilized using auxiliary data acquired by gated imagers, which provides higher contrast training signal for ZeroScatter. These training cues enable ZeroScatter to reliably reconstruct RGB captures corrupted by adverse weather.The proposed method is evaluated quantitatively on scenes with synthetically generated and laboratory generated adverse weather. The evaluation demonstrates a 2.8 dB PSNR improvement over state-of-the-art methods. The contributions of this paper include the proposal of ZeroScatter, a novel domain adaptation method for eliminating scattering media from RGB captures, the incorporation of synthetic and real-world data to train ZeroScatter with unpaired, biased datasets, and the qualitative and quantitative improvements achieved in harsh weather conditions.Overall, ZeroScatter offers a promising solution for addressing the challenges of imaging through scattering media, particularly in adverse weather conditions. Its ability to reconstruct clear day scenes from corrupted RGB captures has the potential to enhance computer vision tasks, such as object detection, in real-world automotive scenarios.
