Bundle adjustment is a fundamental problem in the field of 3D vision, involving the reconstruction of camera poses and the 3D scene structure from image measurements. It is a key component in various applications such as structure from motion, visual odometry, and simultaneous localization and mapping. Over the past two decades, significant research efforts have been dedicated to addressing this problem, resulting in significant progress.The main objective of bundle adjustment is to obtain optimal camera poses and structure by minimizing the errors in image reprojection. This is a nonlinear optimization problem that requires a good initialization to converge to the statistically optimal solution. A common strategy involves estimating pairwise motions, global rotations through rotation averaging, global translations, and triangulating the points.In the pipeline of bundle adjustment, it is crucial to have an accurate initial guess of the rotations, as subsequent steps heavily depend on it. Previous approaches have focused on improving rotation averaging methods or the input relative pairwise motion estimates. However, these approaches have limitations, such as being limited to two views only for relative pose estimation or not leveraging image measurements directly for rotation averaging.In this paper, we propose a novel method called rotation-only bundle adjustment. Building upon a previous method for optimizing rotation between two views, we extend it to handle multiple views. Our method decouples rotation estimation from translation and structure estimation, providing various advantages. These include simplifying the optimization problem by estimating rotations without requiring knowledge of translations and structure, immunity to inaccurate estimation of translations and structure, treatment of both pure and non-pure rotations in a unified manner, and improvement of rotation estimates after rotation averaging.The paper is organized as follows: we review related work and preliminaries, discuss the two-view rotation-only method, describe our proposed method, present experimental results, and provide discussions and conclusions. The paper also includes a comparison of our method with related approaches. To our knowledge, we are the first to propose a multiview rotation-only optimization method using image measurements as direct input. Our method is applicable to both pure and non-pure rotations and can be accessed along with supplementary materials through our provided link.
