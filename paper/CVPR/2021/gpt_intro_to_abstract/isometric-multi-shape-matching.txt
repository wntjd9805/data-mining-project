Correspondence problems in computer science have numerous applications, such as 3D reconstruction, object tracking, shape analysis, and data canonicalization. One commonly studied problem is the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), which is NP-hard and difficult to solve. However, when considering 3D shape matching, structural properties of the shapes can be exploited to find global optima. Modelling the low-dimensional structure and learning suitable feature representations can significantly improve matching performance. Shape matching, specifically identifying correspondences between 3D shapes, is a longstanding challenge in visual computing. Spectral approaches leveraging isometries between shapes have been effective for shape matching. While isometric shape matching for a pair of shapes has been extensively studied, the problem of isometric multi-shape matching, where a collection of shapes is to be matched, is less explored. Using pairwise shape matching methods for matching shape collections can introduce bias or incoherence. Permutation synchronization methods can address this issue, but they are a two-stage procedure and may yield suboptimal results for isometric multi-shape matching. Existing methods do not fully exploit the isometry property for this problem. This work introduces a generalization of state-of-the-art isometric two-shape matching approaches for isometric multi-shape matching. The proposed optimization formulation achieves improved results compared to previous methods and guarantees cycle-consistency without explicit constraints. The algorithm is efficient, easy to implement, and has provable convergence. Experimental results demonstrate improvements on various shape matching benchmarks.
