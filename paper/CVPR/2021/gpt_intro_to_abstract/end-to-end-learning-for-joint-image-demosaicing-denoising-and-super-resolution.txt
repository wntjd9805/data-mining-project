Image demosaicing, denoising, and super-resolution are important image restoration problems in computer vision. Deep learning-based methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance in these tasks. However, existing solutions often introduce artifacts or accumulate errors when applied sequentially. Joint solutions for these problems have been proposed in the literature, but the specific combination of demosaicing, denoising, and super-resolution has received less attention. This paper comprehensively studies various joint solutions for this combined problem. The authors propose an end-to-end network called JDN DM SR+ based on residual channel attention blocks, which achieves superior results compared to other solutions. The network can be customized to perform demosaicing, denoising, and super-resolution individually by adjusting parameters. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, surpassing both other joint solutions and the state-of-the-art. Overall, this paper contributes to the field of image restoration by providing a unified and optimized approach for the combined problem of demosaicing, denoising, and super-resolution.
