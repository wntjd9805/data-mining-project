In this paper, we introduce the concept of temporal grounding, which aims to localize temporal boundaries in untrimmed videos using language queries. We identify two types of uncertainty in this task: query uncertainty stemming from different expressions for the same event, and label uncertainty representing subjective boundaries for the same event. We argue that single-annotation, single-prediction approaches are not sufficient in the presence of uncertainty, and propose a novel DeNet (Decoupling and De-bias) framework to address this challenge. The DeNet framework leverages linguistic knowledge to decouple queries into relation features and modified features, where the former captures discriminative and consistent information, while the latter preserves personalized information. To generate diverse predictions, we employ a de-bias mechanism that includes sampling, multiple choice learning, and clustering. We train DeNet using a min-loss from multiple choice learning to optimize for diverse predictions. In the inference stage, multiple predictions are clustered to form a diverse yet plausible prediction set. We evaluate DeNet on two popular datasets, Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions, using standard and new multi-label metrics. Our contributions include the unified modeling of query and label uncertainty in DeNet, the decoupling module for language encoding, the de-bias mechanism for temporal regression, and the development of new multi-label metrics. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of DeNet in modeling human diversity in real scenarios.
