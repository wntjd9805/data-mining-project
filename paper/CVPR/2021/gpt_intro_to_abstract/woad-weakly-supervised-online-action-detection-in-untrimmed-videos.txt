Temporal Action Localization aims to detect temporal action boundaries in long, untrimmed videos. This paper addresses the challenge of real-time action detection without access to future information, focusing on online per-frame action recognition and online detection of action start. Previous methods rely on segment-level annotations, which require high human labeling cost, while this paper proposes a method that can be trained with video-level annotations, making it more flexible and scalable. The proposed Weakly supervised Online Action Detection (WOAD) framework consists of two jointly-trained modules: Temporal Proposal Generator (TPG) and Online Action Recognizer (OAR). TPG mines class-wise temporal action proposals using video-class labels as supervision, which generates pseudo per-frame labels for OAR. OAR performs per-frame action recognition and start detection in an online fashion. This framework allows the use of weak supervision, which is challenging in online scenarios. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in online per-frame action recognition and online detection of action start tasks, outperforming weakly-supervised baselines and comparable to strongly-supervised methods.
