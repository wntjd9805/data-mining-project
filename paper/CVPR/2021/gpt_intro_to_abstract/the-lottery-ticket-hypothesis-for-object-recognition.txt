This paper explores the application of the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) to object detection, instance segmentation, and keypoint detection tasks in visual recognition. The LTH states that over-parameterized neural networks contain sparse sub-networks that can match or even exceed the performance of the original network. The paper extends the analysis of LTH to these fundamental visual recognition tasks and investigates the transferability of sub-networks within the ConvNet backbone, the training of sparser and more accurate sub-networks, and the behavior of these sub-networks compared to dense networks. The experiments use ImageNet pre-trained ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 backbones, Faster R-CNN and Mask R-CNN modules, and datasets such as Pascal VOC and COCO. The results show that tickets obtained from ImageNet training do not transfer to object recognition in the case of COCO, but can be found with up to 40% sparsity for smaller datasets like Pascal VOC. Task-specific tickets with up to 80% sparsity can be found through direct pruning. The paper also explores the effectiveness of various pruning methods and analyzes the behavior of tickets with respect to task attributes.
