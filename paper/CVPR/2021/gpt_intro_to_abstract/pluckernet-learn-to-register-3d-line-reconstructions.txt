This paper addresses the problem of aligning partially-overlapped 3D line reconstructions in Euclidean space. Traditional methods struggle with this task due to the difficulty of finding line matches based solely on 3D line coordinates. In this study, a learning-based approach called Pl¨uckerNet is proposed, which utilizes deep neural networks to effectively estimate the relative pose between two line reconstructions. The Pl¨uckerNet model parameterizes 3D lines using a deterministic 6-dimensional Pl¨ucker representation, which combines a 3-dimensional direction vector and a 3-dimensional moment vector. Local features are extracted for each line, and a global high-dimensional line feature is obtained by combining them. A graph neural network with attention mechanism is used to make line-wise features discriminative for matching. The matching process involves estimating the line correspondences using a global feature matching module based on optimal transport. Once the line matches are found, a 2-line minimal pose solver is employed to calculate the relative pose in Euclidean space. The solver is integrated within a RANSAC framework to distinguish inliers from outliers. The proposed Pl¨uckerNet is a trained end-to-end network that demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in aligning 3D line reconstructions. Two baseline methods for 3D line registration are also introduced and evaluated on benchmark datasets, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
