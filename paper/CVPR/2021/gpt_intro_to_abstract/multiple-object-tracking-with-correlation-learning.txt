Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is crucial in computer vision, with applications in video surveillance and autonomous driving. Traditionally, MOT has employed the tracking-by-detection paradigm, which separates detection and data association tasks. However, this paradigm has limitations in handling similar distractors and frequent occlusions. To address these challenges, there is a growing interest in extending end-to-end trainable detection frameworks to jointly learn detection and appearance features. Existing methods, however, struggle to distinguish similar objects effectively. In this paper, we propose a correlation network that learns the topological information of objects and context. Our approach utilizes a spatial correlation layer to capture the relationship between targets and their relative spatial positions. We construct a local correlation volume to minimize computational complexity while achieving real-time MOT. Additionally, our correlation learning is not limited to specific target categories. Overall, our approach improves upon existing methods by leveraging contextual information and tackling the limitations of traditional MOT approaches.
