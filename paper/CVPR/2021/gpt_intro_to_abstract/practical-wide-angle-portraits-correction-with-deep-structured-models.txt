In this paper, we address the problem of perspective distortion correction in wide-angle portrait photography. While previous methods have focused on undistorting the entire image, they often result in unnatural distortions in the faces. To overcome this limitation, we propose a deep structured network that generates a content-aware warping flow field, which simultaneously corrects the perspective effects in the background and adapts to the stereographic projection on the faces. Our network consists of a Line Correction Network (LineNet) for background lines correction and a Portrait Correction Network (ShapeNet) for face correction. We also introduce a Transition Module (TM) to ensure smooth transitions between the two corrections. To train our network, we create a high-quality wide-angle portrait dataset and design two novel metrics to quantitatively evaluate the line straightness and face correctness. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms previous calibration-based methods in terms of face fidelity and achieves smooth transitions between background and face regions. Our contributions include the new perspective portrait dataset and the proposed network architecture for distortion correction in wide-angle portraits.
