This paper investigates the role of shape information in few-shot object categorization. While recent approaches to object recognition have focused on learning features directly from images, studies suggest that shape cues play a significant role in human categorization. The goal of this paper is to explore the utility of shape information in low-shot categorization by incorporating a shape bias into state-of-the-art approaches. The authors leverage datasets of 3D object models combined with images to construct their experiments. Additionally, they introduce a new 3D object dataset, Toys4K, specifically designed for testing low-shot categorization. The paper presents two sets of investigations: comparing the effectiveness of purely image-based and purely shape-based approaches, and developing a novel approach that incorporates an explicit shape bias into an image embedding representation. The results demonstrate that shape-based few-shot learning outperforms image-based approaches and establish an empirical upper bound on the effectiveness of a shape bias. The paper contributes a new approach to incorporating shape bias, evidence that shape information improves generalization accuracy in low-shot classification, and a new dataset for low-shot learning.
