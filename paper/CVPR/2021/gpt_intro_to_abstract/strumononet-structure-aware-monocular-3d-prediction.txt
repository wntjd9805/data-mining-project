Monocular 3D prediction is a challenging problem in 3D vision, and recent approaches have shown promise by applying deep learning techniques. This paper focuses on exploring the interconnections between predictions of local geometric elements and predictions of middle-level planar structures in 3D scenes. The goal is to develop suitable geometric representations for plane detection and extract rich relations among planes to enhance depth, normal, and plane equation predictions. To address this, the authors introduce StruMonoNet, a network that takes a single RGB image as input and outputs joint predictions of depth, normal, and planar structure. Unlike previous approaches, StruMonoNet utilizes an intermediate representation that combines surfels and dense visual features. This allows for a simple clustering module for plane detection, guided by visual features. The network also incorporates depth/normal labels for plane detection through predicted surfels. StruMonoNet goes beyond individual plane detection and enforces geometric relations between planes, such as adjacency, perpendicularity, and parallelism. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of individual plane predictions. Additionally, the network introduces a novel plane synchronization module that automatically detects and enforces these relations to enhance the predicted planes' accuracy. The authors leverage the observation that deep learning approaches typically have large variance and small bias in depth and normal predictions. StruMonoNet tackles this by rectifying prediction errors through suitable averaging operations, specifically among detected planar regions. This rectified information then propagates to non-planar regions, utilizing the adjacency, perpendicular, and parallel planes to incorporate more pixels for rectification. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets for monocular depth prediction and achieves considerable improvements in normal prediction and plane detection. The contributions of this paper include a hybrid representation for joint predictions, a synchronization module for geometric relations, and state-of-the-art results on multiple tasks.
