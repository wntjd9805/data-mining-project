Creating a dataset for object detection is more complex than for classification. Object detection involves identifying multiple objects with different class labels within a single image, requiring the pairing of class labels and bounding box information for each object. The time and resources required to label each object and create these datasets are significant. In response, methods for learning with weakly labeled or unlabeled data have been explored as alternatives to learning with labeled data only. Object detection methods can be categorized into weakly-supervised, semi-supervised, and weakly-semi-supervised learning approaches. Weakly-supervised learning trains models with data that has class information but no location information, while weakly-semi-supervised learning uses both weakly labeled data and labeled data. Semi-supervised object detection incorporates both labeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we focus on semi-supervised object detection and propose a new method called Interpolation-based Semi-supervised learning for object Detection (ISD). The ISD method utilizes interpolation regularization (IR) to mix different images and learn to predict combined labels. However, applying IR directly to object detection is challenging due to the diverse and irregular nature of the background class. To address this issue, we divide mixed images into two types (Type-I and Type-II) based on the presence of the background image and apply different IR algorithms for each type. The proposed ISD method can be combined with conventional semi-supervised learning methods to improve detection performance and can also enhance performance in the supervised learning framework. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its significant performance improvement over existing algorithms for semi-supervised object detection.
