In recent years, deep learning has led to remarkable advancements in single image de-raining and other low-level vision tasks. However, existing CNN-based methods for rain removal suffer from catastrophic forgetting, limiting their applicability in real dynamic situations. This problem arises as deep neural networks tend to forget previous knowledge when trained on new tasks, leading to a degradation in performance on previously learned tasks. This issue prevents these methods from adapting to different types of rain streaks, as they can only learn fixed mapping rules between paired rainy and clean images on a single dataset. The approach of sharing network structure but independently updating and storing network parameters on each dataset is not suitable for compact system designs, as it increases training time and parameter space. This paper aims to address the catastrophic forgetting problem in rain removal and proposes a continual learning scheme to handle different types of rain streaks with a single model. The authors introduce a parameter importance guided weights modification approach (PIGWM) to overcome catastrophic forgetting specifically for image de-raining. This approach can potentially be extended to other computer vision tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on different rain streak benchmarks validate the superior performance of the proposed method. This paper presents the first attempt to solve the catastrophic forgetting problem in rain removal tasks and provides an effective solution for maintaining performance on previous tasks while achieving superior results on new datasets.
