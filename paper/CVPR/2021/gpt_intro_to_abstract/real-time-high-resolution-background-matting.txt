The introduction is a crucial part of any computer science paper as it sets the stage for the research presented. This section typically provides an overview of the problem being addressed, the objectives of the study, and the significance of the research.In this paper, we focus on the development of an answer format that outputs only the introduction. This may seem like a trivial task, but it has potential applications in various domains, such as summarization and information retrieval systems. By providing a concise and coherent introduction, these systems can quickly provide users with an overview of a document without having to go through the entire text.To achieve this, we propose a novel approach that combines natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms. Our methodology involves training a model on a large corpus of documents with their corresponding introductions. The model learns the patterns and structures of introductions and is then able to generate coherent summaries that contain the essential information.We evaluate the effectiveness of our answer format by conducting experiments on a diverse set of documents. We compare the generated summaries with human-written introductions and assess the quality using various metrics, such as ROUGE and BLEU. Additionally, we analyze the generated summaries to identify any potential bias or limitations in the model's output.The results of our experiments show that our proposed answer format successfully generates introductions that are comparable in quality to human-written ones. Moreover, the generated summaries exhibit a good level of coherence and capture the main ideas of the documents effectively. However, we also discuss some of the limitations and areas for improvement in our approach.In conclusion, our work presents a novel approach to developing an answer format that outputs only the introduction. We demonstrate the potential applications of this format in summarization and information retrieval systems. Our experiments show promising results, indicating the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Further research is needed to address the identified limitations and to explore the broader impact of this answer format in the field of computer science.
