Automated generation of high-quality residential house models and other man-made structures has the potential to greatly impact various disciplines such as construction, manufacturing, urban planning, and visual effects. With the advancement of deep learning, there has been significant progress in generating CAD-style 3D models. Early methods focused on generating geometry without considering their incident relationships. This paper introduces a novel approach, called Roof-GAN, which builds upon existing methods by utilizing adversarial training, convolution with raster-geometry representation, and a differentiable vectorization module. The proposed generative adversarial network generates a structured geometry model as a graph, representing primitive geometry information and incident relationships. Roof-GAN employs two discriminators to assess the overall geometry composition and the relationship labels in conjunction with the geometry. The effectiveness of Roof-GAN is demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative evaluations against the state-of-the-art methods. A new database of CAD-style roof geometry with incident relationships is also created as part of the evaluation process. The results showcase the ability of Roof-GAN to generate diverse and realistic roof models, as measured by a novel metric proposed in the paper.
