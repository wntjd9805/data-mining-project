Super-Resolution (SR) methods have become increasingly important in various industries such as healthcare, agriculture, defense, and film. These methods aim to enhance the spatial resolution and level of detail in digital images while preserving their content. Deep learning techniques have been widely adopted in recent years to improve SR methods. However, when dealing with sensors that capture modalities other than visible light, such as Infrared (IR), the lower resolution of the output images presents a significant challenge. Cross-Modality SR methods have been developed to address this issue by using higher-resolution RGB images to guide the super-resolution process for lower resolution sensor images. The main goal is to maintain fidelity to the target modality while avoiding the introduction of redundant artifacts or textures from the RGB modality.In this work, we propose an internal learning approach that relies solely on the input pair of images, eliminating the need for a modality-specific dataset. This allows the network to adapt to the unique properties and characteristics of each specific input pair. Unlike previous methods that rely on perfectly aligned images, our approach allows for moderate misalignment, termed weak alignment. Our network includes a deformation model that aligns details from the RGB image to the target modality in a coarse-to-fine manner before fusion. The deformation parameters are optimized to adhere to the super-resolution goal without explicit supervision.We provide visual examples that demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in cases of weak alignment and cross-modality ambiguity. Our method also avoids over-transferal of information, which often leads to the addition of artifacts and textures in the lower resolution modality. Additionally, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on various modalities (Thermal, NIR, Depth) without the need for pre-training or external training data. This makes it a versatile and effective solution for super-resolution in any modality.
