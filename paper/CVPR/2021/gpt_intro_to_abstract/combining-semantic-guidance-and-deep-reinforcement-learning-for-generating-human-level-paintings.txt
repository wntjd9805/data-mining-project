Painting is a fundamental form of human expression, requiring skill and creativity. Teaching machines to paint has important applications in computer graphics and artificial intelligence. Current research focuses on using reinforcement learning to model the painting process as a Markov Decision Process. However, existing methods face challenges in handling multiple instances in an image, variation in object position and scale, and attention to distinguishing features. In this paper, we propose a semantic guidance pipeline that addresses these challenges. We incorporate semantic segmentation into the painting process to differentiate stroke patterns for foreground and background regions. We also introduce a neural alignment model to handle variation in object position and scale. Furthermore, we propose a guided backpropagation-based focus reward to emphasize distinguishing features. Our contributions include a semantically guided painting process, a neural alignment model, and expert guidance on distinguishing features.
