The photoacoustic (PA) effect, discovered in 1880, allows materials to emit acoustic signals under light irradiation. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) has emerged as a 3D imaging technology that combines light and ultrasound to form images, providing the advantages of both optical imaging and ultrasonic imaging. With the development of wavelength-tunable lasers, hyperspectral photoacoustic (HSPA) imaging techniques have been developed, allowing for the analysis of material properties and interior structure. However, the practical use of HSPA is limited by long acquisition times and low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). In this paper, we propose a method to restore full-grid, noise-free 4D HSPA data from incomplete and noisy observations. We conduct a reliability analysis for different depths and spectrum wavelengths and formulate the restoration task as an optimization problem. By exploring data correlations and developing a numerical algorithm, we are able to reconstruct clear and high-quality data. Our contributions include considering the variance of PA data reliability, proposing an integral framework for 4D data restoration, and addressing the limitations of previous studies by focusing on 4D HSPA.
