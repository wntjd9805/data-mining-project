Monocular face reconstruction, which involves the dense reconstruction of 3D face geometry, reﬂectance, and illumination, has numerous applications in various fields such as visual effects, telepresence, and virtual environments. While there has been significant progress in reconstructing both the geometry and reﬂectance of the face, this research primarily focuses on capturing the face reﬂectance, which plays a crucial role in perception. Existing methods often approximate faces as a Lamber-tian surface, using analysis-by-synthesis optimization to estimate face geometry, spherical harmonics lighting, and diffuse face reﬂectance. However, these methods fail to accurately capture specularities, sub-surface effects, and higher-order view-dependent effects in face reﬂectance, resulting in limited photorealism. Other approaches use machine learning techniques to reconstruct diffuse and specular face albedos but still overlook important components of reﬂectance. In this paper, we present a novel monocular face reconstruction algorithm that estimates a full face reﬂectance ﬁeld, including both view direction- and light direction-dependent re-ﬂectance properties, from a single face image. Our method utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that infers the face reﬂectance ﬁeld and represents it as a basis set of images in a normalized space, parameterized by light direction, view direction, and face geometry. Unlike previous image-based techniques, our method captures both light-dependent and view-dependent effects, allowing for the manipulation of light source and viewpoint in the reconstructed image. The algorithm also jointly estimates the 3D face geometry from the monocular image, improving generalization outside of the training data space. Our method is trained on a light-stage dataset and demonstrates the ability to generalize to real images with various facial expressions. In conclusion, our contributions include a monocular method for estimating neural face reﬂectance ﬁelds and the ability to generalize to in-the-wild images, obtained through training in a canonical space invariant to head pose, identity, and expressions.
