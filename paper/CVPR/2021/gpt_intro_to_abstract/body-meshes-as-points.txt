3D human body mesh recovery is a challenging task that aims to reconstruct the 3D full-body mesh of a person from images or videos. It has been widely applied in various fields such as action recognition, virtual try-on, and motion retargeting. While there has been notable progress in single-person based full-body mesh recovery, attention has shifted towards estimating body meshes for multiple persons from a single image.Existing methods for multi-person mesh recovery typically employ two-stage solutions, which can be computationally inefficient. In this paper, we propose a single-stage solution that integrates both person localization and mesh recovery within a single model architecture. Our approach represents each person instance as a point in the spatial-depth space, where each point is associated with a body mesh. This representation allows for parallelism in localization and mesh recovery.Our model consists of two parallel branches, one for instance localization and the other for body mesh recovery. In the localization branch, we model each person instance as a single point in a 3-dimensional space, combining spatial and depth information. The body mesh branch utilizes the SMPL parametric model to represent the body meshes. By discretizing spatial and depth information, we convert the multi-person mesh recovery into a single-shot regression problem.To address challenges in real-world scenarios such as coherent reconstruction and occlusion, we propose using ordinal relations among persons and a keypoint-aware occlusion augmentation strategy. The ordinal relations are used to supervise the model and ensure correct depth ordering, while the keypoint-aware occlusion strategy improves model robustness to occluded instances.Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model. We achieve high performance on various 3D pose benchmarks and outperform existing methods on Panoptic and MuPoTS-3D datasets. Our contributions include introducing a single-stage solution to multi-person mesh recovery, designing a novel model architecture, proposing inter-instance ordinal relation supervision, and a keypoint-aware occlusion augmentation strategy.
