This paper addresses the problem of recognizing partially occluded objects in images using deep neural networks. Previous studies have shown that deep networks are less robust in recognizing occluded objects compared to humans. The challenges arise from the variability of object ordering and positioning, as well as the presence of known and unknown object classes in scenes.To tackle this problem, the authors propose a deep network for multi-object instance segmentation that is robust to occlusion and can be trained using bounding box supervision. This network builds upon the concept of compositional deep networks (CompositionalNets) but extends it to handle multiple mutually occluding objects in an image. The authors introduce an Occlusion Reasoning Module (ORM) that takes independent predictions of object labels, instance segmentation, and occluder segmentation as input. The ORM uses an occlusion voting mechanism to obtain corrected predictions by considering the occlusion order of overlapping bounding boxes based on classification scores.The authors conduct extensive experiments using the KITTI IN-Stance dataset (KINS) and a synthetic dataset generated by superimposing segmented objects from KITTI. These experiments highlight the benefits of reasoning about multi-object occlusion in improving the robustness and accuracy of deep networks. The proposed deep network achieves state-of-the-art performance in instance segmentation under occlusion on the KINS dataset.In summary, this paper makes several contributions: 1) the introduction of a deep network for robust multi-object instance segmentation under occlusion, trained with bounding box supervision; 2) the development of an Occlusion Reasoning Module that efficiently handles multiple objects and corrects erroneous predictions through occlusion reasoning; 3) the achievement of state-of-the-art performance on the KINS dataset; and 4) the introduction of an occlusion challenge dataset and a taxonomy of occlusion scenarios to advance computer vision research in this area.
