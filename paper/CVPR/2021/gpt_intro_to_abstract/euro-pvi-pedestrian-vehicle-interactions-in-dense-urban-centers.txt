This paper addresses the challenge of anticipating the motion of traffic participants in dense urban environments for the success of self-driving vehicles. The complexity of interactions between different agents, such as pedestrians and vehicles, adds significant complexity to the distribution of likely future trajectories. Existing trajectory prediction datasets primarily focus on vehicle-vehicle interactions and do not adequately represent dense urban environments with prominent interactions between pedestrians and vehicles. To address these limitations, the European Pedestrian Vehicle Interaction (Euro-PVI) dataset is proposed, which contains rich and diverse interactions between ego-vehicles and pedestrians or cyclists in dense urban environments in Belgium. Additionally, a latent variable deep generative model called Joint-β-Conditional Variational Autoencoder (Joint-β-cVAE) is developed to better capture the effect of interactions and accurately represent the multi-modal distribution of future trajectories. The contributions of this work include the Euro-PVI dataset, the demonstration of a performance gap between methods that model vehicle-pedestrian interaction and those that do not, the development of Joint-β-cVAE, and demonstration of state-of-the-art performance on trajectory prediction.
