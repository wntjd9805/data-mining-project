Generating manga from illustrations is a task that is in high demand due to the expansion of the manga market and the scarcity of manga artists. Training artists to master the unique manga workflow can be financially expensive and time-consuming. To reduce these costs and speed up production, many manga companies have started using techniques that generate manga from generic art forms like illustrations and digital paintings. This paper introduces a deep learning approach that mimics the manga creation workflow, generating manga images with a similar appearance to those created manually by artists. The framework estimates a line drawing map, segments the image into screentone classes, pastes regular screentone sheets, and synthesizes irregular screen textures. The resulting components can be used independently by artists or composed into manga outputs. A large-scale dataset of image and annotation pairs is created to train a hierarchical neural network, and experiments show that the framework produces high-quality manga images and is preferred by artists compared to other alternatives. This work contributes to the generation of manga from illustrations by mimicking the professional manga creation workflow and provides a dataset to assist related applications.
