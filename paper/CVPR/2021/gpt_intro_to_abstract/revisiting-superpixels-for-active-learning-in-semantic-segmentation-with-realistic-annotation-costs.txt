In recent years, deep learning has achieved remarkable success in computer vision tasks, particularly in the field of semantic image segmentation. However, the annotation cost for labeling large annotated training data sets can be prohibitively expensive. Active learning (AL) offers a solution to this problem by selecting the most informative samples for labeling. Previous AL methods for semantic image segmentation can be classified into image-based and region-based methods. Region-based AL has been shown to outperform image-based AL due to increased data variability. An important consideration in region-based AL is the cost of annotating a sample, which is typically measured in terms of labeled pixels. However, this measurement does not reflect the polygon-based annotation process used in practice. Click-based annotation costs, which consider the number of polygon and intersection clicks required, provide a more accurate reflection of true annotation costs. This consideration motivates the use of superpixels, which are irregularly-shaped regions that preserve natural object boundaries well, in region-based AL. Superpixels require fewer clicks for annotation compared to regularly-shaped regions. However, the advantage of using superpixels for region-based AL remains unclear. Previous work suggests that the advantage is marginal, possibly due to using pixel-based annotation costs for evaluation. Additionally, comparisons between superpixel-based and rectangle-based methods have not been performed. In this paper, we address these gaps by revisiting the use of superpixels for region-based AL and analyzing the effect of region shape and size on annotation costs. Our contributions include demonstrating the effectiveness of the superpixel-based approach over the traditional "rectangle+polygon" based approach, showing that the former outperforms for a wide range of region sizes, and proposing a class-balanced acquisition function to further improve the performance of the superpixel-based approach.
