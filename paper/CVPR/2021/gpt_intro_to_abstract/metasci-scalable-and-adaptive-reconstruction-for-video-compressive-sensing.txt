High-speed video imaging systems face challenges in capturing and storing high-dimensional (HD) data due to high memory, bandwidth, and power demands. Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) has gained attention as a low-cost solution inspired by compressive sensing techniques. The video SCI system consists of an optical hardware encoder and a software decoder. The encoder modulates the HD data using dynamic masks and compresses multiple high-speed frames into a two-dimensional snapshot measurement. The decoder aims to reconstruct the high-speed video frames using advanced algorithms. This paper focuses on video SCI reconstruction and proposes a fast adaptive decoder called MetaSCI, motivated by meta learning. MetaSCI is flexible to different systems and can scale to large data. The desired properties of the decoder include high fidelity and fast recovery. However, existing SCI reconstruction networks lack fast adaptation and are not flexible to changes in the physical masks. Therefore, the paper introduces MetaSCI as a solution to these challenges. It discusses the problem of fast adaptation in video SCI applications and proposes a multi-encoding-system training regime to build MetaSCI. The network consists of a shared backbone for different systems and light-weight meta-modulation parameters that can adapt to individual systems. A hybrid learning algorithm is developed to train the network using gradient descent for the shared backbone and meta updates for meta parameters. MetaSCI achieves competitive performance and fast adaptation on small-scale video benchmarks and is the first deep model to perform real-time large-scale video reconstruction.
