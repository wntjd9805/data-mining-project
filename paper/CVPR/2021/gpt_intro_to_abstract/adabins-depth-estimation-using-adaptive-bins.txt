This paper addresses the problem of estimating a high-quality dense depth map from a single RGB input image. The authors propose a new architecture called AdaBins, which aims to perform global analysis of the output values in order to improve depth estimation. Unlike traditional convolutional layers that process global information only at low spatial resolutions, AdaBins performs global statistical analysis at high resolution to refine the output. The authors propose to analyze and modify the distribution of depth values as a means to improve depth estimation. They demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture on the NYU and KITTI datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results. Furthermore, they investigate different modifications of the AdaBins block and analyze their impact on depth estimation accuracy. The proposed approach shows promising improvements in supervised single image depth estimation for various metrics on popular datasets.
