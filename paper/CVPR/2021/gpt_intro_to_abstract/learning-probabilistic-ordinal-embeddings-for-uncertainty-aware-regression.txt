Regression is a fundamental machine learning problem that involves predicting a continuous target value based on given data. It has been extensively studied due to its applications in various domains such as age estimation, historical image dating, and image aesthetic assessment. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved tremendous success in regression tasks in recent years. As a result, many regression approaches utilize DNNs for their powerful feature representations. However, these approaches often overlook the importance of modeling data uncertainty, which provides a probabilistic interpretation of predictions. Humans are inherently confident in their judgments, and it is essential to incorporate this confidence into regression models. Recent work has proposed methods to model uncertainty in regression by replacing point estimation with a probabilistic distribution. However, these methods typically use certain families of distributions, limiting their expressiveness. Advanced regression methods, such as classification-based and ranking-based approaches, have been developed to outperform direct regression. However, these methods present challenges in modeling data uncertainty due to the presence of multiple neurons in the output layer. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Probabilistic Ordinal Embeddings (POEs), which estimate multivariate Gaussian distributions in the latent space instead of fixed points. Unlike existing methods that use deterministic embeddings, POEs represent each embedding as a random variable, allowing for accurate representation of noisy data. Additionally, an ordinal distribution constraint is proposed to preserve the ordinal relation in the target space. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) the introduction of probabilistic ordinal embeddings to model data uncertainty in regression, (2) the enhancement of present-day regression methods with uncertainty estimation capabilities, and (3) comprehensive experiments demonstrating the performance improvement achieved by incorporating uncertainty modeling in real-world visual tasks.
