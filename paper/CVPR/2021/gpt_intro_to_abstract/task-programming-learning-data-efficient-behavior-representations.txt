Behavioral analysis of agents is crucial in various research fields, such as biology, autonomous driving, sports analytics, and video games. Traditionally, this analysis involves manual extraction of agent location and pose from behavior videos, followed by frame-by-frame labeling of specific behaviors. However, this process is time-consuming and subjective. Automated quantification of behavior offers a more objective and scalable approach, but requires data-intensive training and specialized domain knowledge. To address this, we propose a framework called TREBA (Trajectory Embedding for Behavior Analysis) that integrates self-supervised representation learning and expert-designed programs for trajectory data. These programs capture domain-specific knowledge, and trajectory representations are learned through trajectory generation and decoder tasks. This framework allows domain experts to reduce annotation effort by trading annotations for programmed tasks. We evaluate TREBA on mouse and fly behavior datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of task programming in reducing annotation effort while maintaining classification performance. Our method achieves a 10× annotation reduction for mice and a 2× reduction for flies. Overall, our contributions include introducing task programming as an efficient method for domain experts to reduce annotation effort and encode structural knowledge, studying the impact of task programming, data annotation, and different decoder losses on behavior classifier performance, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our method across multiple datasets in two domains.
