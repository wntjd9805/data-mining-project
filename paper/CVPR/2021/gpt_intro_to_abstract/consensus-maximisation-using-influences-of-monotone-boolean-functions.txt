In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to the Maximum Consensus (MaxCon) problem in computer vision using the theory of Monotone Boolean Functions (MBFs). The MaxCon problem aims to find the maximum feasible subset of data points that adhere to a given model within a tolerance level. We represent each subset as a vertex in the n-dimensional Boolean Cube and define a Boolean function that evaluates the feasibility of each subset. By leveraging the existing theory and tools developed for Boolean functions, we analyze the MaxCon problem and propose algorithms to solve it. We also observe that the Boolean function associated with MaxCon belongs to the class of Monotone Boolean Functions and highlight the significance of this observation. Additionally, we define the concept of the Upper zero of a MBF and show that the MaxCon problem can be viewed as the search for the maximum upper zero of the associated monotone infeasibility function. To illustrate these concepts, we provide a simple example and explain how the MaxCon solution corresponds to the highest feasible subset in the Hasse diagram of the Boolean Cube. Although MBFs have been thoroughly studied in various domains, including learning theory, they have received relatively little attention in computer vision, particularly in model-based computer vision. Therefore, we present our novel viewpoint on the MaxCon problem using MBFs and develop efficient solutions based on the concept of Influence in a MBF. We establish a theoretical relationship between influences in a MBF and outliers in MaxCon and demonstrate that the influence of points belonging to the largest structure in the data is smallest under "ideal" conditions. Building upon this analysis, we propose a greedy algorithm that efficiently searches for the maximum upper zero of a MBF to solve the MaxCon problem. Overall, our contributions include a precise definition of the MaxCon problem in terms of finding the maximum upper zero of a Monotone Boolean Function, the connection between influences in a MBF and outliers in MaxCon, and the derivation of a greedy algorithm to solve the MaxCon problem.
