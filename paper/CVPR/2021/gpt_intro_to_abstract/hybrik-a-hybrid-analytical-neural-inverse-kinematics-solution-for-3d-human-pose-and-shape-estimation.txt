Recovering the 3D surface from a single RGB image is a challenging task with various applications. Model-based methods have been developed to estimate the pose and shape of human bodies. These methods can be categorized into optimization-based and learning-based approaches. However, optimization-based methods have limitations such as non-convexity and sensitivity to initialization, leading to a shift towards learning-based approaches. Yet, learning-based methods struggle with the abstract parameter space of the statistical model. To address this challenge, we explore the use of 3D keypoint estimation methods and propose a collaboration between 3D joints and body mesh. By leveraging the accurate 3D joints as well as the shape prior in the parametric model, we improve the estimation of the body mesh and ensure realistic body structure. In this work, we present a hybrid analytical-neural inverse kinematics solution (HybrIK) that bridges the gap between 3D keypoint estimation and body mesh estimation. Our approach decomposes the relative rotation of a skeleton part into twist and swing, enabling accurate alignment with the 3D skeleton. All operations in HybrIK are differentiable, allowing for end-to-end training. Experimental results demonstrate that HybrIK outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of body mesh estimation accuracy. The contributions of our approach include proposing HybrIK, closing the loop between the 3D skeleton and parametric model, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.
