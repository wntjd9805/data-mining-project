Semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation are critical computer vision tasks that play a crucial role in perceiving and understanding the surrounding environment. These tasks have been shown to complement each other, with information from one task improving the performance of the other. This paper focuses on the domain adaptation (DA) problem, which aims to maximize model performance in a target domain with limited supervision compared to the source domain.Specifically, this paper addresses the Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) setting, where only unannotated samples from the target domain are available during training. Existing techniques have proposed leveraging depth information from the source domain to enhance semantic segmentation in the target domain. However, they lack an explicit formulation to explicitly relate different semantic categories with various depth levels.In this paper, we introduce a novel network architecture and a multitask-aware feature space alignment mechanism for UDA. First, we propose a Cross-Task Relation Layer (CTRL) that captures task relationships based on the network's semantic and depth predictions. This parameter-free module enables the explicit modeling of relationships between semantic classes and depth levels. Additionally, we utilize a Semantics Refinement Head (SRH) that predicts semantic segmentation given depth features, further enhancing the cross-task relationships. Both CTRL and SRH improve the model's ability to encode correlations between semantics and depth, resulting in improved predictions on the target domain.Furthermore, we employ an Iterative Self Learning (ISL) scheme that, combined with the proposed model design, further enhances semantic segmentation performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging UDA benchmarks, as demonstrated through comparisons with previous methods. The paper provides an in-depth discussion of related work, describes the proposed UDA approach, network architecture, and learning scheme, presents experimental analysis with ablation studies, and concludes with a summary of the findings.
