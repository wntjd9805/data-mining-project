3D shape segmentation is a fundamental problem in 3D vision, but most existing works focus on semantic segmentation of 3D shapes into major parts. However, many application scenarios demand fine-grained shape segmentation. Fine-grained parts refer to modeling components that are conceptually meaningful in assembly-based 3D modeling. This problem of fine-grained segmentation facilitates part-based shape synthesis, modeling, and robotic manipulation. Learning-based approaches to fine-grained shape segmentation typically require a large dataset with fine-grained part segmentation and tags. While most online shape repositories provide fine-grained part segmentation, they often lack semantic tags or have noisy tags, making part annotation tedious and leaving many parts unlabeled. In this paper, we propose a deep clustering-based approach to fine-grained part segmentation that does not rely on part labels. Our method learns geometric part priors based on a dataset with fine-grained segmentation but no part labels. We use a similarity matrix of point features to model clustering priors and introduce a novel low-rank loss for fine-grained part segmentation. To handle large point clouds, we use a divide-and-conquer strategy, partitioning the point set into blocks and merging segments using a graph convolution network. Our contributions include a formulation for fine-grained segmentation without relying on part annotations, a novel low-rank loss for learning fine-grained part priors, and a graph convolution network module for merging segments.
