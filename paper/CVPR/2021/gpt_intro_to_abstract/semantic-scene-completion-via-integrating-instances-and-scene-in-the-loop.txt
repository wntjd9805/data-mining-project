Indoor scene understanding in 3D is crucial for various computer vision tasks, but reconstructing and understanding the semantics of a whole 3D scene from partial observations is challenging. Existing Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) methods have limitations in accurately reconstructing object shapes and identifying semantic categories due to voxelization resolution and absence of instance-level constraints. Recent Semantic Instance Completion (SIC) methods focus on reconstructing specific object types but struggle with object detection in partially observed scenes. In this paper, we propose a Scene-Instance-Scene Network (SISNet) that integrates scene and instance information to improve SSC prediction. Our framework utilizes 3D voxel-wise ground truths to aid instance completion, resulting in iterative completion and more accurate scene understanding. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on synthetic and real datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art SSC methods.
