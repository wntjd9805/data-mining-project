Nighttime images often suffer from low visibility due to varying illumination and multiple man-made light sources. This includes challenges such as glow, glare, and floodlight effects that can severely degrade image quality. Existing visibility enhancement methods and HDR imaging techniques struggle to handle these light effects, often incorrectly intensifying them and further deteriorating visibility. To address this problem, we propose a semi-supervised network that simultaneously increases the dynamic range and suppresses light effects in nighttime images. Our method utilizes paired images for training the network to increase the dynamic range and unpaired images to train it for light effect suppression. We employ a linearisation network to estimate the inverse CRF of the input image, decompose it into low-frequency and high-frequency feature maps, and process them separately to suppress light effects and remove noise. The resulting feature maps are then fused to generate an output image with improved visibility. Our method is the first to address the issue of single-image nighttime visibility enhancement with both increased dynamic range and suppressed light effects. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in nighttime visibility enhancement and HDR imaging.
