Graph matching is a fundamental task in computer science that involves finding an optimal one-to-one correspondence between nodes in graph-structured data. This task is mathematically formulated as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP), which is known to be NP-hard. To make the problem computationally tractable, various approximation techniques have been proposed.Recently, deep graph matching (DGM) methods have emerged, which aim to learn the node affinity using deep features extracted from convolutional neural networks. These methods primarily focus on feature modeling and refinement to improve affinity construction. However, distinguishing nodes with similar deep features in DGM can be challenging, and the implicit structure information captured by these methods may not be specific enough to represent structural discrepancies between graphs.To enhance matching accuracy, we propose to incorporate a quadratic structural constraint into DGM. This constraint maximizes the adjacency consensus and achieves global consistency by minimizing the discrepancy between graphs using the pairwise term of Koopmans-Beckmann's QAP. We present a modified Frank-Wolfe algorithm that is differentiable with respect to the learnable parameters in our model and the relaxed QAP.Another important issue in DGM is class imbalance, where there are disproportionately more unmatched entries than matched entries in the predicted matching matrices. Existing loss functions designed for DGM do not adequately address this class imbalance issue. Therefore, we introduce a novel loss function called False Matching Loss, which effectively handles class imbalance and overfitting.Our contributions include the development of a DGM method with quadratic constraint, a modified optimization algorithm, and a novel loss function. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving matching accuracy and addressing class imbalance.
