This paper introduces a novel approach to point cloud registration, which aims to achieve accuracy, robustness to noise and initialization, and fast inference speed. The proposed registration agent, called ReAgent, combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning to learn an accurate initial policy and improve it through a symmetry-invariant reward. ReAgent treats registration as an iterative classification of the observed point cloud pair into discrete steps. The paper discusses related methods in point cloud registration and reinforcement learning, presents the proposed agent, and provides experiments on synthetic and real data to demonstrate its improved accuracy and reduced inference time compared to state-of-the-art methods. The impact of the contributions is discussed, and the paper concludes with future directions and additional details and results on the related object pose estimation task.
