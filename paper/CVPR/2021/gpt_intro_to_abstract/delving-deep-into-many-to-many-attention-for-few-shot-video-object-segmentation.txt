This paper introduces the concept of Few-Shot Video Object Segmentation (FSVOS), which aims to segment new object classes across query videos with only a few annotated support images. The paper explores existing solutions for solving the many-to-many problem of constructing correlation between support images and query videos. Prototype-based methods extract a global descriptor from support images, while attention-based methods learn a many-to-many attention between every support-query image pair. However, the computational complexity of attention-based methods grows exponentially with the number of input images. To address this, the paper proposes the Attention Decomposition Hypothesis, which replaces the original attention matrix with two smaller attention matrices through a domain agent. The paper also introduces a learning strategy that combines meta-learning and online learning for FSVOS. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and superior performance of the proposed method. The main contributions of this work are: exploring many-to-many attention, proposing a novel Domain Agent Network (DAN), presenting a learning strategy, and establishing a benchmark for FSVOS.
