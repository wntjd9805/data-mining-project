This paper introduces a novel approach for 6D pose estimation, a crucial task in various real-world applications. The problem is challenging due to sensor noise, lighting variations, and scene occlusion. Previous works using deep learning techniques on RGB images have been limited by the loss of geometry information caused by perspective projection. The emergence of inexpensive RGBD sensors has provided additional depth information, raising the question of how to effectively leverage both data modalities for improved pose estimation. Existing methods have attempted to address this issue through cascaded designs or by using point cloud networks (PCNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) separately. However, these approaches either suffer from time-consuming refinement procedures or performance degradation in certain scenarios. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a full flow bidirectional fusion network that performs fusion on each encoding and decoding layer for representation learning from RGBD images. The key insight is that appearance information in RGB and geometry information in the point cloud can complement each other during feature extraction. The proposed fusion mechanism bridges the gap between the CNN and PCN feature extraction, improving performance in challenging scenarios.Additionally, the authors propose an algorithm called SIFT-FPS for automatic 3D keypoint selection, which takes both object texture and geometry information into account. This enhances the pose estimation process by facilitating the network's ability to locate salient keypoints.The proposed approach is evaluated on benchmark datasets such as YCB-Video, LineMOD, and Occlusion LineMOD. Experimental results demonstrate that the method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches without requiring time-consuming post-refinement procedures.In summary, the contributions of this work include a novel fusion network for representation learning, an effective 3D keypoint selection algorithm, state-of-the-art pose estimation performance, and in-depth analysis of the system design choices.
