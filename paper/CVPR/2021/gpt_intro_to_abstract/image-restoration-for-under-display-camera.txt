Under-display cameras (UDCs) are a new imaging system that mounts a display screen on top of a traditional digital camera lens. UDCs offer two main advantages: they enable full-screen devices with a larger screen-to-body ratio, providing a better user experience, and they enhance human-computer interaction, especially in teleconferencing scenarios. However, mounting a camera behind a display can result in severe degradation of imaging quality, leading to noisy and blurry images. Therefore, it is necessary to develop image restoration techniques to improve the quality of UDC-captured images.Traditional image restoration approaches, such as inverse problems or optimization methods, are not suitable for UDC systems that require real-time processing. Deconvolution-based methods like the Wiener Filter are preferred due to their efficiency. However, the effectiveness of deconvolution depends on the space-invariance of the point-spread function (PSF) and a low condition number for the inverse of the PSF. For non-delta-function-like PSFs encountered in UDC systems, additional denoising steps may be necessary.Alternatively, discriminative learning-based image restoration models have shown promising results in specific tasks like denoising, deblurring, and super-resolution. However, existing models are not suitable for enhancing real-world low-quality images with complicated or combined degradation types like UDC-captured images. Therefore, collecting real paired data or synthesizing near-realistic data after understanding the degradation model is necessary to address the complexity of UDC image restoration.In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the UDC system from both optics and image restoration perspectives. We analyze the optical system and its characteristics, relate them to the image restoration pipeline, and propose two approaches for UDC restoration: a deconvolution-based Wiener Filter pipeline and a data-driven learning-based approach. Moreover, we focus on two types of displays and a single camera type to analyze the image degradation process and propose a data acquisition system for real imaging data and optical measurements.The contributions of this paper include defining, measuring, and analyzing the UDC system, proposing practical restoration solutions, and introducing a UDC dataset collected using our newly-assembled image acquisition system.
