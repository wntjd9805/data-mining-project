Human pose estimation requires high-resolution representations for achieving high performance. However, in order to meet the increasing demand for model efficiency, this paper explores the development of efficient high-resolution models under limited computational resources. Existing efficient networks are primarily designed either by borrowing design ideas from classification networks or by employing tricks to mitigate spatial information loss. In this study, a naive lightweight network is first examined by combining the shuffle block from ShuffleNet and the high-resolution design pattern from HRNet. Empirical results demonstrate that this direct combination outperforms ShuffleNet, MobileNet, and Small HRNet. To further enhance efficiency, an efficient unit called conditional channel weighting is introduced to replace costly pointwise convolutions in the shuffle block. The conditional channel weighting scheme enables information exchange across channels, significantly reducing the computation complexity of the shuffle block. Unlike regular convolutional kernel weights, the proposed scheme's weights are conditioned on input maps and computed across channels through a lightweight unit, facilitating information exchange. Experimental results showcase the superiority of the resulting network, named Lite-HRNet, compared to the naive Lite-HRNet and the benefits of the proposed conditional channel weighting scheme in terms of computational complexity reduction. The main contributions of this paper include the introduction of the naive Lite-HRNet, which outperforms existing lightweight networks, and the presentation of the improved Lite-HRNet, which incorporates the efficient conditional channel weighting unit. Lite-HRNet achieves state-of-the-art complexity and accuracy trade-off on COCO and MPII human pose estimation datasets and can be easily applied to semantic segmentation tasks as well.
