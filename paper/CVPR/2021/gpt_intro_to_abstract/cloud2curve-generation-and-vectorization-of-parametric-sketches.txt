The analysis of free-hand sketches using deep learning has seen significant progress in recent years, particularly in the areas of classification, retrieval, and generative modeling. While raster sketches (pixel grids) have been the preferred modality for recognition and retrieval, recent advancements have focused on vector representations and generating sketches as sequences of waypoints/line segments, similar to how humans sketch. This approach leads to clean and blur-free image generation, unlike direct raster-graphic generations. In this paper, we present Cloud2Curve, a framework that advances the generative sketch modeling paradigm by generating parametric sketches composed of scalable parametric curves. It also provides the ability to sample such sketches given point-cloud data, which can be obtained from raster-graphic or waypoint sequences. Our framework enables the generation and deterministic vectorization of scalable parametric sketches based on point clouds. Existing frameworks like SketchRNN generate vector sketches as dense sequences of short straight line segments. However, these output sketches are not spatially scalable and struggle with generating long sketches. Our framework addresses these limitations by dynamically determining the optimal complexity of each generated curve and training the model end-to-end. Moreover, existing generative sketch frameworks rely on purely sequential data for training, requiring specially collected sequential datasets. In contrast, our framework encodes point-cloud training data and decodes a sequence of parametric curves using an inverse-graphics approach. We compare reconstructed curves with the original segmented point cloud strokes using an Optimal Transport (OT) based objective, leading to controllable abstraction of sketches. In summary, our contributions include a novel formulation of BÂ´ezier curves with a continuous degree parameter, the development of Cloud2Curve as a generative model capable of training and inference on point-cloud data, and the demonstration of scalable parametric curve generation from point-clouds using Quick, Draw!, and a subset of K-MNIST datasets.
