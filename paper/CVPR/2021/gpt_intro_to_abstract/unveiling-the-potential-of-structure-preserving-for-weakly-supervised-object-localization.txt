Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) is a task that relies on image-level annotations to learn localization models. In recent years, WSOL has gained attention due to its ability to leverage rich web images with tags for object-level model learning. Class Activation Mapping (CAM) is a popular method for WSOL, which uses intermediate classifier activation to identify discriminative image regions for object localization. However, existing methods often neglect the preservation of object structure. In this study, we propose a two-stage WSOL approach called Structure-Preserving Activation (SPA) to accurately localize objects using image-level category labels as supervision. The first stage involves a Restricted Activation Module (RAM) that suppresses misleading responses and differentiates objects from the background. In the second stage, a Self-Correlation Map Generating (SCG) module is used to refine the localization map by capturing precise spatial layouts of objects through high-order self-correlation. Experimental results on the CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC datasets show that our proposed SPA approach achieves significant gains compared to baseline methods and achieves comparable results with state-of-the-art methods for bounding box and mask localization. The contributions of this study include highlighting the importance of spatial structure preservation in WSOL, proposing a simple yet effective approach for accurate object localization, and demonstrating consistent performance improvements across datasets with minimal computational overhead.
