Shadows have long been a challenging problem in computer vision, with previous works focusing on tasks such as shadow detection and removal. However, recent research has introduced a new task called instance shadow detection, which aims to not only detect shadows but also identify the associated objects that cast those shadows. This task has significant implications for various vision applications, including light direction estimation and photo editing.One such approach to instance shadow detection is the SOBA dataset and method proposed by Wang and Hu et al. This method utilizes a two-stage framework, where the first stage generates region proposals that are likely to contain shadow instances, object instances, and shadow-object associations. In the second stage, predictions are made on the masks and bounding boxes of these instances based on cropped regions-of-interest (ROIs) from feature maps. Finally, a strategy is employed to pair up the shadow and object instances using the predicted shadow-object associations.However, upon revisiting this task, several limitations were identified. Firstly, the previous method treats shadow-object associations as a single category and predicts a bounding box for each association, even though the appearance of shadow and object instances can be significantly different. This leads to the potential omission of shadow-object associations. Secondly, the two-stage framework and post-processing used in the previous method may accumulate errors, resulting in a decline in performance. Lastly, the use of rectangular-shaped ROIs in the previous method could include irrelevant image contents, such as other object and shadow instances.To address these limitations, this paper presents a new approach to instance shadow detection using a single-stage deep network. This network directly learns the relationship between shadow instances and object instances in an end-to-end manner, employing only fully convolutional operations. Importantly, the network is able to handle shadow/object instances and shadow-object associations of arbitrary shape. The bidirectional relation learning module is introduced to explore the pairing between shadow and object instances, using offset vectors to determine the relationship between their centers.To optimize the network, class vectors are employed to indicate the learning direction (shadow → object or object → shadow), and segmentation loss and offset loss are used as optimization metrics. These techniques contribute to improving the performance of instance shadow detection by enabling better pairing between shadow and object instances.The major contributions of this work include the design of a single-stage instance shadow detection network, the formulation of a bidirectional relation learning module, and the comparison of the proposed method with the state-of-the-art on a benchmark dataset, demonstrating an accuracy improvement of over 29%.
