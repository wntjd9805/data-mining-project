House design is a complex and time-consuming process, typically requiring multiple iterations and refinements. However, only a small percentage of buildings employ professional architects for custom design due to cost limitations. Automatic floorplan generation has the potential to revolutionize the trillion-dollar real estate and construction industries. Previous research has explored iterative optimization methods and more recently, deep neural networks, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which have shown promising results in floorplan generation. However, the lack of incomplete floorplan datasets during design iterations has made training these models difficult. This paper introduces a novel generative adversarial layout refinement network that addresses this challenge. The proposed system trains a generator to iteratively refine floorplans by generating a graph of segmentation masks. The problem setup is based on the House-GAN system, with modifications to handle non-rectangular room shapes, generate doors/entrances, and utilize a functional graph instead of an adjacency graph. The technical contributions of this paper include the architecture of integrating a graph-constrained relational GAN and a conditional GAN, a non-iterative training algorithm called component-wise GT-conditioning, and a test-time meta-optimization algorithm. The proposed system is evaluated using the RPLAN dataset, which includes 60k vector-graphics floorplans designed by professional architects. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms the current state-of-the-art in terms of realism, diversity, and compatibility metrics. User studies conducted with professional architects also show that the generated floorplans are competitive with ground-truth floorplans. The code, model, and dataset used in this research are publicly available.
