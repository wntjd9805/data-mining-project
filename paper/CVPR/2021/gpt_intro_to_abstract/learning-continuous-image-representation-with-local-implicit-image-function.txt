Our visual world is continuous, but machines typically process images as 2D arrays of pixels, constrained by resolution. In this paper, we propose a continuous representation for images by modeling them as functions defined in a continuous domain. This representation allows for image restoration and generation in arbitrary resolution. Inspired by the success of implicit neural representation for 3D shape reconstruction, we introduce the Local Implicit Image Function (LIIF) for representing natural and complex images. LIIF represents an image as a set of latent codes distributed in spatial dimensions, with a decoding function that predicts the RGB value at a given coordinate. By training an encoder with LIIF representation using a self-supervised super-resolution task, we demonstrate the ability to generate continuous representations with higher precision than the input image. LIIF bridges the gap between discrete and continuous representations in 2D, allowing for exploitation of information in different resolutions without sacrificing fidelity. Our contributions include a novel method for representing images continuously, the ability to extrapolate to higher resolutions not seen during training, and effectiveness in learning tasks with size-varied image ground-truths.
