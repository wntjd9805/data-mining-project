High Definition (HD) maps play a crucial role in autonomous driving applications, providing precise depictions of physical roads and rich semantics of traffic rules. They enable self-driving robots to localize themselves, predict vehicle motions, and maneuver effectively. HD maps also have applications in city modeling and simulation, aiding in game design and urban planning. However, constructing HD maps through traditional methods is expensive and lacks generalization capabilities. This paper proposes a data-driven approach to synthetic HD map generation using deep generative models. Previous methods rely on procedural modeling and hand-crafted rules, limiting adaptability to new scenarios. The unique attributes of HD maps, such as geometric features and rich semantic attributes, pose challenges to their modeling. The major contributions of this work include posing the problem of data-driven HD lane map generation, exploring autoregressive generative models, and proposing HDMapGen, a hierarchical graph model that outperforms other baselines. The model is evaluated on maps from the ArgoVerse dataset and an in-house dataset, demonstrating high fidelity, diversity, scalability, and efficiency. This research addresses the need for flexible and adaptable HD map generation methods in the field of autonomous driving.
