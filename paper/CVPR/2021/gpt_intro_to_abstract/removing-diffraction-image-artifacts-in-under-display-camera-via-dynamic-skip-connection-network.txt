The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the growing consumer demand for smartphones with bezel-free, notch-less displays, which has led to the development of a new imaging system known as Under-Display Camera (UDC). The UDC system is not limited to smartphones but also has practical applications in videoconferencing with UDC TVs, laptops, and tablets. The UDC system consists of a camera module placed underneath a semi-transparent Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED) display. However, the micrometer-scale gaps between the display pixels cause diffraction of the incoming light, resulting in image degradation. Previous attempts to address the UDC image restoration problem have had drawbacks, including inaccurate Point Spread Function (PSF) synthesis, lack of high dynamic range (HDR), and a lack of real-world evaluation on non-synthetic data. This paper aims to address these issues by presenting a realistic image formation model and measurement protocol that consider proper dynamic range for scenes and camera sensors. The authors experiment with the ZTE Axon 20 smartphone, one of the first production UDC devices, to analyze diffraction effects. The paper proposes a method to directly measure the PSF of the UDC device and reformulates the image formation model to account for realistic flare, haze, and blur. A data simulation pipeline based on HDR images is used to approximate real scenes, and real images captured with the UDC phone's selfie camera are used to validate the simulated data. The paper also introduces a DynamIc Skip Connection Network (DISCNet) that incorporates domain knowledge to effectively remove diffraction image artifacts in UDC systems.The contributions of this work include reformulating the image formation model for UDC systems, measuring the real-world PSF of UDC devices, and proposing a dynamic skip connection network that utilizes domain knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for UDC image restoration.
