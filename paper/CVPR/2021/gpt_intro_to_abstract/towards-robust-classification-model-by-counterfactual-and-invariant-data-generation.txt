This paper addresses the issue of spurious associations in machine learning classification models by incorporating human causal knowledge. While typical machine learning models rely on associations between features and labels, this approach considers the causal factors behind these associations. Spurious associations occur when factors correlate with labels but are not causal, and can lead to issues such as spurious correlations, artifacts, lack of robustness, and discrimination. In order to break the correlations between backgrounds and labels, the authors propose two data augmentation techniques. First, they generate counterfactuals by modifying images in a way that would no longer be labeled by humans as a certain class. Second, they intervene on non-causal factors, such as the image background, to generate new images with modified backgrounds. Experimental results on large-scale datasets show that these augmentations improve model accuracy and saliency focus on causal features. The contributions of this paper include the use of counterfactual and invariant data generation to make models more robust to spurious correlations, demonstrating similar or better accuracy compared to state-of-the-art techniques, and providing stronger salience focus on causal features for better explanations.
