Object detection is a vital task in computer vision with applications in various fields. Many existing object detection methods rely on large volumes of annotated training data, which can be time-consuming and expensive to obtain. Few-shot learning and semi-supervised learning have been proposed as solutions, but they still face challenges such as data imbalance and dataset bias. This paper introduces a new approach called Positive-Unlabeled learning, which aims to improve object detection performance and eliminate label dependence by utilizing large amounts of unlabeled data from the wild. A two-stage framework is proposed, including a PU classifier for data purification and a self-distillation based training scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed method, PUDet, is demonstrated on the COCO benchmark, achieving a higher mean average precision without manual annotation of additional data.
