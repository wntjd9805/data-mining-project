Instance segmentation, which combines object detection and semantic segmentation into one task, has been a popular research topic in computer vision. It requires accurately classifying, localizing, and providing segmentation masks for all object instances in an image. To improve the performance of instance segmentation, a cascaded architecture with multi-stage refinement has been proposed. However, existing cascades mainly exploit a unidirectional relationship between mask segmentation and bounding box detection. In this paper, we investigate the opposite direction and propose a Deeply Shape-guided Cascade (DSC) that establishes a bi-directional relationship between the two tasks. DSC incorporates shape guidance extracted from mask prediction at previous stages into bounding box detection at the current stage. This is achieved through three key components: initial shape guidance, explicit shape guidance, and implicit shape guidance. The shape guidance learned from mask supervision is more informative than box-level supervision and improves the generation of precise bounding boxes, leading to more accurate segmented masks. DSC outperforms the state-of-the-art instance segmentation cascade, HTC, in terms of box AP and mask AP on the COCO dataset. It is particularly effective at segmenting huddled instances. Overall, our contribution is a novel cascade architecture that leverages shape guidance to enhance instance segmentation performance.
