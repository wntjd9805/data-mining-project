Automatic image aesthetics assessment (IAA) has gained significant attention in recent years due to its potential applications in various fields such as image retrieval, photo recommendation, and image enhancement. Early research efforts focused on extracting hand-crafted features based on known photographic principles, while more recent methods have utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to map image aesthetics to different formulations.However, there are two main inherent constraints in employing CNNs for IAA. Firstly, general deep aesthetic models often require additional operations to generate fixed-size inputs, which can compromise image aesthetics and introduce label noise. Secondly, layout information is crucial for assessing visual aesthetics, as the arrangement of visual elements contributes to balance and harmony in photographs.To address these problems, we propose a double-subnetwork framework based on Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) that leverages layout information for visual aesthetics assessment. The framework consists of a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) to preserve spatial information and a Layout-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (LA-GCN) module to perform graph convolutions on an aesthetics graph constructed based on the spatial nodes. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical LA-GCN (HLA-GCN) module to enable efficient global reasoning over disjoint regions.Our contributions include the development of a layout-aware graph convolution module that explicitly relates aesthetic perception to image layout attributes and the proposal of the HLA-GCN architecture for learning visual representations from both coordinate and latent spaces. Experimental results on the AVA and AADB datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in unified aesthetics assessment tasks such as quality classification, score regression, and distribution prediction.In conclusion, our research addresses the limitations of CNN-based IAA methods and introduces a novel framework that incorporates layout information for improved aesthetics assessment.
