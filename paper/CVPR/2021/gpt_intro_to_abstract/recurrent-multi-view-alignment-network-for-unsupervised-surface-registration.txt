Surface registration, the process of finding the spatial transformation and correspondences between two surfaces, is a fundamental problem in computer vision and graphics. It has wide applications in 3D reconstruction, tracking, and medical imaging. Registration algorithms can be categorized as rigid or non-rigid methods, with the latter being more challenging due to its increased complexity and freedoms.Traditional optimization based methods handle surface registration by iteratively alternating between finding corresponding points and estimating the transformation. However, constructing reliable correspondences based on heuristics or hand-crafted features is not easy. Learning based methods have shown promising results, but most of them are limited to rigid registration. There are only a few learning based non-rigid registration methods, which are only applicable to small-scale deformations.The challenges of learning non-rigid registration lie in the increased difficulty of network training and the lack of labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose a new non-rigid representation that combines multiple rigid transformations. This representation allows for the approximation of arbitrary non-rigid transformations and constrains the solution space. We design a recurrent neural network architecture to estimate the combination weights and rigid transformations iteratively.To train the model in a self-supervised manner, we propose a multi-view loss function that measures the visual similarity of the projected 2D depth images of the source and target surfaces. We use a soft rasterization method to render point clouds to depth maps and masks, making the loss term differentiable. Our proposed shape similarity loss outperforms commonly used metrics like Chamfer Distance and Earth Mover's distance.We conduct extensive experiments on various object types and datasets, demonstrating that our proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and is effective for large-scale non-rigid registration tasks. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component in our proposed method.
