The sewerage infrastructure is a crucial but often overlooked aspect of public health and sanitation. With 240 million US citizens relying on 1.28 million kilometers of public and privately owned sewer pipes, substantial investment is required to accommodate an additional 56 million Americans and prevent sewer overflows. Regular inspections of these sewer pipes are necessary to prevent collapse and maintain optimal functionality. Currently, inspections are performed manually by professional inspectors, who navigate remote controlled vehicles with movable cameras through the sewer pipes. This method can lead to flawed inspections due to the prolonged video monitoring required and the visual variation within sewer pipes.Automated sewer inspection has been studied for three decades, resulting in the development of various robot platforms and specialized algorithms. However, there is no consensus on the best method due to the absence of open-source benchmark datasets, code, and evaluation protocols. Researchers often rely on their own datasets and inspection guidelines, leading to stagnation in the field and a lack of reproducibility.To address these issues, we present the Sewer-ML dataset, which consists of 1.3 million annotated images collected over nine years from three Danish water utility companies. This open-source dataset provides a multi-label defect dataset for sewer inspection research. Our contributions include not only the dataset but also a comparison of state-of-the-art methods using the dataset, a novel class-importance weighted F2 metric (F2CIW), and a benchmark algorithm that combines knowledge from the sewer defect and multi-label classification domains.The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related works in the fields of multi-label image classification and automated sewer inspection. Section 3 introduces and describes the Sewer-ML dataset in detail. In Section 4, we propose the F2CIW metric, test various methods on the dataset, and conduct an ablation study to develop our benchmark algorithm. Finally, Section 5 summarizes our findings and concludes the paper.
