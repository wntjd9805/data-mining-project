This paper introduces a unified semi-supervised framework called UniT for object detection and segmentation in computer vision tasks. The framework aims to leverage different levels of instance-level supervision and scales with the available data. The authors make two fundamental observations: image-level supervision is abundant while instance-level structured labels are expensive and scarce, and the assumption of no instance-level supervision for target classes is artificial because it is often possible to collect a few instance-level annotations. The proposed UniT algorithm jointly learns weak-detectors for all object classes from image-level classification data and supervised regressors/segmentors on top of those for base classes using instance-level annotations. The novel class detectors/regressors/segmentors are expressed as a weighted linear combination of their base class counterparts, with the weights determined by a multi-modal similarity measure. The approach effectively enables knowledge transfer and adaptation between novel and base classes. The authors experiment with popular object detection/segmentation datasets and compare their method with state-of-the-art few-shot, weakly-supervised, and semi-supervised approaches. The contributions of this work include studying semi-supervised object detection and segmentation with various levels of supervision, proposing a general and interpretable framework, contrasting the importance of weak and strong supervision, and achieving state-of-the-art performance in multiple tasks and datasets.
