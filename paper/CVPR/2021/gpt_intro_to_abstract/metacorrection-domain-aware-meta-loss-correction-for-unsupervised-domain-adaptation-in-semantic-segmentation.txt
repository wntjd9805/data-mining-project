Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation is a critical problem in computer science, as it can benefit various real-world applications such as simulation for robots and autonomous driving. The main challenge in UDA for semantic segmentation lies in the divergence of data distribution between labeled source domains and unlabeled target domains. This domain gap often results in significant performance degradation when applying the model trained on source data directly to target samples. There are two major approaches to tackle this domain gap problem: adversarial learning-based UDA methods and self-training-based methods. Adversarial learning methods aim to align the distributions of two domains, while self-training methods enhance the discrimination property of target features and encourage cross-domain alignment by training with pseudo-labeled target data and labeled source data simultaneously. However, self-training methods often suffer from noisy pseudo labels, which can lead to overfitting and reduced generalization ability of the adapted models. Manual thresholding to eliminate low-confidence pseudo-labeled samples is challenging and prone to errors. To address the issue of noisy pseudo labels, this paper proposes a domain-aware meta-learning strategy called Domain-aware MetaCorrection (DMLC). DMLC models the noise distribution of pseudo labels using a Neural Transition Matrix (NTM) and estimates the NTM using a domain-aware meta-learning algorithm. The estimated noise distribution is then used to correct the supervision signal for target data in a self-training-based UDA method. The proposed MetaCorrection framework incorporates DMLC to provide matched and compatible supervision signals for different layers, thereby enhancing the deep adaptation of the model. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of the MetaCorrection framework, the formulation of inter-class misclassification probabilities to model the noise distribution in the target domain, the development of a domain-aware meta-learning algorithm for estimating the NTM, and extensive comparison experiments and ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Overall, the proposed DMLC and MetaCorrection framework show promising results in addressing the noisy pseudo label problem in UDA for semantic segmentation.
