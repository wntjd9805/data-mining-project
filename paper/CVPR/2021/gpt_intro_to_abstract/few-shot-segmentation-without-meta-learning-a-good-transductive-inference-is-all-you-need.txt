Few-shot learning has made significant progress in recent years, particularly in the field of meta-learning. However, there have been limitations in the generalization capacity of meta-learning methods beyond standard classification benchmarks. Similarly, few-shot segmentation, a popular research area in deep learning-based semantic segmentation, has also faced challenges in realistic scenarios. Existing few-shot segmentation methods often make assumptions about the structure of testing tasks and the similarity between base and novel classes, which may limit their applicability. In this paper, the authors propose a new approach called RePRI (Region Proportion Regularized Inference) that forgoes meta-learning and instead utilizes cross-entropy supervision and transductive inference. RePRI achieves highly competitive performances on standard few-shot segmentation benchmarks and demonstrates improved results in more realistic settings. The authors also show the benefits of incorporating precise region-proportion information on query objects. Overall, this work presents promising directions for future research and suggests a reconsideration of the existing few-shot segmentation benchmarks and datasets.
