This paper addresses the limitations of supervised learning methods in computer vision applications due to the need for abundant labeled data. Semi-supervised and unsupervised learning methods have been explored, but they mainly assume learning within a similar domain. This paper introduces Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) as a potential solution for transferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain with domain discrepancy. Traditional UDA methods use a domain discriminator or domain discrepancy metrics to minimize the gap between the domains. However, these methods do not consider scenarios where the distance between the domains is large. To address this challenge, the authors propose a fixed ratio-based mixup approach that generates multiple intermediate augmented domains with different characteristics. Complementary models are trained in these augmented domains to bridge the gap between the source and target domains. Bidirectional matching and self-penalization techniques are introduced to enhance the performance of the models. Adaptive thresholds and consistency regularization are also utilized to maintain the characteristics of the models. Extensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods in standard benchmarks. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of a fixed ratio-based mixup approach, conÔ¨Ådence-based learning methodologies, and empirical validation of the proposed method through extensive evaluations.
