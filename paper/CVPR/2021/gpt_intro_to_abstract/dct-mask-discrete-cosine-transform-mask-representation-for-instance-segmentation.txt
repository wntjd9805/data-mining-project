Instance segmentation tasks in computer vision involve detecting objects and assigning category labels to pixels. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have greatly advanced instance segmentation. One popular method, Mask R-CNN, uses a low-resolution binary grid for mask representation. However, this grid fails to capture detailed features and causes bias during reconstruction. In this paper, we propose using a higher-resolution mask representation based on the discrete cosine transform (DCT). By transforming the high-resolution binary mask into the frequency domain and keeping its low-frequency components, we obtain a high-quality and low-complexity mask representation. Experimental results show that the DCT mask representation achieves a high intersection over union (IoU) with the ground truth. We integrate the DCT mask representation into the Mask R-CNN framework and demonstrate consistent improvements in mask average precision (AP) on multiple datasets. Our method, DCT-Mask, does not require extra pre-processing or pre-training and achieves high-resolution mask prediction at a speed similar to low-resolution methods. Overall, our work contributes a high-quality and low-complexity mask representation for instance segmentation, which improves the accuracy of mask prediction without introducing additional computational complexity.
