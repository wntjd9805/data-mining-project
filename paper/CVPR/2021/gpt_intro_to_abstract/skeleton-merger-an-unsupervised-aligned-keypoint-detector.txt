This paper discusses the importance of accurately detecting semantic keypoints in computer vision, particularly for 3D point clouds. These keypoints are essential for various vision applications such as object tracking, shape registration, and robotics. However, determining if a point contains semantics requires high-level intelligence, and limited human annotated data is available. Unsupervised methods often utilize geometric properties to detect keypoints, but they may lack rich semantics and have low coverage. This paper proposes Skeleton Merger, an unsupervised keypoint detector that extracts salient and aligned keypoints by reconstructing a point cloud from its skeleton. The Skeleton Merger follows a deep Autoencoder architecture, generating keypoint proposals and predicting activation strengths of edges between keypoints. A loss function called Composite Chamfer Distance (CCD) evaluates how well the refined skeleton reconstructs the original point cloud. Experimental results demonstrate that Skeleton Merger outperforms current unsupervised detectors and is comparable to supervised methods in detecting semantically-rich keypoints with good alignment. The detector is also robust to noise and subsampling.
