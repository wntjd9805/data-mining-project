Regression tracking can be categorized into discriminative correlation filters (DCFs) based trackers and deep regression networks (DRNs) based trackers. While DCFs trackers achieve fast speed and perform well on tracking benchmarks, they have limitations in taking advantage of end-to-end learning. On the other hand, DRNs trackers have the potential for end-to-end learning but overlook the relationships between object parts and the complete object, resulting in drift and tracking failure. To address these limitations, we propose a spatial-temporal relationships-aware capsule architecture for regression tracking. This architecture incorporates the CapsNet model, which models spatial relationships using capsule architecture. However, applying the original CapsNet directly to regression tracking is impractical due to the high computational demand and the need for temporal relationship consideration. We introduce three components, namely the spatial capsules module (S-Caps), the temporal capsules module (T-Caps), and the STCaps Learning module, to effectively explore part-object relationships and capture temporal relationships across frames. Additionally, we design a prior-guided capsule routing algorithm (PGR) to leverage prior correlations and estimate capsule assignments. To address the computational burden, we propose a knowledge distillation compression strategy (KDPMC) to reduce parameters. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to state-of-the-art methods. Overall, this work introduces CapsNet to regression tracking and addresses issues of spatial-temporal relationships and computational efficiency.
