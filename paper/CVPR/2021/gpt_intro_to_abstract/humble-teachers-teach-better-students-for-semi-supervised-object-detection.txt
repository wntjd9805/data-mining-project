This paper addresses the problem of semi-supervised object detection, which is characterized by the scarcity of labeled data compared to image classification tasks. While much progress has been made in semi-supervised learning for image classification, transferring these methods directly to object detection has proven to be less effective. In this work, we propose a teacher-student approach called Humble Teacher, specifically designed for object detection frameworks. The Humble Teacher dynamically updates the teacher model using exponential moving average (EMA) updates, and utilizes asymmetric data augmentation to process different views of the same image. The key to its strong performance lies in the use of soft pseudo-labels, which strike a balance between covering the entire image and focusing on useful foreground instances. The Humble Teacher outperforms existing methods, such as Self-Training with Augmentation-driven Consistency (STAC), both on the MS-COCO and VOC datasets. It significantly closes the gap between semi-supervised and fully supervised learning and achieves notable improvements in low-data and high-data regimes. Overall, the Humble Teacher offers a promising solution for semi-supervised object detection.
