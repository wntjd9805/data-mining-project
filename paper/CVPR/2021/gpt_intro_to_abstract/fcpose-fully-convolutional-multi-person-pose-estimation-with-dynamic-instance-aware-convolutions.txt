Multi-person pose estimation, also known as keypoint detection, is a crucial task in computer vision with various applications. The key challenge in this task is obtaining instance-level keypoints that are grouped according to the individuals they belong to. Existing methods address this challenge using bottom-up or top-down approaches. However, these methods have shortcomings such as the need for ROIs and grouping post-processing. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective solution that avoids these drawbacks. Our approach involves dynamically generating keypoint heads with instance-specific convolution filters. This allows us to obtain keypoint detection results for each target instance, eliminating the need for ROIs and grouping post-processing. Furthermore, our dynamically-generated keypoint heads are compact and fast, enabling real-time applications. Additionally, we introduce a keypoint refinement module to improve localization precision without significant computation overhead. Our proposed framework, FCPose, achieves better accuracy and speed compared to recent top-down and bottom-up methods, making it a strong baseline for real-time keypoint detection.
