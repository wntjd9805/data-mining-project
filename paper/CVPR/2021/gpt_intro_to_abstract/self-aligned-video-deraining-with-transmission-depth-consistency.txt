Rain is a common weather condition that degrades visibility in video due to rain streaks and rain accumulation. Rain streaks partially occlude the background scene and blur the image, while rain accumulation washes out colors, reduces contrast, and creates a veiling effect. Existing rain removal methods mostly focus on rain streaks and rely on optical flow, which is unstable in rainy conditions. There is a lack of video-based methods for removing rain accumulation. Current single-image rain accumulation removal methods suffer from ambiguity between depth and water droplet density, leading to unsatisfactory results. In this paper, we propose a daytime rain removal method for videos that tackles both rain streaks and rain accumulation. We avoid relying on optical flow by using a feature-based alignment network to align consecutive input frames. Our network removes rain streaks based on the aligned features of adjacent frames. To address rain accumulation, we leverage depth cues from the input video. Our accumulationNet generates rain-accumulation free images as the final output. We train our network using synthetic rain videos with ground-truths and real rain videos without ground-truths. We introduce various losses to handle rain accumulation, including depth-transmission consistency loss, depth-temporal consistency loss, and photo-temporal consistency loss.The contributions of our work are: 1. We propose a video deraining method that removes both rain streaks and rain accumulation in an end-to-end framework, which is the first attempt in video deraining to address both types of rain.2. We provide a video-based deraining method with feature-level alignment, avoiding the use of optical flow and its associated issues.3. We propose losses that utilize depth, transmission map, and camera pose to handle rain accumulation, effectively dealing with the depth and water-droplet ambiguity problem and improving results.Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to state-of-the-art methods in terms of both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.
