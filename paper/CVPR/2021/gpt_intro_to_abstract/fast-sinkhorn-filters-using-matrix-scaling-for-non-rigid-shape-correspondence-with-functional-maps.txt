Non-rigid shape matching plays a crucial role in various computer vision tasks, such as statistical shape analysis, texture mapping, and deformation transfer. Among the different approaches for this problem, spectral quantities like the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator have been widely used due to their invariance to isometric shape deformations. The functional map framework, introduced in prior work, offers an efficient method for representing and computing mappings, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in challenging shape matching problems. This framework formulates shape correspondence as an optimization problem, allowing for the extraction of dense point-to-point correspondences. However, a recurring issue in this domain is the precise relation between functional and pointwise maps, particularly in the conversion step. Despite extensive research on this topic, the rigorous relation between the two representations remains ill-defined. This paper provides a theoretical justification for the pointwise conversion from a functional map, highlighting the use of the adjoint operator for point-to-point map extraction. Based on this foundation, a general framework for iterative spectral alignment is proposed, showcasing previous shape matching methods as regularized versions of the meta algorithm. Additionally, an effective regularized procedure using Sinkhorn's algorithm is introduced to compute accurate near-bijective pointwise correspondences, applicable to densely-sampled shapes. Existing approaches lack the ability to recover accurate, smooth, and bijective point-to-point correspondences with acceptable time and memory complexity. To address this limitation, the authors utilize spectral alignment analysis to construct a sparse kernel assignment matrix, employing matrix scaling to generate an entropic regularized transport plan. The maximum likelihood estimate of this plan is then extracted, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach, named Fast Sinkhorn Filters, for accurate and efficient pointwise conversion applications.
