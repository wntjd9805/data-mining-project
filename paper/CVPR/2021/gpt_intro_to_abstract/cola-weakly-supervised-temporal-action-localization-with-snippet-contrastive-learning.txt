Temporal action localization (TAL) is a crucial task in computer vision, with applications in surveillance analysis, video summarization, and retrieval. Weakly-supervised TAL (WS-TAL) methods have gained popularity due to their ability to leverage video-level labels instead of labor-intensive manual labeling procedures. Existing WS-TAL methods typically employ attention mechanisms or multiple instance learning formulations. However, WS-TAL suffers from the issue of single snippet cheating, where indistinguishable snippets are misclassified, leading to inaccurate localization results. To address this issue, we propose Contrastive learning on hard snippets to Localize Actions (CoLA), which leverages a contrastive representation learning paradigm. We introduce the Snippet Contrast (SniCo) Loss, which refines the feature representations of hard snippets using more discriminative easy snippets for guidance. To identify reasonable hard snippets, we propose a boundary-aware Hard Snippet Mining algorithm that employs a simple yet effective importance sampling technique. Experimental results on THUMOS'14 and ActivityNet v1.2 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CoLA and the proposed mining algorithm. Our work contributes to the field by introducing contrastive representation learning to WS-TAL and providing an efficient sampling strategy for weakly-supervised settings.
