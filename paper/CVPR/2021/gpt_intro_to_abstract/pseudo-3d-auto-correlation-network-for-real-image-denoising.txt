Image denoising is a crucial task in computer vision and image analysis applications. While advanced methods have made significant progress in removing synthesized noise, real image noise poses challenges due to its complex generation process. Traditional noise reduction algorithms use auto-correlation prior information to enhance denoising. Recently, deep learning techniques have been employed to extract auto-correlation features. These features can be divided into channel-wise and spatial-wise features, capturing cross-channel interaction and spatial self-similarity. However, existing methods still face limitations in terms of computational complexity and model performance. To address these challenges, we propose a pseudo 3D auto-correlation network (P3AN) that simulates 3D convolution using a 2D structure. The P3AN integrates channel and spatial auto-correlation into a unified module, leveraging fast 1D convolution and parameter sharing to reduce complexity. Additionally, our method introduces adaptive fusion to integrate correlation features from different directions. Experiment results on synthetic and real noise datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach compared to state-of-the-art denoising methods. Our proposed P3AN achieves higher performance with lower model complexity.
