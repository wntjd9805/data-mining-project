Stereo reconstruction techniques in computer vision have been extensively studied and applied in various applications due to their simplicity, low cost, and high density of per-pixel depth information. However, traditional stereo reconstruction is limited by its reliance on view-independent appearance matching and geometric triangulation, making it challenging to handle non-Lambertian surface materials and recover accurate surface geometry.In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages polarization cues captured by quad-Bayer polarization cameras to overcome these limitations. Previous methods have used polarization as auxiliary cues for matching and have relied on triangulation for depth estimation, resulting in surface normals being computed as byproducts of depth. This approach ignores complex polarimetric reflection properties and assumes Lambertian or mirror reflection, thereby excluding a wide range of real-world materials and lighting conditions.Our contribution is twofold. Firstly, we demonstrate that surface point correspondences can be established in a polarimetric stereo pair, enabling the direct recovery of per-pixel surface normals from the two polarimetric observations. Secondly, we integrate a full polarimetric BRDF model to handle complex lighting-dependent polarimetric reflection, allowing for accurate reconstruction of surfaces with matte, glossy, and mirrored properties.To achieve this, we propose a simultaneous estimation framework for per-pixel depth-independent normals and albedo. We construct both an RGB cost volume and a polarimetric cost volume based on pixel disparities and store Stokes vector differences for different surface normals and albedo values. By filtering these cost volumes using belief propagation, we can determine optimal disparities that yield pixel correspondences and compute surface normals and albedo values from the corresponding Stokes vectors.Our approach addresses the limitations of traditional stereo reconstruction by seamlessly integrating the filtering of both RGB and polarimetric cost volumes, encoding surface normals in the belief propagation process, and propagating surface normals to denoise them. We also fully model diffuse, specular lobe, and specular spike reflections using a microfacet-based polarimetric BRDF model, accounting for illumination-dependent polarization in the 3D reconstruction.Experimental validation on various objects and lighting conditions demonstrates the accuracy of our method in recovering surface normals and its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. We believe that our approach, enabled by polarization cameras, has implications in domains such as autonomous driving, robotics, VR/AR, and medicine, where detailed geometry reconstruction from a simple setup is crucial.
