This paper addresses the issue of ambiguity in lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG, where the decoder does not allow exploration of the potential images that could have been the source of a compressed code. The authors propose a novel JPEG decompression network architecture that predicts quantization errors and allows for consistent and diverse outputs. They also introduce a graphical user interface that enables interactive exploration of the space of possible reconstructions. The method is applicable in various scenarios, including image restoration, correction of unsatisfying decompression outputs, and testing hypotheses in forensic and medical image analysis. The proposed approach has important implications for improving the understanding and utilization of compressed visual data.
