The World Health Organization estimates that 1% of children below the age of 15 are visually impaired, with most eye diseases related to Parapapillary atrophy (PPA). Forecasting PPA can provide an early alarm for intervention. Existing methods generate future medical data but overlook the irreversibility of the diseases. Inspired by the irreversibility prior in PPA, we propose Disease Forecast via Progression Learning (DFPL) which decomposes the disease label into two factors: current stage disease label given present medical data, and future stage disease label given progression. We introduce prediction modules and a temporal generative framework based on Generative Adversarial Networks. We validate our approach on a longitudinal PPA dataset and show improved prediction accuracy and visualization of disease-related regions. We are the first to consider both current data and progression in forecasting irreversible diseases. Our method learns the dynamics of disease progression and outperforms others in prediction accuracy.
