Modern visual SLAM methods have shown impressive performance in high-quality data evaluation. However, when applied to downstream tasks like indoor robot navigation, several challenges arise. Imperfect navigation agents capture different images than a human, often encountering featureless walls and making rapid turns. Additionally, current robot cameras still have limitations in terms of noisy images, low frame rate, and a narrow field-of-view. These factors make feature extraction and association difficult, and relocalization and loop closure challenging due to environmental changes and repetitive features. Furthermore, integrating SLAM into a navigation pipeline is not straightforward, as the map representation needs to be suitable for planning, capture task-dependent information, and handle map imperfections.To address these challenges, this paper introduces the Differentiable SLAM Network (SLAM-net) and a navigation architecture for indoor navigation. SLAM-net encodes a SLAM algorithm in a differentiable computation graph and learns neural network model components for the SLAM algorithm using backpropagation. Specifically, SLAM-net encodes the FastSLAM algorithm and learns mapping, transition, and observation models. This approach fills a gap in differentiable robot algorithms research.Compared to unstructured learning approaches, SLAM-net benefits from its encoded particle filter, which provides a strong prior for learning. It also improves upon classic SLAM by learning all components, directly optimizing them for the end-objective. SLAM-net learns RGB and RGB-D observation models, previously reliant on hand-crafted models and lidar sensors. Additionally, task-oriented learning allows feature extractors to be more robust against domain-specific challenges faced during downstream navigation. However, they may be less reusable across tasks.The effectiveness of SLAM-net is validated through experiments on localization with RGB and RGB-D input, as well as downstream robot navigation in unseen indoor environments. The Habitat simulation platform and real-world indoor scene datasets are used for evaluation. SLAM-net performs well under challenging conditions where widely used ORB-SLAM fails and achieves transferable performance across datasets. For downstream navigation, an architecture similar to Neural SLAM is proposed, but incorporating the differentiable SLAM-net module. This approach significantly improves the state-of-the-art for the CVPR Habitat 2020 PointNav challenge.
