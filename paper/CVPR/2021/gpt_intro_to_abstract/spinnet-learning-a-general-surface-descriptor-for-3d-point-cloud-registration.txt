Accurate matching of partial 3D surfaces is crucial for various applications in computer vision, such as point cloud registration, segmentation, and recognition. However, matching these surfaces poses challenges due to variations in viewing angles, incomplete and noisy scans, and different point densities. Traditional methods rely on low-level features and handcrafted histograms but struggle with noisy and large-scale real-world point clouds. Recent learning-based approaches have shown promising results but are limited by their rotational variance and dependence on handcrafted features.In this paper, we propose a novel neural architecture called SpinNet, designed to learn descriptive and general local features for 3D surface matching. SpinNet satisfies three key properties: it is rotation invariant, descriptive despite noise and incomplete data, and does not rely on handcrafted features. The network consists of two modules: a Spatial Point Transformer that aligns the input 3D surface using cylindrical transformations and a Neural Feature Extractor that uses point-based and convolutional neural layers to learn representative patterns.The Spatial Point Transformer eliminates rotational variance along the Z-axis and further removes rotation variance within each spherical voxel. It formulates the transformed surface into a 3D cylindrical volume, enabling consumption by subsequent neural layers. The Neural Feature Extractor extracts unique signatures for each voxel and applies novel cylindrical convolutional layers to generate compact and representative feature vectors for the input surface.SpinNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on both indoor 3DMatch and outdoor ETH datasets. Notably, it exhibits superior generalization ability across unseen scenarios, with a significantly higher recall score than existing methods. Extensive experiments and ablations studies validate the effectiveness and generalization capability of our approach.In summary, our contributions include the proposal of SpinNet, a rotation-invariant and representative neural feature learner for 3D surface matching. We introduce a powerful 3D cylindrical convolution by formulating the transformed surface into a cylindrical volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable generalization of our method and provide insights into our architectural choices.
