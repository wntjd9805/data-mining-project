Prediction of diverse multimodal behaviors is crucial for autonomous vehicles to make safe decisions. This includes not only predicting dominant modes but also accounting for sporadic less dominant ones. Existing generative models have been used for trajectory prediction but suffer from mode collapse issues. To address this, a Divide and Conquer (DAC) approach is proposed, which provides better initialization to the winner-takes-all (WTA) objective used in recent methods. DAC solves issues related to untrained hypotheses and equilibrium positions that do not represent the data. This approach captures the data distribution better compared to baseline WTA objectives. Additionally, a new trajectory prediction framework called ALAN is introduced, which uses lane centerlines as anchors for accurate predictions with strong semantic alignment. ALAN incorporates a single representational model for multi-agent inputs and encodes interactions through hypercolumn descriptors. The prediction problem is transformed to normal-tangential (nt) coordinates relative to input lanes to enable the use of lane centerlines as anchors. The framework also includes a ranking module based on Inverse Optimal Control. Empirical results demonstrate strong performance on the Nuscenes urban driving benchmark.
