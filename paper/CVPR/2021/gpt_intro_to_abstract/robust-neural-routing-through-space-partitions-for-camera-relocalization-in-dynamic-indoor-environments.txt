Camera relocalization is a vital task in computer vision and robotics applications, including SLAM, AR, and navigation. Traditional methods utilize advanced hardware or RGB/RGB-D sensors to estimate camera pose, but these can be unreliable in certain environments. To address the limitations of existing approaches, we propose a novel outlier-aware neural tree algorithm for accurate camera relocalization in dynamic indoor scenes. Our algorithm incorporates a hierarchical spatial partition, a neural routing function, and outlier rejection to improve generalization in dynamic test scenes. Experimental results on the RIO-10 benchmark demonstrate that our algorithm achieves at least a 30% improvement in camera pose accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. The algorithm is also robust to scene changes and effectively rejects dynamic input samples during the neural routing process.
