Scene text understanding has gained significant attention in recent years due to the abundance of everyday scene images that contain texts. While previous approaches have focused on text detection, recognition, and word spotting, this paper introduces the task of scene text retrieval, which aims to search for text instances in a collection of natural images using a given text query. The authors propose a deep learning framework that combines text detection and cross-modal similarity learning stages for scene text retrieval. The network is optimized through a text detection task and a similarity learning task, which are complementary to each other. The authors also propose a word augmentation method to address the problem of unevenly distributed similarity values in training. Additionally, the authors present a new dataset for Chinese scene text retrieval to verify the effectiveness of text retrieval methods in non-Latin scripts. The contributions of this work include the development of an end-to-end trainable network for joint optimization of scene text detection and cross-modal similarity learning, the proposal of a word augmentation method for enhanced similarity learning, and the introduction of a new dataset for Chinese scene text retrieval.
