Bundle adjustment (BA) is a fundamental problem in computer vision, particularly in the context of 3D reconstruction and structure-from-motion (SfM). It involves estimating the true positions of landmarks and camera poses from observed approximate positions. While various formulations of BA exist, the underlying goal remains the same. Traditionally, BA has been studied for small-scale problems, but the rise of large-scale internet photo collections has necessitated the development of scalable solutions.In this paper, we challenge the widely accepted use of the Schur complement (SC) trick as the standard method for solving large-scale BA problems. Instead, we propose and analyze an alternative technique based on QR decomposition. Inspired by similar approaches in the Kalman filter literature, we factorize the landmark Jacobian matrix in a way that allows us to project the problem onto the nullspace of the matrix. This allows us to avoid computing the normal equations and their system matrix, resulting in a more numerically stable and efficient reduction step.Our contributions include: (1) proposing nullspace marginalization as an algebraically equivalent alternative to the SC trick, (2) linking the theory of nullspace marginalization to an efficient implementation strategy that exploits the specific structure of BA problems, (3) demonstrating the parallelizability and favorable numerical properties of our algorithm, resulting in a twofold speedup when computed in single precision, (4) extensive evaluation of our approach on large-scale datasets and comparison to the state-of-the-art framework Ceres, and (5) releasing our implementation and evaluation pipeline as open source for reproducibility and further research.Through our analysis and experimentation, we show that our proposed square root bundle adjustment (âˆšBA) solver outperforms competing methods in terms of speed and scalability, particularly for large-scale BA problems. Our work contributes to the ongoing research in the field of BA and provides a valuable alternative approach for solving this important computer vision problem.
