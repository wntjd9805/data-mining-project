Image compression is a fundamental problem in image processing and computer vision. Classical image compression codecs, such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and BPG, have been extensively studied. However, these codecs have separate modules for different compression tasks, making it difficult to achieve optimal solutions. Recently, deep learning and variational autoencoder (VAE) approaches have shown promising results in image compression.This paper proposes a novel image compression framework called AG-VAE. The framework allows for continuous rate adaptation within a single model and achieves comparable rate-distortion performance to state-of-the-art methods. The framework introduces a gain unit, which rescales the latent representation of the image, controlling the degree of information loss during quantization.The paper addresses two critical challenges: avoiding performance degradation with the inverse-gain unit and studying the reconstruction assumption of gain units for continuous rate adaptation. To improve entropy estimation, an asymmetric Gaussian entropy model is introduced. The gain units are integrated into other backbone architectures to showcase their universality.The contributions of this paper are fourfold: (1) the introduction of gain units for discrete rate adaptation in a single model, achieving similar performance to state-of-the-art methods; (2) the proposal of an exponent interpolation formula for generating gain vectors at arbitrary bit rates, extending the rate's coverage to a continuous range without additional training; (3) the generalization of gain units with exponent interpolation to all VAE-based image compression methods while avoiding performance degradation; (4) the introduction of the asymmetric Gaussian entropy model for more accurate entropy estimation, requiring less bit rate to achieve the same distortion level.Overall, the AG-VAE framework offers a promising approach to image compression with continuous rate adaptation and competitive rate-distortion performance.
