Rolling shutter (RS) CMOS cameras have gained popularity in the consumer market, particularly in the mobile phone market, due to their low power consumption, affordability, and compact design. However, video recorded using RS mechanisms often suffers from quality issues, particularly the RS distortion (Jello effect) and motion blur. Existing techniques address rolling shutter correction (RSC) and deblurring as separate problems. RSC methods assume that captured images only have RS distortion, while deblurring methods assume the use of a global shutter (GS). The combination of RS distortion and blur presents a new challenge. Existing methods for blind RSCD under simplified conditions exist but cannot handle freely moving objects in dynamic scenes. The complexity of relative motion in the RSCD problem makes modeling and inferring the latent image difficult and time-consuming. The recent success of deep learning and large-scale datasets has advanced image and video restoration techniques. However, learning-based RSCD methods are still limited by the lack of suitable datasets. The only available public dataset, Fastec-RS, is for pure RSC and does not cover the realistic RSCD scenario. This paper introduces the Beam-Splitter Rolling Shutter Correction and Deblurring (BS-RSCD) dataset, the first dataset for the real-world RSCD task. The dataset is captured using a well-designed beam-splitter acquisition system that simultaneously captures RS distorted and blurry video pairs and GS sharp video. Deep learning is explored to address the realistic RSCD problem using BS-RSCD. The complexity of BS-RSCD presents a challenge for existing neural network architectures. Experiments show that existing methods either destroy the geometric structure of the scene or fail to recover details from motion blur. To address this, a novel joint correction and deblurring model (JCD) is proposed, which incorporates the advantages of both RSC and deblurring neural network architectures. JCD utilizes a deformable attention module to fuse bi-directional warped features and non-warped deblurring features at multiple scales. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both RSC and RSCD tasks and validate the effectiveness of the BS-RSCD dataset.
