Point cloud upsampling is a critical task in computer science, as it aims to generate a dense and uniform point set from locally sparse and non-uniform raw point clouds. This paper introduces a novel approach to point cloud upsampling by disentangling the task into two sub-goals: generating a coarse but dense point set, and refining the points for better surface coverage. The proposed method consists of two cascaded sub-networks, a dense generator and a spatial refiner, designed to achieve these sub-goals. The spatial refiner incorporates local and global refinement units to consider both local and global geometric structures, and utilizes a residual-learning strategy for fine-tuning the coarse outputs. Compared to existing methods, the proposed disentangled refinement pipeline assigns lower requirements to each sub-network, allowing them to focus more on their specific sub-goals. The cascading scheme enables the two sub-networks to complement each other during network learning, resulting in improved performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on both real-scanned and synthetic inputs.
