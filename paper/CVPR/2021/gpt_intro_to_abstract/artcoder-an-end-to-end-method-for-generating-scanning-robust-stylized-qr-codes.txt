With the widespread use of smartphones, Quick Response (QR) codes have become one of the most popular types of two-dimensional codes. However, traditional QR codes are visually unattractive and meaningless to human vision. In recent years, efforts have been made to beautify QR codes by adding visual semantics or aesthetic elements. However, these approaches have limited options for personalized styles. To address this limitation, we propose an end-to-end method called Art-Coder that uses Neural Style Transfer (NST) to generate stylized QR codes. These stylized codes combine the visual effect of stylized images with the functionality of QR codes, resulting in personalized, diverse, and scanning-robust codes. One major challenge in generating stylized QR codes is maintaining scanning-robustness after applying artistic styles. Previous methods attempted to repair errors caused by stylization, but the repaired modules were not well-fused with the entire image. In contrast, Art-Coder simultaneously stylizes the image and fuses it with the QR code message, achieving both scanning-robustness and visual quality. We propose three key improvements, including a Sampling-Simulation (SS) layer to extract the encoding message of QR codes, a module-based code loss to preserve scanning-robustness, and a competition mechanism to enhance both visual quality and scanning-robustness. The main contributions of our work are the introduction of Art-Coder as an end-to-end method for generating personalized, diverse, and scanning-robust stylized QR codes, the development of a Sampling-Simulation layer and a module-based code loss to preserve scanning-robustness, and the implementation of a competition mechanism to ensure high-quality stylized QR codes in terms of both visual effect and scanning-robustness.
