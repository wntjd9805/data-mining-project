Visual recognition tasks in computer science have made significant progress with the advent of deep learning, particularly in classification, detection, and segmentation. However, one still challenging aspect is amodal perception, which refers to reasoning about occluded parts of objects. Humans are able to easily interpolate occluded portions, but current vision models struggle in this area. To address this gap, recent research has focused on methods to infer the occluded parts of objects, such as estimating invisible segmentation and recovering invisible content. This paper specifically aims to tackle the problem of estimating invisible masks and appearance content for humans, which is referred to as human de-occlusion. Human de-occlusion is a crucial task as completing human bodies is essential for various vision tasks, including portrait editing, 3D mesh generation, and pose estimation. However, human de-occlusion introduces new challenges due to the non-rigid nature of humans, the context relations between humans and backgrounds, and the need to recognize occluded body parts. This paper presents a two-stage framework for human de-occlusion, where the first stage segments the invisible portions of humans and the second stage recovers the content inside these regions. The proposed framework utilizes a stacked hourglass network for progressive segmentation and incorporates human parsing pseudo labels and typical pose masks. In the second stage, a parsing guided attention (PGA) module is introduced to capture and consolidate context information from visible portions to recover the missing content. To evaluate the proposed method, an Amodal Human Perception dataset (AHP) is introduced, which offers advantages such as a larger number of humans, ground-truth annotations from real-world scenes, and expected occlusion distributions. The contributions of this paper include the two-stage framework for human de-occlusion, a stacked network structure for progressive mask completion, the PGA module for context information extraction, and the AHP dataset for evaluating human de-occlusion.
