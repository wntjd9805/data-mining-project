Fast moving objects (FMOs) present a challenging problem in image processing and computer vision tasks. Previous methods have focused on addressing low to medium blur caused by global camera motion or moderate object speed. However, specialized algorithms for deblurring FMOs have only recently been introduced. FMO detection is important in tracking sports with fast object motion and in autonomous driving to detect impacts. FMOs can also be found in various scenarios such as capturing falling or thrown objects or in low-light conditions. This paper proposes DeFMO, a generative model that reconstructs the contours and appearance of FMOs. By disentangling the blurred object from the background and using a rendering network, DeFMO can render sharp sub-frames capturing the motion in time. The proposed method is trained on a synthetic dataset with complex objects and achieves state-of-the-art trajectory and sharp appearance reconstruction of FMOs. The paper introduces a new synthetic dataset and provides the model implementation for further research. Overall, the contributions of this paper include the first fully neural network model for FMO deblurring, novel self-supervised losses for training, and a new synthetic dataset.
