Personalized outfit recommendation is a task that involves predicting whether a set of fashion items form a well-matched outfit that fits the taste of a specific user. This task has various applications in fashion-oriented social networks and online shopping. However, mining the compatibility relationships between items and capturing the diverse fashion preferences of different users presents challenges. Previous research has mainly focused on studying compatibility between pairs of fashion items or using pairwise approaches for outfits consisting of multiple items, which fail to capture high-order relations. Additionally, a user's personal taste is crucial for outfit recommendation, and incorporating user preference has been shown to significantly improve performance. A common difficulty in personalized recommendation problems is the limited number of historical samples for each user, particularly for new users with minimal rated outfits. Existing methods for personalized outfit recommendation typically combine data from multiple users to model the content of fashion items, but the parameters characterizing users' preferences are still learned only from each user's own data, making it difficult to learn these parameters well with a small number of corresponding training outfits. In this work, we address these issues by treating outfit compatibility prediction as a set-input problem and using the self-attention mechanism to model interactions between fashion items. We also introduce a learnable personalized anchor embedding (LPAE) approach to better capture diverse user tastes. By representing outfits and users as points in an outfit style space and measuring user preferences using anchor-outfit similarity, we can effectively model user preferences even with limited training data. We provide examples of the new user "cold start" problem, where each user only provides one outfit as a reference, and show how the anchor-outfit similarity can serve as a bridge to measure outfit-to-outfit and user-to-user relations, resulting in interpretable recommendation results.
