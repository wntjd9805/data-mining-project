This paper introduces the Coarse-to-Fine Few-Shot (C2FS) task in machine learning, where a model is pre-trained on a set of base classes and needs to adapt to support finer-grained subclasses with only a few labeled examples. In previous few-shot learning works, the new classes were often separate from the known classes or at the same level of granularity. However, this paper addresses the practical situation where the new classes are fine-grained subclasses of the known classes. The authors propose the ANCOR approach, which combines supervised pre-training on coarse classes with contrastive self-supervised learning to facilitate the separation of fine sub-classes in the feature space. They introduce a novel angular normalization component to enhance the synergy between the two learning tasks. Extensive evaluation and analysis show the effectiveness of the proposed ANCOR approach on various datasets compared to different baselines. This paper contributes by introducing the C2FS task, proposing the ANCOR approach, and providing a comprehensive evaluation of its performance.
