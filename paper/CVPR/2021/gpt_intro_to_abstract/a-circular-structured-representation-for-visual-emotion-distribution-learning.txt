Emotion plays a significant role in human behavior and daily life. With the rise of social networks, people increasingly express their emotions through sharing images online. Visual Emotion Analysis (VEA) has become an important research area, aiming to understand how people emotionally respond to visual stimuli. However, most existing work simplifies VEA as a single-label classification task, overlooking the complexity and subjectivity of human emotions. In reality, different individuals may have different emotions towards the same image, and even one person may experience multiple emotions towards one image. This paper proposes a Label Distribution Learning (LDL) approach to address VEA as a multi-label task, considering the ambiguity and subjectivity inherent in emotions. The paper also introduces a circular-structured representation called the Emotion Circle, inspired by psychological models, to effectively capture the intrinsic relationships between emotions. A systematic approach is proposed to map any emotion distribution to a compound emotion vector on the Emotion Circle. Additionally, a Progressive Circular loss function is designed to measure the dissimilarities between labeled and predicted emotion vectors, taking into account the circular nature of emotions. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several emotion distribution datasets. This work contributes to the systematic exploitation of emotion relationships as prior knowledge for visual emotion distribution learning, and provides a novel circular-structured representation and loss function for more accurate emotion analysis.
