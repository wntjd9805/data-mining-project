Deepfake techniques, which generate highly realistic fake videos, have recently made significant progress, raising concerns about their potential misuse. To address this, several deepfake detection approaches have been proposed, typically treating the problem as a binary classification task (real/fake) using global features extracted from suspect images. However, as deepfakes become more realistic, the differences between real and fake videos become subtle and local, requiring more nuanced detection methods.In this paper, inspired by the success of parts-based models in fine-grained classification tasks, we propose a novel multi-attention network for deepfake detection. The network uses multiple attention heads to predict spatial attention maps, allowing it to focus on different potential artifact regions. To avoid fine details being lost in deeper layers, we enhance textural features from shallow layers and combine them with high-level semantic features as the representation for each local part. These representations are then independently pooled and fused to form the overall image representation.However, training a multi-attentional network is challenging because it cannot rely on explicit video-level labels like single-attention networks. To overcome this, we introduce a new attention-guided data augmentation mechanism and a regional independence loss to encourage attention heads to focus on different local parts.We evaluate our multi-attention network on several existing datasets, including FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, and DFDC. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms vanilla binary classifiers and achieves state-of-the-art performance in deepfake detection.In summary, this paper makes three contributions: (1) reformulating deepfake detection as a fine-grained classification task, (2) proposing a multi-attentional network architecture with attention-guided data augmentation and a regional independence loss, and (3) demonstrating superior detection performance compared to baseline methods through extensive experiments.
