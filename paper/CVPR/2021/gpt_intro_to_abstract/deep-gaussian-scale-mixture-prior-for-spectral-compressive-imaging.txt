Hyperspectral images (HSIs) provide more accurate descriptions of material characteristics compared to traditional RGB images. HSIs are valuable for various computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and tracking. Coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) systems have been developed to capture 3D HSIs at video rate by using a physical mask and a disperser to modulate different wavelength signals. Reconstruction algorithms play a crucial role in CASSI, and previous model-based methods used hand-crafted priors to regularize the reconstruction process. Deep learning-based HSI reconstruction methods have also been proposed, leveraging the success of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for natural image restoration. In this paper, we propose an interpretable HSI reconstruction method with a learned Gaussian Scale Mixture (GSM) prior. The contributions of our method include proposing learned GSM models to exploit spatial-spectral correlations, estimating local means and spatial-spectral similarity weights using a DCNN, formulating the HSI reconstruction problem as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimation problem, and achieving superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on synthetic and real datasets.
