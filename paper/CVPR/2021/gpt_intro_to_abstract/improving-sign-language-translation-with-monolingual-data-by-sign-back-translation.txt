This paper focuses on the problem of sign language understanding and translation, which is crucial for improving communication and reducing social isolation among the deaf community. The authors propose a sign back-translation (SignBT) approach to address the limited availability of parallel sign language and spoken language data. The SignBT approach involves training a text-to-gloss translator and a gloss-to-sign converter to generate synthetic parallel data for sign language translation training. The authors also introduce a new large-scale sign language translation benchmark, CSL-Daily, which provides a comprehensive dataset for sign language research. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SignBT mechanism in improving sign language translation models and the significance of using monolingual data for training. This work contributes to the advancement of sign language translation technology and provides valuable resources for further research in sign language recognition, translation, and generation.
