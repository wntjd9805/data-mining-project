Salient object detection is a process that aims to identify visually distinctive regions in a single image, similar to how the human vision system works. Co-saliency detection (CoSD) extends this task and focuses on discovering salient foreground objects among a group of images. This research topic has gained attention due to its potential applications in various vision tasks, such as image and video segmentation, object co-localization, and weakly supervised semantic segmentation.Traditionally, CoSD has been approached as a two-step procedure. Hand-engineered features, including low-level features, mid-level attributes, and multi-cue fusion, are used to describe visual representations. These features are then fed into a subsequent module to identify co-saliency. However, hand-engineered features are limited in their ability to adapt to variations in object appearances and complex background textures.Recently, deep learning-based approaches have been developed to improve CoSD by extracting robust and richer visual representations and exploring semantic correlations between images. End-to-end deep learning frameworks have also been proposed to integrate feature learning and saliency map prediction. Additionally, deep graph neural networks have been used to model non-local and long-range dependencies for CoSD. While these methods have shown promising results, there are still challenges that need to be addressed.In this paper, we propose a novel deep network architecture called DeepACG for CoSD. DeepACG leverages the semantic-aware contrast Gromov-Wasserstein distance to capture accurate pixel-pair correspondences while incorporating structured information. We also introduce a Semantic-aware Co-Attention Module (SCAM) to enhance the co-salient regions by predicting the semantic categories of the objects and modulating this information to refine the localized semantic regions. Furthermore, we present a contrast Edge-Enhanced Module (EEM) to generate fine-grained segmentation for the boundaries of the co-salient objects.Our contributions include the adoption of GW distance to extract dense 4D correlation volumes and find correspondences between target and source image domains, the development of SCAM to enhance co-occurring salient regions based on semantic information, the introduction of EEM to improve boundary segmentation, and extensive experiments on three challenging datasets that demonstrate the superiority of our approach.Overall, our proposed DeepACG architecture addresses key challenges in CoSD and achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets.
