Despite the remarkable performance of deep neural networks (DNNs), they often suffer from overfitting when the training dataset is inadequate in terms of quality or quantity. Quality refers to how well the data represents the true distribution of inputs in the task at hand, allowing the model to learn essential patterns for inference. Quantity, on the other hand, enables the model to observe discriminative patterns from different perspectives and generalize accordingly. While analytically analyzing these properties of data remains challenging, empirical studies consistently show that incorporating more data leads to improved generalization. As a result, data augmentation techniques have become essential in training paradigms, aiming to expand the training set by transforming images within the existing dataset.Traditional image data augmentation techniques involve various context-preserving transformations, such as horizontal flip, crop, scale, color manipulation, and cut out. Recent efforts have focused on optimizing augmentation policies automatically, aiming to enhance the augmentation process. However, most of these methods focus on transforming individual images, neglecting the potential benefits of combining multiple images for augmentation. To address this limitation, several studies have explored the combination of multiple images to generate novel ones. However, these approaches either blindly mix images without considering salient regions or fail to scale to large-scale problems. Additionally, the current mixing functions often lead to the suppression of visual patterns, resulting in inaccurate pseudo labels and limiting the training performance.This paper proposes a novel mixing augmentation approach called SuperMix, which leverages the salient regions of input images to construct more effective mixed data. The supervision for this augmentation can be obtained from the target model itself or a more sophisticated model guiding a student network through knowledge transfer. The paper provides a visual comparison of mixed images generated by different methods, highlighting the superiority of SuperMix. The contributions of the paper include the formalization of the supervised mixing augmentation problem, the careful constraint of the optimization problem to ensure rich salient features and realistic image priors, the development of a modified Newton iterative algorithm for SuperMix, suitable for large-scale applications, and the demonstration of how mixed images facilitate smooth predictions and reveal knowledge from the teacher model through knowledge distillation.In summary, this paper presents SuperMix, an innovative mixing augmentation approach that utilizes salient regions in input images to construct superior mixed data. The method addresses the limitations of existing techniques and provides significant improvements in performance, scalability, and knowledge distillation.
