Person re-identification (Re-ID) is an important task in surveillance systems, aiming to identify individuals across different cameras. Deep Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promising results in supervised person Re-ID methods, but they suffer from limited applicability and performance degradation on unseen domains. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods have been introduced to address this problem, but they still require data collection for updating the model on the target domain. Domain generalization (DG) approaches, on the other hand, do not require target images for training a model, making them more practical for real-world applications. However, existing DG methods do not consider the specific requirements of person Re-ID, where the source and target domains have different label spaces for a retrieval task.Recent DG methods for person Re-ID have focused on batch normalization (BN) and instance normalization (IN), but they suffer from limitations such as the loss of discriminative information and the inability to attenuate new styles in unseen domains. To address these issues, we propose a novel generalizable Re-ID framework called Meta Batch-Instance Normalization (MetaBIN). In MetaBIN, we simulate unsuccessful generalization scenarios within a meta-learning pipeline and learn more generalized representations. We design a batch-instance normalization with learnable balancing parameters between BN and IN to handle under-style-normalization and over-style-normalization scenarios. We also diversify the virtual simulations through a meta-train loss and a cyclic inner-updating manner to boost generalization capability. Experimental results demonstrate that MetaBIN achieves state-of-the-art performance on large-scale domain generalization Re-ID benchmarks and cross-domain Re-ID problems.
