Object segmentation is a crucial step in image recognition, and deep learning has greatly improved the performance of semantic and instance segmentation. However, annotating pixel-level masks for training data is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Weakly supervised methods, using less detailed annotations such as bounding boxes or image-level tags, have been proposed as alternatives. This paper focuses on the use of bounding box annotations and introduces a bounding box attribution map (BBAM) to localize objects within the bounding boxes. The BBAM utilizes attribution maps obtained from a trained object detector to identify the areas occupied by the objects. This pixel-level localization can serve as pseudo ground truth for weakly supervised learning of semantic and instance segmentation. The main contributions include the proposal of BBAM, which outperforms previous methods in weakly supervised segmentation, and an analysis of the BBAM from various perspectives. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2017 benchmarks.
