Camouflage, the concealment of animals or objects for the purpose of making them difficult to detect or disguising them as something else, has valuable applications in various fields. Camouflaged object segmentation (COS) plays a crucial role in numerous areas such as medical diagnosis, industry, agriculture, security and surveillance, scientific research, and art. However, COS is a challenging task due to the need to deceive the visual perceptual system by leveraging the high intrinsic similarities between the target object and the background. Early methods based on handcrafted low-level features had limited capabilities, while deep learning-based approaches have shown some improvement but still leave room for further exploration. Inspired by the natural mechanisms of prey and predators, we propose a bio-inspired solution called the Positioning and Focus Network (PFNet) for accurate COS. PFNet consists of a positioning module (PM) and a focus module (FM), which mimic the detection and identification processes in predation. The PM leverages channel and spatial attention blocks to capture long-range semantic dependencies and infer the initial location of target objects from a global perspective. The FM explores multi-scale contexts to discover and remove distractions, progressively refining the segmentation results. We introduce the concept of distraction and develop a novel distraction mining strategy to improve the accuracy of camouflaged object segmentation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of PFNet, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our contributions include the distraction mining strategy, the PFNet framework, and the improved COS performance.
