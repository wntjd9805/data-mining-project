Automated segmentation of abdominal organs and tumors in computed tomography (CT) scans is a crucial task in medical image analysis. This task has various applications in computer-aided diagnosis, but it is challenging due to the difficulty and cost of annotating large datasets at the voxel level. As a result, most benchmark datasets only have annotations for one type of organ or tumor, with all other structures labeled as background. This partially labeling issue presents a significant challenge in learning representations for multiple organs and tumors.Existing approaches handle this problem by dividing the partially labeled dataset into fully labeled subsets and training separate networks for each segmentation task. Another solution is using a multi-head network with a shared encoder and multiple task-specific decoders. However, both these approaches have limitations. Training multiple networks significantly increases computational complexity, while the inflexible multi-head architecture cannot easily be extended to new tasks.In this paper, we propose a dynamic on-demand network (DoDNet) for multi-organ and tumor segmentation. DoDNet is an encoder-decoder network with a single dynamic head. This dynamic head is capable of segmenting multiple organs and tumors, similar to multiple networks or a multi-head network. The kernels in the dynamic head are generated adaptively by a controller, which takes input images and task-specific priors as conditioning. This approach reduces computational costs compared to a multi-head network.We evaluate the effectiveness of DoDNet on seven organ and tumor segmentation benchmarks, including the liver, kidneys, hepatic vessels, pancreas, colon tumors, and spleen. Additionally, we demonstrate the transferability of DoDNet's weights to downstream annotation-limited segmentation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on a challenging dataset.Our contributions are three-fold: 1. We propose a single network with a dynamic segmentation head that can effectively handle the partially labeling issue, enabling the segmentation of multiple organs and tumors.2. The dynamic segmentation head in our model is adaptive to the input and assigned task, resulting in improved efficiency and flexibility compared to traditional fixed segmentation heads.3. DoDNet, pretrained on partially labeled datasets, can be transferred to downstream annotation-limited segmentation tasks, providing valuable assistance to the medical community when limited annotations are available for 3D image segmentation.
