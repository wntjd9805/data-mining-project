Surface reconstruction from point clouds is a crucial task in digital representation of the world, especially with the advancement of scanning devices that facilitate data acquisition. However, this problem is challenging due to its ill-posed nature, as there could be infinite solutions for the continuous surface given the discrete approximation of point clouds, especially when the points are noisy, irregularly distributed, or incomplete. Traditional methods address this problem by using analytic priors such as local linearity and smoothness, but their performance is hindered by sensing imperfections or the unavailability of surface normals. In recent years, deep neural networks have been introduced to learn geometric priors from auxiliary shapes, showing superior performance compared to classical methods. These approaches either globally embed the shape into a latent space or learn local shape priors by decomposing the global modeling into local ones. However, these methods rely on learning priors from auxiliary training sets, which limits their generalization to unseen shapes. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel method called Sign-Agnostic Implicit Learning of Surface Self-Similarities (SAIL-S3), which directly learns shape priors from the input data themselves. The proposed method is motivated by the observation that self-similar shape patterns of local surface patches repeat across an entire object surface, similar to self-similarities in 2D images. To implement this phenomenon for surface modeling and reconstruction, SAIL-S3 partitions a global implicit surface field into adaptive local subfields and incorporates designs that promote correlated latent representations for similar surface patches. The proposed method is a local framework for sign-agnostic implicit surface modeling, different from existing methods that deform initial meshes or learn priors from auxiliary training sets. Experimental results on ShapeNet and Threedscans datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SAIL-S3 in reconstructing high-quality object surfaces from raw point clouds, without the need for auxiliary training shapes. The proposed method outperforms existing methods in terms of reconstructing smooth and sharp surfaces, and is robust to noisy inputs. The technical contributions of this work include a novel method for surface modeling and reconstruction, the use of adaptively learned local implicit functions, and a global post-optimization strategy for sign flipping to improve the consistency of the reconstructed surfaces.
