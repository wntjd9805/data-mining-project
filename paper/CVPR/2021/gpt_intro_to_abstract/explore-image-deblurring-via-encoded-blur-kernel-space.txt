Motion blur is a common issue in images caused by camera shake or fast-moving objects. Image deblurring, the task of removing blur artifacts to enhance image quality, has significant implications in the era of mobile devices and handheld cameras. However, despite numerous research efforts, image deblurring remains an unsolved problem. Mathematically, image deblurring involves recovering the sharp image (x) from a blurry image (y) using the mathematical model: y = ˆF(x, k) + ⌘, where ˆF(·, k) represents the blur operator with the blur kernel (k) and ⌘ denotes noise. The challenge lies in accurately defining prior distributions (P(x) and P(k)) to maximize the posterior probability (P(x, k|y)).Existing methods approach image deblurring through either handcrafted priors or learning the deep image prior. However, these methods assume a convolutional blur operator, which is not practical for real-world scenarios and often leads to undesired artifacts in deblurred images.An alternative approach is to directly learn a function mapping blurry images to their non-blurry counterparts using deep convolutional networks. Yet, this approach fails to generalize beyond the blur kernels present in the training set. Testing on blur operators not encountered during training results in poor performance.To address these limitations, we propose a deep-learning formulation that explicitly represents the blur kernel and operator. We adopt a data-driven approach to learn the family of blur operators and the latent manifold of blur kernels, rather than assuming a convolutional operator. Our proposed method simultaneously learns a blur operator family (F) and blur kernel extractor (G). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in deblurring images with unseen blur operators.Furthermore, our method can be applied to blur synthesis by transferring the blur kernel of a sharp-blurry image pair to another image. This synthesis technique has various applications, such as data augmentation and improving the robustness of tasks like face recognition and eye gaze estimation.In summary, our contributions include: (1) the proposal of a novel method to encode the blur kernel space for a dataset of blur-sharp image pairs, enabling deblurring of images with unseen blur operators; (2) the introduction of a novel blur synthesis method and its versatile utilities; and (3) achieving state-of-the-art deblurring results on multiple datasets.
