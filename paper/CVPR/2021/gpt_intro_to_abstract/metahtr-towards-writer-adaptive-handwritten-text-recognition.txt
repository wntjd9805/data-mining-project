Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is a challenging problem in computer vision due to the diverse and unique nature of handwritten texts. Existing deep learning-based HTR models often struggle to generalize to unseen writing styles, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning approach, called MetaHTR, for writer-adaptive HTR. Our approach allows the model to quickly adapt to new writing styles using a small set of examples during testing. To address the specific challenges of HTR, we introduce a character-wise cross-entropy loss and instance-specific weights to prioritize learning from more discrepant characters. Our empirical evaluation shows that MetaHTR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our contributions include defining the problem of writer-adaptive HTR, introducing a meta-learning framework with learnable instance-wise weights, and demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in improving recognition accuracy.
