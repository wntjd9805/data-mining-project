Anomaly detection (AD) is an important task in computer vision with applications in industrial quality control and health monitoring. Traditionally, AD methods have focused on detecting broadly different anomalies, but there is a growing interest in detecting subtle anomalies and localizing them precisely. However, existing methods struggle to perform well in both scenarios and lack generalizability to unseen datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge distillation method for AD using pre-trained networks. Our method distills the comprehensive knowledge of an ImageNet pre-trained network into a simpler cloner network, enabling the cloner to learn the normal data manifold thoroughly without gaining knowledge about possible anomalous data. We also propose a gradient-based approach for precise anomaly localization without the need for expensive region-based training and testing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models in both anomaly detection and localization tasks on various datasets. Additionally, our method has a computationally inexpensive and stable training process and allows for real-time anomaly localization. Overall, our contributions include enabling comprehensive knowledge transfer, providing a computationally efficient and stable training process, enabling real-time and precise anomaly localization, and outperforming previous state-of-the-art models on multiple datasets.
