In this paper, we address the challenges of automatic processing of sign languages, specifically focusing on fingerspelling recognition in American Sign Language (ASL). Fingerspelling involves signing words letter by letter using distinct handshapes or trajectories. It plays a significant role in ASL communication, accounting for 12% to 35% of ASL usage. We highlight the need for dedicated fingerspelling detection and recognition modules due to its unique characteristics and potential practical applications.Previous studies have mainly focused on fingerspelling recognition assuming the input sequence is purely fingerspelling or extracted from longer sign language sequences through human annotation. However, for practical fingerspelling recognition "in the wild", automatic detection of fingerspelling is essential. Fingerspelling detection is a challenging task that differs from typical action detection, as fingerspelling handshapes are highly heterogeneous and are also used in non-fingerspelled signs. Moreover, the effectiveness of fingerspelling detection should be evaluated in the context of downstream recognition models.To tackle these challenges, we propose a detection model that incorporates articulated pose (handshape) and a fingerspelling recognizer in its training. We demonstrate that this multi-task learning approach outperforms baseline detection models that omit pose and/or recognition losses. Our approach is the first to demonstrate the influence of fingerspelling detection on fully automatic fingerspelling recognition in real-world scenarios.In addition to presenting our novel detection model, we contribute by proposing an evaluation framework for fingerspelling detection that includes downstream recognition metrics. We also introduce a benchmark dataset based on an extended publicly available dataset. We investigate various approaches for fingerspelling detection, adapting techniques from fingerspelling recognition and action detection. Our proposed multi-task learning approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark dataset across all evaluation metrics.Overall, this research enhances our understanding of fingerspelling recognition in sign languages, emphasizing the importance of fingerspelling detection for practical applications and providing a framework and benchmark for evaluating detection methods.
