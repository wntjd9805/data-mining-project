Lane detection is a critical component of autonomous driving systems (ADS) as it provides crucial information for decision-making and precise positioning. Recent advancements in lane detection have been driven by convolutional neural networks (CNNs), with existing methods leveraging frameworks such as semantic segmentation and object detection. However, these frameworks have limitations when it comes to detecting curved lane lines and accurately representing local positions and global shapes simultaneously.In this paper, we propose a novel lane marker detection method called FOLOLane that focuses on modeling local geometry and integrating it into global results in a bottom-up manner. Our approach predicts the geometry of lane markers by estimating adjacent keypoints on the lane. We use a fully convolutional network to capture keypoints in the local scope, with one head determining the probability of keypoints appearing in pixel space and another head providing the offset between keypoints and the most spatially correlated local lane marker. This allows for refinement of keypoint positions and association between keypoints on the same lane markers. Two decoding algorithms are proposed to predict the global geometry of lane markers based on the local information.Compared to existing methods, our approach concentrates the capabilities of CNNs on a local scale, reducing task complexity and output dimension. This compact output leads to stable and efficient training without additional effort in network architecture design and data collection. Our bottom-up solution achieves state-of-the-art performance on public datasets, with an accuracy of 96.92% on TuSimple and an F1 score of 78.8% on CULane. Additionally, our method shows excellent generalization and compatibility with different CNN architectures.We emphasize that our approach is the first to formulate lane detection as a multi-keypoint estimation and association problem, inspired by the bottom-up human pose estimation framework. By focusing on the local scope and avoiding inaccurate predictions far from the anchor, our method overcomes limitations of detection-based and segmentation-based approaches. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the potential of applying pose estimation approaches to lane detection, opening up new possibilities for solving this important application problem. Our method shows superior accuracy, efficiency, and generalization, making it a promising solution for lane detection in autonomous driving systems.
