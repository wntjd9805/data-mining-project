Professional photography is often expensive due to the complexity involved in capturing a well-composed photo. Composition, referring to the arrangement of visual elements, is a crucial factor in photography. However, achieving aesthetic composition typically requires expert knowledge and training. This paper aims to explore if ordinary individuals can compose photos like professional photographers and popularize this knowledge for everyday use. Specifically, the paper introduces a cropping-by-composition paradigm and proposes the Composition-Aware Cropping Network (CACNet) to explicitly model composition rules within the network. The assumption is made that composition rules are learnable, based on the observation that composition follows basic arrangements of visual elements. CACNet consists of a composition branch and a cropping branch, where the composition branch categorizes images into specific composition rules and generates class activation maps (CAMs) that inform the cropping branch about important composition elements. The cropping branch then uses an anchor-point regressor to generate the final cropping output. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, interpretability, and speed of CACNet, positioning it as a state-of-the-art solution in image cropping that explicitly models composition rules and brings interpretability into the process.
