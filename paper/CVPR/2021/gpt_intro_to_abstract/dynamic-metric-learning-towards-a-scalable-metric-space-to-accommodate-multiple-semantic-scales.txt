This paper introduces the concept of dynamic range to deep metric learning for visual recognition. The dynamic range, borrowed from metrology, is the flexibility of a metric to accommodate various scales. Visual concepts in recognition tasks also have different semantic scales, and current deep metric learning tasks do not consider this dynamic range. The paper argues that incorporating the dynamic range can enhance the generalization ability of deep visual recognition. The importance of the dynamic range is illustrated through a comparison with real-world metric tools. A single-scaled metric in current deep metric learning tasks lacks flexibility and may become inaccurate if the scale of interest changes. To address this limitation, the paper introduces the task of Dynamic Metric Learning (DyML), which aims to learn a scalable metric space capable of accommodating multiple semantic scales. The paper presents three datasets for DyML based on vehicles, animals, and products, each with different semantic scales. Popular deep metric learning methods are benchmarked on these datasets, and the challenging nature of DyML is highlighted. To mitigate the conflict between different scales, the paper proposes a method called Cross-Scale Learning (CSL), which improves the dynamic range and consistently enhances the baseline performance. This paper makes four contributions: the introduction of DyML, the construction of DyML datasets, the benchmarking of DyML with popular metric learning methods, and the proposal of CSL as an approach to improve dynamic range.
