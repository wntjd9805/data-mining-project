Abstract:Camouflage is an important skill in nature, allowing certain animals to hide from predators by blending in with their surroundings. The ability of camouflage, closely related to human perception, has become a topic of increasing research interest. It is difficult for humans to quickly spot camouflaged animals or objects, potentially due to the design of our visual system, which may focus on detecting topological properties rather than identifying camouflaged entities. However, the topic of how machines can compensate for this "flaw" in human perception remains underexplored in computer vision.This paper focuses on the task of camouflaged object detection (COD), which involves identifying a camouflaged object from its background. COD has valuable applications in various domains such as image retrieval, species discovery, and medical image analysis. Existing deep learning models struggle with distinguishing between foreground objects and background surroundings, leading to the need for additional knowledge extraction from shared context to enhance COD representations. However, there are three major open issues in current approaches: the lack of investigation into the collaborative relationship between COD and its auxiliary task, the failure to incorporate higher-order guidance information, and the neglect of edge disruption as a key factor in camouflage.To address these drawbacks, this paper proposes a novel Mutual Graph Learning (MGL) model. MGL aims to exploit the mutual benefits between COD and its auxiliary task, camouflaged object-aware edge extraction (COEE). The MGL model incorporates a well-designed architecture that promotes interaction and cooperation between the two tasks. Unlike existing approaches that naively fuse learned features, MGL explicitly reasons about the complementary relations between COD and COEE using two graph-based interaction functions. These functions mine semantic guidance information and enhance true edge visibility, which in turn improves representation learning for both tasks.The effectiveness of MGL is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various benchmarks. MGL outperforms strong baselines and current state-of-the-art methods, setting new records on popular benchmarks such as CHAMELEON, CAMO, and COD10K. The contributions of this work include a novel graph-based mutual learning approach for camouflaged object detection, carefully designed graph-based interaction functions for fully mining typed guidance information, and state-of-the-art results on widely-used benchmarks.
