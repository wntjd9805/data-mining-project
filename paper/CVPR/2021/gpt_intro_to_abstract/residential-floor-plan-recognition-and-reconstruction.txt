Architectural floor plans are widely used for interior design and remodeling purposes. However, existing floor plan images are rendered as rasterized versions of vector-graphics representations, limiting the flexibility for modification. This paper addresses the need for accurately recovering vectorized information from pixel images, discussing the challenges and limitations of traditional methods. The integration of deep learning technology is proposed as a solution, combining various information such as room structure, types, symbols, text, and scale. The paper introduces a novel floor plan recognition and reconstruction system based on deep learning, which outperforms existing methods. Additionally, a dataset containing 7000 annotated residential apartment images is presented. The paper presents technical contributions including an automatic framework for floor plan recognition and reconstruction, an iterative optimization-based vectorization method, a systematic method for scale recognition, and the largest residential floor plan image dataset with detailed annotations.
