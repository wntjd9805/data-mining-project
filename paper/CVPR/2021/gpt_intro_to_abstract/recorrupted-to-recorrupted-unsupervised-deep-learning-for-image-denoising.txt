Image denoising is a fundamental problem in image processing, aiming to remove random noise from input images to improve their signal-to-noise ratios. Deep learning has been the main driving force in developing image denoisers, but most existing deep learning-based denoisers require a large number of noisy/clean image pairs for training, which can be costly and challenging to obtain. This has led to an increasing interest in unsupervised learning methods for image denoising, which do not require ground truth images. However, the performance of unsupervised methods is still not comparable to that of their supervised counterparts. This paper proposes a new unsupervised learning method for image denoising called Recorrupted-to-Recorrupted (R2R). R2R is trained on a dataset of unorganized noisy images without truth or pairwise correspondence. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance among existing unsupervised methods and is competitive with supervised methods for image denoising. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of R2R for denoising synthetic and real-world images. This paper contributes a simple and flexible unsupervised learning technique for image denoising that achieves comparable performance to supervised methods.
