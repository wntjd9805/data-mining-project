This paper introduces the problem of Multiple Rotation Averaging (MRA) in Computer Vision and its importance in various applications such as Structure-From-Motion (SfM) and visual SLAM. The paper highlights the challenges in MRA, including the nonlinearity of rotation matrices, imprecise initialization methods, and handling incorrect relative orientations. The paper then presents a novel end-to-end trainable neural network approach for MRA. The core of the proposed method is a graph-convolution-based Multi-Source Propagator (MSP) that computes initial absolute orientations for all nodes in the view-graph. Unlike previous methods, MSP considers information from all neighbors to calculate the rotation of a node, allowing reliable edges to be favored and minimizing the impact of outliers. Furthermore, the paper introduces a graph-based Appearance-Geometry Fusion (AGF) network that utilizes image context and corner points to evaluate the quality of each edge in the view-graph. AGF effectively learns to weight each edge based on the error in the measured relative orientations, outperforming conventional methods that rely on hand-crafted features or loop consistency constraints.The proposed method also includes a fine-tuning network, called FineNet, for refining the initial camera orientations obtained from MSP. The paper describes an iterative edge re-weighting process using the Adam optimizer to improve the accuracy and robustness of the results against outliers.The contributions of this work include:1. An end-to-end trainable neural network for MRA.2. The introduction of MSP, a fully differentiable module for rotation averaging initialization.3. The development of AGF, a network that fuses image context and keypoints to detect outliers in relative rotations.4. Superior performance compared to traditional and learning-based state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets.Overall, the proposed method provides a comprehensive solution for MRA, addressing the challenges and achieving improved results in various computer vision applications.
