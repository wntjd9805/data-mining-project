This paper introduces a new method called Fourier Contour Embedding (FCE) for accurately approximating text instance contours. The FCE method models text instance contours in the Fourier domain using the Fourier transformation, which can fit any closed contour with progressive approximation in a robust and simple manner. Compared to existing spatial domain-based methods, the FCE method offers several advantages, including flexibility in fitting any closed contour, compactness of Fourier signature vectors, and simplicity of implementation without complex post-processing.To apply the FCE method to arbitrary-shaped text detection, the authors propose FCENet, which consists of a backbone of ResNet50 with deformable convolutional networks (DCN), feature pyramid networks (FPN), and a Fourier prediction header. The header consists of classification and regression branches. The classification branch predicts text region masks and text center region masks, while the regression branch predicts text Fourier signature vectors in the Fourier domain. The predicted Fourier signature vectors are then used in the Inverse Fourier Transformation (IFT) to reconstruct text contour point sequences. Ground truth text contour point sequences are used as supervision signals for training.Experiments show that FCENet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CTW1500 and Total-Text datasets, particularly on highly-curved text subsets. The proposed FCE method and FCENet demonstrate good representation and generalization abilities for arbitrary-shaped text detection, even with small training datasets.In summary, this paper presents the FCE method and FCENet as effective solutions for accurate and efficient text detection, especially for arbitrary-shaped text contours. The contributions of this work include the development of the FCE method for compact text instance representation in the Fourier domain and the introduction of FCENet, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on relevant datasets.
