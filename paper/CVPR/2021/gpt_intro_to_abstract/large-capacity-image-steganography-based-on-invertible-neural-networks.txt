This paper introduces a large-capacity image steganography approach based on the invertible neural network (INN). Unlike cryptography, which hides the meaning of data, steganography aims to hide the existence of data. Image steganography involves hiding data within an image file, with the host image being the image chosen for hosting the hidden data. The well-designed image steganography system should have both imperceptibility and payload capacity requirements. The container image should avoid arousing suspicion and should be difficult to distinguish from the host image. Existing image steganography solutions struggle to simultaneously achieve good imperceptibility and high payload capacity. Traditional methods hide messages in the spatial, transform, or adaptive domains, with payload capacities around 0.2 - 4 bits per pixel. Recent deep learning-based hiding methods show potential for increasing the hiding capacity but lack a trade-off between making the container statistically indistinguishable and recovering high-quality hidden images. To address these challenges, the paper proposes an Invertible Steganography Network (ISN) based on the INN approach. The ISN considers the task of hiding an image as a special image domain transformation task where the container image should be as close as possible to the host image. The hidden images should also be well reconstructed from the container image. The ISN network consists of two branches, one for the hidden images and one for the host images. The steganography capacity is improved by increasing the number of channels of the hidden image branch. Experimental results show that the proposed method can generate a desired container image with high payloads for hiding images and successfully reveal multiple hidden images. The main contributions of this paper include the introduction of an efficient Invertible Steganography Network (ISN) that effectively solves image steganography and recovery problems. The method significantly improves the steganography payload capacity to 24 - 120 bits per pixel (bpp) and can easily adapt to hide multiple images with high imperceptibility. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art steganography and recovery results.
