Creating high-quality detailed 3D shapes is a complex task that requires expertise. Recent advancements in deep generative neural networks have focused on learning low-dimensional or structural representations of 3D shapes, but have struggled to capture fine geometric details. In this paper, we introduce the problem of 3D shape detailization, which aims to synthesize high-resolution and detailed 3D geometries from a small set of exemplars. We propose a novel generative adversarial network called DECOR-GAN, which leverages voxel representations and a 3D CNN generator to refine coarse shapes into detailed models. By conditioning the refinement process on a detail style code, our approach allows for intuitive control over generated details while ensuring consistency. We train our network adversarially, using masked discriminators to balance the goals of detailization and content preservation. Our method can be trained with a small number of examples and offers a complementary latent space for details. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DECOR-GAN through quantitative evaluations and an ablation study. Our results confirm that our approach outperforms simpler methods that only utilize reconstructive loss.
