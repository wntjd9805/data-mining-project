This paper introduces a novel method for obtaining a bispectral difference image using an event camera with temporally modulated illumination. The bispectral difference, which plays a critical role in various applications involving light absorbing mediums, is typically obtained by subtracting signals captured by conventional digital cameras. However, these cameras suffer from drawbacks such as limited dynamic range and quantization precision. Event cameras, on the other hand, offer superior features such as high dynamic range, temporal resolution, and low power consumption. In this method, temporally modulated light at two wavelengths illuminates a target medium, and the event camera records a series of events triggered by this bispectral illumination. The bispectral difference is read directly as the number of events, bypassing the need for complex operations. The paper presents a prototype imaging system and validates the method through experiments on depth recovery in water and turbid medium concentration estimation. The contributions of this work include the discovery of an analogy between bispectral photometry and event generation mechanism in event cameras, the direct readout of bispectral difference as event numbers, and the feasibility of using event cameras in photometry-based vision tasks such as 3D shape reconstruction in water.
