DenseNets and their variants have become popular in the deep learning community for achieving high performance in various computer vision tasks. One of the key contributions of DenseNets is the use of concatenation-type skip connections, which have been valuable in improving accuracy and efficiency. However, the properties of concatenation-type skip connections, such as gradient propagation and their effect on model performance, have not been thoroughly explored. Dynamical Isometry is a method that quantifies gradient flow in deep neural networks and has been used to study networks with addition-type skip connections like ResNets. Because DenseNet-type skip connections enforce strong structural constraints on gradient propagation, it is important to study their relationship with topology, gradient flow, and model performance. In this paper, we present a new metric called NN-Mass to quantify the topological properties of DNNs with concatenation-type skip connections. We show that NN-Mass is related to Layerwise Dynamical Isometry and that models with similar NN-Mass and width have comparable gradient flow and accuracy. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that models with the same width and NN-Mass achieve similar accuracy regardless of depth, number of parameters, and FLOPS. We also show that NN-Mass can be applied to other types of skip connections like ResNets, Wide-ResNets, and MobileNets. Furthermore, we demonstrate how NN-Mass can be used to design compressed DNNs without extensive training or searching for compressed models, achieving high compression rates with minimal accuracy loss. In summary, our contributions include revealing the influence of topological constraints on gradient propagation and accuracy in DenseNet-type skip connections, proposing the NN-Mass metric for quantifying topological properties of DNNs, experimental validation of NN-Mass on different datasets and skip connection types, and the ability to design compressed models using NN-Mass. The paper is organized as follows: the related work and preliminaries are discussed in Section 2, followed by the description and theoretical analysis of NN-Mass in Section 3. Detailed experimental results are presented in Section 4, and the paper concludes with a summary of our work and contributions in Section 5.
