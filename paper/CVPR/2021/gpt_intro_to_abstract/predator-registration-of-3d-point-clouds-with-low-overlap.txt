Recent advances in 3D feature-based point cloud registration techniques have led to impressive results, with state-of-the-art methods reaching high recall rates and successfully registering a large percentage of scan pairs. However, these achievements are due to lenient evaluation protocols that only consider pairs of point clouds with 30% overlap. In practice, achieving high overlap can be challenging, especially in scenarios such as narrow corridors or densely built-up areas. Additionally, data acquisition can be costly, leading practitioners to aim for a low number of scans with limited overlap. This focus on high-overlap scenarios has neglected the more challenging low-overlap examples, where registration performance rapidly deteriorates for existing methods. Human operators, in contrast, can still register point clouds with low overlap with ease. To address this discrepancy, we construct a low-overlap dataset called 3DLoMatch and analyze the individual modules of the registration pipeline. Our analysis reveals that the key to registering low overlap point clouds lies in learning where to sample feature points rather than improving descriptors. Inspired by this insight, we propose PREDATOR, a neural architecture that learns to detect the overlap region between two scans and focuses on that region when sampling feature points. Our contributions include an analysis of the breakdown of existing registration pipelines in the low-overlap regime, a novel overlap attention block, a refined feature point descriptor scheme, and a new loss function to train matchability scores. We also provide the 3DLoMatch dataset, which contains scan pairs with low overlap. Experimental results demonstrate that PREDATOR outperforms existing methods in the low-overlap regime, improving registration recall by more than 10 percentage points and achieving a new state-of-the-art result on the 3DMatch benchmark with a registration recall of 89%.
