Reference-based Super-Resolution (Ref-SR) has gained significant attention in recent years as an alternative to Single-Image-Super-Resolution (SISR). Ref-SR uses an additional high-resolution (HR) reference image to guide the super-resolution process. The main challenge in Ref-SR is finding accurate correspondences between the input image and the reference image. Existing methods compute correspondences based on content and appearance similarities, but struggle to handle real-world variations such as transformations and resolution disparities.To address these challenges, this paper proposes C2-Matching, a robust reference-based super-resolution technique that explicitly performs cross transformation and cross-resolution matching. For handling the transformation gap, a contrastive correspondence network is employed to learn transformation-robust correspondences. A triplet margin loss is used to minimize the distance of point-wise features before and after transformations, resulting in more accurate correspondences. To tackle the resolution gap, a teacher-student correlation distillation approach is proposed. The teacher network, trained for HR-HR matching, transfers its knowledge to guide the more ambiguous LR-HR matching. This enables the contrastive correspondence network to compute more accurate correspondences for texture regions.After obtaining correspondences, a dynamic aggregation module is used to fuse information from the reference images and transfer the HR textures. The proposed C2-Matching approach achieves significant improvement on the CUFED5 dataset compared to existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate that C2-Matching finds more accurate correspondences, resulting in superior restoration performance.To evaluate Ref-SR tasks in real-world scenarios, the paper introduces the Webly-Reference SR (WR-SR) dataset, which consists of LR images and their similar HR reference images collected from web search engines. This dataset serves as a benchmark for practical applications.In summary, the contributions of this paper are as follows: 1) The proposed contrastive correspondence network mitigates the transformation gap by computing more robust correspondences, 2) The teacher-student correlation distillation bridges the resolution gap, especially for fine texture regions, and 3) The introduction of the WR-SR dataset encourages practical application and evaluation of Ref-SR in real scenarios.
