Estimating depth in monocular images is crucial for understanding scene geometry in applications such as autonomous driving and augmented reality. Current approaches often rely on complex models trained on large datasets using machine learning. Most existing methods treat depth estimation as a regression problem, aiming to predict a metric map. However, accurate prediction of metric depth relies on camera parameters that may not be available, and relative depth estimation is often sufficient. This suggests that depth estimation can be formulated as a ranking task. "Learning-to-rank" methods can minimize performance metrics based on relative errors, allowing for learning from weaker training information such as pseudo-metric data or human-annotated data. Ranking methods are typically based on pairwise comparisons, but they suffer from inefficiency and loss of transitivity information. Listwise ranking provides an alternative that considers higher order rankings as training information. In this paper, we propose a listwise ranking method based on the Plackett-Luce model, allowing for learning probability distributions over rankings from pseudo-metric data. We also suggest a neural network architecture and a sampling strategy for constructing training examples. In a zero-shot evaluation, we compare our model with state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate its effectiveness in rank-based error minimization and recovering metric depth in unseen scenes.
