Deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven to be highly effective in visual representation learning, achieving unprecedented performance on various tasks. These learned representations also exhibit good transferability to other tasks with limited curated data. This pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm has been instrumental in state-of-the-art object detectors. However, this paper aims to enhance this paradigm by training not only accurate but also robust object detectors.The role of pre-training in object detection is revisited, considering recent advancements in data-augmented ImageNet pre-training. The accuracy and robustness of detectors are examined, specifically focusing on the EfﬁcientDet detectors. It is discovered that the performance gains from data augmentation methods in pre-training diminish after fine-tuning, irrespective of the detectors' accuracy or robustness. Therefore, the paper shifts focus to the fine-tuning stage in training object detectors.Initially, the study explores AutoAugment for object detector fine-tuning. However, experiments reveal inconsistent improvements in the studied detectors, potentially due to limited generalization ability. Consequently, the paper investigates AdvProp, a model-dependent data augmentation, for fine-tuning object detectors. AdvProp utilizes adversarial examples to improve image classification models and dynamically evolves with the primary model during training.The paper enhances AdvProp for object detection fine-tuning, denoted as Det-AdvProp. It introduces a local comparison to identify the more "adversarial" source for augmentation, either the classification head or the localization head, and aggregates these sources appropriately. Straightforward aggregation leads to weak adversarial examples, while keeping them separate results in excessive regularization and reduced accuracy.The main findings of the paper include the observation that although pre-training is more effective than random initialization, the performance gains diminish after fine-tuning, regardless of strong data augmentations used. Instead, incorporating advanced data augmentations into fine-tuning proves to be more promising. Det-AdvProp significantly improves the accuracy, robustness to natural corruption, and robustness to domain shift of state-of-the-art EfﬁcientDets. Additionally, Det-AdvProp outperforms the model-agnostic AutoAugment in object detection across different settings.
