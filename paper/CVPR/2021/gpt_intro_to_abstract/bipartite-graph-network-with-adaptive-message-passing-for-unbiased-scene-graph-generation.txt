Scene graph generation is a crucial task in computer vision that involves detecting visual objects and their relationships in an image. This compact structural representation of a scene has potential applications in various vision tasks such as visual question answering, image captioning, and image retrieval. While significant progress has been made in scene graph generation thanks to advancements in object detection and learned visual representations, the task remains challenging due to large variations in visual relationships, imbalanced object and relation distribution, and limited annotations. One of the primary challenges in scene graph generation is biased relationship prediction caused by the intrinsic long-tail data distribution, where a model is dominated by a few head categories and performs poorly on tail categories. Previous approaches have attempted to address this issue through data resampling or loss re-weighting but struggle to achieve a satisfactory trade-off between head and tail categories in instance-level tasks. Additionally, non-head predicate categories often involve complex semantic meaning and intra-class variations, making their representation learning and classification more challenging. Previous works have focused on context modeling mechanisms, but noisy information propagation and limited flexibility have been observed in fully connected and sparse structures. Through empirical analysis, it has been found that a baseline model can achieve notable performance improvement by removing noisy subject-object associations. In light of these findings, a novel confidence-aware graph representation and learning strategy for unbiased scene graph generation is proposed. This approach involves the development of a bipartite graph neural network (BGNN) with adaptive message propagation for effective context modeling. A bi-level data resampling strategy is also designed to address the imbalanced data distribution problem. The proposed method is validated on three scene graph generation datasets and consistently achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance. The overall contributions of this work include the introduction of the bipartite graph neural network for context modeling, the proposal of a bi-level data resampling strategy, and the achievement of competitive or state-of-the-art performance on scene graph benchmarks.
