Drones are being used in various daily life applications, such as agriculture monitoring, firefighting, inventory management, cinematography, and surveillance. With the increasing use of drones, computer vision researchers have developed new techniques for object detection, tracking, and action recognition in drone imagery. Additionally, it is important to detect drones themselves in videos captured by other drones to ensure safety during multi-drone flights, avoid drone attacks, and prevent drone collisions. However, detecting ground objects and aerial drones from drone videos is a challenging task due to factors like camera motion, changes in drone shape and viewpoint, occlusion, and small object sizes. While there has been significant research on detecting ground objects and human action using drones, limited work has been done on detecting drones from drone videos. Some existing approaches employ handcrafted features and regression-based techniques for drone detection. However, these methods often struggle with the detection of small objects like drones, which typically occupy only a few pixels in video frames. Object detection performance also deteriorates in cluttered backgrounds and videos. This paper proposes a two-stage segmentation-based approach for detecting drones in cluttered backgrounds. The first stage uses appearance cues, while the second stage involves spatio-temporal cues. The proposed approach significantly outperforms several competitive baselines in experimental evaluations. The rest of the paper provides an overview of related developments in small object detection, presents the proposed methodology, shares experimental results, and concludes the paper.
