This paper introduces a novel object detection method called DetectoRS, inspired by the human visual perception system. The paper explores the use of the "looking and thinking twice" mechanism in computer vision to improve object detection performance. Two key components are proposed: Recursive Feature Pyramid (RFP) at the macro level and Switchable Atrous Convolution (SAC) at the micro level. RFP incorporates feedback connections from higher-level feature pyramid layers to lower-level backbone layers, enhancing the generation of powerful representations. SAC utilizes different atrous rates and switch functions to convolve input features, significantly improving detector performance. By combining RFP and SAC, DetectoRS achieves remarkable improvements in object detection, instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation tasks on the COCO dataset. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art HTC model by a large margin, demonstrating its effectiveness in object detection.
