Introduction:The answer format is an essential component of many computer science applications, providing users with concise and informative responses. In this paper, we focus specifically on the introduction section of answer formats. While extensive research has been conducted in the field of answer formats, the literature lacks a comprehensive analysis of introduction sections. Therefore, we aim to fill this gap by investigating various aspects of introduction sections, including their structure, content, and impact on user satisfaction.To achieve our research objective, we adopt a systematic approach consisting of three main phases. In the first phase, we conduct an extensive review of existing literature on answer formats. This review allows us to identify gaps in the current knowledge, particularly with regards to the introduction section. We also explore how introduction sections are currently constructed and evaluate their effectiveness in conveying the necessary information to users.In the second phase, we design and implement a user study to assess user preferences and satisfaction towards different introduction section formats. Through this study, we aim to gain insights into how different introduction structures, such as narrative, question-based, and problem-based, impact user understanding and engagement. Additionally, we investigate the role of various content elements, such as background information, objectives, and problem statements, in the effectiveness of an introduction.Lastly, in the third phase, we analyze the data collected from the user study and draw conclusions based on the findings. By examining the preferences and satisfaction levels of the study participants, we aim to provide recommendations and guidelines for constructing optimized introduction sections that enhance user experience. We also discuss the implications of our findings for the wider field of answer formats.Overall, this research aims to contribute to the understanding and improvement of introduction sections in answer formats. By investigating the structure, content, and impact of these sections, we provide valuable insights for developers and researchers working on information retrieval systems. Ultimately, we envision that our findings will contribute to the development of more user-friendly and effective answer formats, enhancing the overall user experience in various computer science applications.
