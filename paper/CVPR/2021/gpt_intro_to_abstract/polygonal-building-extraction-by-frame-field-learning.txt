Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successful in processing large collections of noisy images and achieving state-of-the-art results in remote sensing segmentation. However, geographic information systems like Open Street Map (OSM) require segmentation data in vector format, while CNNs generate raster format output. Additionally, methods extracting objects from remote sensing images need to handle high-resolution aerial images captured daily over large territories, requiring high throughput. This necessitates modifications to the conventional CNN pipeline.Existing work on deep building segmentation falls into two categories: a posteriori vectorization of probability maps and direct learning of vector representations. However, these approaches have limitations such as smoothed out corners, loss of shape information, complex post-processing procedures, and restricted output topology.To address these challenges, we propose a building extraction algorithm that incorporates a frame field output in a fully-convolutional network. This frame field improves segmentation performance, specifically in generating sharper corners, and provides useful information for vectorization. Additional losses ensure a valid and consistent frame field alignment with the segmentation. This method allows for a straightforward polygonization approach using the Active Skeleton Model (ASM), extending the Active Contours Model (ACM). ASM fits a skeleton graph that connects junction nodes and vertices, enabling the reuse of shared walls between adjoining buildings.Our contributions include a learned frame field aligned to object tangents, coupling losses for self-consistency, and a fast polygonization method leveraging the frame field. This approach enables complexity tuning of a corner-aware simplification step and handling non-trivial topology. Overall, our proposed method improves segmentation accuracy and provides efficient polygon extraction, making it suitable for processing complex buildings in remote sensing applications.
