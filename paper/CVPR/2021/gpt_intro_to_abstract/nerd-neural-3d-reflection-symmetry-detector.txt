Recovering the 3D orientation of objects in an image is a challenging problem in computer vision with implications in various fields such as robotics, autonomous driving, and virtual reality. Traditional solutions rely on depth cameras, which have limitations in range and availability, limiting their practical applications. Recent advancements in convolutional neural networks have shown promise in inferring object-level information from RGB images, but existing methods for 3D pose estimation either require known CAD models or lack the ability to exploit geometric constraints, resulting in inaccurate results.To address these limitations, we propose NeRD, a network that leverages the geometric connection between object poses and reflection symmetry commonly found in man-made objects. NeRD first detects reflection symmetry from RGB images using a coarse-to-fine strategy and then verifies its correctness using a geometric-based neural network. This method allows for accurate recovery of the normal direction of the symmetry plane, which encodes crucial geometric information about the object's pose.Specifically, NeRD incorporates the concept of reflection symmetry into deep networks through plane-sweep cost volumes built from corresponding pixels' features. This enables accurate estimation of the normal direction of the symmetry plane based on the principle of shape-from-symmetry. The network consists of a backbone feature extractor, a differentiable warping module, and a cost volume network, allowing neural networks to utilize intra-image pixel correspondence from reflection symmetry in a single image.We evaluate NeRD on the ShapeNet and Pix3D datasets and compare it against existing methods. The results demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches in accurately estimating the normal direction of the symmetry plane and object pose, even when the object is not perfectly symmetric. Moreover, we show that the learned symmetry planes significantly benefit other downstream tasks, including single-view pose recovery and depth estimation.In summary, our contributions include identifying the problem of learning a neural 3D reflection symmetry detector, proposing a novel framework that outperforms previous methods in estimating symmetry planes, and demonstrating the benefits of the learned symmetry planes in various tasks. NeRD opens up new possibilities for accurate and practical 3D orientation recovery from RGB images.
