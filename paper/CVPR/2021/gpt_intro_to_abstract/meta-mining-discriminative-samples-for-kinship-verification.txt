Facial appearance conveys valuable information such as identity, age, gender, emotion, and social relation. Kinship verification, which predicts the existence of kinship for a given pair of facial images, has received significant attention in recent years. This emerging task has various potential applications including missing children search, intelligent family album organization, and social media analysis. Existing kinship databases organize data by sampling a fixed number of negative samples to construct a balanced database. However, this approach leads to overfitting and cannot effectively learn the real decision boundary. In this paper, we propose a Discriminative Sample Meta-Mining (DSMM) strategy to mine discriminative information from limited positive pairs and sufficient negative samples. We introduce a meta-miner network to automatically learn the weight for each sample and optimize it with the meta-gradient. Our method simultaneously samples an unbalanced train batch and a balanced meta-train batch, and performs sample mining on the training batch with the guidance of the balanced meta-train batch. Experimental results on four widely used kinship databases demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of a meta-learning framework for fully utilizing unbalanced data in kinship databases, simultaneous sampling of unbalanced and balanced batches, and achieving state-of-the-art performance.
