Image-based person re-identification (Re-ID) involves retrieving a specific person from a large number of person images captured by different cameras. Due to its importance in various applications such as security surveillance and pedestrian behavior analysis, Re-ID has gained significant attention in recent years. This paper introduces a novel coarse-to-fine Re-ID framework that leverages an auxiliary-domain classification (ADC) task to learn features from coarse-grained to fine-grained levels for person distinction. The framework incorporates an extra-domain dataset and a Re-ID dataset in ADC and utilizes a second-order information bottleneck (2O-IB) module to compress redundant information and noise in features, generating a concise and core representation for person embedding. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used for Re-ID due to their feature extraction capabilities and invariance embedding. Different CNN-based Re-ID methods can be categorized into representation learning, metric learning, attribute learning, local feature learning, and GAN-based methods. However, Re-ID remains challenging due to intra-class variations caused by changes in background, illumination, viewpoint, and human poses. To address these challenges, attention-based methods and GANs have been proposed, but still fall short in resolving the concerns of intra-class variations. This paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical framework for Re-ID that focuses on extracting features in a coarse stage and distinguishing different persons in a fine stage. The framework consists of coarse-grained feature extraction (CGFE), fine-grained feature extraction (FGFE), and second-order information bottleneck (2O-IB) layers. To mitigate the impact of miscellaneous background objects, an extra-domain dataset is utilized for joint training of CGFE and the first 2O-IB layer in ADC. Additionally, a second-order information bottleneck is introduced to reduce data stochasticity, redundancy, noise, and intra-class variations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hierarchical framework outperforms state-of-the-art Re-ID methods. This paper contributes by offering a comprehensive solution for person Re-ID that addresses intra-class variations and achieves superior performance.
