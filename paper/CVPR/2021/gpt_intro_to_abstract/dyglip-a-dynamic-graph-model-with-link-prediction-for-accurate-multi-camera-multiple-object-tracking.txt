Multi-Camera Multiple Object Tracking (MC-MOT) is an important component of computer vision, with applications in self-driving cars, crowd behavior analysis, and anomaly detection. While recent methods have made progress in large-scale datasets, there are still challenges in data association for MC-MOT. Inconsistent lighting and occlusion patterns between cameras make data association even more difficult, leading to incorrect identity assignments. This can have long-term detrimental effects on tracking systems. To address this issue, we propose a new approach that considers data association as a link prediction problem on a graph. Our dynamic graph formulation incorporates temporal information and object relations, improving ID assignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our contributions include the introduction of a new MC-MOT framework using link prediction and dynamic graph formulation, and the incorporation of an attention mechanism for accurate link prediction using dynamic graph embeddings. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in association tasks on multiple MC-MOT datasets.
