The objective of image-based geo-localization is to determine the location of a query image by finding the most similar image in a GPS-tagged reference database. Cross-view geo-localization, which uses GPS-tagged aerial-view images as reference for street-view queries, has gained interest recently. However, there is often a large appearance gap between query and reference images, which can affect performance. Existing datasets assume a one-to-one correspondence between query and reference images, which is not practical for real-world applications where query images can occur at arbitrary locations. To address these limitations, we propose a new benchmark called VIGOR for evaluating cross-view geo-localization in a more realistic setting. VIGOR involves densely sampling reference aerial images to achieve comprehensive coverage of the area of interest and capturing street-view queries at arbitrary locations. This dataset allows us to explore the effect of reference samples that are not centered at the query locations, breaking the one-to-one correspondence. We also introduce a novel hybrid loss to take advantage of multiple reference images during training, improving the geo-localization method. Additionally, we employ within-image calibration to predict the offset of the query location inside the retrieved image, enabling a coarse-to-fine localization. The entire pipeline is end-to-end and fast during inference, as the offset prediction shares feature descriptors with the retrieval task. Our dataset is accompanied by raw GPS data, allowing for a more direct performance assessment in terms of real-world distance. Our main contributions include the introduction of a new dataset for cross-view image geo-localization, a novel joint-retrieval-and-calibration framework, a hybrid loss for learning from multiple reference images, and validation of the proposed framework in a real-world application scenario. This work aims to bridge the gap between current research and practical applications in the field of cross-view geo-localization.
