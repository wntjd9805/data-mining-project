Event sensors are often used in applications that require high temporal resolution, such as robotic manipulation and aerial vehicles. However, efficient algorithms are needed to process event streams with low-latency for accurate motion recovery. In this paper, we propose spatiotemporal registration (STR) as an alternative to contrast maximisation (CM) for event-based motion estimation. STR addresses the computational cost and temporal resolution issues faced by CM. We demonstrate the validity and accuracy of STR for rotational motion estimation and introduce a novel event-based VO pipeline that utilizes feature correspondences obtained through STR. We also provide a new event dataset for VO experiments.
