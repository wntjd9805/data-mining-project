Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used imaging technique in clinical applications due to its non-invasive nature and ability to capture different types of tissues using customizable pulse sequences. However, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of MRI scans can be improved by using multiple saturation frequencies and repeating acquisitions, leading to longer scan times. Compressed sensing (CS) and deep learning-based methods have been proposed to accelerate the MRI sampling process and improve image reconstruction. However, deep learning methods often require large amounts of paired data, which can be challenging and expensive to collect and store securely. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a framework for collaborative and decentralized training of deep learning models, allowing each institution to utilize and store its own private data without sharing it directly. However, models trained with FL may still have suboptimal generalizability due to domain shift caused by variations in sensors, disease types, and acquisition protocols among different institutions. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a cross-site model for MR image reconstruction within the FL framework. The proposed method involves training local reconstruction networks on private data and transferring latent features between different source sites to align their distributions with the target site. An adversarial domain identifier is then trained to further align the latent space distributions, resulting in improved reconstructions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FL-based approach and cross-site modeling for MR image reconstruction in multi-institutional collaborations. This paper contributes the FL-MR method for privacy-preserving collaboration in MRI reconstruction, the FL-MRCM method for addressing domain shift, and extensive experimental insights into FL for MR image reconstruction.
