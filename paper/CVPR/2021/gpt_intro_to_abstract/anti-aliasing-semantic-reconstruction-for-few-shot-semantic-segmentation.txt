This paper introduces the concept of few-shot semantic segmentation, which aims to generalize a pre-trained model to recognize novel classes with only a few examples. The authors propose an anti-aliasing semantic reconstruction (ASR) approach to address the issue of semantic aliasing between novel classes that have similar compositions of semantic concepts. ASR reformulates few-shot segmentation as a semantic reconstruction problem and utilizes a class-level semantic space to represent novel classes. The authors categorize convolutional feature channels into channel groups, each optimized for constructing a basis vector corresponding to a base class, which reduces semantic overlap. The orthogonality of basis vectors is enhanced through a contrastive loss. To suppress interfering semantics, a semantic filtering module is introduced, which projects query feature vectors to the reconstructed support vector. ASR achieves good performance on commonly used datasets and demonstrates significant improvements compared to prior approaches. The contributions of this study include the development of a systematic and interpretable ASR approach, the introduction of semantic span and semantic filtering techniques, and the performance analysis of ASR in two-way few-shot segmentation settings.
