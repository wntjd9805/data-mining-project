Automated medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in various clinical applications. Deep neural network architectures, such as U-Net, have shown significant advancements in image segmentation. However, the diverse characteristics and appearances of medical images make it challenging to apply a successful network like U-Net directly to new tasks. To address this issue, neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms have been proposed to automatically discover optimal network architectures. The NAS search space for segmentation typically consists of network topology and cell levels, where the former controls connections among cells and feature map flow, and the latter determines specific operations on the feature maps.While previous NAS methods, such as evolutionary or reinforcement learning-based algorithms, are time-consuming, differentiable architecture search offers more efficiency. However, existing differentiable formulations restrict the complexity of the searched network topology. Additionally, the discretization of the optimal continuous model can lead to sub-optimal discrete architectures, resulting in a performance gap. To tackle these challenges, this paper presents a new differentiable scheme that supports more complex topologies and proposes a topology loss and a topology guaranteed discretization algorithm to mitigate the discretization gap.Moreover, in medical image analysis, large GPU memory usage is a major challenge, particularly for tasks involving high-resolution 3D images. While most NAS algorithms focus on latency, this paper introduces GPU memory constraints in the search stage to limit memory usage during retraining.The proposed method is validated on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon dataset, demonstrating state-of-the-art results while significantly reducing search time compared to NAS-based methods. The contributions of this research include the novel Differentiable Network Topology Search scheme (DiNTS), the topology guaranteed discretization algorithm, the memory usage aware search method, and the improved segmentation results achieved.
