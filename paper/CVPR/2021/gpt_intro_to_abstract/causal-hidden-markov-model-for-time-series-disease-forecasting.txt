Future disease forecasting is crucial for irreversible diseases like Alzheimerâ€™s Disease and eye diseases. Early forecasting allows for timely medical treatment or intervention to slow down or alleviate disease progression. However, early forecasting faces challenges such as incomplete information and out-of-distribution generalization. Existing approaches for future disease forecasting can be divided into two categories: forecasting with additional supervisions and forecasting based on the generation of future images. These approaches may suffer from limitations such as lack of supervision or biases inherited from the provided data. To address these limitations, we propose a Causal Hidden Markov Model (Causal-HMM) that explicitly separates disease-causative features and models them using hidden variables. We demonstrate the identifiability of these hidden variables and reformulate a sequential VAE framework for practical inference. We apply our method to a dataset related to peripapillary atrophy and show superior prediction accuracy on out-of-distribution test data, indicating the ability to handle spurious correlation. Our contributions include a novel Causal-HMM for future disease forecasting, a new sequential VAE framework aligned with the causal model, theoretical identifiability results, and state-of-the-art prediction performance on the peripapillary atrophy forecasting problem.
