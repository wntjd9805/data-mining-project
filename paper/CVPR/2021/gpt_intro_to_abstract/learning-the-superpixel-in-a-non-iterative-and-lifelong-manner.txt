Superpixel segmentation aims to divide an image into smaller partitions called superpixels, based on color and spatial features. This method is widely used in machine learning and convolutional neural networks to reduce computational complexity and perceive object contours. Various techniques have been developed, including gradient-based and graph-based methods. However, these methods often suffer from low contour adherence or high computational cost. To address these limitations, some approaches employ convolutional neural networks to learn a suitable feature space for superpixel segmentation. However, these methods require human-labeled ground truth and have large memory requirements. Additionally, they often require iterative updates of cluster centers, which are time-consuming. To overcome these challenges, we propose a lifelong learning approach called LNS-Net for unsupervised CNN-based superpixel segmentation. LNS-Net consists of a feature embedder module, a non-iterative clustering module, and a gradient rescaling module. Our approach can learn superpixels in a non-iterative and lifelong manner, without the need for manual labels. The proposed LNS-Net outperforms other unsupervised methods and achieves comparable performance to supervised CNN-based methods. This work contributes by defining superpixel segmentation as a lifelong learning task and providing a lightweight solution that can be trained without manual labels.
