Title: Partial Feature Selection and Alignment for Multi-Source Partial Domain AdaptationAbstract:Domain adaptation methods have been widely studied to reduce the domain shift between labeled source domains and unlabeled target domains. Recently, a more practical task called Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA) has gained attention, where knowledge learned from multiple source domains is transferred to an unlabeled target domain. However, most existing MSDA methods focus on aligning all common features, without considering the fact that some source features may not be present in the target domain. Moreover, the label space of the target domain is typically unknown, posing additional challenges in domain adaptation.This paper introduces a novel end-to-end trainable model called Partial Feature Selection and Alignment (PFSA) to address both MSDA and a more challenging task called Multi-Source Partial Domain Adaptation (MSPDA). MSPDA considers scenarios where multiple source domains have distinct label spaces and the target domain does not share an identical label space with any specific source domain. The proposed PFSA model selectively aligns features that are relevant to the target domain, improving adaptation performance. It employs three feature alignment losses, focusing on class-level, domain-level, and discrimination aspects.Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of PFSA compared to state-of-the-art MSDA and PDA approaches in adapting multiple domains for both MSDA and MSPDA tasks. The contributions of this paper include the proposal of PFSA as a general framework capable of addressing MSDA and MSPDA problems, the utilization of feature selection vectors to preserve target-related features, and the introduction of novel feature alignment losses to generate discriminative representations.
