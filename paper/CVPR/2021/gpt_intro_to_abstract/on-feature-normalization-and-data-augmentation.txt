Image recognition and image generation are two fundamental aspects of computer vision. However, techniques used in these two areas often exhibit a dichotomy. In image recognition, mean and standard deviation calculations are commonly used to remove noise and improve optimization and convergence. On the other hand, moments play a central role in image generation, allowing for control over the style and shape of generated images. This study aims to regulate the attention that deep neural networks pay to moments and propose a novel data augmentation scheme called Moment Exchange (MoEx). MoEx swaps the moments between images to increase the robustness of classification tasks by forcing the network to consider both the normalized features and the moments during prediction. MoEx operates purely in feature space and can be easily combined with existing data augmentation techniques. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MoEx in various computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing tasks.
