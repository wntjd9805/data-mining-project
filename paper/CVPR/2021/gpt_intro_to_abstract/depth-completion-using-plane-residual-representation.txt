This paper introduces a novel approach for depth completion in 3D scene reconstruction using a Plane-Residual (PR) representation and an end-to-end deep learning network. The PR representation expresses the absolute depth value of a pixel with two parameters, allowing for the factorization of the depth regression problem into discrete depth plane classification and plane-by-plane residual regression. The proposed depth completion network shows good performance and fast computation. Extensive ablation studies and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods validate the effectiveness and validity of the design choices. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional stereo matching and commercial depth sensors, providing a more efficient and practical solution for precise and reliable 3D scene information. The results offer promising outcomes in preserving edge information and real-time applications.
