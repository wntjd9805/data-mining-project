This paper introduces the topic of reading text in visual content using computer vision techniques. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) has seen significant advancements in recent years, particularly with the application of deep learning. Traditionally, OCR involves two sub-problems: text detection and text recognition. However, recent research has shown that these two components can be learned jointly, leading to improved performance. While OCR benchmarks and methods have primarily focused on the English language, it is important to expand OCR capabilities to other languages to ensure accessibility for all users. Developing multilingual OCR systems presents challenges such as the wide variability in script appearance and word structures across languages. Naively training separate systems for each language is computationally expensive and fails to consider predictions made for other languages. This paper proposes a blend of approaches, utilizing a single text detection module followed by a language-specific text recognition head. A Language Prediction Network (LPN) is used to determine the appropriate head for each detected text. This approach mimics human perception of text, where language identification precedes recognition. The proposed multiplexer design has significant implications for real-world text spotting systems, allowing for custom architecture design for each language while still sharing and jointly learning the text detection trunk. The contributions of this paper include the proposal of an end-to-end trainable multiplexed OCR model, a language prediction network, a training strategy that addresses data imbalance, and empirical evidence demonstrating the superiority of the multiplexed model over single-head models in terms of performance and bias.
