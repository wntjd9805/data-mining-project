Image enhancement has long been studied in an unrealistic setting, assuming the existence of perfect quality original images for evaluating the visual quality of enhanced images. This has led to the use of full-reference image quality metrics to measure the distance between enhanced and original image pairs. However, in real-world image enhancement, specifying desired outputs is often difficult and there may be multiple desirable outputs. Full-reference models relying on a single "ideal" image are not applicable in these cases. Attempts have been made to use no-reference models for performance assessment, but accurate models for specific or general image enhancement applications are lacking. Subjective quality assessment, which relies on human perception, is a more reliable approach, but it can be biased in terms of sampling, algorithm selection, and subjective judgments. In this paper, we propose a debiased subjective assessment method that automatically selects a diverse set of images for evaluation. Our method is based on the principles of model falsification as model comparison and selects images that discriminate between enhancers while ensuring content diversity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in three real-world image enhancement applications: single image dehazing, single image super-resolution, and low-light image enhancement.
