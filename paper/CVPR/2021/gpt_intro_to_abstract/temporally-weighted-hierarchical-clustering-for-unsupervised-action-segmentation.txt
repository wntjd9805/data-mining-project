Human behavior understanding in videos has traditionally focused on inferring high-level semantics such as activity recognition. However, these approaches are often limited to tightly clipped video sequences, leaving out untrimmed content that may be unrelated to human activities. To address this issue, the problem of action segmentation in untrimmed videos has gained attention. Action segmentation involves labeling each frame of a video with an action, which is more challenging than activity recognition in trimmed videos due to the presence of irrelevant background frames.Weakly- and unsupervised approaches to action segmentation have become popular, as they require less annotation effort. These approaches often rely on acquiring pseudo-labels to supervise the training of feature embeddings. However, the use of noisy pseudo-labels can hinder the effectiveness of learned embeddings. This work proposes a different approach by treating action segmentation as a grouping problem and developing clustering methods to delineate temporal boundaries between actions.The authors found that a simple clustering of appearance-based frame features achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art weakly-supervised and unsupervised methods that require training on the target video data. This finding indicates that a sufficiently discriminative visual representation of video frames can be used to group them into visually coherent clusters. However, temporal coherence is also important for action segmentation. Therefore, the authors adapt a hierarchical graph-based clustering algorithm that modulates appearance-based graph edges between frames based on their temporal distances.The proposed method outperforms strong baselines and existing state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on five benchmark datasets. The contributions of this work include establishing strong appearance-based clustering baselines, using temporally-modulated appearance-based graphs to represent untrimmed videos, and combining this representation with a hierarchical graph-based clustering algorithm for temporal action segmentation.
