Enhancing low-light images is crucial for a variety of computer vision and machine learning applications. However, low-light images often suffer from poor visibility, low contrast, and unexpected noise. This paper explores Low-light Image Enhancement (LIE) techniques, which can enhance low-light images before further processing and analysis. Previous classical methods have used histogram equalization, gamma correction, or prior regularization models. These methods, however, often produce noisy or over/under-enhanced results. More recently, CNN-based models have shown promise in LIE, with some relying on paired data for supervised training and others training without paired supervision. However, existing CNN-based methods struggle with various light intensities and intensive noise in real-world scenarios due to the lack of physical constraints. To address these issues, this paper proposes a framework called Retinex-inspired Un-rolling with Architecture Search (RUAS) that incorporates knowledge of low-light images and searches for lightweight prior architectures. By unrolling optimization processes and following the principles of Retinex, RUAS establishes the structure of the enhancement network and uses a reference-free bilevel learning strategy to search for prior architectures. The contributions of this paper include a principled approach to building fundamental network structures, a cooperative bilevel search strategy, and flexibility in searching for prior architectures for different low-light scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate the memory and computation efficiency of our enhancement networks and their performance against state-of-the-art approaches.
