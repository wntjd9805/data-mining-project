The task of inferring room layout from a single view 360◦ panoramic image has gained significant attention in the computer vision community. This problem is crucial for achieving holistic indoor scene understanding and enabling 3D modeling of the physical environment. Recent state-of-the-art methods have made progress in accurate 3D room layout reconstruction using powerful neural network architectures. However, acquiring high-quality room layout annotations for deep neural network supervision presents challenges, particularly in cluttered scenes with ambiguous wall boundaries and complex layouts.There has been flourishing research on deep semi-supervised learning (SSL) that leverages unlabeled data to enhance learning and generalization in limited labeled data scenarios. SSL has primarily been successful in simple tasks like image classification, where labeling is binary. However, the principles of SSL applied to room layout estimation, a complex and challenging task, have not been studied extensively. The utilization of unlabeled data presents an opportunity for effective learning with limited annotated examples.This paper proposes SSLayout360, a neural architecture that learns representations of floor-wall, ceiling-wall, and wall-wall boundaries using a combination of labeled and unlabeled data for improved room layout estimation in 360◦ panoramic scenes. The approach is the first substantial attempt at semi-supervised 3D layout reconstruction in complex indoor scenes with as few as 20 labeled examples. Comparative experiments demonstrate that SSLayout360 achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmarks for both simple and complex room layouts. When coupled with a layout predictor pre-trained on synthetic data, SSLayout360 achieves performance comparable to a fully supervised baseline with only 12% of the required labels.Furthermore, this paper establishes a comprehensive set of semi-supervised benchmarks for indoor layout estimation and proposes an evaluation protocol encouraging the use of error bounds as standard practice. The utility of unlabeled data is demonstrated across various experimental settings. These findings serve as a strong baseline for future research in semi-supervised 3D layout reconstruction, aiming for even more robust results.
