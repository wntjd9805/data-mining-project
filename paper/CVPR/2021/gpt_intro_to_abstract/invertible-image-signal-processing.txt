Professional photographers often prefer to process RAW images instead of RGB images to achieve better visual effects. RAW images capture unprocessed scene irradiance at higher bit depths and have a linear relationship with scene irradiance, making them more suitable for image editing and computer vision tasks. However, accessing RAW images can be challenging due to their memory-demanding nature. Thus, researchers have developed various approaches to map sRGB images to their RAW counterparts. Some methods explicitly store mapping parameters in metadata, while others use prior camera information or learning-based techniques. However, these methods still rely on lossy in-camera image signal processing (ISP) pipelines and may produce inaccurate and different RAW images.In this paper, we propose a novel solution called Invertible ISP (InvISP) that redesigns the camera ISP pipeline as an invertible process. InvISP allows for the rendering of visually appealing RGB images while also enabling the recovery of nearly perfect quality raw sensor data from compressed RGB images. Our reconstructed RAW data closely matches real RAW data and facilitates computer vision applications like image retouching and HDR reconstruction. Designing an invertible ISP is challenging due to information loss during traditional ISP steps, the need to avoid visual artifacts, and the difficulties in reconstructing high-quality RAW data from JPEG images.To overcome these challenges, we leverage the reversibility of normalizing flow-based models and design both the RAW-to-RGB and RGB-to-RAW mappings with a single invertible neural network. We analyze traditional ISP properties and develop modules that approximate camera ISP and reconstruct RAW data accurately. Our model consists of affine coupling layers and learnable permutation functions using invertible 1x1 convolutions. Additionally, we integrate a differentiable JPEG simulator into our network to handle JPEG compression. This allows our end-to-end InvISP framework to minimize information loss in the RAW data and RGB image conversion. By jointly optimizing RGB and RAW reconstruction, we demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recovering RAW data while maintaining excellent RGB reconstruction performance.To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first attempt to reconstruct RAW data by redesigning the camera ISP as an invertible process. Our method effectively addresses information loss and is robust to JPEG compression. Experimental results on DSLR cameras demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared to existing baselines. We also showcase potential applications in RAW data compression, image retouching, and HDR reconstruction.
