The ability to simulate realistic traffic scenarios is crucial for the development of self-driving vehicles (SDVs). Simulations allow for the improvement and verification of SDVs' safety and performance. However, current simulation methods, such as using pre-recorded scenarios or manually designing new ones, are not scalable. Therefore, there is a need to automatically generate realistic traffic scenarios.This paper focuses on the task of generating the layout of actors in a traffic scene based on the SDV's current state and a high-definition map (HD map) of the surrounding area. Each actor is characterized by a class label, a bird's eye view bounding box, and a velocity vector. This lightweight parameterization is widely used in self-driving simulation stacks.Previous approaches to traffic scene generation use procedural models and hand-crafted rules. While these methods yield reasonable results, they do not capture the complexity and diversity of real-world traffic scenes. Recent machine learning techniques have shown improvements by automatically tuning model parameters. However, these approaches still rely on hand-crafted heuristics and assumptions, limiting their ability to model real traffic scenes accurately.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a traffic scene generation model called SceneGen, which uses a data-driven approach inspired by deep generative modeling. SceneGen is a neural autoregressive model that sequentially inserts actors into the scene, mimicking the process performed by humans. By utilizing SceneGen, realistic traffic scenes can be sampled, and the likelihood of existing ones can be computed.The proposed SceneGen model is evaluated on two large-scale self-driving datasets. The results demonstrate that SceneGen outperforms competing baselines in estimating the distribution over real traffic scenes and generating more realistic samples. Additionally, the paper shows that SceneGen, combined with sensor simulation, can generate realistic labeled data for training perception models that generalize to the real world.Overall, this work contributes to the development of self-driving vehicles by enabling safer and scalable simulation through the automatic generation of realistic traffic scenarios. The authors hope that this research inspires further exploration in this direction to achieve the ultimate goal of developing efficient and reliable self-driving vehicles.
