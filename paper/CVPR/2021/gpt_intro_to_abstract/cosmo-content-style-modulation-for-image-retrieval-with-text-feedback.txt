Image retrieval is a fundamental task in computer vision with various applications such as product search, person re-identification, and internet search. Most existing image search engines rely on either image-to-image or image-text matching, but it is challenging to accurately express complex target concepts through a single image or sentence. Additionally, these systems lack the ability for users to refine the retrieved results. In this paper, we explore the setting of image retrieval with text feedback, where a reference image and a modifier text are used jointly as a query. This approach allows users to express their concepts more precisely and refine the search results recursively. To address this task, we propose a novel image-text compositor called CoSMo, which consists of a content modulator and a style modulator. The content modulator uses a disentangled multi-modal non-local block to transform the contents of the reference image feature, while the style modulator selectively preserves and adds new styles based on the modifier text. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CoSMo on multiple image-text retrieval benchmarks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our method provides a new approach for accurate image retrieval with text feedback.
