Abstract:Temporal action localization (TAL) is a crucial aspect of video understanding, with applications in video analysis, summarization, and human interaction. Existing TAL models mainly focus on actionness-guided methods and anchor-based methods, but they have limitations such as producing redundant proposals, relying on separate classification models, and being sensitive to hyperparameters. To address these limitations, we propose an anchor-free TAL framework called Anchor-Free Saliency-based Detector (AFSD). AFSD eliminates the need for pre-defined anchors and combines boundary regression and classification in one model. We introduce novel boundary pooling and Boundary Consistency Learning strategies to improve boundary feature detection. Experimental results on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3 datasets demonstrate that AFSD outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving improved performance with fewer hyperparameters. This paper presents the first purely anchor-free TAL model, providing a more efficient and effective approach to temporal action localization.
