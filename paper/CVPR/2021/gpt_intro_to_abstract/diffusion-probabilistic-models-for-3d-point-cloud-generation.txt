Recent advances in depth sensing and laser scanning have led to a growing interest in using point clouds as a popular representation for modeling 3D shapes. While methods for point cloud analysis, such as classification and segmentation, have made significant progress, there is a need for generative models to learn the data distribution and enable tasks such as shape completion, upsampling, and synthesis. However, existing generative models like variational auto-encoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs) cannot be directly applied to point clouds due to the irregular sampling patterns in 3D space. This paper proposes a novel probabilistic generative model for point clouds inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The model exploits the reverse diffusion process to learn the point distribution, treating the points in a point cloud as particles in a non-equilibrium thermodynamic system. By modeling the reverse diffusion process as a Markov chain, the target point distribution can be recovered from a noise distribution. A shape latent is introduced as a condition for the transition kernel, allowing the model to generate point clouds of various shapes. The training objective is formulated as maximizing the variational lower bound of the likelihood of the point cloud conditional on the shape latent. The model is evaluated on point cloud generation, auto-encoding, and unsupervised representation learning tasks, showing competitive performance in point cloud generation and auto-encoding, and comparable results in unsupervised representation learning. The main contributions of this work include the proposal of a novel generative model for point clouds, the derivation of a tractable training objective, and extensive experimental results demonstrating the model's performance.
