Finding correspondences between non-rigid shapes is a fundamental problem in computer graphics, vision, and pattern recognition. This problem has countless applications, including shape comparison, texture transfer, and shape interpolation. Many real-world deformations are approximately isometric, making the search for near isometric maps practically significant. One of the most influential techniques for finding correspondences is the functional map framework, which maps between spaces of square-integrable functions on respective shapes. This framework reduces the problem of finding correspondence to a simple and efficient algebraic problem. However, the commonly used constraints in functional maps, such as aligning descriptor functions and commuting with Laplace-Beltrami operators, suffer from disadvantages in correspondence quality and computing efficiency.In this paper, we propose novel constraints and efficient computation methods to enhance the functional map framework. Our inspiration comes from the spectral manifold wavelets (SMWs), which are constructed similarly to classical wavelets but are computed efficiently. We impose SMWs preservation constraints on the functional maps, preserving the multiscale SMWs at each scale. This approach takes advantage of SMWs' properties in non-rigid shape analysis, such as intrinsic invariance under shape isometric deformations and the ability to encode shape features at different frequency bands. By preserving a few scales of intrinsic SMWs during the mapping, the isometric properties of the maps are sufficiently extracted and ensured while maintaining the overall linear system nature of the functional map framework.Additionally, we propose an efficient iteration method to update the computation of functional maps and pointwise maps alternately. This method significantly improves correspondence quality with only two or three iterations. By using suitable SMWs, specifically tight wavelet frames, the computation of functional mapping matrices simplifies into an iterative filtering procedure using various band-pass filters. This approach eliminates the need for time-consuming solutions of large systems of linear equations, commonly found in previous works, and produces matrices closer to the structures of isometric pointwise maps.Our method is evaluated through a wide range of experiments, demonstrating better correspondences and significantly higher computation efficiency compared to previous approaches.
