Active learning is a technique in machine learning that allows algorithms to achieve better performance with fewer training samples by selecting which samples to learn from. While there has been progress in methods with less supervision, such as weak supervision and semi-supervision, active learning remains important for practical applications. In the field of computer vision, active learning has been extensively studied for image classification. Various uncertainty-based methods and distribution-based approaches have been used to select informative images. However, there is a lack of instance-level active learning methods for object detection, where the goal is to select informative images for detector training. Current methods simply summarize or average instance uncertainty as image uncertainty, which ignores the imbalance of negative instances in object detection and leads to noisy instances in the background. This inconsistency between instance and image uncertainty hampers the selection of informative images. This paper proposes a Multiple Instance Active Object Detection (MI-AOD) approach to address this issue. The MI-AOD approach learns and re-weights instance uncertainty using discrepancy learning and multiple instance learning (MIL). A module called instance uncertainty learning (IUL) is used to learn the uncertainty of unlabeled instances, while a MIL module incorporates instance uncertainty re-weighting (IUR) to evaluate instance appearance consistency across images. By bridging the gap between instance-level observation and image-level evaluation, MI-AOD selects the most informative images for detector training. The contributions of this paper include the proposal of MI-AOD as a baseline model for the relationship between instance and image uncertainty, the design of IUL and IUR modules for effective instance selection in object detection, and the application of MI-AOD to improve state-of-the-art methods in object detection on common datasets.
