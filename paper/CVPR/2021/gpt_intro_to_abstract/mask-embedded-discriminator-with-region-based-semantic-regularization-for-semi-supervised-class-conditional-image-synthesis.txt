Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity image synthesis. However, accurately capturing class semantics in GANs remains a challenge. Class-conditional GANs have been introduced to address this issue by synthesizing diverse instances that match the underlying class-conditional distribution of real data. Acquiring accurate and sufficient labeled data is often expensive and time-consuming, motivating research on semi-supervised generative learning. This research focuses on training reliable generative models when there is a limited amount of labeled data together with a large amount of unlabeled data.Several techniques have been explored to improve class-conditional image synthesis in the semi-supervised setting. These techniques enhance generators and discriminators through strategies like class-wise mean feature matching and regional replacement. However, it has been observed that class-conditional discriminators tend to focus on regions that may not necessarily be important, especially in cases with limited supervision. This could degrade the generation performance of class-conditional generators.To address these limitations, this work proposes a semi-supervised Generative Adversarial Network with a Mask-Embedded Discriminator (MED-GAN) to facilitate class-conditional image synthesis. The MED-GAN model incorporates a mask embedding module in the discriminator to reduce its dependence on the background. By reducing this dependence, the generator can focus more on synthesizing class semantics-related content. The model also adopts a region-based consistent and contrastive regularization approach to enforce separation between real and fake classes and among object categories, thus improving synthesis quality.Extensive validation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques, as MED-GAN significantly improves synthesis quality in terms of Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID). Furthermore, MED-GAN outperforms previous state-of-the-art semi-supervised GANs on multiple standard benchmarks. The main contributions of this work include enhancing the discriminator with a mask embedding module, constructing region-based regularizers to facilitate class-conditional distribution matching, jointly training a classifier with the generator and discriminator, and applying the developed techniques to the fully-supervised case with significant improvements in the generation performance of a BigGAN.Overall, MED-GAN presents a promising approach for addressing the challenges of class-conditional image synthesis in the semi-supervised setting, offering improved synthesis quality and outperforming existing methods on standard benchmarks.
