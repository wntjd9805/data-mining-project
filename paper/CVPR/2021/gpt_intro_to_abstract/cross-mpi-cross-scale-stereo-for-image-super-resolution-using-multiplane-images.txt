Computational photography has led to a growing demand for higher-quality imaging in various industries and everyday life. Hybrid multiscale imaging camera systems have emerged as a promising solution for achieving higher spatial bandwidth by combining different camera characteristics. These systems have been successfully applied in hybrid light field cameras, gigapixel video systems, and mobile phones.One of the key challenges in realizing hybrid multiscale imaging is how to match and fuse cross-resolution images from different cameras with perspective parallax. Reference-based image super-resolution (RefSR) has been proposed to address this problem by using high-resolution reference images to enhance the resolution of low-resolution images. Unlike data-driven single image super-resolution methods, RefSR produces better results by leveraging additional high-resolution references, especially for upsampling factors larger than 4x.Existing RefSR methods typically follow a "warp-and-synthesis" pipeline, which can be categorized into pixel-alignment and patch-matching RefSR methods. However, these methods have limitations when dealing with large parallax or resolution gaps, resulting in the failure to capture correspondences and transfer high-fidelity details.In this paper, we propose an end-to-end approach that leverages multiplane images (MPIs) to solve the cross-scale RefSR problem in actual multiscale camera systems. MPIs have proven to be effective in image-based novel view synthesis, offering the ability to capture hidden surfaces and adapt to complex scenes. However, existing MPI estimation methods require image pairs with the same resolution and slight viewpoint changes, which is not feasible for RefSR tasks with resolution gaps up to 8x.To address this challenge, we propose a novel MPI-based approach that fully explores the properties of cross-scale image pairs. We introduce a plane-aware attention mechanism that captures correspondences along depth planes, improving the quality of MPI estimation. Additionally, we design a multiscale guided upsampling module to estimate robust correspondences in spaces with significant resolution differences, enabling the synthesis of super-resolved MPIs.Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experimental results and the development of a real hybrid cross-scale stereo system. Our method outperforms existing methods in terms of visual and quantitative performance while maintaining computational efficiency. The contributions of this paper include the exploration of RefSR through the MPI representation, the introduction of a novel plane-aware attention mechanism for MPI estimation, and a multiscale guided upsampling module for cross-scale multiplane image synthesis and depth map inference.
