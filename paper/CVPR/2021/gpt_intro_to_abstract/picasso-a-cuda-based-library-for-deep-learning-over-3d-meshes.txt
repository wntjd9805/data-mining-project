Data in computer vision can come in various formats, ranging from homogeneous data in 2D projective space (such as images and videos) to heterogeneous data in 3D Euclidean space (such as point clouds and meshes). Traditional convolutional feature learning has been successful for homogeneous data, leading to research interest in geometric deep learning for effective feature learning on heterogeneous data. With the rise of autonomous driving and robotics, 3D deep learning has become an important area of research, particularly for understanding 3D scenes. While 3D point clouds have been commonly used for convolutions in real-world 3D scene understanding, they lack the ability to preserve structural details represented by meshes. Existing methods for feature learning from meshes have been limited to small synthetic models and have not been efficient for large-scale meshes. This paper presents a GPU-accelerated mesh simplification algorithm that enables the exploration of hierarchical architectures on meshes. The algorithm is fast and efficient for both small-scale watertight meshes and large-scale unstructured real-world meshes. The proposed method computes all operations in parallel on GPU, except for the grouping of vertex pairs. By controlling the desired vertex size, the algorithm can be compatible with modern deep learning modules and can be combined with point cloud-based modules. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm compared to existing mesh simplification methods. In addition, the paper introduces three novel convolution modules for flexible feature learning on the mesh, and a self-contained library named Picasso is released for deep learning over unstructured real-world 3D meshes. The library includes implementations of the proposed modules as well as complementary CUDA-based pooling and unpooling operations. The main contributions of this work are the fast GPU-accelerated mesh simplification technique, the three novel convolution modules, and the release of the Picasso library for deep learning on 3D meshes.
