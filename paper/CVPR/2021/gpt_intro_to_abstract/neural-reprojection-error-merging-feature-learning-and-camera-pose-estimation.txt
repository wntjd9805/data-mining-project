Absolute camera pose estimation is a crucial task in various computer vision applications, including Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and visual localization. This paper proposes a novel approach called Neural Reprojection Error (NRE) as a substitute for the traditional Reprojection Error (RE) method. The NRE approach eliminates the need for 2D-3D correspondences and instead relies on a dense loss map, which contains more information and provides higher-quality data to the pose estimator. The NRE method also combines feature learning and pose estimation in a unique way, allowing for more efficient and accurate camera pose estimation. The paper presents a coarse-to-fine optimization technique for minimizing the NRE terms and demonstrates the improved robustness and accuracy of the NRE-based pose estimator compared to traditional RE-based methods. The evaluation results show that the NRE approach is computationally and memory efficient while achieving superior performance. The paper concludes with a discussion of related work, the proposed method, and the experimental results.
