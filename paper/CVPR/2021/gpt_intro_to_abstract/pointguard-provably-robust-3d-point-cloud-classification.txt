This paper introduces the concept of 3D point cloud data structures and their importance in modeling 3D shapes or objects. The focus of this study is on 3D point cloud classification, which has gained increasing interest in recent years due to its applications in robotic grasping, autonomous driving, and more. However, it has been observed that 3D point cloud classifiers are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where attackers can modify, add, or delete points in a 3D point cloud to manipulate its classification. These attacks pose a security concern in safety-critical applications.Various empirical defenses have been proposed to mitigate these attacks, but they often lack provable robustness guarantees and can be broken by advanced attacks. This paper highlights the importance of developing certified defenses that provide provable robustness guarantees. Randomized smoothing, a technique used for certifying robustness in 2D image classifiers, is explored for point cloud classification. However, randomized smoothing is only applicable to point modification attacks and does not address the other types of attacks.To fill this gap, the paper proposes a new defense called PointGuard, which is the first defense with provable robustness guarantees against point modification, addition, deletion, and perturbation attacks. PointGuard works by creating a sub-sampled point cloud and predicting the label with the highest probability for the original 3D point cloud based on the label probabilities of the sub-sampled points. The paper presents theoretical contributions, proving that PointGuard can predict the same label for a point cloud within a certified perturbation size threshold. Additionally, the lower and upper bounds of the label probabilities are estimated using a Monte-Carlo algorithm to solve an optimization problem, allowing the calculation of the certified perturbation size.The effectiveness of PointGuard is evaluated on two datasets using PointNet and DGCNN classifiers. The paper introduces certified accuracy as an evaluation metric and demonstrates that PointGuard achieves substantially higher certified accuracy compared to the empirical accuracy of a standard point cloud classifier. Furthermore, PointGuard outperforms randomized smoothing in point modification attacks.In summary, this paper presents PointGuard as a provably robust defense against various adversarial attacks in 3D point cloud classification. The derived certified robustness guarantee is proven to be tight, and efficient algorithms are proposed for computing the certified perturbation size. Experimental results showcase the superiority of PointGuard over other defenses, highlighting its effectiveness in securing 3D point cloud classification systems.
