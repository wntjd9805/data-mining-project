Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have had a significant impact on image processing research, particularly in machine learning for image enhancement and visual editing. GANs can be used as implicit learnable objectives, high-quality image priors, and for manipulating internal representations for visual editing purposes. GAN latent spaces also encode human-interpretable concepts, making GANs the dominant paradigm for controllable generation.Many methods have been developed to discover interpretable directions in GAN latent spaces, allowing for effective image editing. These directions can be identified across different GAN models and can be used to achieve impressive visual effects by moving the image's latent codes along these directions.This paper introduces an alternative approach, demonstrating that exciting visual effects can be achieved by gradually modifying the GAN parameters instead of the latent codes. The authors show that the GAN parameter space also contains a plethora of interpretable image manipulation directions. They describe domain-agnostic procedures to discover these directions in an unsupervised fashion. Extensive experiments confirm that the visual effects achieved through parameter modifications are substantially new and cannot be achieved through latent code manipulations alone. This significantly expands the range of image editing techniques based on GANs.The contributions of this paper are as follows:1. The proposal to use interpretable directions in the space of the generator parameters for semantic editing, which differs from existing approaches that operate on the latent codes or intermediate GAN activations. Remarkable visual effects can be achieved by slightly changing the GAN parameters.2. The development of effective and fast methods to discover these directions, which can be implemented on a single GPU.3. Confirmation that the discovered directions are qualitatively new and correspond to semantic manipulations that existing methods cannot produce.In conclusion, this paper presents a novel approach to image editing using GANs, demonstrating the potential of modifying GAN parameters to achieve visually appealing and semantically meaningful effects. The proposed methods for discovering these directions are effective and efficient, expanding the possibilities of GAN-based image editing techniques.
