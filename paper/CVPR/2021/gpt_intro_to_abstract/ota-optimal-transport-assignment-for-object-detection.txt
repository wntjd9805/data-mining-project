This paper introduces an optimal transport assignment (OTA) strategy for label assignment in object detection. Current CNN-based object detectors perform label assignment based on pre-defined rules, ignoring variations in object size, shape, and occlusion. Dynamic assignment strategies have been proposed, but they lack global context and can assign ambiguous anchors incorrectly. To address this, the authors propose OTA, which formulates label assignment as an optimal transport problem. Each ground-truth object is a supplier and each anchor is a demander, with transportation costs based on pairwise classification and regression losses. OTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular benchmarks and demonstrates generalization ability on crowded pedestrian datasets.
