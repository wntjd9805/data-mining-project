Learning discriminative features is crucial in computer vision and machine learning, particularly in representing images. One approach is to aggregate similar features into compact clusters, while separating different classes. Deep neural networks have made great strides in learning such features. This paper focuses on unsupervised deep metric learning, where class labels are unavailable and test image classes are different from training classes. Existing methods for unsupervised representation learning use clustering or self-supervision to construct pseudo labels, but they suffer from high error rates and lack generalization to new classes. The challenge is how to handle intra-class variation and inter-class ambiguity effectively. We propose a novel approach called Relative Orders for Unsupervised Learning (ROUL) that leverages relative order analysis. We introduce a ternary relative ordering function and develop a deep neural network to predict these relative orders. During training, the relative order prediction network and the feature embedding network mutually constrain each other, improving metric learning performance. During testing, the predicted relative orders serve as constraints for optimizing features and refining image retrieval results. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our ROUL method compared to existing approaches.
