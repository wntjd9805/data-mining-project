Recent research in depth from stereo matching has focused on developing accurate but computationally expensive deep learning approaches. However, for active agents like mobile robots or self-driving cars, high latency is undesirable, and faster methods are needed. This paper investigates the integration of efficient mechanisms from active stereo methods into neural network-based stereo matching systems to achieve efficient and accurate results for passive stereo depth sensing in latency-critical applications.The paper highlights the limitations of end-to-end learning approaches that rely on a convolutional neural network (CNN) unaware of the geometric properties of stereo matching. Initial approaches utilized a generic U-Net architecture, while subsequent works incorporated explicit matching cost volumes and 3D convolutions to improve accuracy at the cost of increased computation.Several recent stereo matching methods have achieved efficient disparity estimation for active stereo while maintaining accuracy. These methods use compact/sparse features, efficient disparity optimization schemes, and iterative image warps with slanted planes to minimize image dissimilarity.However, these efficient approaches do not directly apply to passive stereo because they lack the use of a powerful machine learning system. This paper proposes HITNet, a framework for neural network-based depth estimation that integrates image warping, spatial propagation, and fast high-resolution initialization steps into the network architecture. HITNet represents image tiles as planar patches with learned compact feature descriptors and fuses information from the initialization and current hypotheses using spatial propagation.The network iteratively increases the accuracy of disparity predictions using a local cost volume in a narrow band around the planar patch. The architecture also reconstructs fine details and captures large texture-less areas by upsampling predictions hierarchically. Matches from the initialization module facilitate the recovery of thin structures at each resolution.Overall, the contributions of this paper include a fast multi-resolution initialization step, an efficient 2D disparity propagation method, and state-of-the-art results in popular benchmarks with significantly reduced computation compared to other methods.
