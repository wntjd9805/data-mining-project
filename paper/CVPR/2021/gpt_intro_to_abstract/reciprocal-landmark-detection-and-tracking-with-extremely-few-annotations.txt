The paper addresses the problem of data scarcity and lack of annotation in developing machine learning models for medical imaging, specifically focusing on ultrasound imaging and echocardiography. The authors investigate the automatic localization of landmarks in the parasternal long axis view of the left ventricle, which is used to estimate the ejection fraction. Manual annotation of all cardiac frames is impractical, so the authors propose a novel Reciprocal landmark Detection and Tracking (RDT) model that uses prior knowledge from sparsely labeled keyframes and imposes cycle consistency in tracking landmarks across unannotated frames. The model is weakly supervised by only two annotated keyframes for training and is tested as an end-to-end model. The paper highlights the significance of automated measurement systems in improving cardiac reports and clinical workflow. The authors discuss related work in the field of deep learning for anatomical structure localization and spatio-temporal models for sequential data. They introduce their contributions, including the novel RDT model and the use of adversarial training for optimization. The paper concludes by emphasizing the advantages of their proposed approach and its potential impact in the medical imaging field.
