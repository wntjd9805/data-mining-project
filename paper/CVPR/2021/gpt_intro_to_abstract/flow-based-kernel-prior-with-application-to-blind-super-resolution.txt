Image super-resolution (SR) is a crucial task in computer vision, aiming to recover high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) inputs. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have gained popularity in solving this task, but most existing methods assume a fixed and known blur kernel, which limits their performance in real-world applications. Blind image SR, which deals with unknown blur kernels, has become an active research topic. Blind SR is more challenging and typically involves kernel estimation and non-blind SR as sub-problems. Kernel estimation plays a crucial role in non-blind SR, and inaccuracies in the estimated kernel can significantly deteriorate the reconstructed HR images. Recently, kernel estimation methods like Double-DIP and KernelGAN have shown promising results but have some limitations. In this paper, we propose a flow-based kernel prior (FKP) for kernel distribution modeling and integrate it into existing blind SR models. FKP utilizes normalizing flow, consisting of batch normalization layers, permutation layers, and affine coupling layers, to capture the kernel distribution through an invertible mapping between the kernel space and a latent space. FKP is optimized by minimizing the negative log-likelihood loss of the kernel in an unsupervised manner. Once trained, FKP can be integrated with existing models like Double-DIP and KernelGAN for kernel estimation, improving their stability, accuracy, and convergence. FKP offers several advantages, including fewer parameters, stable convergence, and better kernel estimation. The main contributions of this paper are the proposal of FKP as a learning-based kernel prior, the fixed parameter optimization approach that traverses the learned kernel manifold, and the improvement in accuracy and stability of existing kernel estimation methods. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in blind SR tasks.
