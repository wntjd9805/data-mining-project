Single image deraining (SID) is the task of removing rain and restoring the clean background scene from a single rainy image. This is important for outdoor computer vision applications like autonomous driving and video surveillance, where rainy images are often degraded in quality. Deep learning methods have shown promising results for SID, but most of these methods rely on paired rain/clean images for training, which are difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, a semi-supervised learning framework is proposed. It utilizes both supervised and unsupervised knowledge to improve rain removal. A memory-oriented encoder-decoder network is designed to capture rain patterns and recover rain-free background images. A memory module is used to model various appearances of rain, and a self-training mechanism transfers deraining knowledge from synthetic datasets to unlabeled real-world data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in terms of quantitative and qualitative performance.
