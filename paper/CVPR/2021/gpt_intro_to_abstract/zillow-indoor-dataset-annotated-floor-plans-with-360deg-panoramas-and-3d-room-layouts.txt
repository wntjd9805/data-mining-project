This paper introduces the Zillow Indoor Dataset (ZInD), which aims to provide a large-scale and diverse dataset for 3D scene understanding in computer vision. The dataset contains annotated 360o panoramas, room layouts, and floor plans of real un-furnished residential homes. Existing datasets in this domain are limited in size and variation, either due to logistical challenges or domain gaps in synthetic datasets. ZInD addresses these limitations by offering a comprehensive collection of 1,524 homes with 71,474 panoramas, 21,596 room layouts, and 2,564 floor plans. The dataset enables research on room layout estimation, floor plan reconstruction, and image feature analysis. The paper also presents experiments with state-of-the-art methods for room layout estimation and multi-view registration to showcase the potential of ZInD.
