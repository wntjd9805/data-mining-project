Object detection is a critical task in computer vision, involving the localization and classification of various objects. One of the challenges in object detection is handling the large scale variance of objects in real-world scenarios. Previous approaches have focused on network architecture and data augmentation techniques to address this challenge. This paper specifically focuses on data augmentation for object detection and proposes a new method for automatically learning scale-aware data augmentation strategies. The proposed method introduces scale-awareness to the search space at both the image and box levels, allowing for adaptive augmentations based on object scales. Additionally, a new estimation metric is proposed to improve the efficiency of the search process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on various object detectors, achieving significant performance gains with reduced search costs. The proposed method can be easily applied to other box-level tasks, such as instance segmentation and keypoint detection. Overall, this work contributes to the development of automatic data augmentation policies for object detection, providing improved performance and valuable insights for human knowledge.
