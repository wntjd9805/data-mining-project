Machine learning involves learning useful representations from high-dimensional data. While there are many supervised representation learning methods that perform well on downstream tasks, labeling large-scale real-world datasets can be costly and time-consuming. As a result, unsupervised representation learning is becoming a more popular approach. Recent works have utilized hyperbolic geometry to learn representations by understanding the hierarchical nature of data domains. Complex networks can be approximated as trees, and previous works have shown the effectiveness of learning representations using hyperbolic spaces. Additionally, hyperbolic geometry has shown promise in computer vision tasks, with high degrees of hyperbolicity observed in image dataset activations. Some studies have demonstrated the benefits of hyperbolic embeddings on tasks like few-shot learning and person re-identification. However, most existing hyperbolic representation learning works focus on supervised settings, and the impact of hyperbolic geometry on unsupervised representation learning remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel hyperbolic graph convolutional auto-encoder (HGCAE) for unsupervised representation learning. The HGCAE combines hyperbolic geometry and message passing, conducting auto-encoding of graphs in hyperbolic spaces. We introduce a geometry-aware attention mechanism to fully utilize hyperbolic geometry for representation learning. Through extensive experiments and analyses, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on node clustering and link prediction tasks. We also show that image clustering tasks benefit from embeddings in hyperbolic latent spaces, and that hyperbolic embeddings can recognize underlying data structures without supervision of ground-truth class hierarchy. Furthermore, we utilize the sample's hyperbolic distance from the origin as a criterion for choosing samples, improving the model's generalization ability. Overall, our work highlights the benefits of hyperbolic geometry in unsupervised representation learning across various data domains.
