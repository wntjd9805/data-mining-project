Single-image reflection removal is a challenging problem in computer vision that aims to recover the transmission of a reflection-contaminated image. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address the content ambiguity issue in this problem by leveraging panoramic images. Panoramic images, which have a 360-degree field of view, naturally capture a partial view of the reflection scene. We exploit this property to partially capture the reflection scene and alleviate the content ambiguity. However, there are geometric and photometric misalignments between the panoramic reflection scene and the glass-reflected view. To overcome this, we propose a two-step solution that includes reflection alignment and transmission recovery. The first step incorporates a coarse-to-fine strategy to align the panoramic reflection scene with the glass-reflected view. The second step utilizes a transmission recovery network to restore the transmission of the reflection-contaminated image with the guidance of the aligned reflection scene. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art single-image methods in reflection removal and generalizes well to images captured by casual users without panoramic cameras. This work contributes to explicitly relieving the content ambiguity in reflection removal and improving the performance and applicability of the method.
