This paper introduces the concept of emotional artificial intelligence (emotion AI), which utilizes machine learning techniques to enable computers to understand human emotions. Emotions play a crucial role in human-computer interaction, and body language is an important aspect in the interpretation of emotions. However, current studies and datasets in the field of computer vision and affective computing have significant limitations in recognizing and understanding emotions. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a novel dataset focused on micro-gestures (MGs), which are unintentional behaviors that reveal suppressed or hidden emotions. The dataset, called iMiGUE, aims to explore MGs for hidden emotion understanding while preserving individual privacy. It is the first public benchmark for emotional MGs and provides annotations on both the MG categories and the corresponding emotions. The experimental results on iMiGUE demonstrate the challenges of recognizing and understanding MGs, and propose an unsupervised model that achieves competitive performance compared to supervised models. Additionally, the findings highlight the importance of MGs in emotion understanding and suggest the potential of MG-based emotion AI. The iMiGUE dataset and the proposed model serve as a foundation for further research and development in this field.
