Multi-label visual recognition is a crucial task in computer vision, and deep networks trained on training data with ground-truth labels have been widely used for this purpose. However, similar to single-label recognition tasks, the training data for multi-label recognition often exhibits a long-tailed distribution in terms of class labels. This means that there are many samples for head classes, but very few for tail classes. Training on such data with uniform sampling typically results in low performance on the tail classes.To address this issue, re-balanced data sampling has been proven to be effective in long-tailed visual recognition. It achieves class-wise balance by either down-sampling the head-class data or up-sampling the tail-class data. However, this approach can also duplicate/remove head-class/tail-class samples due to label co-occurrence in multi-label recognition.This paper introduces a new method for long-tailed multi-label visual recognition that combines different data samplings to improve the performance of both head and tail classes. The approach utilizes both uniform and re-balanced samplings to train a two-branch network, where each branch follows the same architecture but reflects the different distributions of their respective inputs. A loss function is defined to enforce consistency between the two branches for the same input image, inspired by mutual learning and co-regularization techniques. This cross-branch consistency results in an effect similar to learning from a balanced implicit distribution between the two biased distributions from different samplings.The proposed method is evaluated on the VOC-LT and COCO-LT datasets, and experimental results show that it can simultaneously improve the performance of both head and tail classes. The main contributions of this work are the utilization of both uniform and re-balanced samplings, the development of a two-branch network and a cross-branch loss for collaborative learning, and the extensive evaluation on real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.
