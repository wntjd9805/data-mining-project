The paper introduces the task of Multiple Object Tracking (MOT), which aims to associate the same object across frames in a video clip. A robust and accurate MOT algorithm is crucial in applications like autonomous driving and video surveillance. The dominant paradigm in MOT is tracking-by-detection, which involves obtaining object bounding boxes and generating trajectories by associating objects between frames. While recent MOT works focus on improving data association through graph partitioning and deep learning, there is a lack of integration between these two directions. This paper argues for the importance of intra-frame relationships in MOT and proposes representing these relationships as a general graph. To solve the association problem, a differentiable quadratic programming layer is derived, allowing for the incorporation of deep feature learning. The proposed GMTracker achieves significant advancements in the state-of-the-art performance of MOT on benchmark datasets.
