Forecasting future trajectories of pedestrians is crucial for autonomous moving platforms like self-driving cars or social robots. This paper introduces a latent belief energy-based model (LB-EBM) that captures pedestrian behavior patterns and social interaction norms to make multimodal trajectory predictions. The LB-EBM is learned from expert demonstrations using inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Traditional IRL approaches are computationally expensive, so this paper proposes a middle ground solution by learning an energy-based model (EBM) in a low dimensional latent space and mapping it to actions with a policy generator. The LB-EBM explicitly learns a multimodal cost function, allowing for better prediction of diverse future trajectories. The paper presents experimental results on benchmark datasets, showing that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in human trajectory forecasting.
