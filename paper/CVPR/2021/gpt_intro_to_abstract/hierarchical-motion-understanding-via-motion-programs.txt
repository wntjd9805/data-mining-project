Most current video analysis architectures focus on local and short-term motions of human bodies, but struggle with higher-level spatial structures and longer-lasting temporal patterns. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical motion understanding framework that incorporates higher-level reasoning of motion primitives and their relationships to improve video understanding and downstream task performance. Our framework consists of three levels of abstraction: Level 1, which deals with keypoints and provides low-level priors such as temporal smoothing; Level 2, which introduces concrete motion programs representing sequences of atomic actions; and Level 3, which describes abstract motion programs that capture higher-level groupings of primitives and their patterns. We present these levels using domain-specific languages and propose an algorithm for automatically synthesizing motion programs from videos. We demonstrate the advantages of motion programs through three applications: video interpolation, repetitive segment detection, and video prediction. These applications highlight the ability of motion programs to achieve higher-quality interpolations, detect and extract repetitive segments of human motion, and perform longer-range video prediction. Our contributions include the introduction of a hierarchical motion understanding framework using motion programs, the development of an algorithm for synthesizing motion programs from raw videos, and the demonstration of improved performance in video synthesis pipelines through the incorporation of motion programs.
