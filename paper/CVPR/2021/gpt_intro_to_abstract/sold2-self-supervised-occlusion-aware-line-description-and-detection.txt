The use of feature points is prevalent in various computer vision tasks due to their compact and robust representation. However, lines, which offer many advantages over points, are also semantically meaningful in the world. Lines are widely present in man-made environments and can provide strong geometric cues about a scene. Previous methods for detecting lines in images relied on gradient information and handcrafted filters, but recent advancements in deep learning have enabled robust and real-time line detection. Most learned line detectors focus on wireframe parsing, which infers the structured layout of a scene based on line segments and their connectivity. However, these methods lack repeatability across images and require manually labeled ground truth lines for training.Matching geometric structures across images traditionally relies on feature descriptors. However, line descriptors face challenges such as partial occlusion, poorly localized endpoints, fluctuating scale, and distortion changes. Early line descriptors focused on extracting support regions and computing gradient statistics, while recent deep line descriptors have been proposed but still struggle with occlusion and localization issues.In this work, we propose a self-supervised network for jointly learning the detection and description of line segments. Our network, inspired by LCNN and Super-Point, can be trained on any image dataset without labels. Pretrained on a synthetic dataset, our method is then applied to real images. Our line detection aims to maximize repeatability and accuracy for use in geometric estimation tasks.To address occlusion and maintain discriminative power, we introduce a novel line matching technique based on dynamic programming and inspired by sequence alignment in genetics and classical stereo matching. Our self-supervised occlusion-aware line description and detection (SOLD2) offers a generic pipeline that bridges the gap between recent learned feature point methods. Our contributions include the first deep network for joint line segment detection and description, a self-supervised training approach for line detection, and a robust line matching procedure that achieves state-of-the-art results on image matching tasks.
