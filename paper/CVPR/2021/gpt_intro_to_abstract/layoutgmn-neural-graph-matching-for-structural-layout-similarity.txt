In this paper, we address the challenge of comparing two-dimensional layouts, such as floorplans and UI designs, by developing a deep neural network called LayoutGMN. Traditional image-space metrics, like intersection-over-union (IoU), do not effectively measure structural layout similarity due to their focus on visual comparison rather than structural reasoning. LayoutGMN takes a structural view of layouts and represents them as directed, fully connected graphs. The network learns structural layout similarity through neural graph matching, using intra-graph message passing and cross-graph information communication. By training the network with weak supervision using layout IoUs, we avoid the challenges associated with subjective human labeling. Despite the shortcomings of IoU for structural matching, it provides an objective and easily obtainable measure that enforces a structural bias in the network during training. The attention weights learned by LayoutGMN can be used for matching layout elements. Evaluation of the network on retrieval tasks demonstrates its superiority in capturing structural layout similarity compared to IoUs and other baselines. Additionally, we showcase a label transfer application for floorplans enabled by the structure matching learned by our network. Overall, LayoutGMN provides an effective and efficient solution for comparing and evaluating two-dimensional layouts.
