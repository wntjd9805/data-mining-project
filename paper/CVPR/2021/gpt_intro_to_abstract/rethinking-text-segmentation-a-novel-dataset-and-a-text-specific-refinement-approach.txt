Text segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with numerous applications such as font style transfer, scene text removal, and interactive text image editing. While deep neural networks have advanced text-related research, modern text segmentation techniques and datasets lag behind other computer vision research directions. Existing datasets like Total-Text, COCO TS, and MLT S have limitations in scale, labeling quality, and representation of diverse text conditions. To address these issues, we propose a new text segmentation dataset called TextSeg, which includes a wide range of scene and design text with accurate annotations. In addition, we introduce a new text segmentation approach, TexRNet, designed specifically to handle the challenges posed by text segmentation. This approach incorporates effective network modules and losses to handle diverse textures and arbitrary scales and shapes of text. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TexRNet outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on TextSeg and other representative datasets. Our work contributes to the improvement of text segmentation research and provides prospects for downstream applications benefiting from accurate text segmentation.
