This paper focuses on the task of temporal action detection, which involves identifying the starting and ending times of action instances in long videos and classifying the actions. Existing methods for temporal action detection commonly employ a two-stage approach, consisting of temporal action proposal generation and classification. However, the performance of temporal action detection methods remains unsatisfactory in mainstream benchmarks. Therefore, researchers aim to improve the quality of temporal action proposals.The current proposal generation methods can be divided into two steps: capturing temporal relationships and generating proposals. However, existing methods have several drawbacks. First, neither convolution nor global fusion effectively models the temporal relationship. Second, the context used for regression in existing methods is insufficient for generating proposals with precise boundaries.To address these issues, this paper proposes the Temporal Context Aggregation Network (TCANet) for high-quality proposal refinement. TCANet includes the Local-Global Temporal Encoder (LGTE), which captures local and global temporal relationships simultaneously. LGTE consists of two main sub-modules: the Local Temporal Encoder (LTE) for local temporal modeling and the Global Temporal Encoder (GTE) for global information perception. Additionally, the Temporal Boundary Regressor (TBR) is proposed to exploit both boundary context and internal context of proposals for boundary regressions at the frame-level and segment-level.The proposed TCANet approach has three main contributions. First, the Local-Global Temporal Encoder enables the simultaneous modeling of local and global temporal relationships. Second, the Temporal Boundary Regressor performs complementary and progressive boundary refinements. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TCANet on various benchmarks.In conclusion, this paper proposes TCANet, which improves the quality of temporal action proposals through the combination of the Local-Global Temporal Encoder and the Temporal Boundary Regressor. Experimental results show that TCANet achieves competitive performance on several benchmark datasets.
