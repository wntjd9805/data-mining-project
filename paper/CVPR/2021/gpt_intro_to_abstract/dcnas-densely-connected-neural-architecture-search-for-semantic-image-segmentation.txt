Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods have been limited in real-world applications due to their heavy computation overheads. Recent strategies have significantly reduced the search time, allowing NAS approaches to achieve superhuman performance in image classification tasks. However, these methods with constrained search spaces are not suitable for dense image prediction tasks. To address this, researchers have focused on improving NAS frameworks by designing new search spaces to handle multi-scale features. This paper proposes an efficient and proxyless NAS framework for semantic image segmentation. The framework includes a comprehensive search space that covers a wide range of optimal network architectures and incorporates multi-scale features. The paper introduces a fusion module and a mixture layer to address memory consumption and heavy computation problems. By relaxing the discrete architectures into a continuous representation and using SGD for the proxyless searching procedure, the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets. The paper also investigates the correlation between the accuracy in the searching phase and the performance of the fine-tuned model. The contributions of this work include the design of a novel densely connected search space, the implementation of a proxyless searching paradigm, and the demonstration of improved performance compared to contemporary NAS methods.
