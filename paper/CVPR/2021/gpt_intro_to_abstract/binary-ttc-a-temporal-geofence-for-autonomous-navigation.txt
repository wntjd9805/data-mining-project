In the field of path planning, accurate perception is crucial for tasks such as robotics and automotive applications. Depth information plays a key role in achieving accurate perception, and various modalities exist to infer depth. While strategies like lidar provide accurate depth estimation, they are limited by their sparse coverage and high cost. Stereo-based strategies, on the other hand, introduce calibration drift over time.In this paper, we propose a low-cost solution using a monocular camera for depth estimation. The motion of the camera induces optical flow between consecutive frames, which carries information about the scene's depth. However, estimating depth becomes challenging in dynamic scenes, as the 2D flow of a pixel depends on its depth, velocity, and the camera's velocity. Disentangling these components is an under-constrained problem.Previous approaches either ignore dynamic regions or rely on strong scene priors to estimate depth. In this work, we introduce the concept of time-to-contact (TTC), which refers to the time an object would collide with the camera plane under the current velocity conditions. TTC estimation is valuable for decision-making, as it provides information about critical objects moving towards the camera.We propose a learning-based approach that directly estimates per-pixel TTC from images without explicitly computing optical flow. We leverage the relationship between an object's TTC and the ratio of its image size in different frames. By performing binary classifications with respect to different scale factors, we generate a binary TTC map that acts as a temporal geofence in front of the camera. This map identifies objects within a given TTC quickly, in just 6.4 ms. We also offer the ability to estimate per-pixel TTC with quantization levels, ranging from binary to continuous.To enhance the performance of our network and overcome the scarcity of TTC ground truth data, we introduce binary optical flow estimation as an auxiliary task. Our approach achieves competitive performance compared to existing methods, including stereo-based ones, while being significantly faster.Overall, our work presents a novel approach to depth estimation using monocular cameras, leveraging the concept of time-to-contact. Our method provides an efficient and low-cost solution for accurate perception in path planning applications.
