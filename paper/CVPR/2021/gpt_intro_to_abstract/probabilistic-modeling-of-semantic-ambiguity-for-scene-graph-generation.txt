Scene graph generation (SGG) is a vital task in computer vision, acting as a bridge between object detection and high-level visual understanding tasks. However, existing SGG methods overlook the intrinsic semantic ambiguity of visual relationships, aiming for accuracy rather than diversity. This paper introduces a Probabilistic Uncertainty Modeling (PUM) module to address this issue. PUM represents each union region as a probability distribution, allowing for diverse predictions. Through experiments on the Visual Genome benchmark, PUM combined with the Residual Cross-attention Graph Convolutional Network (ResCAGCN) achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in mean recall. Additionally, PUM successfully alleviates bias towards frequent relationships. The proposed module generates diverse yet plausible relationships, demonstrating its superiority and potential in SGG.
