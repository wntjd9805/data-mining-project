Reconstructing 3D shape from a single-view RGB image is a challenging task in computer vision with applications in robotics, CAD, and virtual and augmented reality. While humans can easily infer object shape from a single image, machine vision systems face significant difficulties due to limited prior knowledge and lack of innate visual understanding and reasoning. This paper introduces a novel approach to address this problem, aiming to overcome the challenges posed by heavy occlusion, input variability, and noisy input. The proposed method incorporates elements of existing techniques such as 3D-R2N2 and Pix2Vox++, but also introduces novel contributions to improve accuracy and robustness. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reconstructing 3D object shapes from single-view RGB images.
