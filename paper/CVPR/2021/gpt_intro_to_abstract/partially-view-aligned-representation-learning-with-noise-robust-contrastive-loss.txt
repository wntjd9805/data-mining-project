Abstract:Multi-view Representation Learning (MvRL) aims to learn consistent representations from multi-view/modal data for various downstream tasks such as clustering and classification. However, existing MvRL methods heavily rely on the assumptions of data completeness and view consistency, which may not hold in practice due to data collection or transmission issues. This leads to the Partially View-aligned Problem (PVP), where only a portion of data is aligned across views. While some progress has been made in addressing the Partially Data-missing Problem (PDP), there are few studies on solving PVP. In this paper, we propose a novel method called Multi-view Contrastive Learning with Noise-robust loss (MvCLN) to tackle PVP without the need for data annotations. Our approach redefines the view alignment problem as a category-level alignment task, which is more desirable for clustering and classification. We formulate the alignment task as a view identification task and employ a contrastive learning framework. We also introduce a noise-robust contrastive loss to handle noisy labels introduced during pair construction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in achieving category-level alignment and handling noisy labels. Our work contributes to the field by proposing a task-specific alignment approach, utilizing contrastive learning for category-level alignment, and introducing a noise-robust contrastive loss to handle noisy labels in MvRL.
