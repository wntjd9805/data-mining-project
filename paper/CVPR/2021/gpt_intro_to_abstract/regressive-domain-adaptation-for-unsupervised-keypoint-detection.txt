Deep neural networks have revolutionized computer vision tasks, but they heavily rely on large amounts of labeled data. Collecting such data can be expensive and time-consuming, making domain adaptation an attractive alternative. Domain adaptation involves transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Keypoint detection tasks in computer vision, which have complex annotations and require significant labor work, can benefit greatly from domain adaptation. Synthetic images generated through computer graphics processing offer a cost-effective source of accurately labeled data.While there are numerous effective domain adaptation methods for classification tasks, there are few methods that work well for regression tasks. This is likely because classification tasks have explicit boundaries between classes, enabling domain alignment to enlarge the boundaries on the target domain and help the model generalize. In contrast, the regression space is continuous, with no clear decision boundary. Additionally, keypoints in regression tasks exist in a large discrete space, posing a challenge for traditional domain adaptation methods.To address the challenges posed by the large output space in regression tasks, the authors analyzed the predictions of a source-only keypoint detection model. They observed that when predictions on the unlabeled target domain are wrong, they tend to be concentrated around other keypoints rather than scattered randomly. This observation suggests that the output space is sparse in terms of probability, and by constraining it to a smaller space with only the keypoints, it may be possible to bridge the gap between regression and classification.The paper proposes a regressive domain adaptation (RegDA) method inspired by the disparity discrepancy theory. It involves training an adversarial regressor to maximize the disparity on the target domain and a feature generator to minimize the disparity. The authors introduce a spatial probability distribution to describe the sparsity in the output space and use it to guide the optimization of the adversarial regressor. They also convert the minimax game in the disparity discrepancy theory into the minimization of two opposite goals to overcome the optimization difficulty of adversarial training in RegDA.The contributions of this paper include the discovery of the sparsity in the regression output space and its implications for bridging the gap between regression and classification. The proposed RegDA method effectively converts the minimax game into the minimization of two goals and is validated through experiments on various keypoint detection tasks. The results show performance gains ranging from 8% to 11% in terms of PCK (percentage of correct keypoints).
