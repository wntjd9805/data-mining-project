Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) has gained popularity in various scientific applications for its ability to capture detailed spectral information of scene surfaces. However, traditional hyperspectral acquisition systems are scanning based and have slow capture speed. To overcome this limitation, recent research has focused on recovering spectral information from a single RGB image using dictionary-based and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches. It has been found that the accuracy of spectral reconstruction heavily depends on the spectral response of the RGB camera used. To address this, data-driven algorithms have been proposed to retrieve the best camera spectral sensitivity (CSS) curves or design new response curves. However, existing methods for selecting CSS curves are limited to existing databases and may not be suitable for spectral upsampling. Commercial RGB cameras often have IR-cut filters that cut off energy beyond 650nm, which undermines the reconstruction efforts for the visible range. In this paper, we propose a solution that involves implementing a deeply tuned filter to replace the built-in IR-cut filter in order to improve spectral reconstruction. Our solution allows for better trade-off between reconstruction accuracy and realization complexity. Additionally, we investigate the interaction between illumination and reflectance in RGB-to-spectrum upsampling by using an illumination and reflectance spectral separation model. This allows us to accurately estimate incident illumination spectra while reconstructing the spectral information. Extensive experiments on simulated and real spectral images validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The contributions of this work include exploring the response of IR-cut filters as a tunable factor for spectral upsampling, addressing the illumination and reflectance separation, and validating the effectiveness of our propositions through real-life experiments.
