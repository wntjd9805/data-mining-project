Scene text detection has become a popular area of research in both academia and industry, with numerous real-world applications such as online education, product search, instant translation, and video scene parsing. This has been facilitated by the advancements in deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in Object Detection and Image Segmentation. Previous methods have utilized ImageNet pre-training to accelerate convergence and enhance accuracy. However, there is a significant domain gap between natural images and scene text images. Some approaches have attempted to fine-tune models using initialization parameters pre-trained on synthetic data for text detection, but they still face limitations in terms of generalization capabilities and the lack of consideration for text content. In this paper, we propose a powerful pre-trained deep model called STKM (Self-attention based Text Knowledge Mining) for text detection. Inspired by the transformer model, we utilize self-attention mechanisms to aggregate semantic representations of text contents and learn useful prior knowledge for text detection. This allows the pre-trained backbone of STKM to be fine-tuned for various text detectors, resulting in significantly improved detection performance. Our approach extracts features from a standard CNN backbone and uses a cascaded self-attention architecture to decode the flattened features and recognize all the texts without the need for explicit detection. The end-to-end training of our model only requires image-level text annotations, making it more cost-effective than traditional text location annotation methods. Additionally, the STKM backbone can be transferred to different text detection networks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Experimental results demonstrate that by replacing ImageNet pre-training with STKM, existing detectors such as EAST and PSENet achieve higher F-measures on the IC-DAR2015 dataset. The contributions of this paper are two-fold: the introduction of STKM as a general pre-trained model for text detection and its ability to significantly improve the performance of various detectors on different benchmarks.
