In this work, we propose a novel adaptation framework called ILA-DA (Instance Level Affinity-based Domain Adaptation) to improve unsupervised domain adaptation by leveraging instance-wise similarities across datasets. Models trained on labeled datasets often struggle to generalize well to data outside the training distribution due to domain shifts. Unsupervised domain adaptation has emerged as a viable solution to transfer knowledge from a labeled source domain to unlabeled target domains by minimizing divergence between the domains. However, existing approaches that rely on global distribution alignment through adversarial learning fail to consider the finer class-specific structure of samples during alignment, leading to misalignment near classifier boundaries. Although some methods use target pseudo labels to guide class-specific alignment, they are reliant on the reliability of predicted pseudo labels, which can be noisy and result in negative alignment between unrelated categories.To address these limitations, we propose ILA-DA, which combines ideas from metric learning literature to perform cross-domain transfer using instance affinity relations. Instead of domain or class-level alignment, ILA-DA exploits sample-level similarity, leveraging a nearest neighbor-based technique to construct a pairwise affinity matrix. We use this knowledge in a multi-sample contrastive learning (MSC) loss that clusters similar samples across domains and pushes dissimilar samples away, avoiding negative transfer. ILA-DA offers two advantages: stronger signal during training compared to category predictions and the ability to handle fine-grained datasets with large intra-class variation.We evaluate ILA-DA on popular benchmarks such as Digits and Office-31 datasets, achieving improved adaptation accuracy. Additionally, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the challenging Birds-31 dataset without the use of complementary information such as label hierarchies and class structure. We perform extensive ablations and analysis to validate the effectiveness of ILA-DA and publicly release code and data for reproducibility.In summary, this paper introduces ILA-DA, a novel adaptation framework that uses MSC loss to perform instance affinity-aware transfer across source and target domains. ILA-DA can be applied to enhance existing adversarial adaptation approaches and demonstrates consistent improvements over baselines DANN and CDAN. Experimental results on various benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of ILA-DA, sometimes outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.
