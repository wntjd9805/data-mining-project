Deep learning has shown great promise in various applications, but it struggles with generalizability to out-of-distribution data. Domain adaptation methods address this issue but fail to generalize to unknown target domains. Domain generalization aims to train models that can generalize to arbitrary unseen target domains. Existing methods utilize techniques such as adversarial training, meta learning, self-supervised learning, and domain augmentation. This paper introduces a novel Fourier-based perspective for domain generalization. The Fourier transformation preserves high-level semantics in the phase component and low-level statistics in the amplitude component. Inspired by this, the paper proposes a Fourier Augmented Co-Teacher (FACT) framework, which includes Fourier-based data augmentation and co-teacher regularization. The Fourier-based data augmentation distorts the amplitude information while keeping the phase information unchanged. Co-teacher regularization maintains the predicted class relationships between original and augmented images. The effectiveness of FACT is validated on three domain generalization benchmarks, showing superior performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies and analysis are conducted to further support the hypothesis and methodology.
