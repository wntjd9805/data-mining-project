Abstract:Computational imaging (CI) has revolutionized traditional cameras by introducing modulation in the optical path. One promising CI technique, Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI), indirectly captures 3-dimensional (3D) data using a 2D detector. The main challenge lies in reconstructing the desired images from the compressed measurements. While model-based optimization methods have been used, they lack the balance between reconstruction quality and speed. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an end-to-end reversible 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) called RevSCI-net for SCI reconstruction. The proposed network explores spatial and temporal correlations within the desired data and allows activations not to be stored in memory. Notably, this work presents the first application of 3D CNN in SCI problems and achieves high spatio-temporal resolution with a compression rate of 50. Furthermore, the proposed network combines SCI reconstruction and demosaicing for color SCI systems into a single end-to-end network. Extensive simulations and real data experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed network. The results demonstrate that the RevSCI-net outperforms other deep learning-based methods, particularly in terms of memory-efficiency and large-scale, high compression rate SCI measurements.
