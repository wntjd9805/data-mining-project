Estimating 3D poses of multiple people from a monocular video is a challenging task in computer vision. Existing methods can be categorized into top-down and bottom-up approaches. Top-down methods rely on human detection to localize each person and estimate their joint positions, but they suffer from inter-person occlusion and lack awareness of non-target persons and interactions. Bottom-up methods, on the other hand, consider multiple persons simultaneously but struggle with scale variations and lower accuracy.In this paper, we propose a novel two-branch framework that combines the strengths of top-down and bottom-up approaches to achieve more accurate and robust 3D multi-person pose estimation. Our top-down branch detects multiple persons and estimates their 3D poses, overcoming the challenges of inter-person occlusion and interactions. The bottom-up branch incorporates normalized image patches and leverages human detection information to better handle scale variations.To evaluate our method, we compare it with state-of-the-art top-down and bottom-up methods on the MuPoTS-3D dataset. Our results significantly outperform existing approaches, as shown in Figure 1, where we demonstrate the limitations of both top-down and bottom-up methods.Additionally, we introduce a novel two-person pose discriminator that enforces the validity of human poses in close pairwise interactions. This discriminator ensures more natural inter-person interactions in the estimated poses. Furthermore, we mitigate the data scarcity problem by using semi-supervised learning when ground-truth 3D data is limited.In summary, our contributions include the introduction of a two-branch framework that combines the advantages of top-down and bottom-up approaches, the incorporation of multi-person pose estimation and human detection information to handle occlusion and scale variations, and the introduction of a novel discriminator for enforcing inter-person interactions. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art approaches.
