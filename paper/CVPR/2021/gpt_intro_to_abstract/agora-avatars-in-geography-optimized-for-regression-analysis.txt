The field of 3D human pose and shape estimation from images has seen significant advancements with decreasing errors on standard benchmarks. However, existing datasets have limitations in terms of clothing, subjects, occlusion, and diverse ages and ethnicities. To address these limitations and drive progress in the field, we introduce AGORA, a novel dataset that includes challenging scenarios and provides accurate 3D ground truth for body pose and shape. AGORA features high-resolution images with varied poses, ages, and ethnicities, captured in complex natural scenes with occlusion and crowds. We rely on synthetic data and a graphics rendering pipeline to generate ground truth, using a variety of textured scans and HDRI panoramas. The estimated ground truth fits have demonstrated accuracy, enabling benchmarking of state-of-the-art methods. Notably, AGORA is the only dataset that combines these challenging features with highly accurate ground truth. The dataset also includes images of children, addressing the gap in existing methods. We provide the SMPL-X fits for training and validation images, withholding ground truth for evaluation on a separate server. AGORA introduces a novel evaluation protocol, including vertex-to-vertex error, pose and shape evaluation for body, hands, and face, as well as 2D occlusion masks. Our experiments demonstrate the challenging nature of AGORA and its potential for improving 3D pose estimation methods. In summary, AGORA presents a diverse and realistic dataset, along with new evaluation metrics, to advance the state-of-the-art in 3D human pose and shape estimation.
