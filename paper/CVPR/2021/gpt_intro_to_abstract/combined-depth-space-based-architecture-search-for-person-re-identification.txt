This paper introduces the concept of person re-identification (ReID) in the field of computer vision, which involves retrieving images of a specific person from various surveillance cameras. The use of convolution neural networks (CNNs) has become popular in ReID tasks, especially with the emergence of complex models. However, the reliance on these models as backbones restricts researchers from exploring alternative network architectures, and their large computational resource requirements make them impractical for devices with limited computing capabilities.To address these limitations, the authors propose the construction of a lightweight network that is computationally efficient and more suitable for ReID. They leverage the concept of Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to search for lightweight yet effective networks. The existing NAS methods are time-consuming and computationally expensive, so the authors introduce a new algorithm called the Top-k Sample Search that significantly reduces the search cost. Additionally, the authors design a new search space called Combined Depth Space (CDS) that explicitly learns combined pattern features for ReID. They propose the use of a Combined Block (CBlock) comprising two independent branches with different kernel sizes to learn the combined pattern information efficiently. The authors also propose a novel neck structure called the Fine-grained Balance Neck (FBLNeck) to balance the effects of the triplet loss and softmax loss in training the network.The paper's contributions include the introduction of the CDS search space, the development of the Top-k Sample Search strategy, and the proposal of the FBLNeck for better leveraging the advantages of the triplet loss and softmax loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CDNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on ReID tasks and other related tasks among lightweight networks.
