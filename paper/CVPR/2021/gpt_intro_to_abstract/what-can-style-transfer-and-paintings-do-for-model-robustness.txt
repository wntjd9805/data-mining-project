Model robustness refers to a model's ability to perform well on unseen image distributions, which can arise from real-world effects, adversarial noise, or differences in capturing environments. This is particularly important for applications like self-driving cars and medical diagnostics. Data augmentation has been a common approach to improving generalization in models, often achieved through transformations that encourage invariance to certain rules. Recent research has shown that image stylization can also promote invariance to texture. However, existing style transfer models may not fully capture the essence of artistic paintings. In this paper, we investigate the impact of style transfer and paintings on model robustness. We explore the role of style images in stylization-based data augmentation, compare the effects of paintings and other artforms like sketches as training data, and examine the learned invariances from style transfer and paintings. Our contributions include demonstrating the effectiveness of arbitrary style transfer as data augmentation, considering paintings as a form of perceptual data augmentation, and revealing the complementary nature of invariances learned from stylized photos and paintings.
