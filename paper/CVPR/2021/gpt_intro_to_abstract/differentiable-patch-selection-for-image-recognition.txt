High-resolution imagery is now widely available, but processing these images with computer vision models can be computationally expensive. Downsampling the images before processing can remove important details and reduce performance. This paper proposes a method to save compute while retaining the capability to recognize fine details by determining which parts of the image are important for the task at hand. The authors formulate patch selection as a ranking problem, where per-patch relevance scores are predicted by a small ConvNet and the top scoring patches are selected for downstream processing. The method is trainable via backpropagation using the perturbed maximum method. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of their approach in three different domains: street sign recognition, inter-patch relationship reasoning, and fine-grained classification without using object/part bounding box annotations. The paper presents a generic module for patch selection that can be applied to various image recognition tasks.
