Image stitching, the process of combining multiple images into a wider field of view, is widely used in various applications such as photogrammetry, robot navigation, and panorama on smartphones. However, producing high-quality stitched images remains a challenge, as they often suffer from artifacts and distortions, especially for wide parallax images.Feature matching plays a crucial role in aligning multiple images for artifact-free stitching, as matched features serve as anchors in the alignment process. The SIFT features are commonly used in traditional methods for feature point detection and matching. Some recent works have also introduced line features for robust matching in cases of large parallax and low textures. However, existing methods often separately match points and lines, leading to inconsistent and non-uniform stretching or compression of the local surrounding areas, resulting in artifacts in the stitched images.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel approach that leverages both point and line consistency to preserve linear structures during image stitching. The input images are divided into co-planar regions based on the neighborhoods of lines, and matching is performed using geometric invariants reflecting the intrinsic nature of both lines and points. This approach ensures accurate pre-alignment while eliminating artifacts and non-uniform distortions.Furthermore, this method incorporates global collinear structures as a constraint, significantly alleviating unnatural distortions. A comprehensive metric is also proposed to evaluate the preservation of linear structures in stitched images.The proposed method is compared to state-of-the-art approaches on challenging natural image pairs with prominent linear structures, covering variations in camera motions, scenes, and fields of view. The results show that the proposed method produces visually appealing stitching and achieves lower average root mean square error for point matching compared to existing approaches. Moreover, it demonstrates superior accuracy and stability in preserving linear structures, as evaluated by the proposed metric.Overall, this paper presents a novel approach that effectively addresses the challenges of preserving linear structures in image stitching. The proposed method offers significant improvements in image quality and provides a comprehensive evaluation of linear structure preservation.
