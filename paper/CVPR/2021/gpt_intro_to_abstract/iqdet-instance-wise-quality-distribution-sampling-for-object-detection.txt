Recent advancements in object detection methods have introduced various sampling and assignment strategies to improve the performance of modern object detection tasks. This paper presents an instance-wise quality distribution approach for sampling that addresses several limitations of existing strategies. Unlike static rules, the proposed approach is learnable and prediction-aware, allowing for better handling of eccentric objects. Additionally, it overcomes the issue of noisy samples and per-sample quality rules by jointly formulating a quality distribution in spatial dimensions. The proposed dynamic quality distribution is optimized using a variational encoder, which filters out noisy samples and is easier to learn. Furthermore, this distribution is used to guide sample selection in spatial and scale dimensions, enabling the resampling of high-quality and diverse predictions. The entire process is learnable and optimized through back-propagation. Experimental results on the COCO dataset demonstrate significant improvements in average precision (AP), with 2.8 AP improvements achieved on the FCOS method and state-of-the-art performance achieved on the ResNext-101-DCN based IQDet method.
