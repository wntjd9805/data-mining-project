Semantic segmentation is a crucial task in image recognition and scene understanding, involving the allocation of a semantic label to each pixel of an image. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant advances in semantic segmentation, they require a large number of training images annotated with pixel-level labels, which is a costly and time-consuming process. To address this issue, weakly supervised learning methods have been developed, using annotations that are cheaper to obtain than pixel-level labels, such as scribbles, points, bounding boxes, and class labels. Among these options, class labels are the most cost-effective and widely available.Most weakly supervised segmentation methods that utilize class labels rely on attribution maps obtained from a trained classifier. However, these attribution maps often fail to represent the entire region occupied by a target object, limiting their effectiveness for training a semantic segmentation network. To overcome this limitation, researchers have explored image and feature map manipulation techniques to extend the discriminative regions of a target object. One popular method is erasure, where discriminative regions are removed to force the classifier to find new regions of the target object. Another approach is stochastic perturbation, which diversifies attribution maps from an image by applying random dropout to the feature maps of a DNN.In this paper, we propose a novel manipulation method based on adversarial attack but with a benign purpose. Our method aims to extend the discriminative regions of a target object by finding perturbations that push the manipulated image away from the decision boundary. We achieve this through adversarial climbing, perturbing the image along pixel gradients that increase the classification score of the target class. This manipulation technique gradually involves non-discriminative regions relevant to the target class, resulting in attribution maps that identify more regions of the object.To address issues such as activation of irrelevant areas and dramatic increase in attribution scores, we introduce regularization terms that suppress scores of other classes and limit the attribution scores of regions with already high scores. The attribution maps obtained through this iterative manipulation can be used as pseudo ground-truth masks to train a semantic segmentation network in a weakly and semi-supervised manner.Our method is a post-hoc analysis of a trained classifier, making it easily applicable to existing methods without requiring modification or re-training of their networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of several weakly supervised semantic segmentation methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Pascal VOC 2012 benchmark in both weakly and semi-supervised semantic segmentation.
