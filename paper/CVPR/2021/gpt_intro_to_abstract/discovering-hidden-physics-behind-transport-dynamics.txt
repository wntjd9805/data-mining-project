The introduction of this computer science paper discusses the challenges of numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs) using deep learning techniques. While there have been significant advancements in using deep neural networks (DNNs) to model and solve PDEs, the problem of parameter estimation for inverse PDEs remains challenging. Existing methods have mainly focused on estimating parameters for advection equations, such as displacement or velocity vector fields. However, this paper aims to address the parameter estimation problem for more general advection-diffusion equations, specifically estimating spatially-varying velocity and diffusion tensor fields. The authors introduce a novel learning framework called YETI, which not only predicts the transport dynamics but also reconstructs the underlying velocity and diffusion tensor fields. The paper also presents representation theorems for divergence-free vectors and symmetric positive semi-definite tensors, ensuring realistic constraints on the learned physics parameter fields. The authors develop an advection-diffusion simulator for training the model and propose a two-phase learning strategy that involves training on simulated datasets and then applying transfer learning to real-world data. In summary, this paper presents a novel approach for parameter estimation in advection-diffusion equations using deep learning and provides theoretical foundations, a simulator, and a learning strategy to support the proposed framework.
