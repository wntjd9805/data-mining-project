Discriminative classifiers p(y|x) and generative models p(x) are typically seen as complementary domains in the field of machine learning and computer vision. However, the line between the two approaches is becoming increasingly blurred. Generative models aim to capture the underlying density of a data distribution, while discriminative classifiers learn complex feature representations to classify images. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using discriminative classifiers to synthesize novel samples based on their understanding of class boundaries. Existing approaches have trained discriminative classifiers using Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). However, it has been observed that classifiers trained with ERM do not provide smooth estimates of uncertainty near class boundaries. This raises the question of whether training with ERM affects the synthesizing capabilities of these classifiers. Additionally, synthesizing high-quality samples requires the classifier to learn tighter class boundaries. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel discriminative classifier called Synthesize-it-Classifier (STIC). The STIC classifier is trained using Vicinal Risk Minimization (VRM), which incorporates virtual mixup image-label samples in addition to real samples. The proposed classifier is then used to synthesize novel samples using a novel Gram Matrix Regularized Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (GRMALA) sampler. This approach is the first to train a discriminative classifier with VRM and synthesize samples using the GRMALA sampler. To further improve the performance of the STIC classifier, a recurrent self-analytic process is introduced. This process eliminates regions outside the class boundaries and enables the sampler to search within the boundaries. The STIC methodology trains the classifier with real images and synthesizes samples conditioned on class logits. The synthesized samples from the previous iteration are also used to re-estimate class boundaries using the self-analysis approach. The paper also proposes an attentive-STIC model for faster updates by operating on the feature space instead of the raw pixel space. Additionally, a novel class conditional score matching based discriminative classifier, referred to as Score-STIC, is introduced. The contributions of this work include the novel recurrent self-analytic STIC classifier trained with VRM and synthesized images using the GRMALA sampler. The paper also presents the Attentive-STIC model and the Score-STIC method for addressing the slow mixing problem and introducing a class conditional score function. The proposed approaches are evaluated on real-world datasets such as ImageNet, LSUN, and CIFAR-10.
