Deep learning algorithms for computer vision tasks often require a large amount of annotated data to achieve high performance. However, even with well-annotated data, few-shot learning remains a challenge. This is because in the real world, there are always rare cases with only a few available samples. Traditional approaches of collecting more annotated data do not effectively address the scarcity of such cases. Therefore, the study of few-shot learning, especially in the context of object detection, is important.Many recent efforts have been made to tackle few-shot object detection (FSOD). FSOD involves a set of base classes with sufficient annotated objects and a set of novel classes with very limited labeled objects. Most existing FSOD methods leverage ideas from meta-learning and metric learning to extend conventional detection frameworks. However, limited data availability still hinders the generalization of the detector. The performance of FSOD methods is highly sensitive to the number of explicit and implicit shots. Explicit shots refer to the available labeled objects from the novel classes, while implicit shots refer to the knowledge about novel classes encoded in the parameters of the backbone network due to pretraining on a large-scale classification dataset that contains implicitly overlapping classes.We propose a Semantic Relation Reasoning Few-Shot Detector (SRR-FSD) that addresses the limitations of existing FSOD methods. We introduce semantic relation reasoning by leveraging word embeddings to represent semantic concepts and knowledge graphs to represent explicit relationships between classes. We construct a semantic space guided by word embeddings and train the detector to project objects from the visual space to the semantic space, aligning their image representations with class embeddings. To overcome practical challenges, we learn a dynamic relation graph driven by image data and use it for relation reasoning.Our SRR-FSD demonstrates shot-stable performance in different settings. In common few-shot settings, it achieves competitive performance at higher shots and significantly outperforms existing methods at lower shots. In a more realistic setting where implicit shots of novel concepts are removed from the pretrained model, SRR-FSD maintains steady performance while previous methods suffer significant degradation. We propose this realistic setting as a new benchmark protocol for future research.In summary, our work is the first to investigate semantic relation reasoning for few-shot detection, showing its potential to improve performance. Our SRR-FSD achieves stable performance across different shot variations, outperforming existing FSOD methods. We also propose a more realistic FSOD setting and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in this setting.
