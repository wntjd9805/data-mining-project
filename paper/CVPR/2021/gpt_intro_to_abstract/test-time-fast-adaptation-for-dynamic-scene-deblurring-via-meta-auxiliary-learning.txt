Images captured in dynamic scenes often suffer from blur caused by object motions and camera shake, making it challenging to restore clean images. Previous research has attempted to address this issue, with deep neural networks (DNNs) emerging as a popular approach. However, existing DNN-based methods often fail to exploit the unique properties of individual test images, leading to suboptimal results. Additionally, these methods rely heavily on the distribution of training data and may struggle with distribution shifts. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel approach that combines meta-learning and auxiliary-learning paradigms. The proposed method utilizes self-reconstruction as an auxiliary task, improving the performance of the primary deblurring task. Additionally, meta-auxiliary learning enables effective and fast model adaptation at test-time, enhancing the generalization capability of the model. Unlike previous approaches, this method does not require surrogate training pairs during testing. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in dynamic scene deblurring and has potential applications in other image restoration tasks where surrogate training pairs are unavailable.
