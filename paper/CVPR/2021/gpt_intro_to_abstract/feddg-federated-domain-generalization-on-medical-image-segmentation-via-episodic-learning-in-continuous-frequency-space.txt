Data collaboration across multiple medical institutions is essential for building accurate and robust data-driven deep networks for medical image segmentation. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving solution for training models on distributed datasets. However, existing FL models for medical image segmentation focus on improving performance on internal clients and neglect the generalizability of models to unseen domains outside the federation.To address this limitation, we introduce the novel problem of Federated Domain Generalization (FedDG), which aims to learn a federated model that can directly generalize to completely unseen domains. This is particularly challenging in the federated paradigm, where data are stored distributedly and each client can only access its local data. Existing methods for unseen domain generalization are not applicable in the FedDG scenario.To overcome this challenge, we propose a privacy-preserving solution that enables each client to access multi-source data distributions. We leverage the amplitude and phase spectrum in the frequency space to transmit distribution information while preserving privacy. We also introduce a continuous frequency space interpolation mechanism to enrich the multi-domain distributions for each client, promoting domain-invariance in local training. Additionally, we devise a boundary-oriented episodic learning scheme that exposes local optimization to domain shifts and enhances model generalizability at the ambiguous boundary area.Our contributions include tackling the practical problem of Federated Domain Generalization for the first time, proposing a privacy-preserving solution for learning generalizable FL models, presenting a novel boundary-oriented episodic learning scheme, and conducting extensive experiments on retinal fundus image segmentation and prostate MRI segmentation tasks. Our approach demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods and showcases the effectiveness of our approach in improving model generalizability.
