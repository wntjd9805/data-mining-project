Instance segmentation is a crucial problem with applications in various domains. Existing approaches have achieved impressive results on large-scale datasets, assuming fully supervised settings. However, relying on human-annotated segmentation masks has limitations in generalization to novel and long-tail objects. Extending annotated categories is costly and time-consuming. To overcome this, weaker forms of supervision have been explored, but they still require known bounding boxes of all categories. In this work, we propose an unsupervised instance segmentation method that discovers long-tail objects through representation learning using hierarchical self-supervision. Our approach leverages class-agnostic mask proposals and focuses on representation learning. We exploit the hierarchical visual structure of objects and introduce triplet losses to learn better mask features and capture hierarchical relations. Our method outperforms existing partially supervised models even without bounding box annotations, and can discover and segment novel object categories. We summarize our contributions as: 1) proposing a method that eliminates the need for ground truth annotation of long-tail categories, 2) leveraging hyperbolic embeddings to capture hierarchical structure, and 3) outperforming partially supervised methods with less supervision, providing baseline numbers on a large vocabulary instance segmentation dataset.
