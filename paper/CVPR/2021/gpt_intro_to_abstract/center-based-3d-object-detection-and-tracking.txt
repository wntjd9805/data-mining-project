Abstract:This paper addresses the challenges of 3D object detection on point-clouds, which differ significantly from traditional 2D detection. Point-clouds are sparse and lack measurements for most parts of objects, resulting in 3D detection outputs that are not well-aligned with any global coordinate frame. Additionally, 3D objects exhibit a wide range of sizes, shapes, and aspect ratios. A transfer of ideas between the 2D and 3D domains is made difficult by these differences. The main challenge lies in the representation of objects, as an axis-aligned 2D box is insufficient for representing free-form 3D objects. To address these challenges, the paper presents CenterPoint, a two-stage 3D detector that represents objects as points rather than bounding boxes. CenterPoint utilizes a keypoints detector and a second stage to refine object estimates. The center-based representation simplifies object recognition and downstream tasks such as tracking. Experimental results on Waymo Open and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that the switch from box representation to center-based representation improves 3D detection performance. Two-stage refinement further enhances performance without significant computational overhead. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D detection and tracking tasks on both datasets and demonstrates real-time processing speeds.
