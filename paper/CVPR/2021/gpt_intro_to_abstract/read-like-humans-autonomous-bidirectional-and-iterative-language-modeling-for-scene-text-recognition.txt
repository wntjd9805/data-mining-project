This paper introduces ABINet, a novel approach to scene text recognition (STR) that is guided by the principles of autonomous, bidirectional, and iterative language modeling. In traditional STR methods, characters are recognized as meaningless symbols using classification models. However, in challenging environments such as occlusion and blur, character recognition becomes difficult. ABINet addresses this problem by decoupling the vision model (VM) and language model (LM), allowing them to be learned independently. The LM is designed as a bidirectional cloze network (BCN), which takes into account both left and right context to predict illegible characters. ABINet also incorporates an iterative correction mechanism, where predictions from the BCN are fed back into the LM for refinement. Furthermore, ABINet explores semi-supervised methods based on self-training for human-level recognition. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on mainstream benchmarks and shows promising improvement with ensemble self-training. Overall, this paper contributes to the advancements in STR by introducing the principles of autonomy, bidirectionality, and iteration in LM design.
