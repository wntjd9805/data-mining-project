Automatic radiology report generation is a critical task in clinical practice to alleviate the heavy workload on radiologists and improve the accuracy of reporting abnormalities in medical images. However, existing methods face challenges in capturing rare and diverse abnormal regions and generating specific crucial abnormalities due to data deviation in both visual and textual information. To address these problems, we propose the Posterior-and-Prior Knowledge Exploring-and-Distilling (PPKED) framework. The framework consists of three modules: the Posterior Knowledge Explorer (PoKE), which extracts abnormal regions based on input images, the Prior Knowledge Explorer (PrKE), which encodes prior working experience and medical knowledge, and the Multi-domain Knowledge Distiller (MKD), which distills useful knowledge for report generation. Our experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, highlighting the effectiveness of the PPKED framework in accurately describing rare and diverse abnormalities. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses related works, Section 3 presents our proposed approach, Section 4 presents experimental results, and Section 5 concludes the paper.
