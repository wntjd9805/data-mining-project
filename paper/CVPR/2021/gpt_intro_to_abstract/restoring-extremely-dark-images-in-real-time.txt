The proposed research introduces a new deep learning architecture for extreme low-light single image restoration. This architecture aims to address the limitations of existing methods in terms of computational cost and real-world deployment. While previous solutions prioritize restoration quality over speed and efficiency, the proposed architecture focuses on achieving similar restoration quality with drastically lower operations.The research proposes a deep learning network that extracts most of the necessary information from higher scale-spaces, operating at lower resolution, and skips intermediate scales. At the highest scale, a modified version of the widely used Residual Dense Block (RDB) is utilized. The modification reduces negative clipping side effects while maintaining sufficient non-linearity. Additionally, the architecture incorporates architectural parallelism for concurrent processing of scale-spaces, providing a 30% speedup without compromising restoration quality.The research also introduces a new amplification module that estimates the amplification directly from the input dark raw image, eliminating the need for knowledge of the ground-truth exposure. This module adapts to varying light levels, potentially achieving better perceptual scores than the ground-truth image. Importantly, the amplification module can be incorporated into existing pre-trained models without requiring fine-tuning.In summary, the contributions of this research include a new deep learning architecture that outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of speed, computational cost, model parameters, and operations. The proposed architecture enables architectural parallelism for additional speedup without compromising restoration quality. A modified version of the Residual Dense Block is introduced for better restoration, and a novel amplification module is developed for real-world scenarios. The research demonstrates the generalizability of the model to unseen cameras and subsequent tasks, such as object detection, without the need for fine-tuning.
