Deep convolutional neural networks have become highly successful in computer vision applications, but their performance heavily relies on large-scale labeled datasets. However, collecting enough training data for a target domain of interest can be impractical. To address this challenge, open domain generalization aims to learn a generalizable representation from disparate source domains that can generalize well to any unseen target domain. This paper introduces the concept of open domain generalization and proposes a Domain-Augmented Meta-Learning (DAML) framework to tackle this problem. The framework leverages meta-learning techniques and domain augmentation methods at feature-level and label-level to overcome the challenges of disparate distributions and label sets. Experimental results demonstrate that DAML outperforms previous methods in terms of classification accuracy for both known and open classes in unseen target domains, even when dealing with extremely diverse source domains.
