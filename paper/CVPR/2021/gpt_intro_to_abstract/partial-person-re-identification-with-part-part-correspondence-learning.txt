In computer vision tasks, algorithms typically assume complete or adequately recognized input data. However, in real-world scenarios like person re-identification (re-ID) in surveillance videos, this assumption is often not satisfied due to flawed data processing pipelines. Existing methods that don't account for partial input images suffer from performance degradation, as they struggle with understanding part-whole relationships. In this paper, we focus on the challenge of partial person re-ID, where only a continuous part of the original image is available. The main difficulties in addressing this problem include handling unknown input sizes and scales, as well as eliminating irrelevant regions when computing similarity with reference images. Previous studies have tackled these difficulties separately, but we propose a unified framework called Part-Part Correspondence Learning (PPCL) that addresses both challenges. PPCL consists of a gated layout rectifier (GLRec) module and a corresponding region locator (CR-Loc) module. The GLRec module reduces input space and outputs a rectified partial image with the proper scale and layout. The CR-Loc module produces a corresponding patch in the reference image based on the rectified partial image, and similarity between two images is calculated using only shared semantically corresponding regions. Training the CR-Loc module is challenging because there is no part-level correspondence signal available during training. To overcome this, we propose two self-supervised training schemes: Part-Part Cycle constraint (PP-Cycle) and Part-Part Triplet constraint (PP-Triplet). PP-Cycle enforces a self-supervised cycle consistency constraint by leveraging the duality of finding corresponding regions. PP-Triplet formulates a triplet constraint using randomly sampled negative exemplars. Our methodology aims to find semantically corresponding regions on reference images without additional supervision and provides insights into correspondence learning. Experimental results on partial person re-ID show significant performance improvement and demonstrate the learned semantic correspondence. Extended experimental results on partial face recognition are also provided.
