3D object detection plays a crucial role in various applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and virtual reality. Recent advancements in this field have been driven by deep neural networks and large-scale human-annotated datasets. However, 3D detectors developed on one specific domain may not generalize well to novel testing domains due to domain shifts arising from different types of 3D sensors, weather conditions, and geographical locations. This poses a challenge in adapting 3D detectors from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, which is known as unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for 3D object detection.While there have been extensive studies on UDA in the 2D image setting, few efforts have been made to explore UDA for 3D detection. The fundamental differences in data structures and network architectures make UDA approaches for image tasks not readily applicable to 3D object detection. To address this gap, we propose a novel self-training approach, ST3D, for UDA on 3D object detection.ST3D follows a two-step process: pre-training the model on labeled source data and then iteratively generating pseudo labels and training the model on unlabeled target data. To overcome the bias in object size on the source domain, we introduce random object scaling (ROS) as a simple 3D object augmentation technique during pre-training. For pseudo label generation, we develop a quality-aware triplet memory bank (QTMB) that assesses the quality of pseudo boxes, avoids assigning pseudo labels to ambiguous examples, and reduces label noise through ensemble and voting. In the model training process, we incorporate curriculum data augmentation (CDA) to gradually increase the intensity of augmentation, preventing overfitting to easy examples.Experimental results on four 3D object detection datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. We achieve significant performance improvements compared to source-only results and outperform existing approaches. Furthermore, our approach even surpasses oracle results in specific settings. ST3D provides a promising direction for UDA in 3D object detection and opens up opportunities for further research in domain adaptation techniques in this domain.
