3D scene understanding is an important problem in the field of Computer Vision. Current methods in this area rely on supervised learning, which requires extensive 3D annotation and can have limitations in generalization. Non-supervised approaches using generative models and optimization algorithms have been explored, but none have been applied to 3D perception problems. In this paper, we propose the use of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a discrete AI algorithm, for optimization in 3D scene understanding. We present a modified version of MCTS called Monte Carlo Scene Search (MCSS) and apply it to object and layout recognition in indoor scenes. Our method produces annotations that are sometimes more accurate than existing manual annotations and can be applied to new data without parameter tuning. Running our method takes a few minutes per scene, and while it is slower than supervised methods, it has the potential to generate annotations for training faster inference models. Additionally, the versatility of MCTS suggests that our approach could be applied to other perception problems and integrated with control architectures.
