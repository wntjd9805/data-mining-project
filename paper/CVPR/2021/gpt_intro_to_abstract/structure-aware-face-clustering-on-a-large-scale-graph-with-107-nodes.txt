Recent advancements in face recognition have been made possible by the availability of large-scale datasets. However, as the demand for larger datasets increases, traditional unsupervised face clustering methods, such as K-Means and DBSCAN, become less effective. To overcome this limitation, recent research has turned to supervised learning using Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs). Global-based GCN methods, such as GCN-V+E, use the entire graph for training but are limited by GPU memory. On the other hand, local-based GCN methods, such as GCN-D, lack a comprehensive understanding of the global graph structure. In this paper, we propose a structure-aware face clustering method called STAR-FC to address the challenges of large-scale training and efficient inference. We design a GCN based on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) affinity graph to estimate edge confidence and introduce a structure-preserved subgraph sampling strategy for larger-scale GCN training. During inference, face clustering is performed in two steps: graph parsing and graph refinement, where node intimacy is utilized to mine local structural information for further refinement. Our experiments demonstrate that with these structure-aware designs, STAR-FC achieves state-of-the-art face clustering results and provides a strong baseline for large-scale face clustering. Our contributions include the proposal of a subgraph sampling strategy to break through the limitation of training data scale and an efficient inference approach that takes the entire graph as input.
