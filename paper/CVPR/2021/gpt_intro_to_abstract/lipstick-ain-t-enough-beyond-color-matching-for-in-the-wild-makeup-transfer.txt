Facial beauty has long been a fascination for humans, particularly females, with makeup being the most popular method of enhancing appearance. Makeup try-on, specifically makeup transfer, is a vital application in retail and entertainment industries. This task involves transferring the makeup style from one reference face to another, considering factors such as head pose, illumination, facial expressions, and occlusions. Deep-learning-based generative models, such as BeautyGAN, BeautyGlow, PSGAN, and CA-GAN, have made significant progress in this area, but they are limited in handling complex makeup styles that rely on shape, texture, and location. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines color transformation and pattern addition to achieve realistic makeup transfer. The framework consists of two branches: Color Transfer Branch and Pattern Transfer Branch, which operate independently on warped faces in UV space. We introduce new makeup-transfer datasets covering a wide range of styles, including extreme makeups not found in previous datasets. Through extensive experiments, our method outperforms existing techniques in terms of coverage and achieves state-of-the-art performance in both light and extreme makeup transfer. Our contributions include a comprehensive makeup transfer method, a novel network architecture, new datasets, and improved quantitative and qualitative results.
