Image-based rendering and novel view synthesis are important problems in computer vision and graphics with applications in entertainment, virtual reality, and augmented reality. Recent advancements in neural rendering techniques have enabled high-quality image generation. However, these techniques suffer from slow computation and memory inefficiency. The primary computational bottleneck in neural volume rendering is the evaluation of integrals along the rendered rays during training and inference. Monte Carlo sampling is typically used for approximate integration, but this requires multiple forward passes through the neural network for each ray in a single frame. In this paper, we propose a general and efficient framework for approximate integration. Our framework utilizes coordinate-based networks that accurately represent signals and their derivatives. By taking the derivative of a coordinate-based network, we create a "grad network" that shares the parameters of the original network. This grad network can be trained on the signal to be integrated, and by reassembling its parameters into the original network, we obtain a neural network representing the antiderivative of the signal. This allows for the calculation of definite integrals in just two evaluations of the network. We call this procedure automatic integration or AutoInt. AutoInt provides a closed-form solution for the antiderivative, enabling fast evaluation of arbitrary definite integrals by querying the network. We apply this framework to the specific problem of neural volume rendering and achieve significant speedup in the rendering process, although with a slight reduction in image quality. Our contributions include introducing a framework for automatic integration, exploring new network architectures and training strategies, proposing a more efficient model and parameterization for neural volume rendering, and improving the tradeoff between rendering speed and image quality. Overall, AutoInt has the potential to accelerate rendering times and make neural rendering techniques more competitive with real-time graphics pipelines.
