Scene understanding in computer vision involves recognizing and understanding visual cues in complex visual environments. Semantic scene graphs (SG) have been used in computer graphics to depict objects and their structural relationships. This paper focuses on 3D point-based semantic SG analysis, which is an emerging task in 3D visual recognition. The proposed 3D SGGpoint framework aims to bridge perception and reasoning in 3D scene understanding through scene graph construction, reasoning, and inference. The framework incorporates an edge-oriented graph convolution network (EdgeGCN) to model inter-node relationships, twinning interactions between SG nodes and edges for comprehensive reasoning, and an attentional mechanism to enhance the utilization of visual clues. The integrated SGGpoint framework is shown to be effective in generating 3D scene structures from both computer-generated and real-world 3D scenes. The edge-driven interaction scheme also benefits conventional graph representation learning tasks. This work contributes to the advancement of scene understanding in computer vision and has potential applications in interior decoration design, autonomous vehicles, and AI-enhanced industries.
