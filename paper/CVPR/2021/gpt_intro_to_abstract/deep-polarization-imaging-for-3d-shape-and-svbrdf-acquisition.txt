In this work, we present a method for acquiring the shape and spatially varying reflectance of 3D objects. The accurate acquisition of object shape and appearance has important applications in various fields such as analysis/recognition, visual effects, games, virtual reality, cultural heritage, advertising, and design. Recent advances in digital imaging have led to the development of image-based acquisition techniques that make the acquisition process more practical and accessible.Our method builds upon previous works that use deep learning for 3D object appearance capture. Specifically, we leverage deep learning and additional photometric cues to improve the recovery of object appearance. We employ acquisition under frontal flash illumination, similar to recent works, but we also integrate polarization imaging and exploit polarization cues in conjunction with deep learning. This allows us to estimate the surface normals and physically-based spatially-varying BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) of objects, resulting in higher quality renderings under different lighting conditions.We address the limitations of arbitrary environment illumination on polarization signal quality by using flash illumination. We demonstrate that this approach improves the quality of surface normal estimation and enables the processing of non-homogeneous objects. Our method also outperforms previous methods in estimating the spatially-varying BRDF.To facilitate our research, we create a new synthetic dataset that simulates polarization behavior on different geometries and SVBRDFs (Spatially-Varying Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions). This dataset is used to train an improved deep network architecture inspired by previous works. By observing the polarization information of an object from a single view direction under frontal flash illumination, our method estimates the 3D shape, surface normals, depth maps, and various reflectance properties, enabling high-quality renderings under novel lighting conditions.In summary, our contributions include proposing a method for joint 3D shape and SVBRDF estimation using polarization cues and deep learning. We also publish a new synthetic dataset with diffuse polarization effects for supervised learning. We analyze the effectiveness of polarization cues under different lighting conditions and provide a practical acquisition protocol for achieving high-quality results. Additionally, we introduce an improved deep network architecture and training loss for 3D object appearance acquisition.
