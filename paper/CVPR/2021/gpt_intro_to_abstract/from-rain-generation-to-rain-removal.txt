Recently, single image rain removal (SIRR) has attracted considerable attention as a necessary pre-processing step for outdoor image processing tasks. Deep learning (DL) has become the dominant approach for SIRR due to the availability of large training datasets and the powerful fitting capability of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, most DL-based methods focus more on improving the design of deraining models and learning strategies, while putting less emphasis on the impact of training data.This paper aims to address the limitations of existing SIRR datasets and explore the potential of improving DL-based derainers by ameliorating the quality of these datasets. Current datasets are mainly obtained through various methods such as synthesizing rain streaks using photo-realistic rendering techniques, exploring fusion mechanisms between clear images and rain streaks, unpaired image translation, and semi-automatically generating real rain datasets. However, these generation methods possess limitations and may not fully represent the diversity and complexity of real-world rain.To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a generative model that explores the intrinsic generative mechanism underlying rain streaks. The proposed model represents the implicit distribution of rains and uses a deep variational inference algorithm to approximate the expected distribution of rainy images. This model not only enables the generation of high-quality rain streaks with diverse and non-repetitive shapes but also provides intrinsic clues for understanding the generation of rains.The contributions of this work are three-fold. Firstly, it proposes a generative model that captures the statistical distribution of rain layers. Secondly, it presents an interpretable rain generator that can generate diverse and non-repetitive rain streaks without relying on subjective human intervention. Thirdly, it demonstrates the potential of the proposed generator in augmenting diverse rains for DL-based SIRR derainers, leading to significant performance improvements.Overall, this work highlights the importance of improving the quality and diversity of training datasets in order to enhance the performance of DL-based SIRR derainers. The proposed generative model provides a promising approach to automatically and faithfully generate diverse rains, paving the way for future advancements in SIRR research.
