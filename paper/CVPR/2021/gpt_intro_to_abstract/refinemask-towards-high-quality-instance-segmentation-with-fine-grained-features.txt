Instance segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, which involves assigning each pixel in an image to a specific semantic category and distinguishing individual instances within that category. Recent state-of-the-art methods for instance segmentation typically follow a two-stage approach. The first stage involves using a powerful object detector to generate high-quality bounding boxes, followed by a parallel segmentation branch that predicts binary masks for each instance within the bounding box. However, these methods suffer from a loss of image details, which are crucial for high-quality instance segmentation. This loss is mainly caused by the use of multi-level features from the feature pyramid, which result in coarser spatial resolution and difficulties in preserving details during the mapping of mask predictions back to the input space. Additionally, the pooling operation employed further reduces the spatial size of the features, leading to additional information loss. This paper proposes a new method, called ReÔ¨ÅneMask, which aims to address these issues and improve the accuracy of instance segmentation. The proposed method is compared to existing methods, such as Mask R-CNN and DeepLabV3+, demonstrating its superiority in preserving image details and achieving accurate segmentation results.
