Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based denoisers have achieved impressive results in image denoising by utilizing the supervised learning approach. However, the availability of clean and noisy image pairs for training is often limited, especially in real-world settings such as medical imaging. To address this limitation, two approaches have emerged: one uses unpaired clean images to generate synthetic noisy images for training, while the other trains a denoiser solely based on noisy images. These approaches, however, have their own limitations in terms of performance and practicality. In this paper, we propose Fast Blind Image Denoiser (FBI-Denoiser) as an improvement over the existing BP-AIDE method. Firstly, we introduce PGE-Net, a network that learns to estimate the Poisson-Gaussian noise parameters solely from noisy images, resulting in a more efficient and accurate estimation process. Secondly, we devise FBI-Net, a compact fully convolutional blind-spot network architecture that reduces inference time without sacrificing performance. The FBI-Denoiser is trained in two steps: first with PGE-Net using noisy images, and then with FBI-Net using the same noisy images and the outputs of PGE-Net. Our proposed method achieves a significant improvement in inference time compared to BP-AIDE while also achieving state-of-the-art blind denoising performance on real-world noise benchmarks. By leveraging the benefits of both PGE-Net and FBI-Net, our approach provides a practical solution for image denoising in scenarios where clean-noisy image pairs are not readily available.
