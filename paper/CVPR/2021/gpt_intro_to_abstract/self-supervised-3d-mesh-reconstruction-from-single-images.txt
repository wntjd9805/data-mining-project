Single-view 3D object reconstruction is a well-known problem in computer vision with various applications. Traditional methods use 3D prior models, but building these models is time-consuming and not applicable to diverse objects. In the deep learning era, deep models have been used for supervised reconstruction, but they require 3D annotations. On the other hand, 2D supervised methods do not require 3D annotations but do not ensure accurate 3D attribute prediction. This paper proposes a self-supervised approach called Self-Supervised Mesh Reconstruction (SMR) to reconstruct category-specific 3D mesh objects from single images. The proposed approach predicts 3D attributes and supervises them at both the 2D and 3D levels. Additionally, two novel self-supervised methods, Interpolated Consistency (IC) and Landmark Consistency (LC), are introduced to enhance the learning process of 3D mesh attributes. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art mesh reconstruction methods and improves both 2D supervised and unsupervised reconstruction.
