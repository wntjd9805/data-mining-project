Abstract:Visual object detection has seen significant progress in recent years due to the availability of large-scale datasets and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, annotating objects is expensive and time-consuming, leading to a growing interest in few-shot detection, which mimics human learning by training models to detect objects from both base and novel classes with limited supervision. This two-stage training approach involves representation learning with base classes and novel class reconstruction. While several methods have been proposed, the inherent contradiction between representation and classification in few-shot object detection has been overlooked. This paper introduces the Class Margin Equilibrium (CME) approach, which optimizes feature space partition through adversarial class margin regularization. CME incorporates a fully connected layer to decouple localization features and pursues margin equilibrium through the introduction of class margin loss and feature disturbance module. The proposed approach demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline detectors and sheds light on the representation-classification constraint in few-shot object detection.
