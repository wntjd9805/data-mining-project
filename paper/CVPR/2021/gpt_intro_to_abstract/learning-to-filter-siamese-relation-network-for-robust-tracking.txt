Visual object tracking is an essential task in computer vision, with applications in autonomous driving, robotics, surveillance, and human-computer interaction. Existing tracking methods need to be accurate, fast, and robust in the face of challenges like occlusions, fast motions, appearance deformations, illumination changes, and background clutter. While Siamese network-based trackers have gained attention for their speed and performance balance, they are not as robust as discriminative trackers equipped with an update mechanism, particularly in the presence of similar distractors or background clutter. This is because Siamese trackers focus on matching the same target and do not effectively distinguish between different targets. Additionally, Siamese-style cropping strategies may introduce distracting context, and the classification and regression branches of Siamese-based trackers are usually optimized independently, leading to a mismatch between them during tracking. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel Siamese relation network with two efficient modules: the Relation Detector (RD) and the Refinement Module (RM). RD is trained to filter out distractors from the background using meta-learning. It learns to distinguish between target and non-target categories through one-shot learning with nonlinear learnable comparators. The RM integrates information from RD and the classification branch to refine tracking results and reduce the mismatch between classification and regression. RD is equipped with a contrastive training strategy that not only learns to match the same target but also pays attention to distinguishing different objects. The proposed tracker demonstrates excellent discriminability and robustness in the presence of background clutter, fast motion, and occlusion. Experimental results on five popular tracking benchmarks show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art trackers, confirming its effectiveness. The main contributions of this paper include the introduction of RD, which filters out distractors using few-shot learning and a contrastive training strategy, and the design of the RM to integrate information and reduce mismatch between classification and regression. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks, further validating its effectiveness.
