Face swapping, the process of transferring the identity from one face image to another while preserving the facial attributes of the target image, has gained significant attention due to its potential applications in entertainment, privacy protection, and the theatrical industry. Existing face swapping methods can be categorized as subject-specific or subject-agnostic. Subject-specific methods require training and testing on the same pair of subjects, limiting their applications. On the other hand, subject-agnostic methods can be applied to arbitrary identities without additional training. This paper focuses on the challenging task of one-shot face swapping, where only one image is available for both the source and target identities in both training and testing. With the increasing popularity of high-resolution image and video data, the generation of high-resolution swapped faces poses several challenges. Firstly, the compressed representation in an end-to-end framework results in insufficient information for high-quality face generation. Secondly, the instability of adversarial training restricts the resolution of previous methods to only 256x256. Thirdly, GPU memory limitations or small training batch sizes worsen the training process collapse. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the MegaFS method for megapixel-level one-shot face swapping. The method adopts a "divide and conquer" strategy in three steps. Firstly, to overcome information loss in the encoder, the paper introduces a Hierarchical Representation Face Encoder (HieRFE) that utilizes GAN Inversion methods to find the complete face representation in an extended latent space. Secondly, a novel swapping module called the Face Transfer Module (FTM) is proposed to modify face representations and control multiple attributes synchronously without explicit feature disentanglement. Finally, the unstable adversarial training problem is mitigated by leveraging StyleGAN2 as the decoder and not optimizing the discriminator. Each part of MegaFS can be independently trained, satisfying the GPU memory requirements for megapixel face swapping. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: (1) MegaFS is the first method capable of conducting one-shot face swapping at the megapixel level, and (2) the proposed HieRFE and FTM enable encoding and manipulating the complete face representation and managing multiple attributes without explicit feature disentanglement, respectively.
