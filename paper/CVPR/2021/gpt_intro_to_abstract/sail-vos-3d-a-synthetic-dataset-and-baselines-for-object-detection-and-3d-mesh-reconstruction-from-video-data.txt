Understanding the 3D shape of an observed object over time is a significant goal in computer vision. Early work focused on recovering simple geometric primitives in images, but the field has since advanced with the ability to detect objects and infer their complex 3D shapes from a single image. Single-view 3D shape reconstruction has gained attention, achieving realistic reconstructions through data-driven and learning-based approaches. However, these methods only consider single input images and do not utilize temporal information. This paper aims to explore how methods can benefit from the complementary information available in multiple views. Classical multi-view 3D reconstruction techniques exploit geometric properties in multiple views, but assumptions of a static scene are often violated in practice. This paper proposes a new approach called SAIL-VOS 3D, which incorporates temporal information to aid in 3D shape reconstruction. Comparative analysis with existing 3D datasets shows the unique features and advantages of SAIL-VOS 3D.
