This paper addresses the problem of poor generalization performance of deep neural network models in classifying real-world object images using a classification model trained on simulated object images. This issue arises due to dataset shift or domain shift. To overcome this problem, domain adaptation (DA) methods have been developed to transfer knowledge from label-rich datasets to label-scare scenarios without the need for expensive human labeling. Existing DA methods can be categorized into unsupervised DA and semi-supervised DA, depending on the availability of labeled data in the target domain. This paper focuses on unsupervised DA, where no labeled data is available in the target domain during training.Recent deep unsupervised DA approaches, which aim to learn domain-invariant feature representations, have shown promising results. However, these approaches often assume covariate shift, which may not hold in real-world applications. Another line of research uses semi-supervised learning (SSL) techniques for DA problems, where the target domain is treated as an unlabeled set in SSL. However, SSL-based DA methods may fail to classify target samples far away from the source domain due to the ignorance of domain shift.To address these challenges, this paper proposes a new pseudo-labeling framework called Auxiliary Target Domain-Oriented Classifier (ATDOC) for DA problems. ATDOC aims to alleviate labeling bias by introducing an auxiliary classifier specifically for target data. Two types of non-parametric classifiers, namely nearest centroid classifier (NC) and neighborhood aggregation (NA), are designed to avoid additional network parameters. The class centroids and local neighborhood structures are capable of representing the target domain, resulting in unbiased and reliable pseudo labels for target data.To enable global structure learning with mini-batch optimization, a memory module is introduced to store information over all the unlabeled target samples. Additionally, since no labeled data is available in the target domain, noisy pseudo labels are directly exploited as an alternative. The proposed ATDOC framework achieves competitive or better results than prior state-of-the-art methods under various DA settings, such as partial-set unsupervised DA and semi-supervised DA. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing domain-invariant feature learning methods to further improve adaptation performance. Furthermore, ATDOC outperforms other SSL techniques even in the absence of domain shift in an SSL setting with only a few annotated data points.
