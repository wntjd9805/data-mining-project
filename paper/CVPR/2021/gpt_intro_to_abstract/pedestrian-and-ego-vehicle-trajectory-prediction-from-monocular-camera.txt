Predicting the future behavior of objects in images and videos is crucial in applications like robotics and automotive systems. Specifically, predicting the trajectory of pedestrians is important for autonomous and assistive driving systems. Current methods based on single cameras mounted on vehicles, known as first-person view monocular methods, are gaining attention due to their low sensing hardware requirements. However, existing pedestrian trajectory prediction methods fail in dynamic scenes captured by on-board cameras due to changing viewpoints, occlusions, and other scene dynamics. Additionally, these methods rely on discovering pedestrian motion patterns, which is not possible in on-board videos where the car's movement is the main observed effect. To address these challenges, we propose a method that disentangles the motion of pedestrians from the ego-motion of the vehicle. We observe that pedestrian motion only affects a specific part of the image, while vehicle ego-motion affects the appearance of the whole scene. Using a self-supervised training paradigm, we train a network to predict ego-motion, similar to existing self-supervised depth estimation systems, but with a focus on predicting future ego-motion. This allows us to subtract the predicted motion of the vehicle and observe and predict the intrinsic pedestrian motion in a normalized view. By normalizing the view, we can use a simple model to predict pedestrian motion and achieve state-of-the-art results on public datasets. Compared to previous methods that rely on complex predictors, our predictor is simpler and does not require additional annotations. The proposed method is suitable for use with monocular cameras, making it applicable in current-generation vehicles without advanced LiDAR sensors or as a redundancy system in autonomous cars. The view normalization also enables integration with stationary camera-based trajectory prediction methods. In summary, our contributions include introducing a self-supervised framework for ego-vehicle movement prediction, using this framework to disentangle vehicle and pedestrian motion, and demonstrating the effectiveness of a simple linear model for trajectory prediction when pedestrian viewpoints are normalized.
