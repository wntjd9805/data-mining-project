The paper introduces a novel single-stage framework for 3D object detection using hybrid 3D representations. The authors propose a memory module to augment point-based features, making the method efficient. They also introduce an Attentive Multi-scale Feature Module (AMFM) that provides scale-aware features, considering the sparse and irregular patterns of point clouds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the approach. The model achieves competitive performance on the KITTI dataset, running at a speed of 36.1fps. The code and models are available online. The contributions of the paper include the introduction of the single-stage framework, the use of the memory module, and the introduction of the AMFM for scale-aware features. The paper presents a better compromise in terms of speed and accuracy compared to the state of the art.
