The problem of 3D face texture completion and face rotation generation from a single image has important applications in face analysis, pose-invariant face recognition, and 3D modelling. Existing methods for texture completion and rotation generation have primarily relied on regression-based techniques. However, these methods may lose identity-related features and often require large amounts of labeled training data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that redefines texture completion and rotation generation as an optimization problem. Our method optimizes for identity-related features alongside other criteria, resulting in visually impressive results. Additionally, our approach leverages 2D face generators to recover unseen parts of the face in 3D without the need for extensive 3D data collection. We contribute to the field by introducing a well-engineered methodology and cost function for one-shot optimization-based texture completion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through qualitative and quantitative experiments. Furthermore, we leverage our method to train a large-scale prior of 3D facial textures using in-the-wild images, which can be used to enhance 3D face reconstruction algorithms.
