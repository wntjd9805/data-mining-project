In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have greatly improved object detection techniques. However, the success of these networks heavily relies on large-scale datasets, limiting their performance when labeled data is scarce. In contrast, humans have demonstrated the ability to learn new concepts with only a few examples. This has led to increased attention on few-shot learning, where models are trained to generalize well with limited examples. While existing few-shot learning works mainly focus on image classification, few studies have addressed the more challenging problem of few-shot object detection.Previous studies in few-shot object detection can be categorized into two groups. Some adopt a meta-learning framework to perform feature reweighting for class-specific predictions, while others use a two-stage fine-tuning approach that only fine-tunes the last layer of detectors. However, these methods have limitations. They fail to fully explore the relations between support features and query features, resulting in a loss of detailed local context. They also struggle with the scale variation problem in few-shot detection tasks.To address these challenges, this paper proposes two modules: the dense relation distillation module and the context-aware feature aggregation module. The dense relation distillation module matches query and support features at a pixel-wise level, effectively utilizing local information for improved detection performance. The context-aware feature aggregation module captures essential cues for different scales during region of interest (RoI) pooling, mitigating the scale variation problem by adapting pooling resolutions.The contributions of this paper include the development of the dense relation distillation module and the context-aware feature aggregation module for few-shot object detection. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate the consistent improvement and better performance of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods.Keywords: object detection, deep convolutional neural networks, few-shot learning, feature reweighting, scale variation, relation distillation, context-aware feature aggregation.
