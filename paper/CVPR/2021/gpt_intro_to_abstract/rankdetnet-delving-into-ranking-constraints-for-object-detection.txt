Object detection is an essential task in computer vision with various research fields and practical applications. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have significantly advanced deep learning-based object detectors compared to traditional methods. There are two main approaches for object detection: two-stage and one-stage detectors. Two-stage methods achieve superior performance but require large computational resources, limiting their use on resource-constrained devices. One-stage detectors aim to detect objects directly from pre-defined anchors but often suffer from foreground-background class imbalance. Anchor-free methods attempt to detect objects by predicting points instead of using anchor boxes.The focal loss has been successful in addressing class imbalance but has two limitations. First, it treats each sample independently, leading to suboptimal detection performance. Second, there is a mismatch between classification and localization tasks, resulting in the suppression of accurately localized proposals during post-processing. Existing methods for addressing this problem require additional network structures and computation costs.To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a ranking-based optimization algorithm that explicitly models the relationships between pairs of proposals. Instead of point-wise ranking, the algorithm uses two pair-wise ranking losses: global ranking loss and class-specific ranking loss. The global ranking loss encourages foreground samples to rank higher, while the class-specific ranking loss ensures positive proposals of a specific class rank higher than negatives. To address the mismatch between classification and localization, an IoU-guided ranking loss aligns object confidence scores with IoU overlaps between positive proposals. The proposed algorithm, called RankDetNet, is evaluated on the COCO benchmark and compared against state-of-the-art methods. RankDetNet consistently improves existing anchor-based and anchor-free object detectors, achieving significant gains in AP. The ranking constraints are also applied to 3D object detection, resulting in improved performance over baseline methods. The proposed algorithm offers several contributions, including the replacement of the conventional classification loss with pair-wise ranking losses, an effective alternative for classification, and an IoU-guided ranking loss to address the mismatch between classification and localization tasks. Additionally, RankDetNet demonstrates consistent performance improvements, validating its superiority and generality.
