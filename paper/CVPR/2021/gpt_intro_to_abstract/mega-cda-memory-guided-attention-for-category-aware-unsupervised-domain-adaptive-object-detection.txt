Object detectors are a crucial component in various applications such as autonomous navigation, video surveillance, and image analysis. Despite the significant interest and recent advancements in object detection, existing approaches often suffer from performance degradation when evaluated on images that differ in distribution from the training set. This limitation is particularly relevant in real-world scenarios, such as deploying object detectors trained on datasets from one city or environment to another. Unsupervised domain adaptation has been proposed as a solution to this issue, aiming to improve the performance of object detectors on new, unlabeled target domain data by leveraging labeled source domain data. Previous methods have focused on aligning the global distribution of features between the source and target domains. However, in the case of object detection, this global alignment may lead to sub-optimal adaptation due to the presence of multiple object categories. To address this problem, we propose incorporating category information into the domain adaptation process by matching the local joint distribution of features. Specifically, we introduce category-specific discriminators to perform category-wise alignment of features. However, since annotations are not available in unsupervised domain adaptation, we propose using memory-guided attention maps to enable category-aware feature alignment. These attention maps focus on objects of specific categories, allowing the routing of backbone features to the appropriate category-specific discriminators. In order to generate these attention maps, we utilize memory networks to store prototypes of objects from different categories and compute category-specific attention based on retrieved items from the memory network. Additionally, we propose a metric-learning based approach to improve the effectiveness of the memory module and attention map generation process. We evaluate the proposed method on benchmark datasets and adaptation protocols, demonstrating its superiority over recent domain adaptive detection approaches. Furthermore, we conduct extensive ablation studies to highlight the role of memory-guided attention in achieving category-wise alignment. Overall, our contributions include the introduction of memory-guided attention maps for category-wise distribution matching in domain adaptive object detection, the use of metric learning to enhance the memory modules, and the evaluation and analysis of the proposed method against existing approaches.
