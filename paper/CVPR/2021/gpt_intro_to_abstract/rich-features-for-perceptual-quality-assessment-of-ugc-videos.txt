Video streaming services, particularly those on social media platforms, often involve User Generated Content (UGC) that may have pre-existing distortions or compression artifacts. Understanding the perceptual subjective video quality of UGC is important for making quality of service trade-offs. However, UGC presents diverse challenges due to factors such as varying content popularity, original quality, and applied operations. In this paper, we propose a framework that comprehensively analyzes video quality, providing human-friendly descriptors to decompose the perceptual quality into its constituent parts. Our contributions include an enhanced dataset, a comprehensive analysis framework, and a state-of-the-art model for UGC quality prediction. The proposed model not only achieves high precision but also provides reliable indications of quality degradation caused by compression. These findings can benefit uploaders, service providers, recommendation systems, and video enhancement frameworks.
