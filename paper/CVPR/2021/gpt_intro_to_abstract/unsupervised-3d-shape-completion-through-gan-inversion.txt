The paper introduces the concept of 3D shape completion, which involves estimating the complete geometry of a partial shape represented as a partial point cloud. While most existing shape completion methods are trained in a supervised manner with paired partial-complete data, they struggle to generalize to out-of-domain data. In this study, an unsupervised approach called ShapeInversion is proposed, which applies GAN inversion to 3D shape completion for the first time. By leveraging prior knowledge stored in a pre-trained GAN, ShapeInversion is able to generalize well to inputs of various partial forms and real-world scans. Additionally, the involvement of GAN in ShapeInversion enables the generation of multiple reasonable complete shapes for some partial inputs, as well as shape jittering and manipulation. The paper also discusses the challenges specific to 3D data and presents two new components to address them: a uniform loss called PatchVariance to improve the uniformity of estimated point clouds, and an effective masking mechanism called k-Mask to estimate point correspondences between the partial input and predicted shape. Experimental results show that ShapeInversion outperforms existing unsupervised methods on a benchmark derived from ShapeNet and exhibits considerable generalization ability and robustness compared to supervised methods. Furthermore, ShapeInversion is able to provide multiple valid complete shapes in cases of ambiguity or extreme incompleteness.
