Camouflage is a crucial defense mechanism used by prey to avoid predators. The two main strategies employed by prey for camouflage are background matching and disruptive coloration. Background matching involves the prey blending with their surroundings, while disruptive coloration relies on high contrast markings near the body edges in complex environments. Both strategies aim to hide the prey or reduce their visibility, which is closely related to the perception and cognition of predators. Understanding camouflaged object detection can help explore the mechanisms of the human visual system and find applications in agriculture and medical imaging. Existing camouflaged object detection models are based on binary ground truth datasets, which only indicate the presence of camouflaged objects without measuring their level of camouflage. We propose a camouflage ranking model that can estimate the degree of camouflage and provide instance-level rankings of camouflaged objects. This ranking-based approach provides a better understanding of the evolution of animal camouflage and can aid in designing more sophisticated camouflage techniques. Camouflaged objects often lack obvious contrast with the background, so detecting them may rely on identifying discriminative patterns such as faces, eyes, or antennae. We propose camouflaged object discriminative region localization to identify the most detectable regions of camouflaged objects. To create a ranking-based camouflaged object detection dataset, we relabel an existing dataset using an eye tracker to record detection delays. The longer it takes for an observer to notice a camouflaged object, the higher its level of camouflage. This dataset also allows us to estimate the discriminative regions of camouflaged objects. Additionally, we contribute a new camouflaged object testing dataset called NC4K, which includes thousands of images for evaluating the generalization ability of existing models. In summary, our contributions include introducing camouflaged object ranking and localization tasks, providing corresponding datasets, and proposing a triplet tasks learning model for localizing, segmenting, and ranking camouflaged objects.
