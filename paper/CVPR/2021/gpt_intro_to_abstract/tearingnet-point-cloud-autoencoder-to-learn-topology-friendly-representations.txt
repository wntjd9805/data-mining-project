This paper introduces a novel autoencoder called TearingNet, which aims to generate topology-friendly representations for complex 3D point clouds. The authors highlight the importance of topology in human perception and machine learning and discuss the limitations of existing approaches in handling point clouds with varying topologies. To address this challenge, TearingNet combines a Tearing network and a Folding network, allowing them to interact and generate accurate reconstructions. The Tearing network tears a graph built on a 2D primitive to match the topology of the target point cloud, while the Folding network refines the reconstruction based on the torn primitive. The authors demonstrate the efficacy of TearingNet in various downstream tasks, such as shape reconstruction, object counting, and object detection. They also analyze the learned representations and show how the topology-friendliness is achieved. The contributions of this work include the proposal of TearingNet, the explicit learning of point cloud topology through graph tearing, and the application of TearingNet in topology-sensitive tasks. The paper concludes with a review of related work, a detailed presentation of the TearingNet methodology, experimental results, and conclusions.
