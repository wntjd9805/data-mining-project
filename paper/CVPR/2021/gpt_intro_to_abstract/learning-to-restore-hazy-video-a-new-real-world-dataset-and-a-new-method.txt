This paper focuses on the problem of image and video dehazing, which aims to remove haze and restore a clear scene. Dehazing algorithms are essential for various high-level vision tasks, such as scene understanding and detection. Recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning have provided new perspectives for addressing the dehazing problem. However, existing deep learning-based methods are often trained on synthetic datasets, resulting in unsatisfactory results when applied to real-world inputs due to domain shift.To address this limitation, the authors introduce realistic image dehazing datasets that better represent real-world scenarios. Despite significant progress in single-image dehazing, the authors argue that video dehazing algorithms can achieve better results by utilizing temporal redundancy from neighboring frames. However, the lack of real-world video dehazing datasets hinders the progress in this area. To overcome this challenge, the authors propose a Consecutive Frames Acquisition System (CFAS) that collects paired videos using a controllable robot arm. This system allows for the collection of real hazy and corresponding haze-free videos, contributing to the creation of the first video dehazing dataset for supervised learning, called the REal-world VIdeo DEhazing (REVIDE) Dataset.The authors then propose a Conﬁdence Guided and Improved Deformable Network (CG-IDN) for video dehazing. This algorithm utilizes a conﬁdence guided pre-dehazing module and the cost volume to improve the accuracy of estimated offsets and guide multi-feature fusion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm against state-of-the-art video and image dehazing methods.In summary, the contributions of this paper include the creation of a real-world video dehazing dataset, the REVIDE dataset, which provides a valuable benchmark for training and evaluating real-world video dehazing algorithms. Additionally, the authors propose the CG-IDN algorithm, which achieves favorable results in real-world video dehazing tasks.
