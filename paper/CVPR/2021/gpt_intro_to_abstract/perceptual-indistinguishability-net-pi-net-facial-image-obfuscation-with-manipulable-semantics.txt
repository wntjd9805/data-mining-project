Facial image datasets are increasingly available, presenting opportunities for collaboration between data owners and the machine learning community. However, privacy concerns prevent data sharing. Various facial image obfuscation techniques have been proposed, such as using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to synthesize similar images and manipulating semantics with GANs. These methods lack formal privacy guarantees and may not preserve analytical conclusions derived from original images. To address these weaknesses, differential privacy (DP) and perceptual indistinguishability (PI) are introduced. PI combines perceptual similarity and indistinguishability to protect privacy while ensuring data utility. PI-Net, a novel encoder-decoder architecture, is proposed to achieve image obfuscation with PI by injecting noise and using triplet loss to cluster similar facial attributes. The contributions of this work include the introduction of PI as a privacy notion and the development of PI-Net for anonymizing faces with preserved attributes.
