Visual object tracking in large-scale long-term scenarios has gained significant attention due to its potential in real-world applications. Long-term tracking differs from short-term tracking in that it must handle cases where the target object frequently disappears and reappears. These sequences often present challenges such as appearance changes, long-duration disappearances, and intra-class distractors. Therefore, effective long-term trackers should have the ability to re-detect objects and distinguish them from similar distractors.Various long-term trackers have been proposed, categorized as pseudo long-term trackers (LT0) and re-detecting long-term trackers (LT1). LT0 trackers utilize short-term trackers for long-term tasks, but are susceptible to drifting to distractors due to appearance confusion. LT1 trackers, on the other hand, employ re-detection strategies to recover from tracking failures, but require complex designs for the interaction between local trackers and global detectors.To address these challenges, we propose a two-task tracking framework consisting of a lightweight detection model and an explicit object association method. For the first task, we introduce dynamic convolutions (d-convs) to embed target information into a one-stage anchor-free detection model, reducing computation. For the second task, we incorporate a novel re-identification (re-id) embedding into the detection model, jointly learning the two tasks. This allows our tracker to achieve favorable performance with a compact association strategy, explicitly reasoning distractors by maintaining potential similarity tracklets.Experiments demonstrate that our tracker outperforms state-of-the-art methods on five long-term tracking benchmarks while running three times faster. Our main contributions include the proposed two-task framework, the novel dynamic convolutions generation method for efficient detection, and the effective tracklet association through discriminative re-id embedding. Overall, our approach provides a practical baseline for GIS-based trackers in real-world applications.
