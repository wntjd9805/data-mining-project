Rotation detection has gained attention due to its utility in various scenarios, but it has received relatively less study compared to horizontal object detection. Many rotation detectors are based on the vanilla detection algorithms and use regression to predict angle parameters. However, angle prediction based on regression often introduces boundary discontinuity issues, such as periodicity of angle and exchangeability of edges. Existing works have attempted to address these issues by adding constraints to the loss function, but they do not guarantee the complete elimination of boundary discontinuity behavior. To provide a more elegant and effective solution, recent research proposes the use of angle classification instead of regression and introduces the Circular Smooth Label (CSL) method to address the periodicity of angle. However, angle classification-based detectors are still in their early stages and have limitations. This paper introduces two technical advancements: the use of Densely Coded Labels (DCL) instead of Sparsely Coded Labels (SCL) to improve training time and detection accuracy, and the Angle Distance and Aspect Ratio Sensitive Weighting (ADARSW) method to eliminate periodicity of angle and adaptively adjust to an object's aspect ratio. Experimental results show that the DCL-based method outperforms regression-based and CSL-based methods in terms of accuracy. Additionally, the impact of different DCLs, including Binary Coded Label (BCL) and Gray Coded Label (GCL), is compared, with BCL showing notable speedup in training and detection accuracy. Overall, the proposed techniques improve the robustness of rotation detection and achieve superior performance compared to existing methods.
