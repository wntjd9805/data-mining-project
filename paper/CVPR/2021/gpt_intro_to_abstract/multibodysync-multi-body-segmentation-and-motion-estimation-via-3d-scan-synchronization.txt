Motion analysis in dynamic point clouds is an important area of research with applications in surveillance, autonomous driving, and robotic manipulation. While previous work has focused on specific scenarios with known category semantics, there is a lack of research on generic motion segmentation. This paper introduces the problem of multi-scan multi-body segmentation and motion estimation, where the goal is to discover and register rigid bodies from multiple scans, represented as full or partial point clouds. The authors propose a deep declarative architecture called MultiBodySync, which can process an arbitrary number of unordered point sets. The architecture includes modules for pairwise point correspondences and motion segmentation synchronization. The paper presents extensive evaluations on various datasets, demonstrating that MultiBodySync outperforms the state-of-the-art in both motion segmentation and estimation. The contributions of the paper include the novel architecture, theoretical analysis of synchronization, and cross-category generalization. The paper also introduces a new dataset for moving objects. Overall, this work addresses the challenge of multi-body motion analysis and provides a solution that is both effective and robust.
