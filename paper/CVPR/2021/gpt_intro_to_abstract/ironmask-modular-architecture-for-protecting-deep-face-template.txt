Biometric-based authentication has been at the forefront of research in computer science, with recent advancements in recognition being driven by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, the exposure of user face templates in face recognition systems poses a significant threat to user privacy and system security. To address these concerns, face template protection schemes need to satisfy the properties of irreversibility, revocability, and unlinkability while maintaining high matching performance. Existing approaches in CNN-based face template protection can be categorized into two groups: training-in-enrollment and training-before-enrollment. While the former approach requires training the CNN with face images of the target user during enrollment, the latter approach aims to mitigate retraining requirements for new users. However, the use of binary codes in these approaches results in low matching accuracy and substantial differences from non-protected face recognition systems. In this paper, we propose a novel design architecture called IronMask, which combines template protection with any face recognition system using the angular distance metric. By utilizing a real-valued error-correcting code (ECC) compatible with the angular distance metric, IronMask generates real-valued codewords and linear transformations for face templates. The protected templates satisfy the properties of irreversibility, revocability, and unlinkability while achieving high matching performance. We demonstrate the efficacy of IronMask by integrating it with two state-of-the-art face recognition systems and evaluating its performance on three widely used datasets. The experimental results showcase the superior matching performance of IronMask, with true accept rates (TAR) ranging from 98.76% to 99.79% at low false accept rates (FAR). Our approach addresses the challenges of face template protection while maintaining the advantages of non-protected biometric recognition systems.
