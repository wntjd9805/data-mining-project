Abstract:Person re-identification (ReID) is a crucial task in computer vision, aiming to identify individuals across camera networks. Despite the development of effective algorithms on large-scale ReID datasets, there is a significant gap in deploying these algorithms in real-world scenarios. This is due to the vulnerability of trained models to domain changes and the exhaustive human labor required to annotate identities in new scenarios. To address this gap, we propose UnrealPerson, a pipeline that harnesses unreal (synthesized) image data to create a powerful and easily deployable ReID algorithm across diverse scenarios. The synthesized data offers two-fold benefits in terms of generalization ability: it is more diverse compared to manually collected data from real scenarios and can be tailored to fit challenging domains like low-illumination scenarios. Our pipeline consists of pre-training the model using synthesized data and fine-tuning it with domain adaptation algorithms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments, showing improved generalization ability and competitive performance in specialized ReID scenarios. Our contributions include a novel pipeline that reduces deployment costs, a versatile toolkit for various downstream tasks, and a detailed analysis of factors in data synthesis.
