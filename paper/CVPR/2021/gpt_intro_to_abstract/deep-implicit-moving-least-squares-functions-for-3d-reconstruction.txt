This paper explores the combination of implicit function approaches and point set methods for high-quality 3D shape generation. While point sets are commonly used in 3D deep learning due to their ease of acquisition and ability to capture complex geometry, they suffer from discrete and rough geometry. On the other hand, implicit function approaches define smooth functions on 3D domains but are computationally inefficient. To address these limitations, the authors propose extending the point set representation to model implicit surfaces. They adopt point set surfaces and use moving least-squares (MLS) interpolation to define locally implicit functions over a narrow band region of the point set. The MLS function maps spatial points to signed distance values, allowing for the extraction of a smooth and continuous surface. To incorporate the MLS surface representation into a deep learning framework, the authors introduce an octree-based scaffolding for generating variable numbers of MLS points only where needed, ensuring a more optimal point distribution. They also propose using succinct sampling at octree nodes for evaluation, reducing computational costs. Extensive ablation tests are conducted to validate the design choices, and the authors demonstrate the superior performance of their deep implicit MLS surface approach compared to other point set generation methods and global or local implicit function methods in 3D object reconstruction.
