Facial Expression Recognition (FER) has gained significant attention in the field of computer vision due to its various applications in areas such as virtual reality, intelligent tutoring systems, and healthcare. The task of FER involves classifying facial images into different emotion categories. Existing FER methods focus on extracting holistic expression features but fail to capture subtle differences between facial expressions with similar actions. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method called Feature Decomposition and Reconstruction Learning (FDRL) for FER.The FDRL method consists of two crucial networks: a Feature Decomposition Network (FDN) and a Feature Reconstruction Network (FRN). The FDN decomposes basic features into facial action-aware latent features, capturing expression similarities across different emotions. Compactness loss is employed to obtain compact latent feature representations. The FRN includes an Intra-feature Relation Modeling module (Intra-RM) and an Inter-feature Relation Modeling module (Inter-RM), which effectively model expression-specific variations and reconstruct the expression features. An expression prediction network is used for classification.Our major contributions include:1. Proposal of the FDRL method that explicitly models expression similarities and expression-specific variations, enabling the extraction of fine-grained expression features for accurate identification of subtle differences between facial expressions.2. Elaborate design of Intra-RM and Inter-RM modules to capture intra-feature and inter-feature relationships, resulting in discriminative expression features.3. Extensive evaluation of the FDRL method on both in-the-lab and in-the-wild FER databases, demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves recognition accuracy of 89.47% on the RAF-DB database and 62.16% on the SFEW database.Overall, the FDRL method shows great potential in FER by effectively decomposing and reconstructing facial expression features, providing a more accurate and nuanced representation of facial emotions.
