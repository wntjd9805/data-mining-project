Transfer learning is a powerful technique in deep learning that involves pre-training on large source datasets and fine-tuning on target datasets or tasks. This approach has been widely employed in computer vision and natural language processing tasks to improve performance and convergence. With the exponential growth of data, the influence of transfer learning has become even more significant. However, transfer learning with large-scale pre-training data is limited by its lack of flexibility in model architecture. Different datasets and application scenarios may require different architectures, making it necessary to train customized models from scratch, which can be prohibitively expensive. This issue is particularly pronounced in object detection, where detectors must work across various devices with different resource constraints and adapt to different input sizes and architectures. Moreover, the demand for task-specific architecture adaptation is particularly strong in object detection due to the close correlation between object scales and network architectures. In this paper, we introduce a transfer learning system called GAIA, which aims to bridge the gap between large-scale upstream training and downstream customization in object detection. GAIA enables the rapid generation of specialized solutions to diverse demands, including task-specific architectures and well-prepared pre-trained weights. It also has the capability to collect relevant data for users with limited task-specific data. GAIA consists of two components: task-agnostic unification and task-specific adaptation. In task-agnostic unification, we collect data from multiple sources and create a large data pool with a unified label space. The label space is formulated based on word2vec similarity to resolve conflicts among duplicated categories and allow data from relevant categories to jointly enhance detector performance. We also adopt a weight sharing scheme to train models of different widths and depths efficiently on large upstream data, using an "anchor-based progressive shrinking" technique to mitigate interference between models during training. In the task-specific adaptation procedure, GAIA selects adapted model architectures using an efficient and reliable method based on the Kendall Tau measure. This approach ensures that the selected models fit the downstream tasks well, regardless of data domains or latency constraints. Additionally, GAIA has the ability to collect relevant data from the data pool to support fine-tuning in data-scarce scenarios. The contributions of this paper are as follows: 1. Demonstrating the combination of transfer learning and weight sharing learning to produce powerful pre-trained models across various architectures simultaneously. 2. Proposing an efficient and reliable approach to finding adapted network architectures for specified downstream tasks, achieving impressive results across 10 downstream tasks without exclusive tuning of hyper-parameters.
