Shape-from-shading (SfS) is widely used in 3D scanning to enhance geometric details by factorizing reﬂected camera signals to photometric normals. However, SfS becomes ill-posed when reﬂectance and illumination are unknown. Multiview SfS can estimate distributions of illumination and albedo by leveraging multiview input, resulting in high-quality geometry. However, real-time RGB-D scanning faces challenges such as imperfect geometric registration and compromising details for performance. To address these challenges, we propose a real-time scanning method that integrates volumetric fusion, multiview SfS, and geometry-aware texture mapping. We introduce a real-time acquisition method of photometric normals and a progressive refinement of geometric registration. Our method can acquire high-detail geometry, photometric normals, and albedo textures, with competitive quality to offline multiview SfS methods. The codes and demo will be published online for reproducibility.
