Deformable image registration is a crucial step in medical imaging applications, such as segmentation, diagnosis, and computational anatomy. Traditionally, image registration involves solving an optimization problem to obtain a transformation for each specific image pair, which is time-consuming and inefficient. Recent advancements in deep learning have allowed for an end-to-end registration process, where a trained deep model can infer spatial transformations quickly.However, accurately capturing the deformations in anatomical structures is challenging, as they are often local and non-rigid. It is important to ensure that the estimated spatial transformation is smooth and realistic, while also avoiding overfitting due to the high degrees of freedom in the transformation model. Most learning-based registration methods use a generic regularization loss, typically penalizing the first-order derivative of the displacement field. However, this approach does not consider the specific characteristics of different image contents and permissible deformations, limiting its effectiveness.Additionally, popular registration networks based on U-Nets struggle with datasets that have large deformations, hindering their performance. To address these issues, we propose a meta-regularization framework for learning-based image registration models. We leverage Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) theory and demonstrate how it can be simplified to a convolution operation, while retaining its regularization properties. We then introduce a method to train a meta-regularization convolutional layer in registration networks, enhancing the model's generalizability.The main contributions of our work are: (1) the introduction of a meta-regularization framework to improve the generalization ability of learning-based deformable image registration methods, (2) establishing connections between regularizing displacement fields through differential operators and convolving with radially symmetric, rank-1, positive semi-definite (PSD) filters, (3) proposing a training method for convolution filters in registration networks to possess spatial regularization properties, and (4) demonstrating that our approach can enhance anatomical correspondence and reduce folding and tearing in predicted displacement fields, particularly in cases involving large deformations.
