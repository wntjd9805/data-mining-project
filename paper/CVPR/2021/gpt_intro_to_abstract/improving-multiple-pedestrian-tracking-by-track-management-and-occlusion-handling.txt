Tracking multiple pedestrians is a critical task in various applications, particularly in surveillance. The objective is to detect and identify each pedestrian in a video by assigning them a unique ID. Existing approaches typically employ the tracking-by-detection paradigm, where bounding boxes are generated for each frame and then associated with tracks based on motion patterns or visual cues. However, these methods face challenges in crowded scenes where occlusions result in missing detections. To tackle this problem, many techniques use re-identification models to extract deep features from detected bounding boxes. However, this approach requires separate training of a network, increasing computational complexity and potentially leading to false re-identifications due to the inclusion of nearby pedestrians.In contrast, we propose a novel strategy that explicitly models pedestrian occlusion and relies solely on motion for re-identification. Our approach introduces the concepts of occluding and occluded tracks and uses motion-based analysis to associate newly detected targets with previously found occluded tracks, eliminating the need for a separate re-identification network. We augment this approach with active and inactive track states and a sophisticated track management system that includes track termination when pedestrians leave the scene.To utilize recognized tracks in consecutive frames, we adopt the tracking-by-regression paradigm, leveraging the regression capabilities of a two-stage object detector to predict the new positions of previously detected bounding boxes. This eliminates the need for a separate association step. We extend this regression approach to inactive tracks, giving preference to active tracks during subsequent non-maximum suppression to facilitate regression-based re-identification in occluded scenarios.Additionally, we present an offline extension that can enhance the performance of any multi-object tracker. This extension utilizes a video sequence in both temporal directions and merges intermediate results to further boost tracking accuracy.Through ablation experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed components. The proposed techniques achieve state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets: MOT16, MOT17, and MOT20.In summary, our work makes the following contributions:1. A novel strategy for re-identifying occluded pedestrians using the concepts of occluding and occluded tracks without the need for a separate re-identification network.2. Extensions to track management, including occlusion handling, regression of inactive tracks, and treatment of tracks crossing image boundaries.3. An offline extension that leverages video sequences in both temporal directions, combined with a merging mechanism, to significantly improve overall tracking performance.
