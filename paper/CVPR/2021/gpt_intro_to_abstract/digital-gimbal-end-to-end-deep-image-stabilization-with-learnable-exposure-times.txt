Advancements in imaging technology have made optical systems more portable and lightweight. However, the need for stabilization often counteracts these improvements. Camera motion, caused by natural handheld tremors or vehicle movement, can result in motion blur that is especially noticeable during long exposures or with long focal lengths. Existing image stabilization methods have mainly focused on optical and mechanical approaches. Optical stabilization relies on high-cost lenses or cheaper shift sensors, while mechanical stabilization devices like actuated gimbals can be attached to any camera but have limitations in compensating for blur due to scene motion or atmospheric turbulence, and are costly and bulky.In recent years, deep learning approaches have gained popularity in traditional image processing tasks. Burst and multi-frame imaging have emerged as areas of increasing interest, with works on denoising and deblurring. These methods exploit the information captured by different degraded realizations of the same scene to reconstruct a high-quality image. Leveraging the trade-off between strong blur at long exposures and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at short exposures, this paper proposes solving image stabilization using bursts of consecutively captured images over a short period. By combining burst denoising and deblurring, which are already established techniques, the problem of image stabilization can be addressed.Most burst methods assume that the data across the burst are complementary. However, this paper suggests explicitly introducing diversity in noise and blur levels by intervening in the acquisition pipeline. This is achieved through the design of an end-to-end learned system that incorporates a deep burst image processing network and the camera's exposure configuration. The exposure configuration is implemented using a novel network layer that models the frame acquisition process numerically, potentially allowing for further customization for other imaging tasks. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this approach has not been attempted before for reconstructing still images from SNR-limited bursts in the presence of camera motion.
