Image composition is a commonly performed operation in image editing and data augmentation. However, creating a realistic composite image often requires professional compositors to adjust the appearance of foreground objects using photo editing software. To address this issue, image harmonization techniques have been introduced to seamlessly integrate foreground objects into new images with less human involvement. This paper presents a new perspective on image harmonization by focusing on the visual style consistency between foreground and background images. The visual style of an image includes properties such as illumination, color temperature, saturation, hue, and texture. The paper proposes a Region-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (RAIN) layer that learns the style from background images and applies it to the foreground objects. The RAIN layer aligns the channel-wise mean and variance of the foreground activation with those learned from the background. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RAIN method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in terms of image harmonization performance. The contributions of this work include the introduction of background image style concept and the development of the RAIN module, which can be easily integrated into existing image harmonization networks.
