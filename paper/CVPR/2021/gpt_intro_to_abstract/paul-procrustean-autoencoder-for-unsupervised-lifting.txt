Inferring the non-rigid 3D structure from multiple unsynchronized 2D image observations is a challenging problem in computer science. Non-Rigid Structure from Motion (NRSfM) methods have been used to address this problem by incorporating additional priors, such as low rank and union of subspaces methods. Recently, there has been a shift towards using unsupervised deep learning approaches for NRSfM. These approaches, known as 2D-3D lifting networks, offer scalability and fast prediction capabilities but still rely on traditional priors and constraints.To overcome the limitations of existing methods, this paper proposes a new non-rigid shape prior inspired by deep learning techniques. The proposed prior suggests that 3D shapes aligned to a common reference frame are compressible using an undercomplete auto-encoder. This approach offers advantages over previous linear methods as the deeper auto-encoder can handle more complex non-rigid shapes. The challenge lies in the fact that the auto-encoder only observes 2D projected measurements and needs to resolve the unknown rigid transformation to align each shape instance.The solution, named Procustean Autoencoder for Unsupervised Lifting (PAUL), is an unsupervised method that addresses unknown depth, shape pose, and occlusions. Unlike previous approaches, PAUL does not require a feed-forward network, allowing for a tighter coupling with the mathematical objective. The paper also explores alternative deep shape priors, such as decoder only and decoder + low-rank, and compares their performance.The contributions of this work include: - The introduction of an optimization objective for jointly learning the 2D-3D lifting network and the Procrustean auto-encoder solely from 2D projected measurements.- The proposal of a bilevel optimization approach to overcome poor local minima in the optimization process.- The achievement of state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks and robustness to hyper-parameter choices.Overall, this paper presents a novel approach to non-rigid 3D structure inference by leveraging the power of deep learning and a compressibility prior. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in reconstructing 3D shapes aligned to a canonical frame.
