With the rise of social media platforms and easily accessible image editing software, adversaries have the ability to share manipulated images online with malicious intent. Detecting these spliced images has become an important research area. Existing approaches rely on dense pixel-level annotations, which are expensive to obtain and limit scalability. In this paper, we propose a new approach called Spliced Image Retrieval (SIR), which formulates splicing detection as an image retrieval task. The goal is to retrieve authentic images from a large-scale database that correspond to a spliced query image. Unlike traditional image retrieval tasks, SIR faces unique challenges, such as identifying region-specific modifications in the query image and dealing with diverse backgrounds. To address these challenges, we leverage recent advances in object detection and propose Object Embeddings for Spliced Image Retrieval (OE-SIR), which generates object-level representations for both spliced and authentic images. We also explore different pre-trained object detectors and compare their embeddings with image classification models for spliced image retrieval. Our analysis shows that a two-step process combining object detection and classification models achieves superior results. We introduce a student-teacher training regime to optimize computational efficiency and achieve reliable bounding boxes alongside discriminative features for classification. The contributions of this work include the introduction of the SIR task, the development of OE-SIR with object-level embeddings, a comprehensive analysis of different pre-trained models, and the demonstration of improved performance in detecting spliced regions.
