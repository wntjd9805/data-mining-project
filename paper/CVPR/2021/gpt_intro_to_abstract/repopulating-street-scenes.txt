This paper proposes learning-based tools to address the limitations of street-level imagery provided by websites like Google Street View. These limitations include the presence of objects such as cars and pedestrians, the inability to capture scenes at specific times of day, and the need for privacy protection measures. The proposed method aims to remove objects from a scene and replace them with anonymized images and vehicles, enhancing privacy and allowing for the composition of new scenarios. The capabilities of this approach can also be useful in applications such as generating novel scene configurations for training autonomous driving systems.The method consists of four main components: a removal network that removes objects and their shadows, a sun estimation network to determine the dominant lighting direction, a composition method for inserting new objects with proper scale, occlusion, and cast shadows, and an insertion network for generating realistic shadows.The paper demonstrates that the proposed method yields realistic results, surpassing standard methods like image inpainting. The approach learns from short image bursts and generalizes to any single image of a street scene.Overall, this paper presents a novel learning-based approach to address the limitations of street-level imagery, providing practical applications and improving upon existing methods.
