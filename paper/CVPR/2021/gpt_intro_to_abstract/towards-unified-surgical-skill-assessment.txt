Abstract:Surgical skill assessment is a crucial aspect of surgical training and credentialing, aimed at ensuring patient safety and reducing clinical errors. Conventional methods of assessment rely on manual observation and rating protocols, which are time-consuming and lack reproducibility. The advent of laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgeries has led to an abundance of surgery videos, providing an opportunity for automatic learning-based approaches to skill assessment. This paper proposes a unified framework for automated surgical skill assessment using surgical videos. The framework considers three important aspects of surgical skills: surgical tool usage, surgical field clearness, and surgical event pattern. Each aspect is assessed separately, and their interdependencies are captured to provide a comprehensive skill assessment. The framework is equipped with both supervised and self-supervised contrastive loss functions to address limitations in training data availability. Furthermore, a new clinical surgery dataset, including laparoscopic gastrectomies with skill and event annotations, is collected and used for validation. The proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art results on both simulated and clinical surgery datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in surgical skill assessment.
