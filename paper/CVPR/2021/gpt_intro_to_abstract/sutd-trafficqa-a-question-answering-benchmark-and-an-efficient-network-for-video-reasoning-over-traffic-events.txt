This paper introduces a novel dataset called TrafﬁcQA (Trafﬁc Question Answering) to facilitate research on causal reasoning in complex trafﬁc scenarios for intelligent transportation. The dataset includes 6 challenging reasoning tasks that require exploring the complex causal structures within trafﬁc events. These tasks involve forecasting future events, inferring past situations, explaining accident causes, and providing preventive advice. Video question answering is used as a natural and effective choice for presenting these reasoning tasks. In addition to providing the reasoning tasks, the dataset covers various trafﬁc events, diversiﬁed road-agents and surroundings, and different capturing perspectives in the wild. The paper also addresses the importance of computational efficiency in video event reasoning, especially in scenarios with constrained computational resources and energy budgets. Existing video QA methods primarily focus on reasoning accuracy without emphasizing efficiency. To achieve reliable and efficient video reasoning, the paper introduces Eclipse, an efficient glimpse network. Eclipse utilizes a dynamic inference process to adaptively determine which frames to skip and glimpse, as well as the computation granularity for each glimpse. This approach significantly reduces computation costs while maintaining reliable reasoning. The paper also introduces a joint Gumbel-Softmax mechanism to optimize the discrete operations involved in frame localization and feature granularity determination. Overall, this paper presents a comprehensive dataset for video reasoning of traffic events, along with an efficient glimpse network for reliable and efficient causal reasoning and video QA. The proposed approach is the first to perform adaptive frame localization and feature granularity determination in a dynamic reasoning process, making it a significant contribution to the field.
