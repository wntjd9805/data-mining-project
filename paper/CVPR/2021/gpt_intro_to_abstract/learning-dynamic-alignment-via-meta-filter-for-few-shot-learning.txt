This paper focuses on the problem of few-shot learning in computer vision tasks. While deep learning models have achieved impressive results in tasks such as image recognition and object detection, they often require large amounts of labeled training data and struggle to transfer knowledge to unseen categories. In contrast, humans are able to learn from very limited examples. Motivated by this, few-shot learning aims to recognize new classes with only a few support examples.The paper introduces a novel dynamic feature alignment strategy for few-shot learning. The authors propose using dynamic filters to align query features based on important regions and channels. By applying these filters, the authors show that they can achieve more effective representations for recognition. Additionally, the paper utilizes a dynamic sampling strategy to decrease redundancy in the support knowledge and capture position-based semantic context.To adaptively align query features, the paper introduces a recursive alignment approach using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE). This allows for a more adaptive alignment process, avoiding the need for fixed hyper-parameters. The aligned query features are then used in a meta-classifier to make the final prediction. The support knowledge is aggregated through unlearnable operations, which helps avoid the adaptation problem commonly found in learnable classifiers.Overall, the contributions of this work include the proposal of a dynamic meta-filter for feature alignment, the introduction of dynamic sampling and grouping strategies, and the use of Neural ODEs for better representation learning in few-shot learning tasks.
