Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are widely used for generating high-quality images. However, to generate images with specific properties, a method is needed to condition the generated image on those properties. Latent space manipulation, where the latent codes of images are varied, has emerged as a popular approach for image modification and GAN interpretation. However, existing methods still have limitations, such as limited disentanglement of manipulation and restriction to one-dimensional conditioning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method for latent space manipulation based on optimization. We train an auxiliary mapping network that induces a Surrogate Gradient Field (SGF) and use it to search for a new latent code that satisfies a target condition. We also design a metric to evaluate the disentanglement of the manipulation method and conduct quantitative experiments and a user study to demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in disentanglement.Our method supports multidimensional conditioning and can be applied to various modalities of conditioning, such as adjusting facial attributes using keypoints and captions. Overall, our method represents a unified approach for latent space manipulation with improved disentanglement.
