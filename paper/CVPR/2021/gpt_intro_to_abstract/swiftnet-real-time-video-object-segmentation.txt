Given the increasing demand for real-time processing in video object segmentation (VOS), this paper focuses on the challenge of achieving accurate and fast one-shot VOS. Previous methods have primarily focused on improving segmentation accuracy without much consideration for speed. While memory-based methods have shown exceptional accuracy by modeling object variations using historical frames, they suffer from slow segmentation due to the use of more reference frames and complex matching schemes.Recent attempts to accelerate VOS have explored strategies such as reducing the number of reference frames and using lightweight matching schemes. However, these methods still fall short of meeting the real-time requirement and are far from state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy. This paper argues that accurate solutions are less efficient due to the inherent spatiotemporal redundancy in matching-based VOS, while fast solutions sacrifice accuracy by indiscriminately reducing redundancy.To address these challenges, the paper proposes SwiftNet, a real-time one-shot VOS approach. The proposed method compresses spatiotemporal redundancy using a Pixel-Adaptive Memory (PAM) component. Temporally, PAM introduces a variation-aware trigger module to selectively activate memory updates on frames with temporal variations. Spatially, PAM eliminates full-frame operations and incorporates pixel-wise update and match modules.For pixel-wise memory update, the method evaluates inter-frame pixel similarity to identify a subset of pixels beneficial for memory and incrementally adds their feature representation into the memory while bypassing redundant pixels. For pixel-wise memory match, non-local computation is compressed to efficiently match pixel-wise memory without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, PAM is equipped with a novel light-aggregation encoder (LAE) to accelerate segmentation.The proposed SwiftNet achieves state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy and speed, serving as a strong baseline for real-time VOS. The paper identifies spatiotemporal redundancy as a key issue in real-time VOS and resolves it through the use of PAM and LAE. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving the best overall segmentation accuracy and speed performance.
