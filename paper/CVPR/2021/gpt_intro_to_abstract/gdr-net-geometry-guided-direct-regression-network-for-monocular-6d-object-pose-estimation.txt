6D pose estimation, which involves determining the 3D rotation and translation of objects with respect to the camera, is a fundamental problem in computer vision with wide applicability. Traditional methods rely on depth data, while monocular methods have lagged behind. However, with the rise of deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the accuracy and robustness of monocular 6D object pose estimation have been improving. Different strategies for predicting 6D pose from monocular data have been proposed, but methods relying on establishing 2D-3D correspondences prior to pose estimation generally outperform others. However, these methods suffer from drawbacks such as surrogate objective training, lack of differentiability, and time-consuming processes. In this paper, we propose a Geometry-guided Direct Regression Network (GDR-Net) that establishes 2D-3D correspondences while computing the final 6D pose estimate in a fully differentiable way. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate accurate, real-time, and robust monocular 6D object pose estimation.
