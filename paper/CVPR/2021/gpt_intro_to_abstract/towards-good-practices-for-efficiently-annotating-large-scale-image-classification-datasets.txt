This computer science paper introduces the importance of data in machine learning and its impact on learning-based applications. It discusses the success of the ImageNet dataset and its role in the A.I. revolution. The paper explores the challenges of efficient annotation of multi-class labels at scale and proposes improvements using self- and semi-supervised learning. It also provides best practice recommendations to minimize human annotation effort. The paper investigates integrating advances in self-supervised learning and views online labeling as a semi-supervised problem to improve annotation efficiency. It ablates key design choices and provides guidelines for annotation processes. The paper presents a realistic annotator simulation to conduct experiments at scale without involving human annotators for every experiment. The paper showcases experimental results on subsets of ImageNet, demonstrating high label accuracy with reduced annotation efforts. The contributions of this work include exploring the usage of self-supervised learning, proposing a semi-supervised learning approach, providing best practices and guidelines, offering a realistic annotator simulation, and releasing a modular codebase for efficient human-in-the-loop multi-class labeling.
