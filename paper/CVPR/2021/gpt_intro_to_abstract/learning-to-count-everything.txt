This paper addresses the challenge of designing computer vision systems capable of counting objects from a large number of visual categories. The current state-of-the-art methods can only handle a limited number of categories, such as people, cars, and cells. The main challenges are the need for thousands of labeled images for training and the lack of large-scale counting datasets with multiple categories. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose a few-shot regression approach, where the counting task is treated as a few-shot task using images and exemplars of the objects of interest. They introduce a novel architecture called FamNet, which consists of a feature extraction module and a density prediction module. They also develop a few-shot adaptation scheme using gradient descent updates based on exemplars. Additionally, they introduce a medium-scale dataset called FSC-147, which includes over 6000 images from 147 visual categories, suitable for few-shot counting. The contributions of this work are the few-shot regression approach, the FamNet architecture, the few-shot adaptation scheme, and the FSC-147 dataset.
