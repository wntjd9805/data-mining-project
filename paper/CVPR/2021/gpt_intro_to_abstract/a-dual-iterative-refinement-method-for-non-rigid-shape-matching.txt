Nonrigid shape matching is a fundamental task in computer vision and shape analysis, with applications in shape registration, comparison, recognition, and retrieval. In the context of 2D images, shapes are typically represented as 2-dimensional manifolds embedded in R3. However, the representation of shapes in R3 can introduce ambiguities, as shapes with the same metric or similar metrics can have different xyz-coordinate representations. To address these ambiguities, techniques based on spectral geometry have been successful. The Laplace-Beltrami (LB) operator, which is isometrically invariant, is commonly used in these approaches. The eigensystem of the LB operator provides intrinsic spectral information of the manifold, allowing for a multi-scale characterization of the shape. However, the use of LB eigenfunctions introduces new ambiguities, such as sign ambiguity and ordering ambiguity. To accurately and robustly use spectral features, a linear transformation is needed to align the spectral modes between two shapes. This transformation is typically computed based on given correspondences, such as landmarks. Using higher eigenmodes can provide accurate correspondence, but it can also lead to instability. To overcome this issue, a multi-scale approach starting with a coarse scale and iteratively refining the correspondence at finer scales is proposed. The approach utilizes anchor pairs selected through spatial matching and determines the linear transformation for aligning the spectral basis at the next scale. The proposed approach, called DIR, outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency, and it is flexible enough to handle different scenarios, including raw point clouds, patch matching, and partial matching. The paper presents extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The contributions of the paper include the stable and effective multi-scale approach combining spatial and spectral matching and the extension of the approach to handle patch and partial matching. The paper concludes with a discussion of related work, a detailed presentation of the proposed method, possible extensions, experimental results, and a conclusion.
