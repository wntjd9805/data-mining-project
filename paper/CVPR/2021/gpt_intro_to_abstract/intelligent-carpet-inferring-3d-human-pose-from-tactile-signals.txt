Human pose estimation is a critical task in various fields such as action recognition, gaming, healthcare, and robotics. Despite significant advancements in camera-based pose estimation, challenges still exist when occlusion occurs, and privacy concerns have led to the development of non-vision-based systems. This study presents a novel approach to pose estimation using tactile interactions between humans and the ground. Previous studies have explored the use of smart floor or carpet systems for movement detection and posture recognition, as well as the feasibility of using pressure images for pose estimation. However, these studies mainly focus on poses where a large portion of the body is in direct contact with the sensing surface. The more challenging task is to infer 3D human pose from limited pressure imprints involved in complex daily activities. In this study, an intelligent carpet with a large integrated tactile sensing array is developed. This carpet consists of over 9,000 pressure sensors covering a significant area. Combined with readout circuits, the system enables real-time recordings of high-resolution human-ground tactile interactions. A dataset of over 1,800,000 synchronized tactile and visual frames is collected from individuals performing different daily activities. Using the visual information as supervision, a deep neural network is designed and implemented to infer the corresponding 3D human pose using only the tactile information. The network achieves an average localization error of less than 10 cm compared to ground truth pose obtained from visual information. The learned representations from the pose estimation model, combined with a simple linear classifier, enable accurate action classification with 98.7% accuracy. Ablation studies are conducted to evaluate the generalization of the model to unseen individuals and actions. The approach is also scalable for multi-person 3D pose estimation. With its use of tactile sensing, this work provides opportunities for human pose estimation that remains unaffected by visual obstructions in a seamless and confidential manner.
