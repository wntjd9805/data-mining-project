The aim of this study is to address the challenge of 3D camera pose estimation in large-environment wide-baseline scenarios for multi-camera networks. Traditional methods rely on structure-from-motion (SfM) techniques, which detect and match keypoints in different camera views. However, in scenarios with significant differences in camera poses, such as varying backgrounds, lighting conditions, and texture areas, detecting and matching keypoints becomes difficult. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages the presence of people in the scene. We observe that matching the same people across camera views is easier than matching 2D keypoints, as human features like appearance and temporal motion can be used. Our method involves a two-step process: first, we use a person re-identification (re-ID) algorithm to associate bounding boxes of people across camera views; second, we extract point correspondences by associating the same body parts within the bounding boxes. Our proposed method, as illustrated in Figure 2, consists of three stages: person matching, point correspondence extraction, and geometric camera pose estimation. We utilize a pre-trained re-ID network to associate person bounding boxes, and then extract point correspondences by analyzing body part positions. Finally, we aggregate the point correspondences over time and solve for camera poses using a structure-from-motion pipeline. Our approach does not require any specialized calibration targets and is suitable for scenarios where consistent camera pose estimation is needed, such as sports training or construction sites. Moreover, our method is robust to imperfect re-ID association results, as outliers can be filtered using RANSAC. We evaluate our method on datasets with different environmental settings and human postures, and our experiments show comparable performance to SfM methods using manual annotations.In summary, our contributions include proposing the use of person re-ID algorithms for camera pose estimation, developing a two-step process for obtaining correspondences in wide-baseline scenarios, achieving accurate results across various datasets, and conducting comprehensive robustness and efficiency analyses.
