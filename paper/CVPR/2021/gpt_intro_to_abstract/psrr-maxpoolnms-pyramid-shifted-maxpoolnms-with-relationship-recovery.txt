Object detection is a crucial task in computer vision that involves localizing and classifying objects in a scene. Deep convolutional neural networks have emerged as the state-of-the-art method for object detection. Convolutional object detectors can be categorized into one-stage detectors, such as SSD and YOLO, and two-stage detectors, such as Faster RCNN and R-FCN. While significant progress has been made in accelerating convolution operations through dedicated hardware, the post-processing technique of Non-maximum Suppression (NMS) remains a performance bottleneck. The standard GreedyNMS approach, which involves sorting and nested for loops, becomes increasingly time-consuming as convolution operations run faster.To address this issue, MaxpoolNMS was introduced as a parallelizable alternative to GreedyNMS, leveraging the correlation between high-confidence bounding boxes and peak values on "confidence score maps". By performing simple max pooling on the score maps, only boxes with peak scores are kept and others are suppressed. However, applying MaxpoolNMS at the second stage of two-stage detectors leads to a significant drop in detection accuracy, limiting its wider applicability.In this paper, we propose PSRR-MaxpoolNMS, a general approach to replace GreedyNMS at all stages in all detectors. To achieve this, we introduce a Relationship Recovery module to correct score map mismatches and a Pyramid Shifted MaxpoolNMS module to increase score map sparsity. These modifications enable PSRR-MaxpoolNMS to approximate GreedyNMS with higher precision than MaxpoolNMS. Importantly, both the Relationship Recovery and Pyramid Shifted MaxpoolNMS modules are simple and parallelizable, making them suitable for customized hardware design and enabling fully parallelizable solutions for accelerating NMS.Our contributions include the development of PSRR-MaxpoolNMS as a general approach for accelerating NMS in convolutional object detectors. We also introduce the Relationship Recovery and Pyramid Shifted MaxpoolNMS modules, which address score map mismatch and sparsity issues, respectively. Furthermore, our PSRR-MaxpoolNMS outperforms MaxpoolNMS significantly while being faster than GreedyNMS with comparable accuracy. Overall, our approach provides a promising solution for accelerating NMS in computer vision systems.
