The problem of finding pixel-wise correspondences between images is essential in computer vision, with applications in 3D reconstruction, video analysis, image registration, image manipulation, and texture transfer. While existing methods excel in small appearance changes and limited displacements, they struggle with the challenges posed by more general geometric matching tasks. In this paper, we propose the Probabilistic Dense Correspondence Network (PDC-Net) for joint learning of dense flow and uncertainty estimation. Our model predicts a constrained mixture model of the flow's conditional probability density, allowing for accurate predictions and outliers with large errors. To ensure robust and generalizable uncertainty predictions, we introduce a carefully designed architecture and improved self-supervision techniques. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on various datasets and tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our uncertainty measure in addressing extreme view-point changes. The confident dense matches predicted by our model can be directly inputted into 3D reconstruction pipelines without additional post-processing.
