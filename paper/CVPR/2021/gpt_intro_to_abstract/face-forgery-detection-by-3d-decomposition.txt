Seamless face manipulation techniques, such as DeepFake and FaceSwap, have raised concerns about potential misuse and the need for effective detection solutions. This paper focuses on detecting manipulation on facial identity and expression, which is challenging to reveal through image analysis alone. Previous work has shown that specific frequency ranges in manipulated images contain artifacts, but it is difficult to determine these ranges due to variations in image capture and compression. To address this, the paper proposes a physical decomposition approach using 3D Morphable Model and computer graphics rendering to simulate the generation of a face image. The face image is decomposed into 3D geometry, common texture, identity texture, ambient light, and direct light. While advanced manipulation methods can reconstruct the 3D geometry, common texture, and ambient light effectively, the identity texture and direct light are more difficult to simulate and thus serve as decisive forgery clues. To detect these clues, a two-stream Forgery-Detection-with-Facial-Detail Net (FD2Net) is proposed, combining both the face image and facial detail. A supervised Detail-guided Attention mechanism is introduced to highlight the discriminative region. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art detection approaches. The contributions of this paper include the introduction of 3D decomposition for forgery detection, the construction of facial detail to amplify subtle artifacts, and the development of FD2Net for multi-modality detection with enhanced attention.
