This paper addresses the problem of automatically inferring industry-standard, feature-based CAD programs from input geometry. While previous work has focused on parametric primitive CSG modeling, this paper introduces the use of B-rep solids and a new geometry representation called the zone graph. The zone graph represents the spatial connectivity of solid zones within the input B-rep and allows for tractable program search. The paper proposes a search algorithm for inferring CAD modeling sequences using sketch, extrude, and Boolean operations. Additionally, a graph neural network is trained to guide the search by predicting scores for different candidate operations. Experimental results show that the zone graph method outperforms a recent CSG inference method, achieving better reconstruction accuracy and generating more plausible programs. The contributions of this paper include the zone graph representation, the search algorithm, and the use of a graph neural network for scoring candidate operations during program search.
