This paper addresses the problem of multi-path interference in structured light imaging (SLI) for 3D scanning. Multi-path interference occurs when a camera pixel sees light from multiple projector positions, resulting in inaccurate scanning and surface reconstruction. While several solutions exist for time-of-flight (ToF) sensing, there are limited approaches for structured light scanners. In this paper, the authors propose a practical and inexpensive approach that treats each pixel as an underdetermined linear system and finds the sparsest solution. The proposed algorithm combines a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework with application-specific constraints, achieving state-of-the-art results in fringe projection profilometry. The approach does not require any hardware modifications or customized patterns, making it easily integrated into existing structured light scanners. The paper provides illustrations of challenging multi-path scenarios and describes the demand for large 3D model databases for deep learning applications. Overall, this work addresses an important problem in the field of computer vision and computational imaging.
