Transforming the weather condition of images realistically, specifically between rain and rain-free conditions, is an attractive yet challenging problem. Existing methods focus on directly transforming images from one weather condition to the other without considering bidirectional control of rain intensities. This leaves a gap in the ability to continuously tune rain intensities ranging from rain-free scenes to heavy downpour using a single input rain image. The different rain intensities exhibit distinct characteristics such as rain streak density, raindrop size, and fog thickness, as well as other scene-specific features that need to be preserved. In this paper, we propose a Rain Intensity Controlling Network (RICNet) that enables continuous and bidirectional control of rain intensities while preserving the scene-specific characteristics of the input rain image. RICNet consists of three sub-networks and aims to generate rain images with different intensities that are consistent with the input rain image.
