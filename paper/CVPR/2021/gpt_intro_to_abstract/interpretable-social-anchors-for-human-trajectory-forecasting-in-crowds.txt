Forecasting human motion in public places is a crucial task for various applications such as autonomous navigation systems, infrastructure design, and evacuation analysis. Previous research has developed hand-crafted models based on domain knowledge to predict human trajectories, but these models lack accuracy and interpretability. Recurrent neural network-based models have shown promise in learning complex functions and long-term dependencies but lack interpretability. In this paper, we propose a hybrid model that combines the accuracy of neural networks with the interpretability of discrete choice models. Our model outputs a probability distribution over a discrete set of possible future intents, designed based on the pedestrian's speed and direction of movement. We use a novel hybrid and interpretable framework that combines hand-crafted functions with neural network representations. Our architecture incorporates scene-specific nuances and social interactions, leading to improved prediction accuracy. We evaluate our model on a benchmark dataset and demonstrate competitive performance compared to existing baselines while providing a rationale behind high-level decisions. The interpretability of our model makes it suitable for safety-critical applications like autonomous systems.
