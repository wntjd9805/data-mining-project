Fine-grained object recognition is a challenging task due to the subtle visual differences among different subclasses within a basic-level category. Deep neural networks have shown promising results in handling these variances using visual features. This paper focuses on two families of methods for fine-grained recognition: discriminative part learning and feature representation learning.The first family of methods involves localizing distinct parts to solve the fine-grained categorization problem. These methods utilize part detectors or segmentation parsers in different tasks. Attention-based approaches also show potential in discovering object parts during weakly-supervised training. However, part localizations using attention mechanisms may produce unreliable results under complex scenarios.The second family of approaches considers the classification problem as a representation learning task. Exploiting mutual relationships among different feature channels is meaningful for fine-grained feature representations. Bilinear pooling and trilinear attention mechanisms are examples of methods that capture second-order and third-order pooling features, respectively. However, high-order features lead to high dimensions, resulting in computation burden and overfitting risks.To address these challenges, the proposed graph-based relation discovery (GaRD) approach excavates finer relational attributes from intrinsic network features. The approach expands and compresses representative feature learning in a novel manner. It constructs contextual relationships among multiple feature channels by learning high-order representations. It also introduces a relation-discovery module that constructs structural relations through a position-aware gating operation.To further embed high-dimension features in a low-dimension manifold, the paper formulates the mix-order tensor into a graph representation. It then proposes a graph grouping module to adaptively embed the high-order relation matrices into a low-dimension manifold, considering semantic similarities.Additionally, the paper advocates for employing group-wise training mechanism for fine-grained image classification without additional regularizations. This mechanism utilizes the center of grouped images for gradient descent, alleviating overfitting and gradient anomalies caused by hard samples.Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art results on four benchmark datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in fine-grained recognition. In summary, the contributions of this paper include a novel GaRD approach, which enhances discriminative representation abilities through relation-aware feature embeddings, and effective modules for learning positional and semantic feature relationships and for group-wise learning.
