Facial expression recognition is crucial in various real-world applications like service robots and human-computer interaction. Deep learning approaches have shown promising performance in automatic facial expression recognition using large-scale datasets. However, the ambiguity problem remains a challenge, as different people may have inconsistent definitions of expression categories. To address this, we propose a solution called Distribution Mining and Uncertainty Estimation (DMUE) that leverages label distributions and pairwise relationships between samples. DMUE dynamically adjusts the learning focus between mined label distributions and original annotations, effectively handling ambiguous images. Our end-to-end solution does not add extra burden during inference and achieves state-of-the-art performance on popular benchmarks, such as RAF-DB and AffectNet.
