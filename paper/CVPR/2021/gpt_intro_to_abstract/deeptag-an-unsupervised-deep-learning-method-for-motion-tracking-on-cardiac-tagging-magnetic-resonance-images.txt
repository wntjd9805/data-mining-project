Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive method for evaluating heart morphology and function. Dynamic cine imaging, which captures a series of 2D images throughout a cardiac cycle, provides important information about heart motion. However, clinical cardiac MRI protocols still primarily use 2D sequences due to long imaging times and breath-holding requirements. To obtain a 3D motion field of the entire heart wall, multiple slices need to be acquired in different views.There are two types of dynamic imaging: conventional cine MRI and tagging imaging (t-MRI). Conventional cine MRI has been used for estimating myocardial motion but lacks reliable landmarks for clinical diagnosis. On the other hand, t-MRI, which uses spatial modulation of magnetization (SPAMM) to create distinctive tag patterns in the myocardium, is considered the gold standard for quantifying regional myocardial motion and strain.Despite its potential, t-MRI has not been widely used in clinical practice due to time-consuming post-processing. This is mainly due to image appearance changes throughout the cardiac cycle, motion artifacts, and other artifacts and noise that degrade image quality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning-based unsupervised method for estimating tag deformations on t-MRI images.Our method does not require any manual annotations during training and is capable of learning to predict more accurate cardiac deformation motion fields with increased training data. We first track the motion field between consecutive frames using a bi-directional generative diffeomorphic registration network. Then, based on these initial motion field estimations, we track the Lagrangian motion field between the reference frame and any other frame using a composition layer. This composition layer is differentiable and updates the learning parameters of the registration network with a global Lagrangian motion constraint, enabling the computation of accurate motion fields.Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) We propose an unsupervised method for t-MRI motion tracking that achieves high accuracy and fast inference speed. (2) We introduce a bi-directional diffeomorphic image registration network that preserves topology and invertibility, incorporating a Boltzmann distribution and normalized cross-correlation metric for robust performance. (3) We present a scheme for decomposing and improving the estimation of Lagrangian motion between frames by composing consecutive frame motions and applying a global motion constraint.
