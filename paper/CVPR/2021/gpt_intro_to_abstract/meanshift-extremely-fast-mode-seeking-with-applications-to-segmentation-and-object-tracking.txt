MeanShift is a widely used mode-seeking clustering algorithm in the fields of machine learning and computer vision, with applications ranging from object tracking to image segmentation. This paper introduces MeanShift++, a novel procedure that partitions the input space into a grid and assigns points to their corresponding grid cells. By approximating each point's window with the average point in its neighboring cells, MeanShift++ efficiently performs iterations in linear time to the number of data points. While the cost is exponential to the dimension of the feature space, making it suitable for low-dimensional data commonly found in computer vision applications. The contributions of this paper include proposing MeanShift++ as a simple yet effective modification of MeanShift, demonstrating its statistical consistency guarantees in approximating the true density, and showing its superior performance and speed compared to MeanShift in clustering and image segmentation tasks. Additionally, MeanShift++ is shown to outperform baselines in object tracking, adapting to gradual color distributions and scene changes that were previously computationally expensive for MeanShift-based approaches.
