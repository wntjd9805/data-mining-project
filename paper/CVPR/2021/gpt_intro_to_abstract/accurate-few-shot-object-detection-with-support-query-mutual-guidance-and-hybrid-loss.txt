Object detection is a fundamental problem in computer vision, but existing methods require large amounts of annotated training data and struggle to detect unseen classes. In contrast, humans can recognize and locate objects they have never seen before with just a few examples. Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to recognize and localize objects of target classes with only a few support images. Current FSOD methods have drawbacks like low accuracy and not fully utilizing support information. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage detector with a multi-level architecture for accurate FSOD. Our method employs a support-query mutual guidance mechanism to generate more support-relevant proposals and utilizes a multi-level proposal scoring module to filter proposals. We also design a hybrid loss that combines contrastive loss, adaptive margin loss, and focal loss to learn a better embedding space for accurate discrimination. Experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms existing methods and advances the state-of-the-art in FSOD.
