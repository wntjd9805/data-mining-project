Image super-resolution (SR) is a fundamental task in image processing that aims to recover high-resolution images from low-resolution ones. It is a critical component of various computer vision applications, including surveillance, video enhancement, and medical imaging. Over the years, numerous SR methods have been developed, with deep learning-based models currently dominating the field. With a wide range of SR models available, selecting the most effective one for a specific dataset poses a challenge. Additionally, hyperparameters are often chosen based on academic benchmarks, which may not be optimal for real-world tasks. Model selection and hyperparameter tuning become even more challenging when ground truth high-resolution images are not available, preventing the use of traditional full-reference evaluation measures. Mean-Opinion-Score (MOS) evaluations, which involve human raters rating the visual appeal of SR images, are time-consuming and expensive. In this paper, we propose Neural Side-By-Side (SBS), a novel instrument for no-reference SR evaluation. SBS utilizes a large dataset of aligned image pairs, each generated by a different SR model, and labeled by human raters. The rater evaluations only consider image quality, independent of image content. We introduce the SBS180K dataset, containing both images and labels, and train a CNN model on this dataset to predict the likelihood of each image being more visually appealing. These probabilities can then serve as a quantitative measure for comparing SR models. Experimental results demonstrate that SBS successfully generalizes to new models and image sets, making it an effective approximation of human evaluation. We compare SBS with existing no-reference measures and showcase its superiority specifically in the context of image super-resolution. Our contributions include the introduction of Neural Side-By-Side as a no-reference technique for comparing SR models, the release of the SBS180K dataset for further research, and the evaluation of various established models using SBS for improved super-resolution development.
