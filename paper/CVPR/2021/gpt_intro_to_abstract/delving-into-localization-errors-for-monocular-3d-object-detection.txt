This paper focuses on the problem of 3D object detection using only monocular images, which typically has lower accuracy compared to LiDAR or stereo-based approaches. The authors aim to identify and address the factors that restrict the performance of monocular 3D object detection.To investigate these factors, the authors conduct intensive diagnostic experiments inspired by error identifying methods commonly used in 2D detection. They build a baseline model based on CenterNet and progressively replace predicted items with their ground-truth values. The results of their experiments, evaluated in a range-wise manner, reveal several key observations.First, the authors observe that using ground-truth location significantly improves the detection performance, similar to state-of-the-art LiDAR-based methods. This suggests that localization error is a major factor restricting monocular 3D detection. They also emphasize the importance of detecting the projected center of the 3D object, along with depth estimation.Second, the authors find that detection accuracy decreases with respect to the distance, and models struggle to detect distant objects accurately due to inevitable localization errors. Based on this observation, the authors propose two schemes: removing distant samples from the training set and reducing the training loss weights of these samples.Third, the authors identify dimension estimation as another vital factor restricting monocular 3D detection. Existing methods optimize each component of the 3D bounding box independently, but the failure to consider each loss item's contribution to the final metric (3D IoU) may lead to sub-optimal optimization. In response, the authors propose an IoU oriented loss for 3D size estimation, dynamically adjusting the loss weight for each side according to its contribution rate to the 3D IoU.The key contributions of this paper include intensive diagnostic experiments on monocular 3D detection, quantification of the impact of each sub-task, investigation of localization error and its associated issues, and the proposal of three novel strategies for improving detection by addressing localization error.Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, with the proposed method achieving significant improvements in bird's view detection and 3D object detection on the KITTI dataset compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches.
