This paper introduces the concept of domains, which are different distributions of object appearances caused by external conditions or intrinsic attributes. Deep models often struggle with generalizing to unseen domains, leading to a drop in performance. To address this issue, two approaches are commonly used: domain adaptation and domain generalization. Domain adaptation aims to generalize to a known target domain, while domain generalization aims to learn a domain-agnostic model without access to any data from the unseen target domain. This paper focuses on single domain generalization, where only a single source domain is available. Previous methods for single domain generalization have utilized data augmentation techniques to extend the distribution of the source domain. However, these methods require the selection of an augmentation type and magnitude based on the target domain, which is challenging in practice. To solve the single domain generalization problem, this paper proposes the progressive domain expansion network (PDEN). PDEN consists of a domain expansion subnetwork and a domain invariant representation learning subnetwork, which mutually benefit from joint learning. The domain expansion subnetwork generates safe and effective domains by simulating various photometric and geometric transforms in unseen domains. Strategies are introduced to ensure the safety and effectiveness of these domains. The domain invariant representation learning subnetwork utilizes contrastive learning to learn a domain invariant representation that improves generalization by clustering each class effectively. The proposed PDEN framework achieves superior performance in classification and segmentation tasks compared to other single-domain generalization methods. Experimental results demonstrate up to a 15.28% improvement with the proposed method.
