This paper introduces the concept of pan-sharpening, a technique used to obtain high-resolution multispectral images by fusing low spatial resolution multispectral (LRMS) images with high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) images. The authors propose a novel model-driven deep network for pan-sharpening, called the Gradient Projection Based Pan-sharpening Neural Network (GPPNN). The GPPNN incorporates generative models for PAN and LRMS images and solves two optimization problems using the gradient projection method. The iterative steps of the GPPNN are interpretable and involve separate neural blocks for the PAN and LRMS images. The GPPNN is compared to 13 state-of-the-art and classic pan-sharpening methods using Landsat8, QuickBird, and GF2 satellite images. The experimental results show that the GPPNN outperforms other methods both quantitatively and visually. This paper contributes to the field of pan-sharpening by introducing a model-driven deep network that improves the performance of pan-sharpening techniques.
