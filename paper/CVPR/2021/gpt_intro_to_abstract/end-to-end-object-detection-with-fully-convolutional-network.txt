Object detection is a fundamental task in computer vision, where the goal is to predict bounding boxes with category labels for each image. Traditional detectors use hand-crafted designs such as anchor-based label assignment and non-maximum suppression (NMS) for post-processing. However, recent methods have proposed distance-aware and distribution-based label assignments to eliminate the need for anchor boxes. Despite their success, there is still a challenge in discarding NMS post-processing and achieving fully end-to-end training. To address this issue, several variants of NMS and the CenterNet approach have been proposed. However, these methods lack an effective end-to-end training strategy. Additionally, recurrent neural networks have been used to predict bounding boxes based on an autoregressive decoder, providing a sequential modeling approach. However, these approaches have only been evaluated on small datasets without modern detectors and suffer from inefficient inference due to their iterative nature. Recently, the DETR approach introduced a bipartite matching based training strategy and transformers with a parallel decoder to enable end-to-end object detection. While DETR achieves competitive performance, it has longer training duration and relatively lower performance on small objects. In this paper, we explore whether a fully convolutional network can achieve competitive end-to-end object detection by considering two dimensions: label assignment and network architecture. We compare different label assignment methods and find that the one-to-one assignment is crucial for eliminating duplicate removal post-processing. However, the fixed assignment can lead to ambiguity and reduced discriminability. To solve this, we propose a prediction-aware one-to-one (POTO) label assignment that dynamically assigns foreground samples based on classification and regression quality. Furthermore, we design a 3D Max Filtering (3DMF) module that can be embedded into the FPN head of a modern FPN-based detector to improve the discriminability of convolution in local regions. We also modify a one-to-many assignment as an auxiliary loss to provide additional supervision for feature representation learning. With these proposed techniques, our end-to-end detection framework achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art detectors. On the COCO dataset, our detector based on the FCOS framework and ResNeXt-101 backbone outperforms the baseline with NMS by 1.1% mAP. Additionally, our detector shows improved robustness and flexibility for crowded detection on the CrowdHuman dataset, achieving 3.0% AP50 and 6.0% mMR absolute gains over the FCOS baseline with NMS.
