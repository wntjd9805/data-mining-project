Constructing generative models to generate realistic images is a fundamental problem in computer vision and machine learning. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown promising results in image reproduction. However, a persistent issue with GANs is their tendency to replicate various forms of image degradation in generated images, even when the training images are degraded. This poses a challenge when training GANs with real-world images that may already be degraded. Some previous approaches involve restoring images using a pre-defined image restoration model before training GANs. However, these methods often result in over- or under-restored images due to the gap between pre-defined and real priors. Additionally, many existing methods require additional supervision for training, such as paired supervision or set-level supervision. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a model called Blur, Noise, and Compression Robust GAN (BNCR-GAN) that learns to generate clean images directly from blurred, noisy, and compressed images without prior knowledge of degradation parameters. This is achieved by introducing blur robust GAN (BR-GAN) and compression robust GAN (CR-GAN), which train blur-kernel and quality-factor generators, respectively, along with clean image generators. Unlike previous methods, BNCR-GAN incorporates masking architectures to adapt degradation strengths, allowing only the necessary changes through blur or compression while suppressing unnecessary changes. Furthermore, BNCR-GAN addresses the challenge of handling uncertainty caused by the combination of blur, noise, and compression. To achieve this, the proposed model incorporates adaptive consistency losses, which impose consistency between irreversible degradation processes according to their strengths, preventing the generation of unexpected artifacts. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is evaluated through large-scale comparative studies on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ datasets. The paper also demonstrates the applicability of BNCR-GAN in image restoration tasks, showing its competitiveness with two supervised models.
