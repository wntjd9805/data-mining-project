This paper introduces VRCNet, a Variational Relational Point Completion network that aims to predict complete 3D shapes from partially observed point clouds. Existing methods, such as PCN, provide shape completion results but lack the ability to recover fine geometric details and capture relational structure properties. VRCNet consists of two sub-networks: Probabilistic Modeling (PMNet) and Relational Enhancement Network (RENet). PMNet uses a dual-path architecture to embed global features and latent distributions and predicts overall skeletons as coarse completions. Inspired by smooth complete shape priors, PMNet improves the generated coarse completions. RENet enhances structural relations using the Point Self-Attention Kernel (PSA), which adaptively predicts weights based on learned relations among neighboring points. Additionally, the Point Selective Kernel Module (PSK) exploits and fuses multi-scale point features for further improvement. The paper also introduces a large-scale Multi-View Partial point cloud (MVP) dataset, consisting of over 100,000 partial and complete point clouds, for training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that VRCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets. The key contributions of this paper include the proposal of VRCNet, the design of relational modules for point cloud analysis, and the creation of the MVP dataset.
