The paper introduces the importance of 2D-2D correspondences in computer vision algorithms and the challenges of identifying inlier line correspondences. Existing methods for identifying inliers are limited to either structured or unstructured scenes. The paper proposes a new approach that leverages spatial regularity on a sphere to encode both angular and positional variations of image lines. By mapping line correspondences into vectors tangent to the sphere, the proposed approach achieves a spatial regularity called local trend consistency, regardless of the scene type. A neural network and a novel loss function are designed to learn and enforce the spatial regularity. Additionally, the paper establishes a large real-world dataset for image line matching. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and generalization.
