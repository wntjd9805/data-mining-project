This paper introduces a novel neural network, PMP-Net, for the task of point cloud completion. Point clouds obtained from 3D scanning devices are often sparse and incomplete due to view angle limitations and occlusions. Existing methods treat point cloud completion as a point cloud generation problem, but struggle to capture the detailed structure and topology of the point clouds. PMP-Net takes a different approach by learning to move points from a source point cloud to a target one, establishing point-level correspondences and preserving topology. To ensure a unique arrangement of point moving paths, the network is regularized using the constraint of Earth Mover's Distance. Additionally, a multi-step path searching strategy is proposed to refine the point moving paths, considering the previous paths and applying a Recurrent Path Aggregation module. The main contributions of this work are: the introduction of PMP-Net, which improves completion quality and captures detailed structure relationships; the regularization technique based on Earth Mover's Distance to create a unique point moving path arrangement; and the multi-step path searching strategy with the Recurrent Path Aggregation module.
