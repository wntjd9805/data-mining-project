Machine learning methods have become increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where carefully perturbed data is used to induce misclassifications in trained models. This phenomenon has been extensively demonstrated for various types of data, including images, graphs, point clouds, and meshes. While universal perturbations, which are small and agnostic to specific images, have been identified for image data, the existence of a common space for geometric data poses a challenge. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for universal adversarial attacks on geometric data, specifically meshes and point clouds. We achieve this by defining a common domain as the space of (truncated) Laplacian spectra, which is compact, invariant to isometric deformations, and easily computable for any given geometric object. By computing a universal perturbation in this space, we can synthesize individual adversarial examples by mapping the perturbation to 3D coordinates. This approach allows us to transfer the perturbation across different graphs while ensuring misclassification in all cases.
