Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have led to significant advancements in object detection methods. However, these methods often require large amounts of fully-supervised data, which can be challenging and time-consuming to collect. In response, semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) has gained attention by leveraging unlabeled data to improve the performance of fully-supervised models. Many SSOD methods use pseudo labels obtained from a pre-trained model on labeled images, but they often suffer from the label noise overfitting problem.Label noise overfitting occurs when deep learning models fit to incorrect pseudo annotations, which can degrade performance. This problem affects both image-level and region-level training. At the image level, difficult images with a lot of noise dominate training, making it difficult to incorporate unlabeled data with different difficulty levels. At the region level, regions with heavy overlap but lacking pseudo annotations introduce noisy information and contribute to incorrect gradient messages.To address these issues, this paper proposes a data-uncertainty guided multi-phase learning approach for SSOD. At the image level, uncertainty is used to guide image selection during different training phases, focusing on easier images with low uncertainty first and gradually incorporating more challenging images with high uncertainty. Multiple models are trained, each specializing in different difficulty levels, and their predictions are aggregated during inference. At the region level, uncertainty-based region of interest (RoI) re-weighting is used to reduce weights for uncertain regions and encourage the model to focus on more certain regions.The main contributions of this paper include the proposed uncertainty guided multi-phase SSOD learning method, image-uncertainty based selection to handle attention imbalance on different difficulty levels, region-uncertainty based RoI re-weighting to guide multi-phase learning, and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets.Overall, this paper presents a novel approach to semi-supervised object detection that effectively addresses the label noise overfitting problem and achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.
