Caricatures are widely used in entertainment, social events, and artistic creations for their ability to depict individuals by exaggerating their facial features. While 2D caricatures have gained popularity, there is still a demand for 3D face caricatures in scenarios such as cartoon character creation, game avatar customization, and custom-made 3D printing. However, creating high-quality 3D caricatures is a labor-intensive task. Previous works have focused on 2D caricature generation, but research on reconstructing 3D caricatures from 2D images is limited. This paper introduces 3DCaricShop, a large-scale dataset of 2,000 high-quality and diverse 3D caricature models crafted by professional artists. The dataset addresses challenges such as inconsistent topology and misalignment with images. The paper proposes a method that combines the strengths of implicit function-based and parametric mesh-based reconstruction to generate high-quality 3D caricatures in a pre-defined mesh topology. Extensive benchmarking and ablation analysis demonstrate that the proposed approach, trained on 3DCaricShop, achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-view 3D caricature reconstruction from caricature images.
