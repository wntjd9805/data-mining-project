Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a critical task in various applications such as autonomous driving, video surveillance, and visual recognition. However, it remains a challenging task due to the complex interactions between pedestrians. Existing methods that model pedestrian interactions using dense and undirected interaction models introduce superfluous interactions and fail to effectively handle interactions in certain scenarios. Moreover, previous works focus primarily on collision avoidance, resulting in detour trajectories that deviate from the ground truth.To address these issues, we propose a novel approach that combines Sparse Directed Interaction and Motion Tendency for pedestrian trajectory prediction. The Sparse Directed Interaction model effectively identifies the set of pedestrians that influence the trajectory of a particular individual, while the Motion Tendencies capture the directional trends of the trajectories. Our approach, called Sparse Graph Convolution Network (SGCN), learns the Sparse Directed Interaction and Motion Tendency using a combination of spatial and temporal graphs. We employ self-attention mechanism to learn interaction scores, which are then used to obtain high-level interaction features. By pruning superfluous interactions and employing a normalization step, we obtain asymmetric normalized sparse directed adjacency matrices that represent the sparse directed graph.The trajectory representation is learned using a cascade of Graph Convolution Networks, and the Time Convolution Network estimates parameters of the bi-Gaussian distribution for generating predicted trajectories. Experimental results on ETH and UCY datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.In summary, our contributions include proposing the Sparse Directed Interaction and Motion Tendency models, designing an adaptive method for modeling these interactions, and introducing a sparse graph convolution network for learning trajectory representations. Our approach offers advantages in explicit sparsity and achieves superior performance in pedestrian trajectory prediction.
