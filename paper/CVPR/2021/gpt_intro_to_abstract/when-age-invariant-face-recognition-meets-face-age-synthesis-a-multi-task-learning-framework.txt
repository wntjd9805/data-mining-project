Face recognition is a widely studied topic in computer vision, with deep-learning-based methods achieving impressive performance. However, age variation remains a challenge for face recognition systems, particularly in practical applications like finding lost children. Age-invariant face recognition (AIFR) aims to overcome this challenge but faces difficulties due to large age gaps, complex face age synthesis processes, and limited availability of large paired face datasets. Existing methods for AIFR can be categorized as generative or discriminative models, each with their own limitations. Generative models transform faces of different ages into the same age group, but often produce unpleasing synthesized faces and unexpected changes in identity. Discriminative models focus on extracting age-invariant features but lack visual results for identity verification. In this paper, we propose a unified, multi-task learning framework called MTLFace that aims to achieve AIFR and face age synthesis simultaneously. MTLFace decomposes mixed high-level features into identity- and age-related components using an attention mechanism, and uses a multi-task learning framework to decorrelate these components and encourage age-invariant identity-related features. We also introduce an identity conditional module to achieve identity-level transformation patterns for face age synthesis. Experimental results show superior performance of MTLFace in AIFR and face age synthesis compared to existing methods, as well as competitive performance in general face recognition. We summarize our contributions as the proposal of a unified, multi-task learning framework for AIFR and face age synthesis, the introduction of an attention-based feature decomposition, the use of an identity conditional module for identity-level face transformation, and the release of a large cross-age dataset.
