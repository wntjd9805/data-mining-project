3D object detection in point clouds is crucial for various real-world applications, including autonomous driving and augmented reality. However, processing 3D point clouds is challenging due to their irregular nature, which cannot be directly processed by powerful deep learning models like convolutional neural networks. Existing approaches for 3D object detection can be categorized into voxel-based approaches, point-based approaches, and hybrid approaches. Voxel-based approaches transform point clouds into regular voxels and use 3D convolutions to learn features, but they face a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Point-based approaches directly consume raw points and avoid information loss caused by voxelization, but they are limited by their permutation-invariant learning operations. Hybrid approaches attempt to combine voxel-based and point-based representations but may be limited by the fundamental differences between the two types of representations. To address these limitations, we propose Pointformer, a backbone for 3D object detection in point clouds that leverages the Transformer models. Transformer models have been successful in natural language processing for their ability to capture context-dependent representations and long-range dependencies. However, applying Transformer models directly to 3D point clouds is computationally expensive. Pointformer overcomes this challenge by employing a U-Net structure with multi-scale Pointformer blocks. These blocks consist of Transformer-based modules, including a Local Transformer for modeling local interactions, a coordinate refinement module for adjusting centroids, a Local-Global Transformer for integrating local and global features, and a Global Transformer for capturing scene-level context-aware representations. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of Pointformer as a backbone for 3D object detection, showing significant performance improvements on various datasets. In conclusion, our contributions include proposing Pointformer as a highly effective feature learning backbone for 3D point clouds, demonstrating its applicability as a drop-in replacement for state-of-the-art 3D object detectors, and conducting extensive experiments to validate its performance gains.
