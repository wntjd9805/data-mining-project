Human image completion, which aims to repair corrupted human body parts in images, has numerous applications including restoring old photographs and films, re-composing human images, and editing fashion clothing. Most existing image inpainting methods utilize repeated textures in visible regions to restore a realistic image from the damaged part. However, when dealing with corrupted regions that contain both human body and background, it becomes ambiguous to place repeated textures into the correct position due to the different styles of textures. Previous works have used additional human masks as guidance to address this issue, but it is impractical to borrow repeated textures from other parts of the human body as each body part is unique. Additionally, the non-rigid nature of the human body with diverse poses introduces further ambiguity in determining the appropriate shape for the damaged region, resulting in unrealistic and implausible results. To address these challenges, we propose leveraging the highly structured nature of the human body to guide the generation of reasonable results with plausible human shapes. We employ human parsing as a structure prior, balancing its representative ability and the accuracy of its estimator in a corrupted image. By incorporating this structure prior, we first learn a structure and texture memory bank encoding common body structures and texture patterns. A memory prior encoding network is then used to learn more representative features for both the structure and texture. We estimate the human parsing map of the corrupted image and recover a complete human parsing map using the structure memory bank. To further eliminate shape ambiguities and produce an image with a plausible topological structure, we use multi-scale structure discriminators at different levels. Conditioned on the recovered complete structure map, we propose a texture completion module to restore the human body textures in the corrupted regions. To address the uniqueness of texture in each body part, a structure-texture correlation prior is introduced to retrieve reasonable texture patterns from the texture memory bank. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in recovering unique human body parts with plausible structures and textures. Our contributions include focusing on recovering unique body parts with plausible structures, using multi-scale structure discriminators to ensure topological consistency, and introducing structure and texture memory banks as additional priors for compensation in corrupted regions.
