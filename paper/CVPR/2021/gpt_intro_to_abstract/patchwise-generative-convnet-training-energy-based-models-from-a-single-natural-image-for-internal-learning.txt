This paper introduces the concept of deep internal learning (DIL) and proposes an energy-based generative ConvNet framework for learning internal statistics from a single natural image. The framework represents the internal statistics of overlapping patches within an image using an energy function parameterized by a deep convolutional neural network. The generation process is driven by the estimated energy function. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by training a pyramid of energy-based models (EBMs) with different resolutions in a coarse-to-fine manner. Training is done using the "analysis by synthesis" scheme, where samples generated by the EBMs are used to compute the likelihood gradient and update the model parameters. The trained pyramid of EBMs can be applied to various vision tasks such as image generation, super-resolution, image editing, style transfer, and harmonization. The proposed framework offers architectural efficiency, training efficiency, and representation efficiency. The main contributions of this work are: (i) the study of energy-based deep internal learning from a single image, (ii) the proposal of a sequential training and sampling approach using a pyramid of EBMs, (iii) the enhancement of training through parallel self-supervised tasks, and (iv) strong experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed framework in various image generation and manipulation tasks.
