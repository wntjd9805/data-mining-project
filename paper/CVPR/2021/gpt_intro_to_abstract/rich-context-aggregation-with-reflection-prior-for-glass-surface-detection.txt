Glass surfaces are commonly found in daily life and can pose a problem for computer vision tasks if not detected properly. Existing methods for transparent object detection do not effectively address the specific properties of glass surfaces. In this paper, we propose a new model that considers glass reflections and boundaries as visual cues for glass surface detection. We introduce a Rich Context Aggregation Module (RCAM) for multi-scale boundary feature extraction and a Reflection-based Refinement Module (RRM) for detecting glass reflections. Our model outperforms existing methods in accurately detecting glass surfaces. We also address the limitation of existing glass datasets by creating a diverse dataset with 4,012 glass images from various scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art methods. Our contributions include the novel model, the challenging glass surface dataset, and the improved performance in glass surface detection.
