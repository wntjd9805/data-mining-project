Haze significantly affects visual quality by degrading object appearance and contrast. This has implications for high-level computer vision tasks such as object detection and scene understanding. Therefore, image dehazing has garnered attention in the field of image restoration to improve computer vision systems. In recent years, CNN-based methods have been developed to address the dehazing problem through hazy-to-clear image translation. However, there are several challenges in existing methods, including the limited effectiveness of positive-orient dehazing objective functions. These methods typically rely on clear images as positive samples for training the dehazing network using image reconstruction loss, which may lead to color distortion in restored images. To overcome these issues, we propose the AECR-Net, a novel image dehazing framework that incorporates contrastive regularization and a highly compact autoencoder-like based dehazing network. AECR-Net achieves a superior parameter-performance trade-off compared to existing approaches. Additionally, the proposed contrastive regularization technique can enhance the performance of various dehazing networks. The AECR-Net also utilizes adaptive mixup and dynamic feature enhancement modules to preserve information flow and improve the network's transformation capability. Overall, our contributions include the development of AECR-Net, demonstrating its effectiveness, and the introduction of contrastive regularization as a universal technique for enhancing dehazing networks.
