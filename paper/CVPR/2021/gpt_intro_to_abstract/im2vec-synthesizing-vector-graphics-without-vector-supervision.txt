In this paper, we introduce Im2Vec, a method for generating vector graphics without the need for vector supervision. Generating vector graphics is challenging due to the irregular structure of these images, which makes it difficult to use conventional convolution-based generative neural architectures. Existing generative algorithms for vector graphics require supervision from ground truth vector graphics sequences, which are difficult to collect in large volumes. Additionally, the mapping from drawing instructions to actual images is highly non-linear and non-injective, further complicating the generation process. To overcome these challenges, Im2Vec proposes a method that explicitly models the relationship between representation and appearance, operates on an internal representation that directly maps to a vector graphics representation, and extracts correspondences between shapes from unlabelled images. The fundamental primitive used in Im2Vec is a variable-complexity closed BÃ©zier path, which can be composed to create shapes of arbitrary complexity and topology. By treating each shape as a deformation of a unit circle and using differentiable rasterization and compositing techniques, Im2Vec is able to generate vector art solely based on appearance, eliminating the need for vector supervision.We evaluate the performance of Im2Vec on various examples, including fonts, emojis, and icons, and compare it to existing generative algorithms for vector graphics. We demonstrate that Im2Vec consistently outperforms these algorithms in terms of reconstruction quality, even when trained on the same dataset without any vector supervision. We also compare Im2Vec to a purely raster-based autoencoder and show that while both methods produce comparable reconstruction quality, Im2Vec outputs vector graphics, which provides the benefits of editability and compactness. Furthermore, we quantify the trade-off between compactness and approximation power of Im2Vec and demonstrate its ability to vectorize the MNIST dataset, which lacks a ground truth vector representation. Overall, Im2Vec provides an effective and flexible generative approach for creating vector graphics without the need for vector supervision.
