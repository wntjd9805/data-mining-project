Abstract
Distortion rectiﬁcation is often required for ﬁsheye im-ages. The generation-based method is one mainstream solution due to its label-free property, but its naive skip-connection and overburdened decoder will cause blur and incomplete correction. First, the skip-connection directly transfers the image features, which may introduce distor-tion and cause incomplete correction. Second, the decoder is overburdened during simultaneously reconstructing the content and structure of the image, resulting in vague per-formance. To solve these two problems, in this paper, we focus on the interpretable correction mechanism of the dis-tortion rectiﬁcation network and propose a feature-level correction scheme. We embed a correction layer in skip-connection and leverage the appearance ﬂows in differen-t layers to pre-correct the image features. Consequently, the decoder can easily reconstruct a plausible result with the remaining distortion-less information. In addition, we propose a parallel complementary structure.
It effective-ly reduces the burden of the decoder by separating content reconstruction and structure correction. Subjective and ob-jective experiment results on different datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. 1.

Introduction
Currently, ﬁsheye cameras are widely used in video surveillance [1], autonomous driving [2] and mobile appli-cations [3]. However, the images captured by ﬁsheye cam-eras are not suitable for most computer vision techniques designed for perspective images, such as target tracking
[4][5], motion estimation [6][7], scene segmentation [8][9].
In order to resolve the contradiction, distortion rectiﬁcation has drawn great attention for decades.

However, tures is unstable, which greatly inﬂuences the model ac-curacy. To solve this problem, many existing approach-es [14][15][16][17][18][19] leverage the potential of deep learning which can roughly be divided into two categories: regression-based method and generation-based method.
The regression-based methods [14][15][16][17] utilize con-volutional neural network (CNN) to predict complex non-linear model parameters. However, they have to trade-off the number of parameters in the nonlinear model. In con-trast, the generation-based methods [18][19][20] directly generate corrected images with the help of encoder-decoder structure. Nevertheless, the effects inferred by this struc-ture have never been explored. As we can see from Fig. 1a, the skip-connection in structure communicates redun-dant information, such as distorted features extracted by the encoder, thus confounding the decoder.
