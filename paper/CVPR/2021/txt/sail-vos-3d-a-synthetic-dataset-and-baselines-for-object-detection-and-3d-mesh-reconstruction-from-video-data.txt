Abstract
Extracting detailed 3D information of objects from video data is an important goal for holistic scene understand-ing. While recent methods have shown impressive results when reconstructing meshes of objects from a single im-age, results often remain ambiguous as part of the object is unobserved. Moreover, existing image-based datasets for mesh reconstruction don’t permit to study models which in-tegrate temporal information. To alleviate both concerns we present SAIL-VOS 3D: a synthetic video dataset with frame-by-frame mesh annotations which extends SAIL-VOS. We also develop ﬁrst baselines for reconstruction of 3D meshes from video data via temporal models. We demonstrate efﬁ-cacy of the proposed baseline on SAIL-VOS 3D and Pix3D, showing that temporal information improves reconstruction quality.

Introduction
Understanding the 3D shape of an observed object over time is an important goal in computer vision. Very early work towards this goal [42, 43, 44] focused on recovering lines and primitives like triangles, squares and circles in im-ages. Due to many seminal contributions, the ﬁeld has sig-niﬁcantly advanced since those early days. Given a single image, exciting recent work [21, 31, 37, 76] detects objects and infers their detailed 3D shape. Notably, the shapes are signiﬁcantly more complex than the early primitives.
To uncover the 3D shape, recently, single view 3D shape reconstruction [10, 16, 41, 48, 55, 56, 77, 81] has garnered much attention. The developed data-driven and learning-based approaches achieve realistic reconstructions by infer-ring the 3D geometry and structure of objects. All those methods have in common the use of a single input im-age. However, moving objects and temporal information are not considered. Intuitively, as illustrated in Fig. 1, we ex-pect temporal information to aid 3D shape reconstruction.
How can methods beneﬁt from complementary information available in multiple views?
Classical multi-view 3D reconstruction [6, 18, 65] ex-ploits the geometric properties exposed in multiple views.
For instance, structure from motion algorithms, e.g., [65], infer the 3D shape using multi-view geometry [24]. How-ever note that the assumption of a static scene in these clas-sical methods is often violated in practice. Moreover, clas-11418
