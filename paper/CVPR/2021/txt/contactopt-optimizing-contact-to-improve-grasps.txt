Abstract
Physical contact between hands and objects plays a crit-ical role in human grasps. We show that optimizing the pose of a hand to achieve expected contact with an ob-ject can improve hand poses inferred via image-based meth-ods. Given a hand mesh and an object mesh, a deep model trained on ground truth contact data infers desirable con-tact across the surfaces of the meshes. Then, ContactOpt efﬁciently optimizes the pose of the hand to achieve desir-able contact using a differentiable contact model. Notably, our contact model encourages mesh interpenetration to ap-proximate deformable soft tissue in the hand. In our evalua-tions, our methods result in grasps that better match ground truth contact, have lower kinematic error, and are signiﬁ-cantly preferred by human participants. Code and models are available online1. 1.

Introduction
The availability of data, hand and body models, and learning algorithms has fueled a growing interest in cap-turing, understanding, and simulating hand-object interac-tions [5, 15, 17, 49, 51, 60]. Recent algorithms can pre-dict hand and object pose increasingly accurately from an image. However, inferred poses continue to exhibit sufﬁ-cient error to cause unrealistic hand-object contact, making downstream tasks in simulation, virtual reality, and other applications challenging.
A key issue is that physical contact is sensitive to small changes in pose. For example, less than a millimeter change in the pose of a ﬁngertip normal to the surface of an object can make the difference between the object being held or dropped on the ﬂoor. In addition to physical implausibility, lack of contact and other small-scale phenomena can reduce the perceptual realism of rendered poses.
In this paper we present ContactOpt, an algorithm that improves the quality of hand-object contact by reﬁning hand pose. When given a hand mesh and an object mesh, Con-tactOpt infers where contact is likely to occur and then op-timizes the hand pose to achieve this contact.
As shown in Figure 1, ContactOpt consists of two main components, DeepContact and DiffContact. DeepContact is a network that takes the hand and object meshes as input and estimates regions of likely contact. DiffContact is a dif-ferentiable function that takes the hand and object meshes as input and outputs contact based on current geometry. Con-tactOpt uses gradient-based optimization to ﬁnd pose, trans-lation, and rotation parameters for the MANO hand model
[41] that improve the match between current contact from
DiffContact and target contact from DeepContact. 1https://github.com/facebookresearch/contactopt
Notably, ContactOpt takes into account soft tissue defor-11471
mation in the hand. The inner surface of a human hand un-dergoes signiﬁcant deformation when making contact with objects. For example, the ﬁnger pad can deform 2-3 mm, and the palm can deform 5 mm under normal grasping forces [36]. DiffContact permits up to 2 mm of interpene-tration between the hand and object meshes without penalty.
In addition, ContactOpt’s gradient-based optimization uses a loss function that only penalizes penetration greater than this threshold. This allows for contact to occur across wide areas of the hand, rather than only at single points.
We conducted two types of evaluations to assess Con-tactOpt’s performance. For the ﬁrst type of evaluation, we evaluated ContactOpt’s ability to reﬁne hand pose es-timates with small inaccuracies in dataset annotations. This presents methodological challenges due to limits in the pre-cision of dataset ground truth annotations. To overcome this, we used the ContactPose dataset, which has both pose estimates and measured contact data obtained via thermal imagery. We had ContactOpt reﬁne these hand pose es-timates with respect to ground truth contact. The reﬁned hand poses better matched ground truth contact and were preferred by human participants, demonstrating that Con-tactOpt can improve state-of-the-art pose estimates from ex-isting datasets.
For the second type of evaluation, we evaluated Contact-Opt’s ability to reﬁne hand pose estimates with large in-accuracies. We used ContactOpt to reﬁne hand pose esti-mates from an existing RGB hand pose estimation network
[19]) applied to the HO-3D dataset [17]. (Hasson et al.
ContactOpt’s reﬁned hand poses had lower kinematic error, were preferred by human participants, and matched more closely to previously observed hand contact patterns (Fig-ure 2). ContactOpt also outperformed ReﬁneNet [51] (an end-to-end grasp reﬁnement network) with respect to both measures. This demonstrates ContactOpt’s value as a post-processing stage for existing hand-object pose estimation algorithms for which it has not been speciﬁcally trained.
Since ContactOpt operates on hand and object meshes, it has the potential to improve the output of recent image-based estimation methods while avoiding some types of generalization issues associated with operating on images.
In summary, our contributions follow:
• We show that methods that explicitly consider hand-object contact can improve hand pose estimates at both coarse (≈cm) and ﬁne (≈mm) spatial scales, resulting in improved visual realism and lower kinematic error.
• We present DeepContact, a deep network that esti-mates where contact is likely to occur across the sur-faces of inaccurately aligned hand and object meshes.
• We present DiffContact, a differentiable contact model that estimates where contact is occurring between hand and object meshes.
