Abstract
Scene graph generation is an important visual under-standing task with a broad range of vision applications.
Despite recent tremendous progress, it remains challenging due to the intrinsic long-tailed class distribution and large intra-class variation. To address these issues, we introduce a novel conﬁdence-aware bipartite graph neural network with adaptive message propagation mechanism for unbi-ased scene graph generation. In addition, we propose an efﬁcient bi-level data resampling strategy to alleviate the imbalanced data distribution problem in training our graph network. Our approach achieves superior or competitive performance over previous methods on several challenging datasets, including Visual Genome, Open Images V4/V6, demonstrating its effectiveness and generality. 1.

Introduction
Scene graph generation, which aims to detect visual ob-jects and their relationships (or triplets: <subject, pred-icate, object>) in an image, is a fundamental visual un-derstanding task. Such a compact structural scene repre-sentation has potential applications in many vision tasks such as visual question answering [41, 37, 11], image captioning [54] and image retrieval [14]. Tremendous progress has been made recently in scene graph genera-tion [20, 50, 23, 59, 53, 22, 40, 3, 8, 60, 39, 27, 45], thanks to learned visual representations and advances in object de-tection. However, this task remains particularly challeng-ing due to large variations in visual relationships, extremely

Figure 1: The illustration of biased scene graph genera-tion and empirical study on Visual Genome. As shown in (D), the baseline (MSDN [23]) performance is dominated by the head categories due to the imbalanced data. We es-timate an upper-bound performance by ignoring negative predicate-entity connections during message propagation, as shown in (B). Its performance (shown in (D)) indicates a large room for improvement in context modeling. imbalanced object and relation distribution and lack of suf-ﬁcient annotations for many categories.
One primary challenge, which causes biased relation-ship prediction, is the intrinsic long-tail data distribution.
A scene graph model has to simultaneously cope with im-balanced annotations among the head and medium-sized categories, and few-shot learning in the tail categories.
A naively learned model will be largely dominated by those few head categories with much degraded performance for many tail categories (as shown in Fig. 1-D). Early work [1, 4] on re-balancing data distribution focus on data 111109
re-sampling or loss re-weighting. However, it is non-trivial to directly apply the image-level re-balancing strategies for such instance-level tasks. Recent efforts try to introduce the re-balancing ideas into object detection [9, 38] and scene graph generation [39], but it remains difﬁcult to achieve a satisfactory trade-off between head and tail categories.
Moreover, those non-head predicate categories typically involve complex semantic meaning and large intra-class variations (e.g. play, look) in images, which exacerbates the problems in their representation learning and classiﬁcation.
Many previous works [59, 50, 23, 40, 53, 27] attempt to ad-dress this problem by developing context modeling mecha-nisms, but often suffer from noisy information propagation due to their use of fully connected graphs. More recent ef-forts [33, 53, 40, 45] aim to improve context modeling by designing a sparse structure, which also limits the model
ﬂexibility. To illustrate the impact of noises in graph, we further conduct an empirical analysis, as shown in Fig.1, which indicates that a baseline model can achieve notable performance improvement by removing the noisy subject-object associations.
Based on these ﬁndings, we propose a novel conﬁdence-aware graph representation and its learning strategy for un-biased scene graph generation. To this end, we ﬁrst develop a bipartite graph neural network (BGNN) with the adap-tive message propagation for effective context modeling.
Speciﬁcally, our method takes the hypothesize-and-classify strategy, which ﬁrst generates a set of visual entity and pred-icate proposals from a proposal generation network. Then we compute a context-aware representation for those pro-posals by passing them through a multi-stage BGNN. Our graph network adopts directed edges to model different in-formation ﬂow between entity and relationship proposals as a bipartite graph, and an adaptive message propagation strategy based on relation conﬁdence estimation to reduce the noise in the context modeling. Finally, we use the re-ﬁned entity and predicate representations to predict their categories with linear classiﬁers.
To train our multi-stage BGNN for unbiased prediction, we also design a bi-level data resampling strategy to allevi-ate the imbalanced data distribution problem. Our method combines the image-level over-sampling and instance-level under-sampling ideas [13, 9] for the structured prediction task. Equipped with this strategy, we can achieve a better trade-off between the head and tail categories and learn our bipartite graph neural network more effectively.
We extensively validate our methods on three scene graph generation datasets, including Visual Genome, Open
Images V4, and Open Images V6. The empirical results and ablative studies show our method consistently achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on all bench-marks. The main contributions of our works are three-folds.
• We introduce a bipartite graph neural network with adaptive message propagation to alleviate the error propagation and achieve effective context modeling.
• We propose a bi-level data resampling to achieve a bet-ter trade-off between head and tail categories for scene graph generation.
• Our method achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance on various scene graph benchmarks. 2.
