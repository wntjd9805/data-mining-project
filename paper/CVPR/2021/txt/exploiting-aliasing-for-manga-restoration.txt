Abstract
As a popular entertainment art form, manga enriches the line drawings details with bitonal screentones. However, manga resources over the Internet usually show screen-tone artifacts because of inappropriate scanning/rescaling resolution.
In this paper, we propose an innovative two-stage method to restore quality bitonal manga from de-graded ones. Our key observation is that the aliasing in-duced by downsampling bitonal screentones can be utilized as informative clues to infer the original resolution and screentones. First, we predict the target resolution from the degraded manga via the Scale Estimation Network (SE-Net) with spatial voting scheme. Then, at the target reso-lution, we restore the region-wise bitonal screentones via the Manga Restoration Network (MR-Net) discriminatively, depending on the degradation degree. Speciﬁcally, the orig-inal screentones are directly restored in pattern-identiﬁable regions, and visually plausible screentones are synthesized in pattern-agnostic regions. Quantitative evaluation on synthetic data and visual assessment on real-world cases illustrate the effectiveness of our method. 1.

Introduction
Manga, also known as Japanese comics, is a popular entertainment art form. One of the key differences be-tween manga and other illustration types is the use of screentones, regular or stochastic black-and-white patterns to render intensity, textures and shadings (Figure 1(a)).
Although furnishing impressive visual impact, the existence of screentones makes it tricky to resample manga images.
For instance, when being undersampled, the bitonal regu-lar patterns may get ruined and present incoherent visual effects (Figure 1(c)). Unfortunately, it is common to see such screentone artifacts from the manga images over the
Internet (e.g. Manga109 [16]), probably due to the poor

In this background, we are motivated to restore these low-quality legacy mangas and show their original appearances.
Unlike natural images dominating with low-frequency components, manga images mainly consist of regular high-frequency patterns that are pickier at the representing res-olution. Speciﬁcally, for a quality bitonal manga image of resolution T , it is generally impossible to present the screentones in a both bitonal and perceptually consistent manner on the resolution S 6= Tk ∈ {kT |k = 1, 2, 3, ..., n}.
That means, to restore a manga image, we ﬁrst need to
ﬁgure out a target resolution that is able to present the potential target screentones, and then restore the screen-tones from the degraded ones at that scale. Apparently, this tricky requirement excludes the feasibility of existing
Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) methods [3, 5, 8] and image restoration methods [15, 30, 2, 19]. Instead, our key idea is inspired by an interesting observation that the aliasing caused by downsampling the bitonal screentones is usually distinctive on the downscaling factor and screentone type, as illustrated in Figure 2. These may serve as informative clues to infer the original screentones and their associated resolution.
To this end, we propose an innovative two-stage manga restoration method. First, we utilize the Scale Estimation
Network (SE-Net) to predict the target resolution from the degraded screentones. There are usually multiple screen-13405

This is effectively tackled through our proposed spatial voting scheme based on conﬁdence. At the predicted resolution scale, we restore the region-wise bitonal screentones via the Manga Restoration Network (MR-Net). Considering the different degradation degrees, the manga image is re-stored with two parallel branches: the original screentones are restored for pattern-identiﬁable regions, and random screentones are synthesized under intensity conformity for pattern-agnostic regions. this region-wise classiﬁcation is determined adaptively through a learned conﬁdence map. Separately, the two networks are trained over the mixture dataset of synthetic manga and real ones, in a semi-supervised manner.
Speciﬁcally,
We have evaluated our method on our synthetic testset and some real-world cases. Quantitative evaluation demon-strates that our restored manga images achieve high PSNR and SSIM on synthetic data. Meanwhile, qualitative evalua-tion of real-world cases evidences the potential for practical usage. In summary, this paper has the contributions:
• The ﬁrst manga restoration method that restores the bitonal screentones at a learned resolution.
• A manga restoration network that restores the region-wise screentones adaptively based on a learned conﬁ-dence map.
While our current method is tailored for the manga restora-tion problem, our proposed framework has the potential to be extended to natural images containing the regular textures. For example, the checkerboard artifact resulted from undersampling the regular textures should share a similar property as the screentones. 2.
