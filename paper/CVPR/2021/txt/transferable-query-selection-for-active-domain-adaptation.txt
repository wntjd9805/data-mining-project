Abstract
Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) enables trans-ferring knowledge from a related source domain to a fully unlabeled target domain. Despite the signiﬁcant advances in UDA, the performance gap remains quite large between
UDA and supervised learning with fully labeled target data.
Active domain adaptation (ADA) mitigates the gap under minimal annotation cost by selecting a small quota of target samples to annotate and incorporating them into training.
Due to the domain shift, the query selection criteria of prior active learning methods may be ineffective to select the most informative target samples for annotation. In this paper, we propose Transferable Query Selection (TQS), which selects the most informative samples under domain shift by an en-semble of three new criteria: transferable committee, trans-ferable uncertainty, and transferable domainness. We fur-ther develop a randomized selection algorithm to enhance the diversity of the selected samples. Experiments show that
TQS remarkably outperforms previous UDA and ADA meth-ods on several domain adaptation datasets. Deeper analy-ses demonstrate that TQS can select the most informative target samples under the domain shift. 1.

Introduction
Wide attention has been paid to Unsupervised Domain
Adaptation (UDA) [11, 42], which adapts a model learned in the labeled source domain to the target domain with only unlabeled data. However, UDA still falls far in accuracy be-hind its supervised learning counterpart [37, 3]. As shown in [19], the “market value” of target labeled data is much more pronounced than that of source labeled data, and even a few target labeled data can improve Domain Adaptation (DA) models signiﬁcantly. Thus, a promising DA paradigm is to informatively annotate a small quota of target data that maximally beneﬁts the DA model. This learning paradigm is known as Active Domain Adaptation (ADA) [27].
Pool-based active learning [33] adopts a query selection

The need annotation row is quite different from source images and cannot be recognized by UDA, which needs manual annotation. The outliers row shows outlier samples like black im-ages or noisy objects, which are not informative for classiﬁcation. strategy to select the most useful data for training from a large unlabeled data pool, which can be incorporated into
DA to maximize the revenue of the small labeling budget.
Previous active learning methods mainly apply three query selection strategies: committee, uncertainty, and represen-tativeness [33], which respectively query the samples with maximal disagreement by a classiﬁer committee [4, 34], of the highest uncertainty [15, 12], and more distinctive from labeled samples [13, 35]. While successful in general for single-domain active learning, these traditional criteria are not transferable. As we explained later, these criteria fail to select informative target samples under the domain shift.
The selection criterion under domain shift is the major challenge of Active Domain Adaptation (ADA). In this pa-per, we propose Transferable Query Selection (TQS) by transferable committee, transferable uncertainty, and trans-ferable domainness. The ‘transferable’ here means that the criteria are specially designed to mitigate the domain gap.
To build a transferable committee, we enforce multiple clas-siﬁers to only pass target low-density areas by training with adversarial samples. Based on the multi-classiﬁer architec-ture of the transferable committee, we compute the trans-7272

The main difference is that the existing criteria are non-transferable while our TQS is designed as a transferable criterion for ADA.

We further adopt the margin function to assess uncertainty, which is more discriminative and stable. Transferable domainness simultaneously decides whether a target sample is an out-lier and measures its distinctiveness if it is not an outlier.
The three transferable criteria are complementary to form a uniﬁed criterion that selects the most informative samples.
We also propose a randomized selection mechanism to in-crease sample diversity. In summary:

We propose Transferable Query Selection(TQS), a novel query selection criterion for active domain adap-tation, which is an integrated ensemble of transferable committee, transferable uncertainty, and transferable domainness. We demonstrate that the three criteria are complementary to enable informative query selection.
We further design a randomized selection mechanism to increase sample diversity and prevent different se-lected samples from providing redundant information.
Experimental results on several DA benchmarks show that the proposed TQS criterion selects the most infor-mative target samples and achieves higher target do-main accuracy than unsupervised domain adaptation, active learning, and active domain adaptation methods. 2.
