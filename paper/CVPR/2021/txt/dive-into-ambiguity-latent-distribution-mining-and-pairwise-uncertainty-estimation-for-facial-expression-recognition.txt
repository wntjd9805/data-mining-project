Abstract
Due to the subjective annotation and the inherent inter-class similarity of facial expressions, one of key challenges in Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is the annotation
In this paper, we proposes a solution, named ambiguity.
DMUE, to address the problem of annotation ambiguity from two perspectives: the latent Distribution Mining and the pairwise Uncertainty Estimation. For the former, an auxiliary multi-branch learning framework is introduced to better mine and describe the latent distribution in the label space. For the latter, the pairwise relationship of seman-tic feature between instances are fully exploited to estimate the ambiguity extent in the instance space. The proposed method is independent to the backbone architectures, and brings no extra burden for inference. The experiments are conducted on the popular real-world benchmarks and the synthetic noisy datasets. Either way, the proposed DMUE stably achieves leading performance. 1.

Introduction
Facial expression plays an essential role in human’s daily life. Automatic Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is crucial in real world applications, such as service robots, driver fragile detection and human computer interaction. In recent years, with the emerge of large-scale datasets, e.g.
AffectNet [28], RAF-DB [24] and EmotioNet [6], many deep learning based FER approaches [11, 38, 49] have been proposed and achieved promising performance.
However, the ambiguity problem remains an obstacle that hinders the FER performance. Usually, facial images are annotated to one of several basic expressions for train-ing the FER model. Yet the deﬁnition with respect to the expression category may be inconsistent among different people. For better understanding, we randomly pick two images from AffectNet [28] and conduct a user study. As

Figure 1: User study results by 50 volunteers on two ran-domly picked images. The red (purple) bar represents the most (secondary) possible class given by the volunteers.
The results provide insights that the annotations may be in-consistent among the users. shown in Fig. 1, for the image annotated with Anger, the most possible class decided by volunteers is Neutral. For the other image, the conﬁdence gap between the most and secondary possible classes is only 20%, which means anno-tating it to a speciﬁc class is not suitable. In other words, a label distribution that depicts the possibility belonging to each class can better describe the visual feature. There are two reasons leading to the above phenomenon: (1) It is sub-jective for people to deﬁne which type of expression a facial image is. (2) With a large amount of images in large-scale
FER datasets, it is expensive and time-consuming to pro-vide label distribution of images. As there exists a consider-able portion of ambiguous samples in large-scale datasets, the models are prevented from learning the robust visual features with respect to a certain type of expression, thus the performance has reached a bottleneck. The previous approaches tried to address this issue by introducing la-bel distribution learning [11] or suppressing uncertain sam-ples [38]. However, they still suffer from the ambiguity problem revealed in data that cannot be directly solved from the single instance perspective.
In this paper, we propose a solution to address the am-biguity problem in FER from two perspectives, i.e. the latent Distribution Mining and the pairwise Uncertainty 6248
Estimation (DMUE). For the former, several temporary auxiliary branches are introduced to discover the label dis-tributions of samples in an online manner. The iteratively updated distributions can better describe the visual features of expression images in the label space. Thus, it can provide the model informative semantic features to ﬂexibly handle ambiguous images. For the latter, we design an elaborate uncertainty estimation module based on pairwise relation-ships between samples. It jointly utilizes the original anno-tations and the statistics of relationships to reﬂect the am-biguity extent of samples. The estimated uncertain level encourages the model to dynamically adjust learning fo-cus between the mined label distribution and original an-notations. Note that our proposed framework is end-to-end training and has no extra cost for inference. All the auxiliary branches and the uncertainty estimation module will be re-moved during deployment. Overall, the main contributions can be summarized as follows:
• We propose a novel end-to-end solution to investigate the ambiguity problem in FER by exploring the latent label distribution of the given sample, without intro-ducing extra burden on inference.
• An elaborate uncertainty estimation module is de-signed based on the statistics of relationships, which provides guidance for the model to dynamically ad-just learning focus between the mined label distribu-tion and annotations from sample level.
• Our approach is evaluated on the popular real-world benchmarks and synthetic noisy datasets. Particularly, it achieves the best performance by 89.42% on RAF-DB and 63.11% on AffectNet, setting new records. 2.
