Abstract
Encouraging progress in few-shot semantic segmenta-tion has been made by leveraging features learned upon base classes with sufﬁcient training data to represent novel classes with few-shot examples. However, this feature shar-ing mechanism inevitably causes semantic aliasing between novel classes when they have similar compositions of se-mantic concepts. In this paper, we reformulate few-shot seg-mentation as a semantic reconstruction problem, and con-vert base class features into a series of basis vectors which span a class-level semantic space for novel class recon-struction. By introducing contrastive loss, we maximize the orthogonality of basis vectors while minimizing semantic aliasing between classes. Within the reconstructed repre-sentation space, we further suppress interference from other classes by projecting query features to the support vector for precise semantic activation. Our proposed approach, referred to as anti-aliasing semantic reconstruction (ASR), provides a systematic yet interpretable solution for few-shot learning problems. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets show that ASR achieves strong re-sults compared with the prior works. Code will be released at github.com/Bibkiller/ASR. 1.

Introduction
Over the past few years, we have witnessed the sub-stantial progress of object detection and semantic segmen-tation [45, 46, 28, 48, 1, 14]. This can be attributed to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with excellent rep-resentation capability and the availability of large datasets with concise mask annotations, especially. However, an-notating a large number of object masks is expensive and infeasible in some scenarios (e.g., computer-aided diagno-sis systems).

Figure 1. Comparison of conventional methods and our ASR method. While conventional methods represent novel classes (e.g., cat and dog) within the feature space speciﬁed for base classes without considering the semantic aliasing, ASR imple-ments semantic reconstruction by constructing a class-level se-mantic space where basis vectors are orthogonal and the semantic interference is reduced. cient data to novel classes with only a few examples, has emerged as a promising technique.
In few-shot segmentation, the generalization process is to utilize features learned upon base classes with sufﬁcient training data to represent novel classes. However, for the overlapped semantics among features, the intricate many-to-many correspondence between features and classes in-evitably causes semantic aliasing1 between novel classes when they have similar compositions of semantic concepts.
For example, a cat and a dog appear in the same query im-1Semantic aliasing refers to an effect that causes classes to be indistin-guishable due to the sharing of semantics among features. 9747          
age are confused because they correspond to the similar fea-tures of the base classes for bears and sheep, which results in false segmentation, Fig. 1(left).
In this paper, we reformulate the few-shot segmentation task as a semantic reconstruction problem and propose an anti-aliasing semantic reconstruction (ASR) approach. To fulﬁl semantic reconstruction, we ﬁrst span a class-level se-mantic space. During the training phase, convolutional fea-ture channels are categorized into channel groups, each of which is optimized for constructing a basis vector corre-sponding to a base class. This suppresses the semantic over-lap between feature channels. We further introduce a con-trastive loss to enhance the orthogonality of basis vectors and improve their representation capability. In the space, the semantic vectors of novel classes are represented by weighted basis vector reconstruction. Due to the potential class-level semantic similarity, the novel class will be re-constructed by its semantic-proximal base classes. In this way, novel classes inherit the orthogonality of base classes and are distinguishable, Fig. 1(middle right).
To suppress interfering semantics from the background or other classes within the same query image, we further propose the semantic ﬁltering module, which projects query feature vectors to the reconstructed support vector. As the support images have precise semantics guided by the ground-truth annotations, the projection operation divorces interfering semantics, which facilities the activation of tar-get object classes, Fig. 1(bottom right). In the metric learn-ing framework, ASR implements semantic anti-aliasing be-tween novel classes and within query images, providing a systematic solution for few-shot learning, Fig. 2. Such anti-aliasing can be analyzed from perspectives of vector orthog-onality and sparse reconstruction, making ASR an inter-pretable approach.
The contributions of this study include:
• We propose a systematic and interpretable anti-aliasing semantic reconstruction (ASR) approach for few-shot semantic segmentation, by converting the base class features into a series of basis vectors for se-mantic reconstruction.
• We propose semantic span, which reduces the seman-tic aliasing between base classes for precise novel class reconstruction. Based on semantic span, we further propose semantic ﬁltering, to eliminate interfering se-mantics within the query image.
• ASR improves the prior approaches with signiﬁcant margins when applied to commonly used datasets. It also achieves good performance under the two-way few-shot segmentation settings. 2.
