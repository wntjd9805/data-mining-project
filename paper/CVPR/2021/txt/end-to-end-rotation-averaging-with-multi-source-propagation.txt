Abstract
This paper presents an end-to-end neural network for multiple rotation averaging in SfM. Due to the manifold constraint of rotations, conventional methods usually take two separate steps involving spanning tree based initial-ization and iterative nonlinear optimization respectively.
These methods can suffer from bad initializations due to the noisy spanning tree or outliers in input relative rotations.
To handle these problems, we propose to integrate initial-ization and optimization together in an uniﬁed graph neural network via a novel differentiable multi-source propagation module. Speciﬁcally, our network utilizes the image context and geometric cues in feature correspondences to reduce the impact of outliers. Furthermore, unlike the methods that utilize the spanning tree to initialize orientations according to a single reference node in a top-down manner, our net-work initializes orientations according to multiple sources while utilizing information from all neighbors in a differen-tiable way. More importantly, our end-to-end formulation also enables iterative re-weighting of input relative orienta-tions at test time to improve the accuracy of the ﬁnal estima-tion by minimizing the impact of outliers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two real-world datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. 1.

Introduction
Multiple Rotation Averaging (MRA) [20, 47, 31, 2] aims to estimate the absolute orientations R1, R2, ...., R𝑛 ∈
𝑆𝑂 (3) for a set of 𝑛 cameras from the measurements of their relative orientations {
R𝑖 𝑗 }. It is a fundamental prob-e lem in 3D Vision and is important to many applications.
For example, MRA is commonly used in Structure-From-Motion (SfM), especially in global SfM algorithms [8, 24] to determine camera orientations. MRA is also widely used in pose graph optimization in visual SLAM [10, 30, 43] or sensor networks [45, 46].

The MRA problem is commonly formulated on a view-graph 𝐺 = {𝑉, 𝐸 }, where each vertex represents the un-known absolute orientation and an edge connecting two ver-tices if their relative orientation is known. Typically, the op-timal results {R∗
𝑖 } are computed by minimizing the discrep-R𝑖 𝑗 } and ancy between the observed relative orientations {
𝑖 𝑗 } = {R∗
𝑗 R∗−1 the estimated relative orientations from {R∗ e

𝑖 which can be written as: arg min
{R∗

Õ (𝑖, 𝑗) ∈𝐸
𝜌(𝑑 (
R𝑖 𝑗 , R∗ e
𝑖 𝑗 )), (1) where the function 𝑑 deﬁnes the distance between two rota-tion matrices and the 𝜌 is a robust cost function.
There are several challenges in MRA. Firstly, the 3 × 3 rotation matrices form a 3D nonlinear manifold in a 9D lin-ear space.
Ignoring this manifold constraint leads to in-ferior results [27]. However, enforcing the manifold con-straint in optimization is non-trivial, which often involves local linearization by Taylor expansion and iterative opti-mization [6]. Secondly, due to the non-linear optimization, many methods [6, 19, 32, 37] often rely on a Shortest Path
Tree (SPT) or a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for initial-ization, which could be imprecise due to noisy input rela-tive orientations, leading to poor initialization and inferior results. Thirdly, in many real applications, solving MRA needs to deal with incorrect relative orientations [33], i.e., outliers, typically due to feature matching ambiguities. A robust MRA method, therefore, has to handle all these prob-lems simultaneously.
A neural network approach was recently proposed in
[32]. It utilizes a two-stage neural network architecture in which the ﬁrst stage cleans outliers in the view-graph and builds a SPT to initialize the global orientations and the second stage further improves this initialization via a ﬁne-tuning network. However, the whole network is not end-to-end trainable, and the separate stages leave a gap between the initialization and ﬁnal prediction, which makes the sec-ond stage sensitive to the quality of initialization from the
SPT. If the initialization is poor due to the failure of outliers removal, the second stage normally also fails to reﬁne it and generate good estimation. 11774
This work presents the ﬁrst end-to-end trainable neural network for MRA. At the core of our method, a graph-convolution-based Multi-Source Propagator (MSP) com-putes initial absolute orientations for all nodes by apply-ing graph convolution on a view-graph iteratively. Un-like SPT-based methods that determine the orientations of child nodes from only their parent nodes, at each iteration, our method calculates the absolute rotation of a node as a weighted sum over all neighbours. This allows neigh-bouring nodes with reliable edges (inliers) to be favoured in order to minimize the impact of outliers. Moreover, our graph-convolution-based method can propagate infor-mation from multiple reference nodes, which further im-proves our robustness to outliers to initialization.
Furthermore, we design a graph-based Appearance-Geometry Fusion (AGF) network that uses information from image context and corresponding corner points to evaluate the quality of each edge in the view-graph, which is used in the MSP for better initialization. Exploiting se-mantic information, the AGF can effectively learn to weight each edge to reﬂect the error in the measured relative ori-entation. In comparison, conventional methods usually use man-crafted features and/or loop consistency constraints for the same purpose and often have limited performance.
After obtaining the initial camera orientations using
MSP, we reﬁne them with the FineNet introduced in [32].
As it is impossible to distinguish outliers and inliers per-fectly even with the well designed AGF, at test time, with our differentiable MSP module, we iteratively reﬁne the edge weights, i.e., the conﬁdence of input pairwise mea-surement, using the Adam optimizer by ﬁxing the parame-ters of MSP and FineNet and minimizing the discrepancy in
Equ. (1). This iterative edge re-weighting further improves results accuracy and the robustness against outliers.
Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
• An end-to-end neural network for multiple rotation av-eraging and optimization.
• A fully differentiable module, i.e., MSP, to initialize rotation averaging, which enables outlier reﬁnement at test time.
• An Appearance-Geometry Fusion (AGF) network that fuses image context and corresponding keypoints to detect outliers in relative rotations.
• Outperforming both traditional and learning-based state-of-the-art methods on two real-world datasets. 2.
