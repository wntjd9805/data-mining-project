Abstract
Recognition and reconstruction of residential ﬂoor plan drawings are important and challenging in design, deco-ration, and architectural remodeling ﬁelds. An automatic framework is provided that accurately recognizes the struc-ture, type, and size of the room, and outputs vectorized 3D reconstruction results. Deep segmentation and detection neural networks are utilized to extract room structural in-formation. Key points detection network and cluster anal-ysis are utilized to calculate scales of rooms. The vector-ization of room information is processed through an itera-tive optimization-based method. The system signiﬁcantly in-creases accuracy and generalization ability, compared with existing methods. It outperforms other systems in ﬂoor plan segmentation and vectorization process, especially inclined wall detection. 1.

Introduction
Architectural ﬂoor plans, scaled drawings of apartments and building spaces, are utilized to assist users to dec-orate rooms, design furniture layout and remodel indoor spaces [14, 22]. Floor plan images, created by speciﬁc professional designers and architects, are rendered from vector-graphics representation, generated by AutoCAD [1],
Sketchup [7] and HomeStyler [3]. However, after the above rasterization process, designers cannot modify the structure of the room and redesign ﬂexibly. Therefore, accurately recovering vectorized information from pixel images be-comes an urgent problem to be solved.
The above-mentioned problems have existed for decades. The generalization ability of traditional methods is weak, the whole process is difﬁcult to automate, and a large amount of manual participation is required. The recogni-tion of ﬂoor plans needs to consider various information as shown in Figure 1, such as room structure, type, sym-bols, text and scale. In recent years, with the rapid devel-opment of deep learning technology, related methods have made great progress in generalization. However, it is still a challenging problem to organically integrate various infor-Figure 1. Pixel (top) and vector (bottom) ﬂoor plan image. The pixel ﬂoor plan image (top) contains various information, such as room structural elements (magenta), text (blue), symbols (cyan), scales (yellow).

A novel ﬂoor plan recognition and reconstruction sys-tem, based on deep learning, is proposed, which combines the multi-modal information of ﬂoor plan images, such as room structure, type, symbols, text and scale. The system signiﬁcantly outperforms existing methods, as shown in Ta-ble 1. Furthermore, we propose a dataset containing 7000 annotated images of residential apartments.
Our approach to residential ﬂoor plan recognition and reconstruction includes a number of technical contributions:
• An automatic framework for residential ﬂoor plan recognition and reconstruction that accurately recog-nizes the structure, type, and size of the room, and out-puts vectorized 3D reconstruction results.
• An iterative optimization-based vectorization method for ﬂoor plan images that can accurately extract hori-zontal, vertical and inclined walls.
• A systematic method for recognizing the scale of ﬂoor plan images that can assist the 3D reconstruction of real physical size.
• The largest residential ﬂoor plan image dataset with 16717
