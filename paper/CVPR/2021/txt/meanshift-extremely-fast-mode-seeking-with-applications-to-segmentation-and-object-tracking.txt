Abstract
MeanShift is a popular mode-seeking clustering algo-rithm used in a wide range of applications in machine learn-ing. However, it is known to be prohibitively slow, with quadratic runtime per iteration. We propose MeanShift++, an extremely fast mode-seeking algorithm based on Mean-Shift that uses a grid-based approach to speed up the mean shift step, replacing the computationally expensive neigh-bors search with a density-weighted mean of adjacent grid cells. In addition, we show that this grid-based technique for density estimation comes with theoretical guarantees.
The runtime is linear in the number of points and exponen-tial in dimension, which makes MeanShift++ ideal on low-dimensional applications such as image segmentation and object tracking. We provide extensive experimental analy-sis showing that MeanShift++ can be more than 10,000x faster than MeanShift with competitive clustering results on benchmark datasets and nearly identical image segmenta-tions as MeanShift. Finally, we show promising results for object tracking. tions, where in each iteration, each point is moved to the average of the points within a neighborhood ball centered at that point. The radius of the ball is a hyperparameter, often referred to as the bandwidth or window size. All ini-tial examples that converge to the same point are clustered together and the points of convergence are estimates of the modes or local maximas of the probability density function.
It has been shown that MeanShift implicitly performs a gra-dient ascent on the kernel density estimate of the examples
[3]. MeanShift thus serves two purposes: mode-seeking and clustering.
MeanShift is often an attractive choice because it is non-parametric: unlike popular objective-based clustering al-gorithms such as k-means [5, 42] and spectral clustering
[52, 78], it does not need to make many assumptions on the data, and the number of clusters is found automatically by the algorithm rather than a hyperparameter that needs to be set. In other words, MeanShift can adapt to general prob-ability distributions. However, one of the main drawbacks of this procedure is its computational complexity: each it-eration requires O computations. This is because for each example, calculating the window around the example is linear time in the worst case. n2 p q 1.

Introduction
MeanShift [20, 22, 31] is a classical mode-seeking clus-tering algorithm that has a wide range of applications across machine learning and computer vision. Recent ap-plications within computer vision include object tracking
[54, 77, 47], unsupervised image segmentation [66, 13, 96], video segmentation [56, 24, 55], image restoration
[4, 9], edge-preserving smoothing [55, 8, 12], point clouds
[46, 79, 95], and remote sensing [51, 60, 18, 50]. More broadly in machine learning, MeanShift has been used for semi-supervised clustering [2, 72], manifold denoising
[85, 81], matrix completion [82, 21], anomaly detection
[6, 93, 69], as well as numerous problems in medical imag-ing [7, 68, 97, 49, 67, 53, 98, 100], wireless sensor networks
[94, 99, 88, 63, 84, 61], and robotics [44, 45, 36, 43, 91, 16].
Given a set of examples, MeanShift proceeds in itera-In this paper, we propose MeanShift++, a simple but ef-fective procedure which ﬁrst partitions the input space into a grid. Then, at each iteration, each point is assigned to its appropriate grid cell. We then approximate any point’s win-dow with the average point in its and its neighboring grid cells. Each iteration in this procedure runs in linear time to the number of data points, with the cost of being exponen-tial to the dimension of the feature space (since the size of the grid is exponential in dimension). Such a trade-off is ideal in settings with a large number of data points but low dimensionality, which is often the case in computer vision applications. With the growing size of modern datasets and increasing resolution of data collected by sensors and cam-eras, it is becoming ever more urgent to have fast versions of classical techniques.

• We show that MeanShift++’s grid-based approxima-tion attains near minimax optimal statistical consis-tency guarantees at approximating the true density.
• An extensive empirical analysis shows that Mean-Shift++ performs at least as well as MeanShift for clus-tering while being signiﬁcantly faster.
• Image segmentation results show that MeanShift++ delivers almost identical segmentations as MeanShift while being as much as 10,000x faster.
• Image segmentation experiments on the Berkeley Seg-mentation Dataset Benchmark (BSDS500) found that
MeanShift++ performed on par or better than baselines despite being faster than most (and faster than Mean-Shift by 1,000x).
• We present a new object tracking algorithm based on
MeanShift++ that can adapt to gradual color distribu-tions and scene changes–something most MeanShift-based approaches cannot do due to the computational cost. 2.
