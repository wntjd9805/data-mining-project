Abstract
Cardiac tagging magnetic resonance imaging (t-MRI) is the gold standard for regional myocardium deformation and cardiac strain estimation. However, this technique has not been widely used in clinical diagnosis, as a result of the dif-ﬁculty of motion tracking encountered with t-MRI images.
In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning-based fully unsupervised method for in vivo motion tracking on t-MRI images. We ﬁrst estimate the motion ﬁeld (INF) between any two consecutive t-MRI frames by a bi-directional gen-erative diffeomorphic registration neural network. Using this result, we then estimate the Lagrangian motion ﬁeld between the reference frame and any other frame through a differentiable composition layer. By utilizing temporal information to perform reasonable estimations on spatio-temporal motion ﬁelds, this novel method provides a use-ful solution for motion tracking and image registration in dynamic medical imaging. Our method has been vali-dated on a representative clinical t-MRI dataset; the exper-imental results show that our method is superior to con-ventional motion tracking methods in terms of landmark tracking accuracy and inference efﬁciency.

Introduction
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides a non-invasive way to evaluate the morphology and function of the heart from the imaging data. Speciﬁcally, dynamic cine imaging, which generates a 2D image sequence to cover a full cardiac cycle, can provide direct information of heart motion. Due to the long imaging time and breath-holding requirements, the clinical cardiac MRI imaging protocols are still 2D sequences. To recover the 3D mo-2 CH 3 CH 4 CH

There are two kinds of dynamic imaging: conventional (untagged) cine
MR imaging and tagging imaging (t-MRI) [1]. For un-tagged cine images (most recent work has focused on these images), feature tracking can be used to estimate myocar-dial motion [22, 35, 40, 57, 55, 54]. However, as shown in Fig. 1 (b), due to the relatively uniform signal in the my-ocardial wall and the lack of reliable identiﬁable landmarks, the estimated motion cannot be used as a reliable indicator for clinical diagnosis. In contrast, t-MRI provides the gold standard imaging method for regional myocardial motion quantiﬁcation and strain estimation. The t-MRI data is pro-duced by a specially designed magnetic preparation module 7261
called spatial modulation of magnetization (SPAMM) [5].
It introduces the intrinsic tissue markers which are stripe-like darker tag patterns embedded in relatively brighter my-ocardium, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). By tracking the defor-mation of tags, we can retrieve a 2D displacement ﬁeld in the imaging plane and recover magnetization, which non-invasively creates ﬁducial “tags” within the heart wall.
Although it has been widely accepted as the gold stan-dard imaging modality for regional myocardium motion quantiﬁcation, t-MRI has largely remained only a research tool and has not been widely used in clinical practice.
The principal challenge (detailed analysis in Supplementary
Material) is the associated time-consuming post-processing, which could be principally attributed to the following: (1)
Image appearance changes greatly over a cardiac cycle and tag signal fades on the later frames, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). (2) Motion artifacts can degrade images. (3) Other arti-facts and noise can reduce image quality. To tackle these problems, in this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based unsupervised method to estimate tag deformations on t-MRI images. The method has no annotation requirement during training, so with more training data are collected, our method can learn to predict more accurate cardiac de-formation motion ﬁelds with minimal increased effort. In our method, we ﬁrst track the motion ﬁeld in between two consecutive frames, using a bi-directional generative diffeo-morphic registration network. Based on these initial mo-tion ﬁeld estimations, we then track the Lagrangian motion
ﬁeld between the reference frame and any other frame by a composition layer. The composition layer is differentiable, so it can update the learning parameters of the registration network with a global Lagrangian motion constraint, thus achieving a reasonable computation of motion ﬁelds.
Our contributions could be summarized brieﬂy as fol-lows: (1) We propose a novel unsupervised method for t-MRI motion tracking, which can achieve a high accuracy of performance in a fast inference speed. (2) We propose a bi-directional diffeomorphic image registration network which could guarantee topology preservation and invertibility of the transformation, in which the likelihood of the warped image is modeled as a Boltzmann distribution, and a nor-malized cross correlation metric is incorporated in it, for its robust performance on image intensity time-variant regis-tration problems. (3) We propose a scheme to decompose the Lagrangian motion between the reference and any other frame into sums of consecutive frame motions and then im-prove the estimation of these motions by composing them back into the Lagrangian motion and posing a global motion constraint. 2.
