Low-light image enhancement plays very important roles in low-level vision areas. Recent works have built a great deal of deep learning models to address this task. Howev-er, these approaches mostly rely on signiﬁcant architecture engineering and suffer from high computational burden.
In this paper, we propose a new method, named Retinex-inspired Unrolling with Architecture Search (RUAS), to con-struct lightweight yet effective enhancement network for low-light images in real-world scenario. Speciﬁcally, build-ing upon Retinex rule, RUAS ﬁrst establishes models to characterize the intrinsic underexposed structure of low-light images and unroll their optimization processes to con-struct our holistic propagation structure. Then by design-ing a cooperative reference-free learning strategy to dis-cover low-light prior architectures from a compact search space, RUAS is able to obtain a top-performing image en-hancement network, which is with fast speed and requires few computational resources. Extensive experiments veri-fy the superiority of our RUAS framework against recent-ly proposed state-of-the-art methods. The project page is available at http://dutmedia.org/RUAS/. 1.

Introduction
High quality images are critical to a large amount of computer vision and machine learning applications, such as object detection [18], tracking [19], and segmentation [42], just name a few. Unfortunately, images captured in low-light environments usually suffer multiple degradations, in-cluding but not limited to poor visibility, low contrast and unexpected noise. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance low-light images before further processing and analysis. In-deed, Low-light Image Enhancement (LIE) techniques have

In the past decades, classical LIE methods often per-form histogram equalization [28, 4, 43] or gamma correc-tion [11, 29, 35] to enhance low-light images. There are also various classical methods consider Retinex theory [26] and introduce different prior regularized optimization mod-els to characterize the structures of the illumination and re-ﬂectance image layers [6, 9, 13, 46, 20]. However, these hand-crafted constraints/priors are not adaptive enough and their results may present intensive noises and/or suffer from over- and under- enhancement.
In recent years, great progress has been made on design-ing CNN-based models for LIE problems. Among these well-known approaches, most CNN-based solutions rely on paired data for supervised training [2, 49, 21, 37]. In ad-dition, dozens of methods also train their networks with-out paired supervision [40, 12, 8]. However, the perfor-mances of these deep learning methods heavily rely on their elaborately designed architectures and carefully select-ed paired/unpaired training data. Moreover, most of these 110561    
existing CNN-based methods tend to obtain unsatisfactory visual results in the face of various light intensities and in-tensive noises under the real-world scenario. The main rea-son is that these relevant approaches lack of physical con-straints in principle, which makes it difﬁcult to capture the inherent weak light image structure.
To partially address the above issues, we propose a principled framework to construct enhancement network-s by infusing knowledge of low-light images and searching lightweight prior architectures, named Retinex-inspired Un-rolling with Architecture Search (RUAS). More concretely, taking Retinex rule into consideration, we ﬁrst design opti-mization models to exploit the latent structures of the low-light image in the real-world noisy scenario. Then by un-rolling the corresponding optimization processes, we estab-lish the holistic propagation structure of our enhancement network. Finally, we provide a reference-free bilevel learn-ing strategy to cooperatively search prior architectures for the illumination map and desired image. Our contributions can be summarized as follows:
• In contrast to existing CNN-based LIE methods requir-ing substantial efforts to heuristically design the w-hole neural network, RUAS ﬁrst provides a principled manner to build our fundamental network structure and then automatically discover the embedded atomic prior architectures.
• We develop a cooperative bilevel search strategy for
RUAS, which is able to simultaneously discover archi-tectures from a compact search space for both illumi-nation estimation and noise removal. Furthermore, our strategy does not require any paired/unpaired supervi-sions during the whole search process.
• RUAS offers ﬂexibility in searching prior architectures for different kinds of low-light scenarios. Extensive experiments also show that our established enhance-ment networks are memory and computation efﬁcient, and can perform favorably against state-of-the-art ap-proaches (see Fig. 1). 2.
