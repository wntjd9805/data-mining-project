Abstract
We propose a novel method for estimating the global ro-tations of the cameras independently of their positions and the scene structure. When two calibrated cameras observe
ﬁve or more of the same points, their relative rotation can be recovered independently of the translation. We extend this idea to multiple views, thereby decoupling the rotation es-timation from the translation and structure estimation. Our approach provides several beneﬁts such as complete immu-nity to inaccurate translations and structure, and the accu-racy improvement when used with rotation averaging. We perform extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating consistent and signiﬁcant gains in accuracy when used with the state-of-the-art rotation aver-aging method. 1.

Introduction
Bundle adjustment is the problem of reconstructing the camera poses (i.e., rotations and translations) and the 3D scene structure from the image measurements.
It plays a crucial role in many areas of 3D vision, such as structure from motion [26], visual odometry [53], and simultaneous localization and mapping [8]. For this reason, signiﬁcant re-search endeavors have been devoted to this problem, which led to tremendous progress over the past two decades.
Bundle adjustment aims to obtain jointly optimal struc-ture and camera poses by minimizing the image reprojec-tion errors [57]. Being a nonlinear optimization problem, it requires a good initialization to ensure the convergence to the statistically optimal solution [26]. A common strat-egy involves the following steps: (1) Estimate the pairwise motions. (2) Estimate the global rotations through rotation averaging (e.g., [5, 10]). (3) Estimate the global translations (e.g., [24, 59]). (4) Triangulate the points (e.g., [32, 43]).
In such a pipeline, it is important to make an accurate ini-tial guess of the rotations, as the subsequent steps directly depend on it. To this end, one could try to improve the rota-tion averaging method or its input (i.e., the relative pairwise motion estimates). Recent examples of the former include
[5, 10, 16, 19, 51] and the latter include [6, 7, 23, 63].
These two types of approaches are certainly useful for initializing the rotations. However, relative pose estimation is limited to two views only, while rotation averaging does not directly leverage the image measurements. That is, it treats all relative rotations equally even if they were esti-mated from different numbers of points with different noise statistics and distributions. To our knowledge, no previous work has addressed this limitation for rotation estimation.
In this work, we present a novel method that, given the initial estimates of the rotations, performs rotation-only op-timization using the image measurements as direct input.
Our work is based on [34], where it was proposed to opti-mize the rotation between two views independently of the translation. We extend this idea to multiple views. We call our approach rotation-only bundle adjustment because it can be seen as the decoupling of the rotation estimation from the translation and structure estimation in bundle ad-justment. This provides the following advantages:
•
•
•
•
The rotations are estimated without requiring the knowledge of the translations and structure. This greatly simpliﬁes the optimization problem.
The rotations are immune to inaccurate estimation of the translations and structure.
Both pure and non-pure rotations are treated in a uni-ﬁed manner, as we do not need to triangulate and dis-card the low-parallax points.
It can be used after rotation averaging to improve the accuracy of the rotation estimates.
Table 1 summarizes the differences between our method and the related methods.
