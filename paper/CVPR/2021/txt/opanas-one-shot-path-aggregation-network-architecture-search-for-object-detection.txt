Abstract
Recently, neural architecture search (NAS) has been ex-ploited to design feature pyramid networks (FPNs) and achieved promising results for visual object detection. En-couraged by the success, we propose a novel One-Shot Path
Aggregation Network Architecture Search (OPANAS) al-gorithm, which signiﬁcantly improves both searching ef-ﬁciency and detection accuracy.
Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst introduce six heterogeneous information paths to build our search space, namely top-down, bottom-up, fusing-splitting, scale-equalizing, skip-connect and none. Sec-ond, we propose a novel search space of FPNs, in which each FPN candidate is represented by a densely-connected directed acyclic graph (each node is a feature pyramid and each edge is one of the six heterogeneous informa-tion paths). Third, we propose an efﬁcient one-shot search method to ﬁnd the optimal path aggregation architecture; speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst train a super-net and then ﬁnd the op-timal candidate with an evolutionary algorithm. Exper-imental results demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed
OPANAS for object detection: (1) OPANAS is more ef-ﬁcient than state-of-the-art methods (e.g., NAS-FPN and
Auto-FPN) at signiﬁcantly smaller searching cost (e.g., only 4 GPU days on MS-COCO); (2) the optimal architecture found by OPANAS signiﬁcantly improves main-stream de-tectors including RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN and Cascade R-CNN, by 2.3∼3.2 % mAP compared to their FPN counter-parts; and (3) a new state-of-the-art accuracy-speed trade-off (52.2 % mAP at 7.6 FPS) is achieved at smaller training costs than comparable recent arts. Code will be released at https://github.com/VDIGPKU/OPANAS. 1.

Intuitively, di-rectly extracting feature pyramid [22] from CNN at differ-ent stages provides an efﬁcient solution. Each level of the feature pyramid corresponds to a speciﬁc scale in the orig-inal image. However, high-level features are with more se-mantics while the low-level ones are more content descrip-tive [31]. Such a semantic gap is unable to deliver strong features for multi-scale visual recognition tasks (e.g., object detection, and segmentation). To alleviate the discrepancy, different feature fusion strategies have been proposed. Fea-ture Pyramid Network (FPN) [17] is arguably the most pop-ular basic architecture and inspires many important variants.
It adopts a backbone model, typically designed for image classiﬁcation, and builds a top-down information ﬂow by sequentially combining two adjacent layers in feature hier-archy in the backbone. By such design, low-level features are complemented by semantic information from high-level features. Despite simple and effective, FPN may not be the optimal architecture design.
Two lines of research have been conducted to advance
FPN-based detection algorithms. On one hand, various approaches (e.g., PANet [21], BiFPN [25], Libra R-CNN
[23] and SEPC [28]) enrich FPN by aggregating multi-ple heterogeneous information paths and achieve impres-10195

Our OPANAS: (a) super-net training, i.e., the optimization of super-net weights; (b) optimal sub-net search with an evolutionary algorithm; (c) the searched optimal archi-tecture. Note that two information paths (skip-connect and none) work only for (b). top-down and bottom-up [21], sive results. However, as shown in Fig. 1 (a-e), they only explore aggregations of up to three types of infor-top-mation paths, (i.e., down and fusing-splitting [23], and top-down and scale-equalizing [28]). Moreover, most of these methods follow a straightforward chain-style aggregation structure, except
BiFPN that adds additional skip-connect on PANet with several repetitions, but remains in a simple topology. On the other hand, Neural Architecture Search (NAS)-based
FPN architectures [10, 26, 29] have achieved remarkable performance gain beyond manually designed architectures, but with following limitations: (1) inefﬁciency, the search-ing processes are often computationally expensive (e.g., 300
TPU days [10]) due to the extremely large search space, and (2) weak adaptability, their searched architectures are spe-cialized for certain detector with special training skills (e.g., large batch size or longer training schedule).
Inspired by these studies and meanwhile to address aforementioned issues, we propose a new efﬁcient and ef-fective NAS framework, named OPANAS (One-Shot Path
Aggregation Neural Architecture Search, see Fig. 2) to automatically search a better FPN for object detection.
Firstly, we carefully design four parameterized information paths (top-down, bottom-up, scale-equalizing and fusing-splitting, see Fig. 3 (a-d)) and two parameter-free ones (skip-connect and none, see Fig. 3 (e-f)) to build our search space. Clearly, these six modules introduce different infor-mation ﬂows, different connections between backbone and detection head, and lead to complementary and highly inter-pretable aggregation modules. Note that the four parame-terized ones are relatively heavy and the two parameter-free ones are light-weighted, and they work together to achieve a promising accuracy-efﬁciency trade-off.
Secondly, to achieve the optimal aggregation of the six information paths, we propose a novel FPN search space, in which each FPN candidate is represented by a densely-connected directed acyclic graph (each node is a feature pyramid and each edge is a speciﬁc one of the six heteroge-neous information paths as shown in Fig. 3). Notably, our search space contains richer aggregation topological struc-tures of FPNs than existing methods as in Fig. 1, and hence enables richer cross-level and cross-module interactions.
Thirdly, we propose an efﬁcient one-shot search method to search the optimal FPN architecture, that is, we ﬁrst train a super-net and then search the optimal sub-net from the super-net with an evolutionary algorithm that has strong global optimum search capability. Experiments show that our method is efﬁcient as the differentiable NAS methods, i.e., DARTS [20] and Fair DARTS [5], while the searched
FPN architecture can achieve better detection accuracy with less parameters and FLOPs. Moreover, following the sim-ple vanilla training protocol, our searched FPN architec-ture can consistently improve the detection accuracy of the main-stream detectors including RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN and Cascade R-CNN by 2.3∼3.2 mAP, with less parame-ters and FLOPs. These results demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed OPANAS for object detection.
Our contributions can be summarized as:
• We carefully design 6 information paths that can ag-gregate multi-level information, and thus enable the effective and complementary combination of low-, medium- and high-level information. To our knowl-edge, we are the ﬁrst to investigate the aggregations of multiple (>3) information paths.
• We propose a novel one-shot method, OPANAS, to ef-ﬁciently and effectively search the optimal aggregation of the 6 kinds of information paths.
• Working as a plug and play module, our searched ar-chitecture can easily be adapted to main-stream detec-tors including RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN and Cascade 10196
