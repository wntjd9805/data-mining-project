Abstract
Consensus maximisation (MaxCon), which is widely used for robust Ô¨Åtting in computer vision, aims to Ô¨Ånd the largest subset of data that Ô¨Åts the model within some tol-erance level. In this paper, we outline the connection be-tween MaxCon problem and the abstract problem of Ô¨Ånding the maximum upper zero of a Monotone Boolean Function (MBF) deÔ¨Åned over the Boolean Cube. Then, we link the concept of inÔ¨Çuences (in a MBF) to the concept of outlier (in MaxCon) and show that inÔ¨Çuences of points belonging to the largest structure in data would generally be smaller under certain conditions. Based on this observation, we present an iterative algorithm to perform consensus max-imisation. Results for both synthetic and real visual data experiments show that the MBF based algorithm is capa-ble of generating a near optimal solution relatively quickly.
This is particularly important where there are large number of outliers (gross or pseudo) in the observed data. 1.

Introduction
The popular Maximum Consensus (MaxCon) criterion for robust Ô¨Åtting (as typiÔ¨Åed by that of RANSAC [11]), seeks the maximum sized feasible set. Here feasible means that all data points belonging to a ‚Äústructure‚Äù (the inlier set)
Ô¨Åts its model within a tolerance level.
Given a set of n data points D = {pi}n i=1 and a toler-ance level «´, the MaxCon criterion for robust Ô¨Åtting can be written as:
|I| max
Œ∏, I‚äÜD subject to rpi (Œ∏) ‚â§ «´ ‚àÄpi ‚àà I where rpi (Œ∏) is the distance of pi from the model Œ∏.
A subset I can be represented by length-n bit-vector, x, where the i‚Äôth position of the bit vector denote the inclu-sion (xi = 1) or exclusion (xi = 0) of the data point i.
The above shows that, each subset can be represented by a vertex of the n-dimensional Boolean Cube. Therefore, any statement about which of the subsets are feasible, is a statement on the evaluation of a Boolean function over the n-dimensional Boolean Cube. This Boolean function f : {0, 1}n ‚Üí {0, 1}, outputs 1 (for infeasible), or 0 (for feasible) for any vertex of the Boolean Cube. Since Max-Con is a search for the maximum sized feasible subset of the data, it is inherently a search on the Boolean Cube.
Such a view immediately opens the huge theory and very many associated mathematical tools, developed during the study of Boolean functions; for the purposes of the analy-sis of the MaxCon problem and for devising algorithms to solve this problem.
Also, there is an additional signiÔ¨Åcant observation. The
Boolean function associated with a MaxCon problem be-longs to a special class of Boolean functions called the
Monotone Boolean Functions (MBF) [15].
DeÔ¨Ånition 1.1. A MBF of n variables is a mapping f :
{0, 1}n ‚Üí {0, 1} such that Œ± ‚â∫ Œ≤ implies that f (Œ±) ‚â§ f (Œ≤). Here we apply the natural ordering relation on n-dimensional Boolean Cube: Œ≤ follows Œ± (Œ± ‚â∫ Œ≤) if for any i, the equality Œ±i 6 Œ≤i is satisÔ¨Åed.
This is easy to see: If a subset is feasible, then adding more data to that subset can only move the function to-wards infeasibility and once infeasible adding more points will not change the subset back to feasible. Likewise, delet-ing points from a subset can move only towards feasible.
MaxCon, when viewed in the above sketched framework, is nothing more than the search for the maximum upper zero (see the deÔ¨Ånition below) of the above-mentioned mono-tone infeasibility function.
DeÔ¨Ånition 1.2 (Upper zero of a MBF). Upper zero of the
MBF f (¬∑) is a vertex Œ± for which f (Œ±) = 0 and, for all
Œ± ‚â∫ Œ≤ the relation f (Œ≤) = 1 is satisÔ¨Åed.
DeÔ¨Ånition 1.3 (Maximum Upper zero of a MBF [16]).
Maximum Upper zero of the MBF f (¬∑) is a vertex Œ± for 2866

Figure 1: (a) An example of a 2D line Ô¨Åtting problem with 5 data points together with (b) the associated Boolean Cube and MBF - represented in Hasse diagram format. The 5D
Boolean Cube is drawn Ô¨Çattened onto 2D and oriented so that the higher up a vertex appears, the larger is the num-ber of 1‚Äôs in the coordinates. A Boolean Function maps the
Boolean cube to 0 or 1. We illustrate by colouring: ‚Äúwhite‚Äù nodes map to 1, coloured nodes map to 0. This example is a Monotone Boolean Function since moving up the picture, the value of the function only ever increases, it never trans-lates in the opposite direction. The red node is the maxi-mum upper zero in this example. which f (Œ±) = 0 and, for all kŒ≤k1 > kŒ±k1 the relation f (Œ≤) = 1 is satisÔ¨Åed. Here, kŒ±k1 = i Œ±i.
P
A simple example in Figure 1 illustrates the concepts in-volved. The Ô¨Ågure shows that, along paths going up the
Hasse diagram (a directed version of the Boolean cube), the function can only stay constant or increase (never decrease). The vertex ‚Äú11110‚Äù (representing the subset
{p1, p2, p3, p4}) is the MaxCon solution for this problem as it is the highest feasible subset in the Hasse diagram (maximum upper zero). The vertex ‚Äú11001‚Äù is an example of an upper zero as there are no feasible nodes that follows it (‚âª ‚Äò11001‚Äô) on the Hasse diagram (can be seen as a local optimum).
Whilst Monotone Boolean Functions (MBFs) have been extensively studied for a variety of application domains, in-cluding learning theory [1] (and computer vision is, these days, highly dominated by learning style approaches), there appears to be relatively little attention to MBFs in computer vision: and more speciÔ¨Åcally in model-based computer vi-sion. Reference [27] appears to be a recent exception - but even this is tackling very different considerations from our main areas of interest (namely, [27] is concerned with ef-Ô¨Åcient Conditional Random Field (CRF) calculations, and
CRF modelling is very different to the geometric modelling we refer to).
In this paper, we present a novel view point on the Max-Con problem using the Monotone Boolean Functions the-ory and use that to develop some efÔ¨Åcient solutions. For this purpose, we concentrate on a property of all Boolean
Functions, called InÔ¨Çuence [22] (deÔ¨Ånition in Section 2.1); a property that has a particular relationship with the Fourier
Transform of a Boolean Function when that Boolean Func-tion is Monotone. In summary our main contributions in-clude: 1. We provide a precise (and abstract) deÔ¨Ånition of the
MaxCon problem in terms of Ô¨Ånding the maximum up-per zero of a Monotone Boolean Function deÔ¨Åned over the Boolean Cube where, vertices correspond to sub-sets of data and the output of the MBF correspond to whether the subset can be feasibly covered by a model with set tolerance. 2. We link the concept of inÔ¨Çuences in a MBF to the concept of outlier in MaxCon and provide theoretical analysis to show that inÔ¨Çuences of points belonging to the largest structure in data would be smallest under
‚Äúideal‚Äù conditions (deÔ¨Åned in Section 3). 3. Based on the above analysis, we derive a greedy algo-rithm that searches for the maximum upper zero of a
MBF to efÔ¨Åciently solve the MaxCon problem. 2.
