This paper addresses the video rescaling task, which arises from the needs of adapting the video spatial reso-lution to suit individual viewing devices. We aim to jointly optimize video downscaling and upscaling as a combined task. Most recent studies focus on image-based solutions, which do not consider temporal information. We present two joint optimization approaches based on invertible neu-ral networks with coupling layers. Our Long Short-Term
Memory Video Rescaling Network (LSTM-VRN) leverages temporal information in the low-resolution video to form an explicit prediction of the missing high-frequency infor-mation for upscaling. Our Multi-input Multi-output Video
Rescaling Network (MIMO-VRN) proposes a new strategy for downscaling and upscaling a group of video frames si-multaneously. Not only do they outperform the image-based invertible model in terms of quantitative and qualitative re-sults, but also show much improved upscaling quality than the video rescaling methods without joint optimization. To our best knowledge, this work is the ﬁrst attempt at the joint optimization of video downscaling and upscaling.

Introduction
With the increasing popularity of video capturing de-vices, a tremendous amount of high-resolution (HR) videos are shot every day. These HR videos are often downscaled to save storage space and streaming bandwidth, or to ﬁt screens with lower resolutions. It is also common that the downscaled videos need to be upscaled for display on HR monitors [11, 16, 21, 2, 28].
In this paper, we address the joint optimization of video downscaling and upscaling as a combined task, which is

This task involves downscal-ing an HR video into a low-resolution (LR) one, followed by upscaling the resulting LR video back to HR. Our aim is to optimize the HR reconstruction quality while regular-izing the LR video to offer comparable visual quality to the bicubic-downscaled video for human perception. It is to be noted that the rescaling task differs from the super-resolution task; at inference time, the former has access to the HR video while the latter has no such information.
One straightforward solution to video rescaling is to downscale an HR video by predeﬁned kernels and upscale the LR video with super-resolution methods [14, 17, 31, 25, 3, 6, 1, 22, 19, 10, 24, 30, 8, 15, 9]. With this solution, 3527
the downscaling is operated independently of the upscal-ing although the upscaling can be optimized for the cho-sen downscaling kernels. The commonly used downscaling (e.g. bicubic) kernels suffer from losing the high-frequency information [20] inherent in the HR video, thus creating a many-to-one mapping between the HR and LR videos. Re-constructing the HR video by upscaling its LR represen-tation becomes an ill-posed problem. The independently-operated downscaling misses the opportunity of optimizing the downscaled video to mitigate the ill-posedness.
The idea of jointly optimizing downscaling and upscal-ing was ﬁrst proposed for image rescaling [11, 16, 21, 2].
It adds a new dimension of thinking to the studies of learn-ing speciﬁcally to upscale for a given downscaling method
[14, 17, 31, 25, 3, 6]. Recognizing the reciprocality of the downscaling and upscaling operations, IRN [28] recently introduced a coupling layer-based invertible model, which shows much improved HR reconstruction quality than the non-invertible models.
These jointly optimized image-based solutions (Fig. 1(a)) are not ideal for video rescaling. For example, a large number of prior works [1, 22, 19, 10, 24, 30, 8, 15, 9] for video upscaling have adopted the Multi-Input Single-Output (MISO) strategy to reconstruct one HR frame from multiple LR frames and/or previously reconstructed HR frames (Fig. 1(b)). They demonstrate the potential for recovering the missing high-frequency component of a video frame from temporal information. However, image-based solutions do not consider temporal information. In addition, two issues remain widely open as (1) how video downscaling and upscaling could be jointly optimized and (2) how temporal information could be utilized in the joint optimization framework to beneﬁt both operations.
In this paper, we present two joint optimization ap-proaches to video rescaling: Long Short-Term Memory
Video Rescaling Network (LSTM-VRN) and Multi-Input
Multi-Output Video Rescaling Network (MIMO-VRN).
The LSTM-VRN downscales an HR video frame-by-frame using a similar coupling architecture to [28], but fuses multiple downscaled LR video frames via LSTM to es-timate the missing high-frequency component of an LR video frame for upscaling (Fig. 1(b)). LSTM-VRN shares similar downscaling and upscaling strategies to the tradi-tional video rescaling framework. In contrast, our MIMO-VRN introduces a completely new paradigm by adopting the MIMO strategy for both video downscaling and upscal-ing (Fig. 1(c)). We develop a group-of-frames-based (GoF) coupling architecture that downscales multiple HR video frames simultaneously, with their high-frequency compo-nents being estimated also simultaneously in the upscaling process.
