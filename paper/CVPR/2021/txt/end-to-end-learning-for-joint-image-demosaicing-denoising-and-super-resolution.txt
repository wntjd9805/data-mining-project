Abstract
Image denoising, demosaicing and super-resolution are key problems of image restoration well studied in the recent decades. Often, in practice, one has to solve these prob-lems simultaneously. A problem of ﬁnding a joint solution of the multiple image restoration tasks just begun to attract an increased attention of researchers. In this paper, we pro-pose an end-to-end solution for the joint demosaicing, de-noising and super-resolution based on a specially designed deep convolutional neural network (CNN). We systemati-cally study different methods to solve this problem and com-pared them with the proposed method. Extensive experi-ments carried out on large image datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art both quantita-tively and qualitatively. Finally, we have applied various loss functions in the proposed scheme and demonstrate that by using the mean absolute error as a loss function, we can obtain superior results in comparison to other cases. 1.

Introduction
Image demosaicing, denoising, and super-resolution (SR) are classical image restoration problems. With the recent advancement of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their application in image restoration, several deep learning-based methods achieve the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance [19, 42, 37, 47].
In many practical applications an acquired image is dis-torted by multiple degradations, thus the above mentioned individual image restoration problems have to be solved si-multaneously. A most natural choice is to apply best meth-ods of individual image restoration tasks in a sequence.
However, the existing solutions are not ideal. Addressing a problem of image denoising, most of the algorithms smooth out high-frequency content, such as image details and tex-ture, while eliminating noise in ﬂat areas. Image demosaic-ing and super-resolution algorithms often introduce color artifacts especially in the texture regions and around image edges. Thus, a sequential application of the individual im-age restoration methods will result in an accumulation of errors produced by the individual methods. Another draw-back of the sequential methods is an increased complexity of a solution (considering both speed and memory).
As an alternative to this, joint solutions for the combined problems have been proposed in the literature [3, 6, 7, 8, 18, 21, 26, 36, 44, 49]. However, the problem of ﬁnding a joint solution for a triplet of problems of image demosaicing, de-noising and SR has received much less attention [26, 29]. In 2019, Qian et al. [29] proposed a trinity network (TENet) to jointly solve this composite problem. Although the TENet is an end-to-end network, the execution order of different tasks is ﬁxed. To this end, Qian et al. have divided the network into two modules and calculated the middle loss to supervise the functionality of the ﬁrst module and op-timize the network. Recently, Liu et al. proposed another solution to the joint problem, SGNet [26]. In order to im-prove the performance of demosaicing, SGNet introduces two self-guidance methods, the green channel guidance and the density map guidance.
In this paper, we comprehensively study various solu-tions of this combined problem. First, in subsection 3.1, we adjust the execution order, and investigate possible joint so-lutions under this execution order. Then, in subsection 3.2, we propose an end-to-end learning for the combined prob-lem by designing a very deep convolutional neural net-work JDN DM SR. Differently from TENet and SGNet, our network uses the residual channel connection block (RCAB) [47] instead of residual-in-residual dense block (RRDB) [37] as the basic block (see subsection 6.1). We have carried out numerous experiments and demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other joint solutions both quantitatively and qualitatively (Section 4). To further optimize the proposed network, different loss functions are utilized, and the comparative analysis of the resulting so-lutions is demonstrated in subsection 5.1. A comparison with the state-of-the-art method TENet [29] and the abla-tion study (see Fig. 1) are presented in subsection 5.2 and
Section 6, respectively. 3507

The main contributions of this paper are listed below. resolution operations are not performed. 1. We propose an end-to-end network (JDN DM SR+) based on residual channel attention blocks for joint im-age demosaicing, denoising and super-resolution. This network is universal: one can turn off denoising and/or super-resolution operations of the network by setting the noise level parameter to 0 and the scale factor pa-rameter to 1. 2. We systematically compare our JDN DM SR+ with diverse solutions to the joint problem. The quantitative and qualitative experimental results on the benchmark datasets show that the proposed method not only sur-passes other solutions, but also outperforms the state-of-the-art, including cases when denoising or super-2.
