Person re-identiﬁcation (ReID) methods always learn through a stationary domain that is ﬁxed by the choice of a given dataset. In many contexts (e.g., lifelong learning), those methods are ineffective because the domain is con-tinually changing in which case incremental learning over multiple domains is required potentially. In this work we explore a new and challenging ReID task, namely lifelong person re-identiﬁcation (LReID), which enables to learn continuously across multiple domains and even generalise on new and unseen domains. Following the cognitive pro-cesses in the human brain, we design an Adaptive Knowl-edge Accumulation (AKA) framework that is endowed with two crucial abilities: knowledge representation and knowl-edge operation. Our method alleviates catastrophic for-getting on seen domains and demonstrates the ability to generalize to unseen domains. Correspondingly, we also provide a new and large-scale benchmark for LReID. Ex-tensive experiments demonstrate our method outperforms other competitors by a margin of 5.8% mAP in general-ising evaluation. The codes will be available at https:

Introduction
Person re-identiﬁcation (ReID) seeks to linking the same pedestrian across disjoint camera views. While advanced deep learning methods [55, 49, 30, 46, 38, 31, 47] have shown powerful abilities for ReID [35, 10], their train-ing process is limited heavily by a ﬁxed and stationary dataset [52, 54, 40]. However, this limitation violates many practical scenarios where the data is continuously increas-ing from different domains. For instance, smart surveillance systems [53, 15] over multiple crossroads capture millions of new images every day, and they are required to have the ability of incremental or lifelong learning.
To overcome the above limitation, we propose a new yet practical ReID task, namely lifelong person re-identiﬁcation (LReID), which requires the model to accu-∗Corresponding Author.

Figure 1: Pipeline of the proposed lifelong person re-identiﬁcation task. The person identities among the in-volved domains are completely disjoint. mulate informative knowledge incrementally from several seen domains and then adapt the knowledge to the test sets of both seen and unseen domains (Fig. 1). Our LReID task has two challenging problems, compared to previous tasks. First, unlike conventional lifelong learning [27, 32],
LReID further considers improving the generalization abil-ity on unseen classes that never appear in the lifelong train-ing stage. Second, LReID is a ﬁne-grained lifelong learning task, in which inter-class appearance variations are signif-icantly subtler than standard lifelong learning benchmarks like CIFAR-100 [13] and ImageNet [33].
To tackle the challenges in LReLD, we propose a new adaptive knowledge accumulation (AKA) framework which can continually accumulate knowledge information from old domains, so as to have a better generalization qual-ity on any new domain. This idea is inspired by a new per-spective of human cognitive processes. Recent discoveries
[4, 39] in cognitive science indicate that a cognitive pro-cess could be broadly decomposed into “representations” and “operations”. The structure of the knowledge repre-sentations (KRs) plays a key role for stabilizing memory, which shows our brain has potential relations with graph structure. Adaptive update and retrieval contained in the knowledge operations (KOs) promotes the efﬁcient use of knowledge. Such complex yet elaborate KRs and KOs en-able our brain to perform life-long learning well. Motivated by this, we endow AKA with two abilities to separately ac-7901
complish knowledge representation and knowledge opera-tion. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst represent transferable knowledge as a knowledge graph (KG), where each vertex represents one type of knowledge (e.g., the similar appearance be-tween two persons). For image samples in one mini-batch, we temporally construct a similarity graph based on their relationships. Then, AKA establishes cross-graph links and executes a graph convolution. Such operation enables
KG to transfer previous knowledge to each current sample.
Meanwhile, KG is updated by summarizing the information underlying the relationships among current instances. Fur-thermore, for encouraging KG to improve learned represen-tation while considering the forgetting problem, plasticity loss and stability loss are integrated to achieve an optimal balance for generalization on unseen domain. Our contri-butions are three-fold:
Task contribution. We exploit a new yet practical per-son ReID task, namely LReID, which considers person re-identiﬁcation problem under a lifelong learning scenario.
Technical contribution. We propose a new AKA framework for LReID. AKA maintains a learnable knowl-edge graph to adaptively update previous knowledge, while transferring the knowledge to improve generalization on any unseen domains, with the plasticity-stability loss.
Empirical contribution. We provide a new benchmark and evaluation protocols for LReID. AKA shows promising improvements over other state-of-the-art methods. 2.
