We present PREDATOR, a model designed for pairwise point-cloud registration that pays close attention to the overlap region. Unlike previous approaches, our model is specifically designed to handle point-cloud pairs with low overlap. Its main innovation is an overlap-attention block that facilitates early information exchange between the latent encodings of the two point clouds. This enables the decoding of the latent representations into per-point features that are conditioned on the other point cloud, allowing for predictions of which points are both salient and located in the overlap region. By focusing on relevant points for matching, PREDATOR significantly improves performance, increasing successful registrations by over 20% in low-overlap scenarios. Additionally, PREDATOR achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on the 3DMatch benchmark with 89% registration recall. The code for PREDATOR is publicly available.
