Current methods for improving nighttime visibility mainly focus on addressing low light conditions. However, night images suffer not only from low light but also from artificial light effects such as glow, glare, and floodlight. Applying existing enhancement methods to these images actually worsens visibility by intensifying these effects. High dynamic range (HDR) imaging methods can handle low light and over-exposed areas, but they are unable to eliminate light effects and thus cannot enhance visibility in affected regions.This study aims to enhance the visibility of a single nighttime image by expanding the dynamic range of its intensity. This approach increases the intensity of low light regions while simultaneously suppressing light effects like glow and glare. The process involves three main steps. First, a network is used to estimate the camera response function (CRF) and linearize the input image. Second, the linearized image is decomposed into low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) feature maps, which are separately processed by two networks to suppress light effects and remove noise. Third, another network is employed to boost the dynamic range of the processed LF feature maps, which are then combined with the processed HF feature maps to generate the final output. This output exhibits an increased dynamic range and suppressed light effects. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method compared to other state-of-the-art nighttime visibility enhancement techniques.
