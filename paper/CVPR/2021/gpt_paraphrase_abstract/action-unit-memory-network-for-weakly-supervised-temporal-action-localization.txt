We propose a method called Action Unit Memory Network (AUMN) for weakly supervised temporal action localization. This method addresses the challenges of achieving localization completeness and reducing background interference by using a memory bank to learn action units. The AUMN consists of two attention modules that update the memory bank and learn action unit specific classifiers. Additionally, three mechanisms (diversity, homogeneity, and sparsity) are designed to guide the updating of the memory network. This is the first work to explicitly model action units using a memory network. Experimental results on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet benchmarks show that our AUMN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with a significant improvement in average mAP on the THUMOS14 dataset. Specifically, the average mAP of IoU thresholds from 0.1 to 0.5 is improved from 47.0% to 52.1%.
