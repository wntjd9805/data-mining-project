This paper presents a new method for unsupervised video multi-object segmentation. Current methods use a two-stage approach involving object proposal detection and generic feature matching for temporal association. However, the use of generic features leads to poor generalization for unseen objects. To address this issue, the proposed method combines foreground region estimation and instance grouping in one network, and incorporates temporal guidance for accurate object segmentation in each frame. For temporal association, a discriminative appearance model is added to capture target-specific information. The proposed method employs three strategies for accurate segmentation: target-specific tracking using a memory-augmented appearance model, target-agnostic verification to trace tracklets, and adaptive memory updating using verified segments. The proposed approach is evaluated on DAVIS17 and YouTube-VIS datasets and achieves superior segmentation accuracy and inference speed compared to state-of-the-art methods.
