We have developed a framework that can generate manga from digital illustrations. In professional manga studios, the creation process involves three main steps: artists use line drawings to outline the structure of the manga storyboards, apply different types of screentones for shading and rendering, and use irregular screen textures for background layouts and special effects. Inspired by this workflow, we propose a data-driven framework that can convert a digital illustration into three components: manga line drawing, regular screentone, and irregular screen texture. These components can be directly used to compose manga images and can be further adjusted to create a wider range of manga styles. To support our framework, we have created a large dataset with these three components annotated by artists. We have conducted user studies and evaluations, which show that the image layers generated by our framework are practically useful for manga artists. We have provided 60 qualitative results and 15 additional comparisons in our supplementary material. We plan to make our manga dataset publicly available to assist in related applications.
