Detecting the precise location of three-dimensional objects from a single image without depth information is a difficult task. Current methods lack effectiveness in handling truncated objects due to their uniform approach for all objects. In this paper, we propose a flexible framework for monocular 3D object detection that addresses this issue. Our approach separates truncated objects from normal objects by decoupling the edge of the feature map. This ensures that the optimization process for normal objects is not affected. Additionally, we tackle the problem of object depth estimation by combining multiple approaches. We formulate it as an uncertainty-guided ensemble, utilizing both directly regressed object depth and solved depths from different keypoint groups. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art method by 27% and 30% on the moderate and hard levels of the KITTI benchmark test set, respectively, while maintaining real-time efficiency. The code for our method will be made available at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/zhangyp15/MonoFlex.
