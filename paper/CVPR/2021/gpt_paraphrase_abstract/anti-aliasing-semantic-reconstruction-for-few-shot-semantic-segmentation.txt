We have made progress in few-shot semantic segmentation by using features learned from base classes to represent novel classes with limited examples. However, this sharing of features leads to semantic aliasing between similar novel classes. To address this, we propose a new approach called anti-aliasing semantic reconstruction (ASR). ASR reformulates few-shot segmentation as a semantic reconstruction problem, converting base class features into basis vectors that span a class-level semantic space. We use a contrastive loss to maximize the orthogonality of these basis vectors and minimize semantic aliasing. In the reconstructed space, we further suppress interference from other classes by projecting query features to the support vector for precise semantic activation. ASR provides a systematic and interpretable solution for few-shot learning. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ASR compared to previous methods. The code for ASR is available at github.com/Bibkiller/ASR.
