Modern multiple object tracking (MOT) methods have not been able to achieve satisfactory performance due to the inappropriate and inefficient application of single object tracking (SOT) models. This paper proposes a novel MOT architecture that combines CenterNet with an SOT branch, allowing MOT to benefit from the discriminative power of SOT methods in an effective and efficient manner. Unlike existing SOT methods, the added SOT branch trains a separate model per target to distinguish it from its surrounding targets, providing novel discrimination. Additionally, both the detection and SOT branches treat objects as points, enabling efficient online learning even when processing multiple targets simultaneously. Without any tricks, the proposed tracker achieves high performance on MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks, with MOTAs of 0.710 and 0.686, IDF1s of 0.719 and 0.714, respectively. Furthermore, it runs at a fast speed of 16 FPS on MOT17.
