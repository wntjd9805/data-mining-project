This paper presents a new approach for denoising hyperspectral images (HSIs) by applying weights to different pixels in order to suppress the negative impact of noisy elements. Traditional weighting schemes rely on prior understanding or subjective distribution assumptions about HSI noise, making them biased and not suitable for diverse practical scenarios. To address this issue, the authors propose a data-driven scheme called hyper-weight-net (HWnet) that maps an input noisy image to its appropriate weights. They develop a Bayesian framework and a variational inference algorithm to infer the parameters of HWnet, aiming to extract a generalized weighting rule for diverse and complicated noisy HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that the learned HWnet can be effectively applied to different noise types and transferred to other weighted models. Additionally, HWnet helps achieve a more accurate and robust deep hyperspectral prior (DHP). The weights extracted by HWnet accurately capture complex noise knowledge in the input HSI, as demonstrated through experimental analysis.
