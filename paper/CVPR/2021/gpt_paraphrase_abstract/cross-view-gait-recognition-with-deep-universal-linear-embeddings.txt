Gait is a biometric identifier that is attractive due to its non-invasive and non-cooperative nature. Unlike other biometric identifiers such as fingerprints and iris scans, gait recognition does not require direct contact or cooperation from the individual. However, current cross-view gait recognition methods focus on deep convolutional networks and overlook the potential dynamical information present in gait sequences. This paper introduces the use of Koopman operator theory in gait recognition, which enables the identification of a linear approximation for a nonlinear dynamical system. A new framework is proposed, utilizing a convolutional variational autoencoder and deep Koopman embedding, to approximate the Koopman operators and extract dynamical features from a linearized embedding space. This approach offers a physically interpretable gait recognition system. Experimental results on the OU-MVLP dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
