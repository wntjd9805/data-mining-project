The importance of object shape in object recognition is widely acknowledged. However, current powerful object recognition methods do not explicitly utilize object shape during learning. This study explores the potential of incorporating reasoning about 3D shape to enhance the generalization performance of low-shot learning methods. Inspired by recent advances in low-shot learning, developmental psychology, and the use of synthetic data in computer vision research, we propose a novel approach to improve existing low-shot learning techniques. Our approach involves learning a discriminative embedding space using 3D object shape and mapping images into this embedding. Through experimentation on various datasets, we demonstrate that our approach enhances the performance of image-only low-shot learning methods. Additionally, we introduce Toys4K, a 3D object dataset with the largest number of object categories available, designed specifically to support low-shot learning.
