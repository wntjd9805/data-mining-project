Data augmentation is a regularization technique used to address overfitting in deep neural networks. While augmentation methods have been extensively studied for image data, they are rarely considered for point cloud processing. Point clouds, which are often characterized by small datasets and lack of generality, require regularization techniques. This paper introduces a novel data augmentation method called Rigid SubsetMix (RSMix) for point clouds. RSMix generates a virtual mixed sample by replacing part of a sample with shape-preserved subsets from another sample. The method preserves the structural information of the point cloud by extracting subsets without deformation using a neighboring function designed specifically for point clouds. Experimental results demonstrate that RSMix effectively regularizes deep neural networks and significantly improves shape classification. The paper also includes an analysis of various combinations of data augmentations, including RSMix with single and multi-view evaluations, based on extensive ablation studies.
