This paper introduces a novel algorithm called Convolutional Hough Matching (CHM) that leverages geometric relations to establish reliable visual correspondences in images with large variations. The method utilizes a Hough transform perspective and distributes similarities of candidate matches over a geometric transformation space. It evaluates these matches in a convolutional manner by casting it into a trainable neural layer with a semi-isotropic high-dimensional kernel. This approach allows for non-rigid matching with a small number of interpretable parameters. The proposed CHM layers perform convolutional matching in the translation and scaling space, which leads to state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks for semantic visual correspondence. This demonstrates the algorithm's robustness to challenging intra-class variations.
