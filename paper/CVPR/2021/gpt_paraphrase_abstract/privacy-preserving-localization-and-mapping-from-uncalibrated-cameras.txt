Recent advancements in privacy-preserving localization and mapping using line features have made significant progress in addressing privacy concerns in cloud-based solutions for mixed reality and robotics. However, these approaches are limited by the need for calibrated cameras, which restricts their application in crowd-sourced mapping scenarios. In this study, we propose a solution to the problem of uncalibrated privacy-preserving localization and mapping. Our approach simultaneously recovers the intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of a camera solely from line features. This allows uncalibrated devices to both localize themselves within an existing map and contribute to the map while maintaining the privacy of image contents. Additionally, we also present a solution for creating maps from scratch using only uncalibrated devices. Our approach achieves comparable performance to the calibrated scenario and offers privacy-preserving alternatives to traditional point features.
