Most current methods for image de-raining using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can only learn fixed mapping rules between paired rainy and clean images on a single dataset. This limits their applicability in practical situations with multiple and incremental datasets, where the mapping rules may change for different types of rain streaks. However, the traditional deep CNN model suffers from catastrophic forgetting, making it challenging to design a generalized framework for multiple and incremental datasets. To address this issue, a strategy has been developed that involves sharing the network structure but independently updating and storing the network parameters on each dataset. However, this strategy is not suitable for compact systems as it significantly increases training time and parameter space. To overcome this limitation, we propose a parameter importance guided weights modification approach called PIGWM. In this approach, the well-trained network weights are updated based on their importance evaluated on previous training datasets when new datasets, such as new rain datasets, are introduced. Through extensive experimental validation, we show that our proposed method allows a single network with a single parameter set to process multiple rain datasets with minimal performance degradation. The proposed model achieves superior performance on both inhomogeneous and incremental datasets, making it promising for highly compact systems that need to learn various regularities of different types of rain streaks. Our results indicate that our method has great potential for other computer vision tasks with dynamic learning environments.
