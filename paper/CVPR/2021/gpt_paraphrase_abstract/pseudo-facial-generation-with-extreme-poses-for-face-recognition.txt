Although face recognition has made significant advancements, it remains challenging to identify facial images with extreme poses. Traditional methods address this issue by generating artificial frontal faces from extreme poses. However, these methods struggle to maintain identity information while requiring high computational resources and being susceptible to uncontrolled disturbances. Our experiments reveal a significant decrease in precision when dealing with extreme poses. Interestingly, we observed that minor visual differences exist between extreme poses and small rotations. Based on this insight, we propose a novel lightweight approach that tackles the problem of extreme poses without generating frontal facial images. Instead, our method focuses on making minor modifications to the input images while preserving critical identity information. Specifically, our method reconstructs pseudo profile faces by minimizing pixel-wise differences with original profile faces, while simultaneously maintaining identity consistency with their corresponding frontal faces. Our framework enhances existing discriminators and achieves substantial improvements on various benchmark datasets.
