This paper presents a novel deep neural network for snapshot hyperspectral imaging that aims to improve the quality of image reconstruction. The network utilizes the concept of tensor low-rank prior, which is inspired by the canonical-polyadic decomposition theory. This theory states that a low-rank tensor can be represented as a weighted sum of rank-1 component tensors. To incorporate the tensor low-rank prior into the network, the authors propose a two-step process. First, they generate rank-1 tensors with discriminative components to capture contextual information from both the spatial and channel dimensions of the image features. Then, these rank-1 tensors are aggregated into a low-rank tensor, which serves as a 3D attention map to exploit global correlations and refine the image features. The learned tensor low-rank prior is integrated into an iterative optimization algorithm, resulting in an end-to-end hyperspectral image reconstruction process. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments conducted on both synthetic and real data. The results show that the method outperforms existing techniques in terms of reconstruction quality.Overall, this paper introduces a deep neural network that leverages the tensor low-rank prior to enhance hyperspectral image reconstruction. The experimental results validate the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to other approaches.
