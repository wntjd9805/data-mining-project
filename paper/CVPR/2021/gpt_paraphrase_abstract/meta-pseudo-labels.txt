We introduce a novel method called Meta Pseudo Labels, which is a semi-supervised learning technique achieving a remarkable top-1 accuracy of 90.2% on ImageNet. This accuracy surpasses the current state-of-the-art by 1.6% [16]. Similar to Pseudo Labels, Meta Pseudo Labels employs a teacher network to generate pseudo labels for unlabeled data, which are then used to instruct a student network. However, unlike Pseudo Labels where the teacher remains fixed, in Meta Pseudo Labels, the teacher network continuously adapts based on the feedback received from the student's performance on the labeled dataset. Consequently, the teacher network generates improved pseudo labels to enhance the student's learning.
