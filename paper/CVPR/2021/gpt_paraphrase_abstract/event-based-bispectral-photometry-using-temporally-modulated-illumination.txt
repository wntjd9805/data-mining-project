The analysis of bispectral difference is crucial in applications involving the propagation of rays in a medium that absorbs light. Typically, the bispectral difference is obtained by subtracting signals at two specific wavelengths captured by regular digital cameras. However, this approach inherits the limitations of conventional cameras, including limited dynamic range, response speed, and quantization precision. To address this, we propose a new method for obtaining a bispectral difference image using an event camera with temporally modulated illumination.  Our method is based on the observation of the similarity between the bispectral photometry principle of the participating medium and the event generation mechanism in an event camera. By carefully modulating the bispectral illumination, our approach enables the direct extraction of the bispectral difference from triggered events. We conducted experiments using a prototype imaging system, which confirmed the feasibility of this novel usage of event cameras in photometry-based vision tasks, such as 3D shape reconstruction in water.
