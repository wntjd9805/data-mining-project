Aerial Image Segmentation is a specific problem in semantic segmentation that presents unique challenges. Two main issues are the imbalanced distribution of foreground and background and the presence of multiple small objects amidst a complex background. Existing methods, such as dense affinity context modeling, perform poorly due to an excessive focus on background context. To address these challenges, we propose a module called PointFlow, which utilizes point-wise affinity propagation based on the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) framework. Instead of dense affinity learning, we generate a sparse affinity map by selecting points between adjacent features, reducing background noise while maintaining efficiency. We employ a dual point matcher to select points from salient areas and object boundaries. Our experiments on three aerial segmentation datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art general semantic segmentation methods in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. We achieve the best trade-off between speed and accuracy on three aerial benchmarks. Furthermore, experiments on three general semantic segmentation datasets validate the generality of our approach.
