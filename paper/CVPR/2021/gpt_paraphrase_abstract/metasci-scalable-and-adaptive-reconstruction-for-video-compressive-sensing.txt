Video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) is a promising method for capturing high-speed videos using a two-dimensional detector. This involves coding the video frames with various masks and compressing them into a snapshot measurement. The challenge lies in efficiently reconstructing the high-speed frames, which has been achieved using deep learning networks. However, these networks are typically trained for specific small-scale masks and require extensive training time and GPU memory. This lack of flexibility hinders their usability with new masks or larger-scale masks. To overcome these challenges, we propose MetaSCI, a Meta Modulated Convolutional Network for SCI reconstruction. MetaSCI consists of a shared backbone for different masks and lightweight meta-modulation parameters that can adapt to different modulation parameters for each mask. This enables fast adaptation to new masks or systems and scalability to large data. Extensive simulations and real data experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach. The code for MetaSCI is publicly available at https://github.com/xyvirtualgroup/MetaSCI-CVPR2021.
