Recent advancements in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) have demonstrated that a comprehensive training process encompassing both detection and recognition yields superior outcomes. However, existing OCR methods predominantly concentrate on Latin-alphabet languages and often solely on case-insensitive English characters. This study introduces an innovative end-to-end (E2E) strategy called Multiplexed Multilingual Mask TextSpotter, which performs word-level script identification and manages diverse scripts using distinct recognition heads. Importantly, it maintains a unified loss function that optimizes both script identification and multiple recognition heads simultaneously. Experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses single-head models with a similar parameter count in end-to-end recognition tasks. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance on MLT17 and MLT19 joint text detection and script identification benchmarks. This work represents a significant advancement towards an end-to-end trainable and scalable multilingual OCR system capable of serving various purposes. The code and model associated with our approach will be made publicly available.
