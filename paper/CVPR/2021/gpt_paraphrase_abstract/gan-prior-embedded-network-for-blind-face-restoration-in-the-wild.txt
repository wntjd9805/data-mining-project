Blind face restoration (BFR) is a difficult task when dealing with severely degraded face images in real-world scenarios. Training a deep neural network (DNN) directly is not effective due to the complexity and unknown nature of the degradation. Existing generative adversarial network (GAN) based methods offer better results but tend to produce over-smoothed restorations. In this study, we propose a novel approach by first training a GAN for high-quality face image generation and incorporating it into a U-shaped DNN as a prior decoder. We then fine-tune this GAN prior embedded DNN using synthesized low-quality face images. The GAN blocks in our method are designed to generate the latent code and noise input from both deep and shallow features of the DNN, allowing control over the global face structure, local face details, and background of the restored image. Our proposed GAN prior embedded network (GPEN) is easy to implement and produces visually realistic results. Experimental results demonstrate that GPEN outperforms state-of-the-art BFR methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, particularly for severely degraded face images in real-world settings.
