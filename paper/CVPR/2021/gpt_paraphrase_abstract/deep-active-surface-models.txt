Active Surface Models have been widely used to represent complex 3D surfaces. However, their integration with deep networks has been limited to using ActiveContours solely for generating data and controlling meta-parameters. This paper proposes a more comprehensive integration by introducing layers that seamlessly incorporate ActiveContours into Graph Convolutional Networks. These integrated layers enforce sophisticated smoothness priors without significantly increasing computational costs. The resulting Deep Active Surface models outperform traditional regularization loss terms in terms of imposing smoothness priors for tasks such as 3D surface reconstruction from 2D images and 3D volume segmentation.
