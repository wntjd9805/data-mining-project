This study presents a novel method called the dual iterative refinement (DIR) method for achieving dense correspondence between two shapes that are nearly isometric. The main concept of this method is to utilize dual information, such as spatial and spectral features, in a complementary and effective manner. This allows more accurate information to be extracted from the current iteration and used in the subsequent iteration. The DIR method employs a zoom-in process in each iteration, starting from the current correspondence, to select well-matched anchor pairs based on a local mapping distortion criterion. These selected anchor pairs are then used to align spectral features (or other appropriate global features) whose dimension is adaptively adjusted to match the capacity of the selected anchor pairs. The combination of complementary information in a data-adaptive way makes DIR efficient and robust, yielding accurate results within just a few iterations. Moreover, by selecting appropriate dual features, DIR can handle both patch and partial matching. Comprehensive experiments conducted on various datasets demonstrate that DIR outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
