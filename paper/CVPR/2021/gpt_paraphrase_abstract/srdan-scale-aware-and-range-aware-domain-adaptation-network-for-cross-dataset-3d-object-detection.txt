This study focuses on the representation of objects in 3D point clouds and the challenges faced in 3D object detection, especially in domain adaptation scenarios. The authors propose a new method called SRDAN (Scale-aware and Range-aware Domain Adaptation Network) that utilizes the geometric characteristics of 3D data, such as size and distance, to align the distribution between different domains. To address the issue of scale, the authors introduce a 3D voxel-based feature pyramid network that extracts multi-scale semantic voxel features and aligns them between domains. For range alignment, a range-guided domain alignment module is introduced to align the features based on the distance of objects from the capture device. The effectiveness of the SRDAN approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments in three different scenarios, highlighting the importance of geometric characteristics in cross-dataset 3D object detection. A comprehensive ablation study further validates the significance of these geometric characteristics.
