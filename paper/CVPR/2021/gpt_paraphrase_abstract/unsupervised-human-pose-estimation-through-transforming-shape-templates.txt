Human pose estimation is a significant problem in computer vision, with various applications such as augmented reality, video capture, surveillance, and movement tracking. In the medical field, it can serve as a crucial biomarker for identifying neurological impairments in infants. However, existing methods have been limited by the requirement of large annotated datasets and their inability to generalize to individuals with different body shapes and compositions, specifically children and infants. In this study, we propose a new approach to learning pose estimators for both adult humans and infants using unsupervised learning. Our method treats the problem as a learnable template matching task, leveraging deep feature extractors. We estimate human-interpretable landmarks by transforming a template composed of predefined body parts represented by 2D Gaussian distributions. Additionally, we incorporate a connectivity prior to ensure meaningful representations of human shape. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on two distinct datasets that include both adults and infants. For more information, please visit our project page at infantmotion.github.io.
