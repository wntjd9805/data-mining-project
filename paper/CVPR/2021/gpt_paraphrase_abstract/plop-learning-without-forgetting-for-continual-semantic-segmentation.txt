Deep learning methods are widely used in computer vision tasks, especially in semantic segmentation. However, when it comes to continual learning for semantic segmentation (CSS), there is a common issue of catastrophic forgetting. This problem is even more pronounced in CSS because old classes are collapsed into the background at each step. In this paper, we introduce Local POD, a scheme that distills multi-scale pooling to preserve spatial relationships at the feature level. Additionally, we propose an entropy-based pseudo-labelling approach for the background to address background shift and prevent catastrophic forgetting of old classes. Our approach, called PLOP, outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in both existing CSS scenarios and newly proposed benchmarks.
