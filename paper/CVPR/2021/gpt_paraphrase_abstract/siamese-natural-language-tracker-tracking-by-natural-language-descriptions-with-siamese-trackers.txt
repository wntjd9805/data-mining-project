We present a new approach called Siamese Natural Language Tracker (SNLT) that combines visual tracking techniques with tracking by natural language (NL) descriptions. This innovative method can be applied to various Siamese trackers, offering a new set of benchmarks for NL-based tracking and the potential for future improvements. We introduce the Siamese Natural Language Region Proposal Network (SNL-RPN) with a carefully designed architecture, along with the Dynamic Aggregation of vision and language modalities, to perform the tracking by NL task. Experimental results on tracking benchmarks with NL annotations demonstrate that the proposed SNLT enhances Siamese trackers by 3 to 7 percentage points, albeit with a slight decrease in speed. SNLT surpasses all existing NL trackers and competes with state-of-the-art real-time trackers on LaSOT benchmarks, achieving a frame rate of 50 frames per second on a single GPU.
