The development of Under-Display Camera (UDC) systems allows for a seamless and notch-free viewing experience on smartphones, as well as other devices such as TVs, laptops, and tablets. However, the quality of images captured by the selfie camera underneath the display is often degraded due to the microstructure of the OLED pixel array, which causes issues such as noise, flare, haze, and blur. This study aims to analyze and address these degradation problems.To better understand the degradation, a physics-based image formation model is defined. Additionally, a real-world Point Spread Function (PSF) of a UDC system is measured using a prototype smartphone, and a model-based data synthesis pipeline is developed to generate realistically degraded images. A new Dynamic Skip Connection Network (DISCNet), which incorporates domain knowledge, is specially designed to restore the UDC images.Extensive experiments are conducted on both synthetic and real UDC data to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The physics-based image formation model and DISCNet can serve as a foundation for further research in UDC image restoration, as well as for addressing diffraction artifacts in a broader context.
