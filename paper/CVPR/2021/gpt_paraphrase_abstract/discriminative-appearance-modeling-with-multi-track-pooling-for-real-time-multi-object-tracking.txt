This study focuses on improving multi-object tracking by addressing the limitations of existing approaches. Currently, most trackers treat each object separately and struggle to handle similar-looking objects in the scene. To overcome this issue, the researchers propose a novel multi-track pooling module that allows for the simultaneous consideration of all tracks during memory updating. This module has a small spatial overhead. Additionally, a training strategy adapted to multi-track pooling is introduced, which generates hard tracking episodes online. These innovations result in a strong discriminative appearance model within the bilinear LSTM tracking framework. This model enables the use of greedy data association, leading to effective online tracking performance. The experiments conducted demonstrate real-time, state-of-the-art performance on public multi-object tracking datasets.
