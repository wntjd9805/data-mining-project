We propose a new method for reconstructing volumetric flows from limited views using a global transport approach. Instead of obtaining the spatio-temporal function of the observations, we reconstruct the motion based on a single initial state. We also introduce a learned self-supervision technique that constrains observations from unseen angles. These visual constraints, along with transport constraints and differentiable rendering, are combined to create a robust end-to-end reconstruction algorithm. This allows for the reconstruction of highly realistic flow motions, even with only one input view. Our experiments with synthetic and real flows demonstrate that our global reconstruction approach improves the accuracy of fluid motion reconstruction.
