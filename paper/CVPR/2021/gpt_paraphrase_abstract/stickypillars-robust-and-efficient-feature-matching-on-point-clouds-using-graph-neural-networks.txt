StickyPillars is a new method for robust point cloud registration, an important requirement for mapping and localization algorithms. Traditional methods like ICP have limitations in initialization, overlap, and dynamic object presence. Deep learning-based registration approaches offer better results but are slow. StickyPillars addresses these issues by using graph neural networks to match 3D features in point clouds quickly and accurately. It aggregates context using transformer-based self and cross-attention. The network output is used to solve an optimal transport problem, providing final matching probabilities. Unlike other methods, StickyPillars does not rely on handcrafted feature descriptors or heuristic matching strategies. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the KITTI dataset and is four times faster than leading deep methods. StickyPillars is also integrated into a LiDAR odometry pipeline, producing highly accurate results on the KITTI odometry dataset. Additionally, it demonstrates robustness in accuracy even in situations where other procedures fail due to frame drops and higher speeds.
