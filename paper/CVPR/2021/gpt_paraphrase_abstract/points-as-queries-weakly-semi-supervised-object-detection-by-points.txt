We propose a new approach for weakly semi-supervised object detection using a combination of fully annotated images and weakly annotated images by points. This approach strikes a balance between the need for extensive annotation and the performance of object detection. Our analysis of existing detectors reveals that they struggle to effectively utilize the power of the annotated points. To address this issue, we introduce a new detector called Point DETR, which incorporates a point encoder into the existing DETR model. We conducted extensive experiments on the MS-COCO dataset under various data settings, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Specifically, when using only 20% fully labeled data from COCO, our detector achieves a promising performance with an average precision (AP) of 33.3, outperforming a strong baseline (FCOS) by 2.0 AP. Furthermore, we show that the point annotations contribute significantly to various average recall (AR) metrics, providing more than 10 additional points.
