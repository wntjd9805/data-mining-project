The natural instinct of humans to recognize unfamiliar objects in their surroundings helps them learn about these objects when knowledge about them becomes available. This motivates us to introduce a new computer vision problem called "Open World Object Detection." In this problem, a model is tasked with identifying objects that it has not been introduced to as "unknown" without explicit instruction to do so. The model must also learn these unknown categories incrementally without forgetting previously learned classes as labels for them are progressively received. We define the problem, present a rigorous evaluation protocol, and propose a solution called ORE: Open World Object Detector, which utilizes contrastive clustering and energy-based unknown identification. Through experimental evaluation and analysis, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ORE in achieving the objectives of Open World Object Detection. Additionally, we discover that identifying and characterizing unknown instances helps reduce confusion in incremental object detection, resulting in state-of-the-art performance without additional methodological effort. We hope that our work will inspire further research in this newly identified and crucial research direction.
