Deep learning methods have been widely used for automatic estimation of facial action unit (AU) intensity, leading to excellent results. However, these methods primarily focus on appearance-based features and do not effectively utilize the underlying structural information among AUs. In this study, we propose a new approach called dynamic probabilistic graph convolution (DPG) to simultaneously incorporate AU appearances, dynamics, and their semantic structural dependencies for AU intensity estimation. Firstly, we utilize a Bayesian Network to capture the inherent dependencies among AUs. Secondly, we introduce a probabilistic graph convolution technique that enables graph convolution on the distribution of the Bayesian Network structure to extract AU structural features. Lastly, we employ a dynamic deep model based on LSTM to combine AU appearance, dynamics, and structural features for accurate AU intensity estimation. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable or even superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on two benchmark databases for facial AU intensity estimation, namely FERA 2015 and DISFA.
