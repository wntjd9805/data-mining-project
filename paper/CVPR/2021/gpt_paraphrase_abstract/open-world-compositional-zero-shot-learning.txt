Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) involves recognizing combinations of objects and states that were not seen during training. This study operates in an open world setting, where there are numerous unseen compositions, some of which may not be feasible. The approach begins by calculating the cosine similarity between visual features and compositional embeddings. Feasibility scores are then estimated for each composition, which are used to mask the output space or as a margin for the cosine similarity during training. Experimental results on two CZSL benchmarks indicate that existing methods perform poorly in the open world setting. However, the proposed CZSL model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the closed world scenario. Furthermore, the inclusion of feasibility scores significantly improves the performance of the approach in the open world setting, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods.
