We propose a method for 3D object detection using a 2D perspective range image. Our approach involves designing a 2D convolutional network architecture that retains the 3D spherical coordinates of each pixel throughout the network. This allows the network to leverage local geometry information and utilize different convolution kernels. We introduce four types of kernels, including a dense kernel based on the bag-of-words paradigm, as well as three graph kernels inspired by recent advancements in graph neural networks. Additionally, we explore the fusion of camera images with the range image by operating in the perspective range image view. Our method achieves competitive performance on the Waymo Open Dataset, particularly in pedestrian detection where the average precision (AP) is improved from 69.7% to 75.5%. Furthermore, our approach is efficient, with our smallest model outperforming PointPillars while requiring significantly fewer floating point operations (FLOPS) and model parameters (180 times fewer).
