Few-shot learning is a method used to correctly identify new, unseen classes with only a limited number of support samples. Typically, this is done by using global embeddings of images. In this study, we propose enhancing the backbone network by incorporating an attention agent that is trained using reinforcement learning. We utilize the policy gradient algorithm to train the attention agent to dynamically pinpoint representative regions on feature maps. Additionally, we design a reward function based on the prediction of held-out data to improve the attention mechanism's generalization across unseen classes. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that, with the reinforced attention, our embedding network can progressively generate a more distinctive representation in few-shot learning. Furthermore, our experiments on image classification tasks validate the effectiveness of our proposed design.
