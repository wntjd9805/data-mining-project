State-of-the-art techniques for semantic segmentation rely on deep neural networks that require a large amount of labeled data. Region-based active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising approach to reduce the costs associated with data annotation. However, a crucial decision in region-based AL is whether to use regularly-shaped regions like rectangles or irregularly-shaped regions like superpixels. In this study, we investigate this choice using realistic measurement of annotation costs based on clicks. We specifically focus on the use of superpixels and demonstrate that the effectiveness of this approach may be underestimated if the wrong cost measure, such as the percentage of labeled pixels, is used. By comparing the superpixel-based approach to the traditional rectangle+polygon-based approach using click-based annotation costs, we find that the former performs better on Cityscapes and PAS-CAL VOC datasets. Additionally, we propose a class-balanced acquisition function to enhance the performance of the superpixel-based approach, which we validate on evaluation datasets. Our findings strongly advocate for the use of superpixel-based AL in semantic segmentation and emphasize the importance of realistic annotation costs when evaluating such methods.
