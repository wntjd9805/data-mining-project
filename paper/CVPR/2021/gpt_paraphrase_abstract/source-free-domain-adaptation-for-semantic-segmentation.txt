Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) addresses the issue of CNN-based approaches for semantic segmentation relying heavily on labor-intensive pixel-level annotated data. However, current UDA methods require full access to the source datasets for reducing the gap between the source and target domains during model adaptation. This is impractical in real scenarios where source datasets are private and cannot be shared with well-trained source models. To solve this problem, we propose SFDA, a source-free domain adaptation framework for semantic segmentation. SFDA utilizes a well-trained source model and an unlabeled target domain dataset for adaptation. It transfers knowledge from the source model to preserve the source domain knowledge during model adaptation and leverages valuable information from the target domain for self-supervised learning. The framework seamlessly integrates pixel and patch-level optimization objectives tailored for semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework compared to existing UDA approaches that rely on source data.
