Vehicle re-identification (re-ID) is a crucial aspect of urban operations, management, and security, which has gained increased attention in recent years. However, two significant challenges in vehicle re-ID have been largely overlooked: 1) effectively utilizing raw data, and 2) developing a robust re-ID model in the presence of noisy data. This paper tackles these challenges by introducing a new evaluation benchmark called VVeRI-901 and demonstrating the superior performance of video-based re-ID compared to static image-based methods. Additionally, a novel learning method called Pompeiu-Hausdorff distance (PhD) is proposed for video-to-video matching. This method effectively addresses the issue of data noise caused by occlusion in videos, leading to significant improvements in re-ID performance. Extensive experiments conducted on video-based vehicle and person re-ID datasets, including VVeRI-901, MARS, and PRID2011, validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
