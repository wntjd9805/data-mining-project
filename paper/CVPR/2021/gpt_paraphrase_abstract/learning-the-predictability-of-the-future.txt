We present a framework for learning from unlabeled videos to predict future events. Instead of pre-determining which features to predict, our method learns from the data which features are predictable. We utilize the inherent hierarchical structure of hyperbolic geometry to develop a predictive model in hyperbolic space. This model predicts at different levels of the hierarchy, selecting a more concrete level when confident and a higher level of abstraction when uncertain. Our experiments on established datasets demonstrate the importance of hierarchical representations for action prediction. Remarkably, even though our representation is trained with unlabeled video, visualizations reveal the emergence of action hierarchies in the learned representation.
