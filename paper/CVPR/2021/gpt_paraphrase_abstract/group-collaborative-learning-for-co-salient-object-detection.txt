We introduce a novel collaborative learning framework called GCoNet that can detect co-salient objects in real time (16ms). This framework simultaneously mines consensus representations at the group level, using two important criteria. Firstly, it focuses on intra-group compactness to capture the shared attributes among co-salient objects and better formulate their consistency. This is achieved through a novel group affinity module. Secondly, it emphasizes inter-group separability to effectively suppress the influence of noisy objects on the output. This is accomplished by introducing a new group collaborating module that conditions the inconsistent consensus. To enhance the learning of the embedding space without additional computational overhead, we incorporate auxiliary classification supervision. We conduct extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks (CoCA, CoSOD3k, and Cosal2015), and our simple GCoNet outperforms 10 state-of-the-art models, establishing a new state-of-the-art. We also demonstrate the practical applications of our approach in content aware co-segmentation and co-localization based automatic thumbnails. The code for our framework is publicly available at https://github.com/fanq15/GCoNet.
