This study introduces a novel method for manipulating high-quality images generated by generative adversarial networks (GANs). While previous research has focused on basic attribute adjustment, our method allows for manipulation with multidimensional conditions such as keypoints and captions. We propose an algorithm that utilizes the Surrogate Gradient Field (SGF), generated by an auxiliary mapping network, to search for a new latent code that fulfills the desired condition. To evaluate the effectiveness of different manipulation methods, we introduce a metric for measuring disentanglement. Through extensive experiments on facial attribute adjustment, we demonstrate that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques in disentanglement. Moreover, we showcase the versatility of our approach by applying it to various condition modalities, showcasing its ability to modify complex image properties like keypoints and captions.
