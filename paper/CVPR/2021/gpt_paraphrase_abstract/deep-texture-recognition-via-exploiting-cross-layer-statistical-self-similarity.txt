Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become a popular tool for texture recognition. Existing CNN-based approaches focus on aggregating convolutional features to create a robust and discriminative description. This paper introduces a new feature aggregation module called CLASS (Cross-Layer Aggregation of Statistical Self-similarity) for texture recognition. The authors propose modeling the CNN feature maps across different layers as a dynamic process that carries statistical self-similarity (SSS) from the input image along the network depth dimension. The CLASS module utilizes a soft histogram of local differential box-counting dimensions of cross-layer features to characterize the cross-layer SSS. This resulting descriptor captures both the cross-layer dynamics and the local SSS of the input image, offering improved discrimination compared to the commonly used global average pooling. By incorporating CLASS into a ResNet backbone, the authors create CLASSNet, a powerful deep model for texture recognition that achieves state-of-the-art performance in experiments.
