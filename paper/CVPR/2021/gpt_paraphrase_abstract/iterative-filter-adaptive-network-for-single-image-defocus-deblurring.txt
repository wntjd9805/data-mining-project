We present a new learning-based method for effectively removing defocus blur from single images. Our approach incorporates an innovative Iterative Filter Adaptive Network (IFAN) that is specifically designed to handle spatially-varying and large defocus blur. To adaptively handle spatially-varying blur, IFAN predicts pixel-wise deblurring filters that are applied to defocused features of an input image, resulting in deblurred features. For effectively managing large blur, IFAN models deblurring filters as stacks of small-sized separable filters. The predicted separable deblurring filters are applied to defocused features using a novel Iterative Adaptive Convolution (IAC) layer. Additionally, we propose a training scheme that involves defocus disparity estimation and reblurring, significantly improving the quality of deblurring. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively on real-world images.
