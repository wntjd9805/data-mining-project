This study focuses on the importance of accurately identifying prominent motion areas in videos to effectively distinguish actions. However, labeling motion information in videos is time-consuming and requires significant human effort. To address this problem, the researchers propose a self-supervised learning method called MoSI (Motion from Static Images). MoSI learns to encode motion information by classifying pseudo motions generated from static images. Additionally, a static mask is introduced to create local motion patterns, prompting the model to identify notable motion areas for accurate classification. The researchers demonstrate that MoSI can detect regions with significant motion even without fine-tuning on specific datasets. The learned motion representations enhance the performance of tasks such as action recognition in complex scenes and motions. Extensive experiments validate the consistent and transferable improvements achieved by MoSI, and the researchers plan to release the codes soon.
