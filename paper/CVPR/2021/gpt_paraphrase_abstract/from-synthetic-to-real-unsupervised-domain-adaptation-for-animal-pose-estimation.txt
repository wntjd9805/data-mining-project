Animal pose estimation is a growing field with a major challenge being the lack of labeled data. Previous approaches have used pseudo labels generated from easily accessible domains like synthetic data, but these labels are noisy due to domain shift. To address this issue, we propose a multi-scale domain adaptation module (MDAM) to reduce the domain gap between synthetic and real data. Additionally, we introduce an online coarse-to-fine pseudo label updating strategy. This strategy involves a self-distillation module in an inner coarse-update loop and a mean-teacher in an outer fine-update loop, gradually replacing old pseudo labels with new ones to prevent overfitting. Our approach outperforms existing methods on the TigDog and VisDA 2019 datasets, showcasing its effectiveness. Furthermore, our model demonstrates strong generalization ability on both unseen domains and unseen animal categories. The code for our approach is available on our project website.
