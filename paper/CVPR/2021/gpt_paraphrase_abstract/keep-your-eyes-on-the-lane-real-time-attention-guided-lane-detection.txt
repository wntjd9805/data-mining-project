Lane detection methods have made significant progress in handling complex real-world scenarios. However, many of these methods struggle with maintaining real-time efficiency, which is crucial for autonomous vehicles. To address this issue, we propose LaneATT, a deep lane detection model that utilizes anchors for feature pooling, similar to other object detection models. We argue that since lanes exhibit a regular pattern and are highly correlated, global information can play a crucial role in inferring their positions, particularly in challenging conditions like occlusion and missing lane markers. To incorporate this global information, we introduce a novel anchor-based attention mechanism. We extensively evaluate our model on three widely used datasets and demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving both higher efficacy and efficiency. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study and discuss efficiency trade-off options that are practical for real-world implementation. The code and models for LaneATT are available at https://github.com/lucastabelini/LaneATT.
