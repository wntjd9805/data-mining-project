Unsupervised image clustering methods often use alternative objectives to indirectly train the model, which can lead to inaccurate predictions and overly confident results. To address these challenges, this study introduces a novel model called RUC, inspired by robust learning. RUC utilizes pseudo-labels from existing image clustering models as a noisy dataset, which may contain misclassified samples. Through a retraining process, RUC can correct misaligned knowledge and reduce overconfidence in predictions. The flexible structure of RUC allows it to be used as an add-on module to enhance the performance of other clustering methods across multiple datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed model improves model confidence calibration and exhibits increased robustness against adversarial noise.
