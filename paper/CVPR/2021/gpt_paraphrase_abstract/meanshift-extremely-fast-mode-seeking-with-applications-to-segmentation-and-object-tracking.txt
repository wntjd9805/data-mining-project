MeanShift is a widely used mode-seeking clustering algorithm in machine learning. However, it is known to be slow due to its quadratic runtime per iteration. To address this issue, we propose MeanShift++, a faster algorithm that utilizes a grid-based approach. MeanShift++ replaces the computationally expensive neighbor search with a density-weighted mean of adjacent grid cells, significantly speeding up the mean shift step. We also demonstrate that this grid-based technique for density estimation comes with theoretical guarantees. The runtime of MeanShift++ is linear in the number of points and exponential in dimension, making it particularly suitable for low-dimensional applications like image segmentation and object tracking. Through extensive experimental analysis, we show that MeanShift++ can be more than 10,000 times faster than MeanShift while achieving competitive clustering results on benchmark datasets and nearly identical image segmentations. We also present promising results for object tracking. MeanShift performs a gradient ascent on the kernel density estimate of the examples, serving both mode-seeking and clustering purposes. It is attractive because it is non-parametric and does not require assumptions on the data or the setting of a hyperparameter for the number of clusters. However, its main drawback is its computational complexity, with each iteration requiring O(n^2pq) computations.
