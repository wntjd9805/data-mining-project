Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is a major challenge in deploying machine learning models safely in real-world scenarios. Current solutions are limited by small datasets with low resolution and few class labels, such as CIFAR. This has resulted in a lack of exploration in OOD detection for large-scale image classification tasks. To address this gap, we propose a group-based OOD detection framework and introduce a novel scoring function called MOS. Our approach involves breaking down the large semantic space into smaller groups with similar concepts, which simplifies the decision boundaries between in-distribution and out-of-distribution data for effective OOD detection. Compared to previous methods, our approach scales better for high-dimensional class spaces. We evaluate our models trained on ImageNet using four carefully curated OOD datasets that cover diverse semantics. Our MOS method achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing the average false positive rate by 14.33% while also achieving a 6x speedup in inference compared to the previous best method.
