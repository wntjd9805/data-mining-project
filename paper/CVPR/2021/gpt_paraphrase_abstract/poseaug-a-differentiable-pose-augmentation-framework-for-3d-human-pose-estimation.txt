We present PoseAug, a new auto-augmentation framework that aims to improve the generalization performance of 3D human pose estimators to new datasets. Existing estimators struggle with generalization due to limited diversity in the training data. PoseAug addresses this problem by introducing a novel pose augmentor that adjusts various geometry factors of a pose, such as posture, body size, view point, and position, through differentiable operations. This augmentor is optimized alongside the 3D pose estimator and generates more diverse and challenging poses based on estimation error feedback. Additionally, PoseAug utilizes a part-aware Kinematic Chain Space to evaluate local joint-angle plausibility and includes a discriminative module to ensure the plausibility of the augmented poses. These designs allow PoseAug to generate more diverse yet plausible poses compared to existing offline augmentation methods, resulting in improved generalization of the pose estimator. PoseAug is a versatile framework that can be applied to various 3D pose estimators. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness on both intra-scenario and cross-scenario datasets. Notably, PoseAug achieves an 88.6% 3D PCK on MPI-INF-3DHP under cross-dataset evaluation, outperforming previous data augmentation methods by 9.1%.
