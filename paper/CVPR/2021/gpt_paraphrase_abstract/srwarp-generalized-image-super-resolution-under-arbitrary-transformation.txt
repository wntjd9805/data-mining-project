Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successful in image processing tasks, such as single image super-resolution (SR). However, existing methods rely on predetermined integer scaling factors, making them unsuitable for arbitrary target resolutions. Recent approaches have addressed this limitation by considering real-valued upsampling factors with varying aspect ratios. In this paper, we introduce the SRWarp framework, which extends the SR tasks to arbitrary image transformations. We view the traditional image warping task, particularly when the input is enlarged, as a spatially-varying SR problem. To achieve visually pleasing results in the transformation process, we propose novel formulations, including the adaptive warping layer and multiscale blending. Unlike previous methods, our approach does not restrict the SR model to a regular grid, allowing for flexible and diverse image editing. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies, we demonstrate the necessity and advantages of our SRWarp method under various transformations.
