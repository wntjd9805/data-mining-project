This paper addresses the problem of few-shot open-set recognition (FSOSR), which combines few-shot learning (FSL) and open-set recognition (OSR). FSOSR aims to adapt a model to a small labeled sample set while rejecting unseen class samples. Existing methods for OSR and FSL have poor performance in solving FSOSR problems. Previous FSOSR methods rely on pseudo-unseen class samples, collected from other datasets or synthesized, which limits their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose a novel unknown class sample detector called SnaTCHer that does not rely on pseudo-unseen samples. Our method measures the difference between transformed prototypes and a modified prototype set using transformation consistency. By rejecting samples with large differences to the transformed prototypes, SnaTCHer solves the unseen class distribution estimation problem without the need for pseudo-unseen class samples. We evaluate SnaTCHer with different prototype transformation methods and consistently observe improved unseen class sample detection performance without reducing closed-set classification.
