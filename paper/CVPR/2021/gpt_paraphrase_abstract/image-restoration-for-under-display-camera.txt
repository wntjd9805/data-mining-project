This paper focuses on the emerging trend of full-screen devices and the challenges it poses in terms of positioning a camera behind the screen. While this design choice improves the display-to-body ratio and enhances eye contact in video chats, it also leads to image degradation. The authors analyze the optical systems of a 4k Transparent OLED (T-OLED) and a phone Pentile OLED (P-OLED) to understand the degradation process. They then propose a Monitor-Camera Imaging System (MCIS) for data acquisition and a model-based data synthesis pipeline to generate Point Spread Function (PSF) and Under-Display Camera (UDC) data. The authors address the issue of image degradation by employing a deconvolution-based pipeline and learning-based methods. The proposed model achieves high-quality real-time restoration. The findings of this study highlight the potential research opportunities and directions in the field of Under-Display Cameras (UDC).
