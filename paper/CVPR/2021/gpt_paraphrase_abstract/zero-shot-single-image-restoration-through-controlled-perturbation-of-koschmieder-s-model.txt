This paper presents a novel approach to restoring real-world degraded images using a zero-shot single image restoration model. Traditional deep learning methods for image restoration struggle due to the lack of paired real-world data and issues with synthetic paired data. The proposed model overcomes these challenges by leveraging the Koschmieder's model to estimate the degradation parameters of the input image and perform restoration. The key insight is that a suitable degradation of the input image corresponds to a controlled perturbation of the Koschmieder's model. The zero-shot network is optimized by maintaining the relation between the estimated model parameters before and after the perturbation, along with the use of no-reference losses. The proposed framework is applied to dehazing, underwater image restoration, and low-light image enhancement, outperforming state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and subjectively on various real-world image datasets.
