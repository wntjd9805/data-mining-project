Recent advancements in object detection have focused on assigning labels to positive and negative training samples for each ground-truth (gt) object independently. However, this paper takes a novel approach by considering label assignment from a global perspective. The authors propose formulating the assignment procedure as an Optimal Transport (OT) problem, which is a well-studied topic in Optimization Theory. They determine the unit transportation cost between each anchor and gt pair by considering the weighted sum of their classification and regression losses. By formulating the problem in this way, finding the best assignment solution becomes equivalent to solving the optimal transport plan with minimal transportation costs. The authors propose using the Sinkhorn-Knopp Iteration method to solve this problem. The authors evaluate their proposed approach, called Optimal Transport Assignment (OTA), using a single FCOS-ResNet-50 detector on the COCO dataset. They find that OTA achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 40.7% under a 1Ã— scheduler, outperforming all other existing label assignment methods. They also conduct extensive experiments on both COCO and CrowdHuman datasets to further validate the effectiveness of OTA, particularly in crowd scenarios. The code for OTA is made publicly available on GitHub.In summary, this paper introduces a new approach to label assignment in object detection by formulating it as an Optimal Transport problem. The proposed OTA method achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, as demonstrated through experiments on COCO and CrowdHuman datasets. The code for OTA is publicly available for further exploration and use.
