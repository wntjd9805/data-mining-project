Current subspace clustering methods are limited in their ability to handle out-of-sample data and large-scale datasets. In this paper, we introduce a new framework called Self-Expressive Network (SENet) that utilizes a neural network to learn a self-expressive representation of the data. SENet can accurately learn self-expressive coefficients on the training data and effectively handle out-of-sample data. Additionally, SENet demonstrates superior performance on various benchmark datasets, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, Extended MNIST, and CIFAR-10. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
