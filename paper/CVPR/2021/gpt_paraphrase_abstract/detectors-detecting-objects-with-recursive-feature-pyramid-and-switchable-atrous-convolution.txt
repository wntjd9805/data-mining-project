This paper explores the use of the "looking and thinking twice" mechanism in the design of object detection models. The authors propose two approaches to incorporate this mechanism: Recursive Feature Pyramid and Switchable Atrous Convolution. Recursive Feature Pyramid involves adding extra feedback connections from Feature Pyramid Networks to the backbone layers, while Switchable Atrous Convolution convolves features with different atrous rates using switch functions. The combination of these approaches leads to a new model called DetectoRS, which significantly improves object detection performance. On the COCO test-dev dataset, DetectoRS achieves state-of-the-art results with 55.7% box AP for object detection, 48.5% mask AP for instance segmentation, and 50.0% PQ for panoptic segmentation. The code for DetectoRS is publicly available.
