We have developed an Invertible Image Signal Processing (InvISP) pipeline to address the challenge of accessing and working with unprocessed RAW data, which is an important format for image editing and computer vision. Currently, most users only have access to processed and compressed sRGB images due to the large file size of RAW data. Our pipeline not only enables the generation of visually appealing sRGB images but also allows for the recovery of nearly perfect RAW data. This is achieved through the inherent reversibility of our framework, eliminating the need for synthesizing RAW data from sRGB images and avoiding any memory overhead. Additionally, we have integrated a differentiable JPEG compression simulator into our framework, enabling the reconstruction of RAW data from JPEG images. We have conducted extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments on two DSLR cameras, and the results demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher quality in both rendered sRGB images and reconstructed RAW data compared to alternative methods.
