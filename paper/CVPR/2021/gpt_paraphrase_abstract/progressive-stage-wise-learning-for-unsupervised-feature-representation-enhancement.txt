Unsupervised learning methods have gained competitiveness against supervised training. However, unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning offers more freedom in designing objectives. This study introduces the Progressive Stage-wise Learning (PSL) framework to explore new dimensions of unsupervised learning. The PSL framework involves designing multi-level tasks and defining different learning stages for deep networks. Early stages focus on low-level tasks, while late stages extract deeper information through harder tasks. Through progressive stage-wise learning, unsupervised feature representation is effectively enhanced. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PSL consistently improves results for leading unsupervised learning methods.
