We propose D-RISE, a method for generating visual explanations for object detectors' predictions. Our method utilizes a similarity metric that considers both localization and categorization aspects of object detection. This allows D-RISE to generate saliency maps highlighting image areas that have the most impact on the prediction. D-RISE can be considered a "black-box" approach in the software testing sense, as it only requires access to the inputs and outputs of an object detector. Unlike gradient-based methods, D-RISE is more versatile and independent of the specific type of object detector being tested. It does not require knowledge of the inner workings of the model. We demonstrate that D-RISE can easily be applied to various object detectors, including YOLOv3 and Faster-RCNN. Our analysis of the generated visual explanations provides insights into the utilization of context and potential biases learned by object detectors.
