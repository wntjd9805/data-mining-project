This study focuses on removing reflections from panoramic images in order to reduce the ambiguity between reflection and transmission scenes. Although a portion of the reflection scene is present in the panoramic image, it cannot be directly utilized due to misalignment with the reflection-contaminated image. To address this issue, a two-step approach is proposed. Firstly, a coarse-to-fine strategy is employed to align the geometric and photometric aspects of the reflection scene. Then, a recovery network is used to restore the transmission scene. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through training with a synthetic dataset and quantitative verification using a real panoramic image dataset. The results show significant improvement compared to single image-based reflection removal methods, and the method also demonstrates generalization capabilities for limited field-of-view scenarios captured by conventional cameras or mobile phones.
