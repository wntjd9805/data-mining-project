Camouflaged object segmentation (COS) is the process of identifying objects that blend seamlessly into their surroundings. This presents a challenge as there are often similarities between the objects and the background noise. In this study, we propose a bio-inspired framework called Positioning and Focus Network (PFNet) that imitates the predatory process found in nature. The PFNet consists of two main modules: the positioning module (PM) and the focus module (FM). The PM detects potential target objects from a global perspective, while the FM refines the initial predictions by focusing on ambiguous regions. In the FM, we introduce a novel distraction mining strategy to discover and remove distractions, which improves estimation performance. Our experiments show that the PFNet operates in real-time and outperforms 18 state-of-the-art models on three challenging datasets using four standard metrics.
