We present a semi-supervised method for contemporary object detection based on the teacher-student dual model framework. Our approach includes several key features. Firstly, we utilize an exponential moving averaging strategy to update the teacher model based on the student's performance in real-time. Secondly, we employ a large number of region proposals and soft pseudo-labels as training targets for the student model. Lastly, we introduce a lightweight detection-specific data ensemble to enhance the reliability of the pseudo-labels generated by the teacher model.In comparison to the recent state-of-the-art technique called STAC, which relies on hard labels for sparsely selected hard pseudo samples, our model provides the student model with more informative soft-labels from numerous proposals. When using VOC12 as unlabeled data, our model achieves a COCO-style average precision (AP) of 53.04% on the VOC07 validation set, surpassing STAC by 8.4%. On the MS-COCO dataset, our model outperforms prior work when only a small portion of the data is labeled. Furthermore, it achieves an AP of 53.8% on the MS-COCO test-dev set, achieving a 3.1% improvement over the fully supervised ResNet-152 Cascaded R-CNN, by leveraging unlabeled data of a similar size to the labeled data.
