Recent research suggests that generative adversarial networks (GANs) can overcome the limitations of traditional lossy image compression methods, particularly when it comes to preserving textures. By combining GANs with learned image compression, it is possible to relax the strict measures of distortion commonly used in compression algorithms. However, convolutional neural network-based algorithms used in GANs can be computationally intensive. To address this, we propose using learned image coding as a surrogate to optimize images for encoding. By applying a learned filter and incorporating a GAN, we can replace textures in an image with less costly alternatives while still preserving detail. Our approach allows for a conventional codec to be remodeled to optimize for MS-SSIM distortion, resulting in a 20% improvement in compression rate without any decoding overhead. In terms of task-aware image compression, our approach performs favorably compared to a similar but codec-specific method.
