Heatmap regression is commonly used in human pose estimation methods, where ground-truth heatmaps are created by overlaying 2D gaussian kernels on skeletal keypoints. However, this approach may not be suitable for bottom-up methods that deal with varying human scales and labeling ambiguities. To address these challenges, we propose the scale-adaptive heatmap regression (SAHR) method, which allows for adaptive adjustment of the standard deviation for each keypoint. This makes SAHR more versatile in handling different human scales and labeling uncertainties. However, SAHR may create an imbalance between fore-background samples, which can hinder its effectiveness. To address this, we introduce the weight-adaptive heatmap regression (WAHR) to balance the fore-background samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the combination of SAHR and WAHR significantly improves the accuracy of bottom-up human pose estimation. In fact, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art model by +1.5AP and achieves a 72.0AP on COCO test-dev2017, which is comparable to the performance of most top-down methods.
