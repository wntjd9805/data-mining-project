Recently, there has been growing interest in utilizing unlabeled data for training face recognition models. However, most existing methods do not consider the use of unlabeled shallow data in real-world scenarios. Current semi-supervised face recognition approaches that focus on generating pseudo labels or minimizing softmax classification probabilities of unlabeled data do not perform well with unlabeled shallow data. Thus, effectively leveraging unlabeled shallow face data to improve face recognition performance remains a challenge. This paper introduces a novel face recognition method called VirFace, which effectively exploits unlabeled shallow data. VirFace consists of two components: VirClass and VirInstance. VirClass increases the distance between classes by incorporating unlabeled data as new identities, while VirInstance generates virtual instances from the learned distribution of each identity to further increase inter-class distance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to address the problem of unlabeled shallow face data. Extensive experiments on small- and large-scale datasets, such as LFW and IJB-C, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.
