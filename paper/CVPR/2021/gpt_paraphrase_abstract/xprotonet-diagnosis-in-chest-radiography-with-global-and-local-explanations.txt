Automated diagnosis in chest radiography using deep neural networks is beneficial for radiologists in detecting serious diseases. However, current methods lack accurate explanations, which undermines the reliability of the diagnostic process. To address this issue, we propose XProtoNet, a diagnostic framework for chest radiography that is both globally and locally interpretable. XProtoNet learns representative patterns, or prototypes, of each disease from X-ray images and utilizes them to diagnose new images. It predicts the region where a disease is likely to be present and compares the image features in that region with the prototypes. This framework provides both a global explanation, by presenting the prototype, and a local explanation, by demonstrating how the prototype contributes to the diagnosis of an individual image. Despite the emphasis on interpretability, XProtoNet achieves state-of-the-art classification performance on the widely-used NIH chest X-ray dataset.
