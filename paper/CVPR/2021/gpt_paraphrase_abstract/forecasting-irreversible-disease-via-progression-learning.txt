Parapapillary atrophy (PPA) is a symptom associated with irreversible eye diseases and can be used as an indicator for early intervention. This study aims to utilize historical data, such as retinal images, to predict future disease progression. The proposed framework, called Disease Forecast via Progression Learning (DFPL), takes into account the irreversibility of the disease. DFPL decomposes the prediction factors into the current disease label based on present data and the future disease label based on the progression of retinal images. To model these factors, the framework incorporates current and progression predictors. A temporal generative model is introduced to accurately generate future images and compare them with the current images to obtain a residual image. This generative model utilizes a recurrent neural network to take advantage of the historical data. The approach is tested on an in-house PPA dataset and shows significant improvements in accuracy and AUC compared to other methods. Additionally, the generative model is able to accurately identify disease-related regions.
