Portrait photo retouching (PPR) is a specialized task that aims to improve the visual quality of flat-looking portrait photos. It has unique requirements such as prioritizing human regions and ensuring consistency among a group of photos. Existing models trained on general photo retouching datasets do not meet these requirements. To address this, we have created a new dataset called PPR10K, which contains 1,681 groups and 11,161 high-quality raw portrait photos. The dataset also includes high-resolution segmentation masks for human regions. Each photo in the dataset has been retouched by three experts, who have adjusted the tones to ensure consistency within each group. We have defined objective measures to evaluate the performance of PPR and proposed strategies to train models that excel in prioritizing human regions and achieving group-level consistency. The PPR10K dataset serves as a benchmark for automatic PPR methods, and our experiments show that the proposed learning strategies effectively improve the retouching performance.
