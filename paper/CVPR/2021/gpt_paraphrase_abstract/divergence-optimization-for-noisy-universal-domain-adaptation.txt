The concept of universal domain adaptation (UniDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a label-scarce target domain, regardless of any constraints on the label sets. However, in practical applications, it is challenging to obtain a large amount of perfectly clean labeled data in the source domain due to limited resources. Existing UniDA methods heavily rely on accurately annotated source samples, which greatly restricts their real-world applicability. To address this limitation, we introduce a new realistic scenario called Noisy UniDA. In Noisy UniDA, classifiers are trained using noisy labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data with an unknown class distribution from the target domain. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-head convolutional neural network framework. Our network comprises a shared feature generator and two classifiers with distinct decision boundaries. By optimizing the discrepancy between the outputs of the two classifiers, we are able to identify noisy source samples, discover "unknown" classes in the target domain, and align the distributions of the source and target domains. Through an extensive evaluation across various domain adaptation scenarios, our proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in most settings.
