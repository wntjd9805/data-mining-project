As the amount of visual content captured daily continues to increase, the use of lossy compression methods becomes necessary to save storage space and transmission bandwidth. Despite efforts to improve compression techniques, every method inevitably discards information. This discarded information often includes semantically meaningful visual cues, particularly at low bit rates, resulting in significant ambiguity during decompression. However, existing decompression algorithms typically generate only a single output and do not allow users to explore the range of images that could have been compressed. In this study, we propose a novel image decompression method that enables users to explore the diverse set of natural images that could have been compressed. This allows users to determine what elements may or may not have been present in the original scene. Our approach involves developing a deep-network based decoder architecture for the widely used JPEG standard. This decoder architecture allows users to traverse the set of decompressed images that are consistent with the compressed JPEG file. To enhance user interaction, we have created a graphical user interface that includes intuitive exploration tools, including an automatic tool for examining specific solutions of interest. We have applied our framework to various use cases, including graphical, medical, and forensic applications, demonstrating its wide range of potential applications.
