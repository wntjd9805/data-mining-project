We address the challenging problem of blind denoising for Poisson-Gaussian noise, where no additional information about clean images or noise level parameters is available. Existing methods have shown unsatisfactory performance when trained on only single noisy images. However, the blind pixelwise affine image denoiser (BP-AIDE) has recently improved performance in this scenario, competing with denoisers that use additional information. However, BP-AIDE suffers from slow inference time due to inefficient noise level estimation and the blind-spot network (BSN) architecture. To address these issues, we propose the Fast Blind Image Denoiser (FBI-Denoiser) for Poisson-Gaussian noise. FBI-Denoiser consists of two neural network models: 1) PGE-Net, which estimates noise parameters 2000 times faster than conventional methods, and 2) FBI-Net, which implements a more efficient BSN for pixelwise affine denoising in terms of parameters and inference speed. We demonstrate that FBI-Denoiser, trained solely on single noisy images, achieves state-of-the-art performance on various real-world noisy image benchmark datasets with significantly faster inference time (Ã—10) compared to BP-AIDE.
