This paper presents a new concept called dynamic range, which is derived from real-world metric tools and applied to deep visual recognition. The dynamic range refers to the flexibility of a metric tool to accommodate different scales. In visual recognition, there is a problem of multiple scales, where different visual concepts have varying semantic scales. For instance, "Animal" and "Plants" have a larger semantic scale compared to "Elk." Under a small semantic scale, two different elks may appear very different, but under a larger semantic scale, they should be considered similar. By incorporating the dynamic range into deep metric learning, a new task called Dynamic Metric Learning is introduced. The goal of this task is to learn a metric space that can handle visual concepts across multiple semantic scales. Three datasets, consisting of vehicle, animal, and online product images, are constructed for Dynamic Metric Learning. These datasets are benchmarked against popular deep metric learning methods, and it is found that Dynamic Metric Learning is highly challenging. The main difficulty arises from the conflict between different scales, where the discriminative ability under a small scale compromises the discriminative ability under a large scale, and vice versa. As a minor contribution, a technique called Cross-Scale Learning (CSL) is proposed to alleviate this conflict. Experimental results show that CSL consistently improves the baseline performance on all three datasets. The datasets and code for this research will be made publicly available at a specific GitHub repository.
