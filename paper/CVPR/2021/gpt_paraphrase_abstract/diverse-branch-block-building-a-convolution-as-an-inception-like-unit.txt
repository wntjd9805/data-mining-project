We present the Di-verse Branch Block (DBB), a universal building block for Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) that enhances performance without adding inference-time costs. The DBB combines diverse branches of different scales and complexities to enrich the feature space, including sequences of convolutions, multi-scale convolutions, and average pooling. After training, the DBB can be converted into a single conv layer for deployment. Unlike novel ConvNet architectures, the DBB maintains the macro architecture while complicating the training-time microstructure, making it a drop-in replacement for regular conv layers in any architecture. This allows the model to be trained to achieve higher performance and then transformed back into the original inference-time structure. The DBB improves ConvNets in image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, with up to 1.9% higher top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. The PyTorch code and models for DBB are available at https://github.com/DingXiaoH/DiverseBranchBlock.
