The detection of manipulated digital faces has become a significant concern due to the potential harm it can cause to the public. Despite recent advancements in reducing forgery signals, the use of decomposition techniques has emerged as a promising approach to uncover hidden manipulation details. In this study, we approach face image decomposition from a computer graphics perspective, considering it as a combination of underlying 3D geometry and lighting environment. By disentangling the face image into its constituent elements, such as 3D shape, common texture, identity texture, ambient light, and direct light, we identify that the direct light and identity texture hold crucial information regarding forgery. Based on this insight, we propose using facial detail, which encompasses direct light and identity texture, as a clue to detect subtle forgery patterns. Additionally, we introduce a supervised attention mechanism to highlight manipulated regions and a two-stream structure to exploit both the face image and facial detail for a multi-modality approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the extracted features from facial detail, resulting in state-of-the-art performance.
