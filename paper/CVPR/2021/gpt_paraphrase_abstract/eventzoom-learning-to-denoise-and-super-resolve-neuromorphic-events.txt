We present a solution to the problem of denoising and enhancing the resolution of neuromorphic events, a unique visual signal that represents temporal gradients in a specific space-time window. These events are generated asynchronously and only carry binary signs indicating temporal variations. To investigate how these events are formed and degraded, we develop a display-camera system that allows for multi-resolution event recording. We introduce Event-Zoom, a deep neural network architecture based on 3D U-Net, which is trained in a noise-to-noise manner to restore noise-free events. To improve resolution, Event-Zoom includes an event-to-image module supervised by high resolution images. Our experiments demonstrate that Event-Zoom achieves a temporal efficiency of at least 40 times compared to state-of-the-art event denoisers. Furthermore, Event-Zoom enhances performance in event-based visual object tracking and image reconstruction tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art super resolution image reconstruction results while being 10 times faster.
