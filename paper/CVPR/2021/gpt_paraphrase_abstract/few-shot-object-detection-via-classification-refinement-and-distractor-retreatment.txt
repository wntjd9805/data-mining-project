In this study, we address the challenging problem of Few-Shot Object Detection (FSOD), where the model encounters data-scarce categories during training. We investigate the failure modes of Faster-RCNN in FSOD and find that the decrease in performance is primarily caused by false positives resulting from category confusion in classification. This realization motivates us to approach FSOD from a new perspective focused on classification refinement. To overcome the inherent limitations, we propose architectural enhancements and hard-example mining techniques. We introduce a novel few-shot classification refinement mechanism that utilizes a decoupled Few-Shot Classification Network (FSCN) to improve the final classification of a base detector. Additionally, we address the issue of distractor samples in FSOD, which are unlabelled objects in the base set due to incomplete annotations. We develop treatment solutions to eliminate false positives caused by distractor samples. For FSCN training, we formulate the distractor as a semi-supervised problem and propose a distractor utilization loss to effectively utilize it for boosting data-scarce classes. We also develop a confidence-guided dataset pruning (CGDP) technique to facilitate the few-shot adaptation of the base detector. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSOD on popular datasets such as Pascal VOC and MS-COCO.
