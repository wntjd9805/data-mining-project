This study aims to address bias in face recognition by developing a fair face representation that equally represents faces from all demographic groups. The proposed approach involves using adaptive convolution kernels and attention mechanisms based on demographic attributes to mitigate bias. An adaptive module is introduced, which includes kernel masks and attention maps for each demographic group to activate different facial regions for identification. This leads to more discriminative features relevant to the demographics of the individuals. An automated adaptation strategy is also introduced to determine whether adaptation should be applied to a certain layer by calculating the dissimilarity among demographic-adaptive parameters. Additionally, a debiasing loss function is proposed to reduce the gap in average intra-class distance between demographic groups. Experimental results on face benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively mitigates bias in face recognition across demographic groups while maintaining competitive accuracy.
