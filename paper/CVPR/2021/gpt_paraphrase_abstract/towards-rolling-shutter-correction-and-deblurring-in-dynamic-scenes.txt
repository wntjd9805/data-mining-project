The first dataset and code for joint rolling shutter correction and deblurring (RSCD) techniques are made available at https://github.com/zzh-tech/RSCDâˆ—. While current approaches for RSCD are based on conventional energy optimization and designed for static scenes, this research aims to enable learning-based approaches for real-world RSCD problems. To achieve this, the authors present the BS-RSCD dataset, which includes ego-motion and object-motion in dynamic scenes. Real distorted and blurry videos, along with corresponding ground truth, are recorded simultaneously using a beam-splitter-based acquisition system.Applying existing individual rolling shutter correction (RSC) or global shutter deblurring (GSD) methods directly on RSCD leads to unsatisfactory results due to flaws in the network architecture. To address this, the authors propose the first learning-based model for RSCD called JCD. The key idea behind JCD is the use of bi-directional warping streams for displacement compensation, while also preserving a non-warped deblurring stream for restoring details. Experimental results show that JCD achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the realistic BS-RSCD dataset and the synthetic Fastec-RS dataset.
