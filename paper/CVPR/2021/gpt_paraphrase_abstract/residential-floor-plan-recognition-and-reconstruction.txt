A framework is introduced for recognizing and reconstructing residential floor plan drawings. This framework accurately identifies the structure, type, and size of rooms, and generates vectorized 3D reconstruction results. Deep segmentation and detection neural networks are used to extract room structural information, while key points detection network and cluster analysis are employed to determine room scales. Room information is vectorized through an iterative optimization-based method. Compared to existing methods, this system shows improved accuracy and generalization ability. It outperforms other systems in floor plan segmentation and vectorization, particularly in detecting inclined walls.
