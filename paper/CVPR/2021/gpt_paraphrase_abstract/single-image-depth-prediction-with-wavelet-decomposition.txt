We introduce a new approach to accurately predict depths from single images using a wavelet decomposition technique. This method is highly efficient and achieves optimal efficiency by incorporating wavelet decomposition into a fully differentiable encoder-decoder architecture. Our method demonstrates the ability to reconstruct depth maps with high fidelity by predicting sparse wavelet coefficients. Unlike previous methods, we show that it is possible to learn wavelet coefficients without direct supervision on the coefficients themselves. Instead, we only supervise the final reconstructed depth image obtained through the inverse wavelet transform. Furthermore, we demonstrate that wavelet coefficients can be learned in fully self-supervised scenarios, without relying on ground-truth depth information. We also apply our approach to various state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation models and consistently achieve similar or improved results compared to the original models, while requiring less than half the computational complexity in the decoder network.
