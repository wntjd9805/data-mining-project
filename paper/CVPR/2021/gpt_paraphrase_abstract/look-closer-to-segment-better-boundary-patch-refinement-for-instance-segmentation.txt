Efforts to improve instance segmentation have been made, but the quality of the predicted instance masks is still not satisfactory. This is mainly due to imprecise boundaries caused by low spatial resolution and the imbalance of boundary pixels. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective post-processing refinement framework called BPR. The BPR framework focuses on improving the boundary quality by extracting and refining small boundary patches along the predicted instance boundaries. This refinement is achieved through a boundary patch refinement network at a higher resolution. Our BPR framework shows significant improvements over the Mask R-CNN baseline, particularly in boundary-aware metrics, as demonstrated on the Cityscapes benchmark. By applying the BPR framework to the "PolyTransform + SegFix" baseline, we achieved 1st place on the Cityscapes leaderboard. The code for BPR is available at https://github.com/tinyalpha/BPR.
