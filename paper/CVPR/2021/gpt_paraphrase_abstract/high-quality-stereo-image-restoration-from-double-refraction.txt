A new method is proposed for restoring stereo images from double refraction, addressing the issue of severe restoration artifacts in existing methods. The method involves creating a dataset to simulate double refraction and formulating a joint stereo restoration problem. A model is trained using this dataset to restore high-quality stereo images in real-time. The method also allows for estimating dense depth maps from stereo images. Experimental and synthetic evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms existing methods with high accuracy. The method is demonstrated in various image-editing applications.
