We introduce a deep neural network called LayoutGMN that uses Graph Matching Networks (GMN) to predict the similarity between 2D layouts. Our network learns the layout metric by employing neural graph matching within a triplet network framework. To train our network, we utilize weak labels obtained through pixel-wise Intersection-over-Union (IoU) to define the triplet loss. Notably, LayoutGMN incorporates a structural bias to compensate for the lack of structure awareness in IoUs. We evaluate the performance of LayoutGMN on two types of layouts, namely floorplans and UI designs, through retrieval experiments on large-scale datasets. Our network's retrieval results exhibit higher correspondence with human judgement of structural layout similarity compared to IoUs and other baselines, including a graph neural network and image convolution-based state-of-the-art method. Furthermore, LayoutGMN is the first deep model that offers both metric learning of structural layout similarity and structural matching between layout elements.
