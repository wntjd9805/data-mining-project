We present a novel deep generative network called DECOR-GAN for enhancing the geometric details of 3D shapes. Our approach tackles the challenge of generating diverse and high-resolution 3D geometry from a limited number of exemplars by considering it as a problem of transferring geometric details. Our network takes a low-resolution voxel shape as input and employs voxel upsampling to refine it into a higher-resolution shape with enhanced geometric details. The resulting shape retains the overall structure of the input while incorporating detailed features based on an input "style code" that represents a specific exemplar. DECOR-GAN consists of a 3D CNN generator responsible for upsampling the coarse voxels and a 3D PatchGAN discriminator that ensures the generated model's local patches resemble those found in the training detailed shapes. During testing, the generator is conditioned on a style code to guide the refinement process. Our method demonstrates the ability to generate various detailed shapes with different styles while preserving content, plausibility, and diversity. We conducted extensive ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of our network designs. The code for our approach is available at https://github.com/czq142857/DECOR-GAN.
