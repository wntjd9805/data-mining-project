The recent advancements in instance segmentation methods, such as Mask R-CNN, have demonstrated impressive performance. However, the quality of segmented masks is still limited due to downsampling operations in both the feature pyramid and instance-wise pooling processes, particularly for larger objects. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called ReﬁneMask for achieving high-quality instance segmentation of objects and scenes. Our method incorporates fine-grained features in a multi-stage manner during the instance-wise segmenting process. By progressively integrating more detailed information at each stage, ReﬁneMask consistently refines high-quality masks. Notably, ReﬁneMask excels in segmenting challenging cases, including bent parts of objects that are often over-smoothed by previous methods, resulting in accurate boundaries. Furthermore, ReﬁneMask achieves significant improvements of 2.6, 3.4, and 3.8 average precision (AP) over Mask R-CNN on the COCO, LVIS, and Cityscapes benchmarks, respectively, with only a slight increase in computational cost. Impressively, our single-model performance surpasses the winner of the LVIS Challenge 2020 by 1.3 points on the LVIS test-dev set, establishing a new state-of-the-art. The code for ReﬁneMask will be available at https://github.com/zhanggang001/ReﬁneMask.
