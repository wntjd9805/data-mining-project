Generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL) is a task that involves recognizing objects from both seen and unseen classes, using only labeled examples from the seen classes. Previous methods have attempted to address the data-imbalance problem in GZSL by generating missing visual features for unseen classes. However, the original visual feature space is not optimal for GZSL classification due to a lack of discriminative information. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid GZSL framework that combines a generation model with an embedding model.In our hybrid GZSL approach, both real and synthetic samples generated by the generation model are mapped into an embedding space, where the final GZSL classification is performed. We introduce a contrastive embedding (CE) for our hybrid GZSL framework, which leverages both class-wise and instance-wise supervision. Existing GZSL research often neglects instance-wise supervision, but our proposed CE can effectively utilize it.We evaluate our hybrid GZSL framework with contrastive embedding, named CE-GZSL, on five benchmark datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by a significant margin on three of the datasets. We have made our codes available on GitHub for further reference and use.
