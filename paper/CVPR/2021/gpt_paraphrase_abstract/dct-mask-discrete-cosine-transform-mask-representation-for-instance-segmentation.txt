Binary grid mask representation is commonly used in instance segmentation, with MaskR-CNN being a popular example. However, using a low-resolution grid fails to capture details, while a high-resolution grid increases training complexity. To address this, we propose a new approach called DCT-Mask, which applies discrete cosine transform (DCT) to encode high-resolution binary grid masks into compact vectors. DCT-Mask can be easily integrated into existing pixel-based instance segmentation methods without requiring pre-processing or pre-training, and it has minimal impact on running speed. Our method achieves significant improvements across different frameworks, backbones, datasets, and training schedules, particularly for higher-quality annotations and complex backbones. We also analyze the performance of our method based on mask representation quality and find that DCT-Mask works well due to its ability to obtain high-quality representations with low complexity.
