Predicting the paths of humans is crucial for autonomous platforms like social robots and self-driving cars. Most existing studies on human path prediction focus on static scene information and do not utilize dynamic visual information. This paper introduces a model called Introvert, which predicts human paths by considering the observed trajectory and the dynamic scene context using a conditional 3D visual attention mechanism. Introvert can infer both environmental constraints and social interactions solely by observing the dynamic scene, without needing to communicate with other humans. This makes its computational cost independent of crowd density. Furthermore, Introvert uses the observed trajectory of the target human to extract and focus on relevant spatio-temporal primitives, enhancing its ability to capture relevant interactions and constraints. Experimental results on five publicly available datasets demonstrate that Introvert outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction errors.
