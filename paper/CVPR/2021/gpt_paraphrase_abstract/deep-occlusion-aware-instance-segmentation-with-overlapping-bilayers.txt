Segmenting objects that overlap significantly is a difficult task because it is challenging to differentiate between the contours of real objects and the boundaries caused by occlusion. In contrast to previous methods that use a two-stage approach for instance segmentation, our proposed Bilayer Convolutional Network (BCNet) models image formation as a composition of two layers that overlap. The top layer of the network, called the GCN layer, detects the occluding objects, while the bottom layer infers the partially occluded instances. By explicitly modeling the occlusion relationship with a bilayer structure, we naturally separate the boundaries of the occluding and occluded instances and consider their interaction during mask regression. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this bilayer decoupling on both one-stage and two-stage object detectors, using different backbones and network layer choices. Despite its simplicity, extensive experiments on COCO and KINS datasets show that our occlusion-aware BCNet achieves significant and consistent improvements in performance, particularly in cases with heavy occlusion.
