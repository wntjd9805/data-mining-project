The abstract discusses the unique spatial polarization pattern observed in the sky due to sunlight scattering. Similar to how insects use this pattern for navigation, the abstract proposes using it to map pixels to directions in the sky. By decoding the polarization pattern captured in polarimetric appearance, the abstract demonstrates that it is possible to determine the surface normal at each pixel. A polarimetric reflection model is developed for a surface illuminated by the sun and a clear sky, enabling the recovery of per-pixel surface normals from a single polarimetric image or multiple images captured at different times of the day. The accuracy of the proposed shape-from-sky method is evaluated on various real objects with different surface compositions, showing that this passive approach utilizing natural illumination is a viable option for 3D sensing. The abstract suggests that with the advancement of quad-Bayer polarization chips, the implications of this method can extend to various domains.
