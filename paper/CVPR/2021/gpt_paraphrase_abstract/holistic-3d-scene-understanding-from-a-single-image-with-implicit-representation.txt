We introduce a novel approach to comprehensively understand 3D scenes from a single image. Our pipeline can accurately predict object shapes, object poses, and scene layout. Existing methods often struggle with inaccurate shape and layout estimation, especially in cluttered scenes with heavy object occlusion. To address this challenge, we propose utilizing deep implicit representation. We propose an image-based local structured implicit network to improve object shape estimation, and a novel implicit scene graph neural network to refine 3D object pose and scene layout by leveraging implicit local object features. Additionally, we introduce a novel physical violation loss to prevent incorrect context between objects. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of object shape estimation, scene layout estimation, and 3D object detection.
