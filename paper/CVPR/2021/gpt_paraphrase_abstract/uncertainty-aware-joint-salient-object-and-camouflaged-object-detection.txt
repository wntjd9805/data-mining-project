This study proposes a new approach to enhance the detection ability of both salient object detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD), which have opposite objectives. The researchers leverage contradictory information to improve the robustness of the SOD model. They use easy positive samples from the COD dataset as hard positive samples in the SOD task. Additionally, they introduce a "similarity measure" module to explicitly capture the contradicting attributes of the two tasks. To address labeling uncertainty in both datasets, an adversarial learning network is proposed to achieve higher order similarity measure and network confidence estimation. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that this solution achieves state-of-the-art performance for both tasks.
