To fully utilize supervised deep learning algorithms for 3D scene understanding, it is crucial to have access to large-scale and well-annotated datasets. However, currently available datasets are either limited in spatial scale or lack detailed semantic annotations due to the high cost of data acquisition and annotation. This hampers the development of fine-grained semantic understanding in the context of 3D point clouds. To address this issue, this paper introduces an urban-scale photogrammetric point cloud dataset containing nearly three billion points, which is three times larger than the existing largest dataset of its kind. The dataset covers large areas in three cities in the UK, totaling approximately 7.6 km2. Each 3D point in the dataset is labeled with one of 13 semantic classes. The performance of state-of-the-art algorithms on this dataset is extensively evaluated, and a comprehensive analysis of the results is provided. This evaluation highlights several key challenges in achieving urban-scale point cloud understanding. The dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/QingyongHu/SensatUrban.
