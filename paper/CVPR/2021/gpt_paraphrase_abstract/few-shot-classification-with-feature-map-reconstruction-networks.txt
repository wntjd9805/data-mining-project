This paper presents a new approach to few-shot classification by reframing it as a problem of reconstructing a query feature map using support features in latent space. The network's ability to accurately reconstruct the query feature map from the support features of a specific class determines whether the query belongs to that class. The authors propose a novel mechanism that directly regresses from support features to query features without the need for additional modules or large-scale learnable parameters. The resulting Feature Map Reconstruction Networks outperform previous methods in terms of both performance and computational efficiency. The authors demonstrate consistent and significant accuracy improvements on four fine-grained benchmark datasets with different neural architectures. Furthermore, their model achieves competitive performance on the non-fine-grained mini-ImageNet and tiered-ImageNet benchmarks without any additional complex techniques.
