Multi-label activity recognition involves identifying multiple activities that occur simultaneously or sequentially in a video. While most current activity recognition networks focus on single activities, assuming only one activity per video, these networks do not effectively handle multi-label activities. Our approach addresses this by extracting independent feature descriptors for each activity and learning activity correlations. This method can be seamlessly integrated into existing network structures for video classification and can be trained end-to-end. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four multi-label activity recognition datasets. In order to gain insights into the activity-specific features generated by our system, we visualize these features in the Charades dataset. The code for our approach will be made available at a later time.
