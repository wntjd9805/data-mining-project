Domain generalization is a technique that aims to develop a model that can generalize well across different domains, even when the target domains are unknown. This has been traditionally tackled through domain randomization, which involves transferring source images to different styles in spatial space to learn domain-agnostic features. However, existing randomization methods using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) often lack control and can unintentionally alter the semantic structures of images.In this study, we draw inspiration from the JPEG compression technique, which converts spatial images into multiple frequency components (FCs). Building upon this idea, we propose a new method called Frequency Space Domain Randomization (FSDR), which randomizes images in the frequency space while preserving domain-invariant FCs (DIFs) and randomizing domain-variant FCs (DVFs) only. FSDR offers two distinct advantages: 1) It decomposes images into DIFs and DVFs, allowing for explicit access and manipulation of these components, resulting in more controllable randomization.2) FSDR minimally affects the semantic structures of images and preserves domain-invariant features.To validate our approach, we statistically analyzed the domain variance and invariance properties of FCs. We also designed a network that can dynamically identify and fuse DIFs and DVFs through iterative learning. Through extensive experiments on multiple domain generalizable segmentation tasks, we demonstrate that FSDR outperforms other methods in terms of segmentation accuracy. Moreover, FSDR's performance is comparable to domain adaptation methods that have access to target data during training.
