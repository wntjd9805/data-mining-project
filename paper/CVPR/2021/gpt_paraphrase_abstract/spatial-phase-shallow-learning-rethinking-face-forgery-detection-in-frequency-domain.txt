The success of face forgery techniques has raised security concerns in computer vision. One common step in these techniques is up-sampling, which leads to noticeable changes in the frequency domain, particularly in the phase spectrum. By leveraging the properties of natural images, we propose a new method called Spatial-Phase Shallow Learning (SPSL) that combines spatial image and phase spectrum to detect up-sampling artifacts in face forgery. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the use of phase spectrum. Additionally, we find that local texture information is more important than high-level semantic information for detecting face forgery. Therefore, we modify the network structure to focus on the local region and suppress high-level features. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SPSL achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-dataset evaluation and multi-class classification, while also producing comparable results in single dataset evaluation.
