In real-world applications, there is often a lack of alignment between data from different views due to spatial, temporal, or spatiotemporal differences. This leads to the Partially View-aligned Problem (PVP). To address this problem without using labels, we propose a method that simultaneously learns representation and aligns data using a noise-robust contrastive loss. Our method aims to identify within-category counterparts for each sample from one view in other views, establishing cross-view correspondence. Positive pairs are constructed using known correspondences and negative pairs through random sampling. To mitigate the impact of false negatives caused by random sampling, we propose a noise-robust contrastive loss that prevents them from dominating network optimization. This is the first successful attempt at enabling contrastive learning robust to noisy labels, expanding the learning paradigm. Our method shows promising performance in clustering and classification tasks compared to 10 state-of-the-art multi-view approaches. The code will be publicly available at https://pengxi.me.
