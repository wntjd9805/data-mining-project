This paper presents a new approach called MagFace to address the issue of degraded performance in face recognition systems when there is increased variability in the acquired faces. Previous methods have tackled this problem by monitoring face quality during pre-processing or predicting data uncertainty along with face features. MagFace introduces a category of losses that enable the learning of a universal feature embedding, where the magnitude of the embedding can serve as a measure of face quality. The proposed loss function ensures that the magnitude of the feature embedding increases monotonically for subjects that are more likely to be recognized.   Additionally, MagFace incorporates an adaptive mechanism that helps in learning well-structured within-class feature distributions. This is achieved by pulling easy samples towards class centers and pushing hard samples away. By doing so, the model avoids overfitting on noisy, low-quality samples and improves face recognition performance in real-world scenarios.   The effectiveness of MagFace is validated through extensive experiments conducted on face recognition tasks, quality assessments, and clustering. The results demonstrate the superiority of MagFace over existing state-of-the-art methods. The code for implementing MagFace is publicly available at https://github.com/IrvingMeng/MagFace.
