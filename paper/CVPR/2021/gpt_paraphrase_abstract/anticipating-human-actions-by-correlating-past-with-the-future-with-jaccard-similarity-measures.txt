We present a framework for early action recognition and anticipation that utilizes three innovative measures of similarity: Jaccard vector similarity, Jaccard cross-correlation, and Jaccard Frobenius inner product over covariances. By incorporating these unique metrics and employing our framework, we achieve outstanding performance in early action recognition on the UCF101 and JHMDB datasets, with accuracies of 91.7% and 83.5% respectively, using an observation percentage of 20. Furthermore, we achieve state-of-the-art results in action anticipation on the Epic-Kitchen55 and Breakfast datasets, with top-1 accuracies of 20.35 and 41.8 respectively.
