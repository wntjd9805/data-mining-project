We propose a compression-driven network design for frame interpolation (CDFI) that utilizes model pruning to reduce the size of heavy DNN-based frame interpolation models. Our approach compresses the AdaCoF model by 10 times without sacrificing performance. We also introduce a multi-resolution warping module to enhance visual consistencies with multi-level details. As a result, our compressed model achieves significant performance improvement with only a quarter of the size compared to the original AdaCoF model. Furthermore, our CDFI model outperforms other state-of-the-art models across various datasets. Our framework is generic and can be easily applied to other DNN-based frame interpolation algorithms.
