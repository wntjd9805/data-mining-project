The problem of estimating the 3D motion of points in a scene, also known as scene flow, is a fundamental issue in computer vision. Traditional learning-based methods that aim to learn the entire process of 3D flow often struggle to perform well in different scenarios. In this study, we introduce a recurrent architecture that learns a single step of an iterative alignment procedure to improve scene flow predictions. Our approach is inspired by classical algorithms and demonstrates iterative convergence to the solution through the use of strong regularization. Unlike other methods that rely on all-to-all correlation, our method suggests a more compact architecture. By training our network solely on synthetic data from FlyingThings3D, we achieve successful generalization to real scans. Our approach significantly outperforms all existing methods on the KITTI self-supervised benchmark.
