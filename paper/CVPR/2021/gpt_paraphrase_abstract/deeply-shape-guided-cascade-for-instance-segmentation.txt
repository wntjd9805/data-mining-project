The success of a cascade architecture for precise instance segmentation relies on effectively utilizing the relationship between bounding box detection and mask segmentation at multiple stages. While current instance segmentation cascades achieve impressive results, they mainly focus on a one-way relationship where mask segmentation benefits from refined bounding box detection. In this study, we explore an alternative approach by investigating how precise mask segmentation can enhance bounding box detection within a cascade architecture. We propose a Deeply Shape-guided Cascade (DSC) for instance segmentation that establishes a two-way relationship between the two tasks. To achieve this, we introduce three key components:  1. Shape guidance: A mask-supervised Region Proposal Network (mPRN) that generates masks independent of class. 2. Explicit shape guidance: A mask-guided region-of-interest (RoI) feature extractor that utilizes mask segmentation from the previous stage to extract features within a region aligned with the shape of the instance-of-interest, rather than a rectangular RoI. 3. Implicit shape guidance: A feature fusion operation that incorporates intermediate mask features from the previous stage into the bounding box head at the current stage.   Experimental results demonstrate that DSC significantly outperforms the leading instance segmentation cascade, Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC), achieving a box average precision (AP) of 51.8 and a mask AP of 45.5 on COCO test-dev.
