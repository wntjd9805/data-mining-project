We propose a framework that automatically adjusts street scene images by adding or removing objects like pedestrians or vehicles. This method has various applications, including enhancing privacy by anonymizing images, generating data augmentations for perception tasks in autonomous driving, and creating specific atmospheres like empty streets in the early morning. Our work contributes to three main areas: (1) a technique for removing objects from images, (2) a method for estimating the direction of the sun using a single image, and (3) a way to add objects to scenes while respecting scene geometry and lighting conditions. We train each component using minimal ground truth annotations by utilizing a large dataset of short image bursts of street scenes. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on different street scenes and showcase potential practical uses.
