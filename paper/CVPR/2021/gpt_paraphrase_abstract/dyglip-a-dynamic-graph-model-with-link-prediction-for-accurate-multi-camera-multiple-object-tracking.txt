Multi-Camera Multiple Object Tracking (MC-MOT) is a challenging computer vision problem with various real-world applications. Despite numerous existing approaches, the data association problem remains difficult to solve in MC-MOT pipelines. This paper proposes a new approach called Dynamic Graph Model with Link Prediction (DyGLIP) to address the challenges posed by inconsistent lighting conditions, varying object movement patterns, and trajectory occlusions. The DyGLIP approach offers several advantages over existing methods, including improved feature representations and the ability to recover lost tracks during camera transitions. Additionally, our model performs well regardless of the overlapping ratios between cameras. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing MC-MOT algorithms on practical datasets. Notably, our model is particularly effective in online settings and can also be extended to handle large-scale datasets using an incremental approach.
