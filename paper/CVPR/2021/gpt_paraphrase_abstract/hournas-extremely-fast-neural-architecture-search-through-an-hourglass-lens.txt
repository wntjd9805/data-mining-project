Neural Architecture Search (NAS) aims to automatically find the best architectures. This paper introduces HourNAS, an approach inspired by hourglass shape, for fast NAS. The idea is that only a few vital blocks in a deep neural network have a significant impact on the architecture's effectiveness. These vital blocks act as a bottleneck, restricting information flow and influencing network accuracy. The remaining blocks, like the bulbs of an hourglass, determine the overall complexity of the network. To achieve fast NAS without compromising accuracy, HourNAS focuses on identifying and prioritizing the vital blocks during architecture search. The search space for the non-vital blocks is reduced to include only affordable candidates within computational resource limitations. Experimental results on ImageNet demonstrate that HourNAS can search for an architecture achieving 77.0% Top-1 accuracy in just 3 hours (0.1 days) using one GPU. This outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
