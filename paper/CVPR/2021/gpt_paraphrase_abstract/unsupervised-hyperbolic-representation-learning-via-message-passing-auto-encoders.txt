The current literature on hyperbolic embedding primarily focuses on supervised learning, leaving the exploration of unsupervised hyperbolic embedding relatively unexplored. In this study, we investigate the potential benefits of learned representations in hyperbolic space for unsupervised tasks. To examine the effectiveness of representing the hierarchical structure of unlabeled data in hyperbolic spaces, we propose a novel hyperbolic message passing auto-encoder. This model performs auto-encoding in hyperbolic space by fully utilizing hyperbolic geometry in message passing. Through extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses, we confirm the properties and advantages of unsupervised hyperbolic representations. The source code for our model is available at https://github.com/junhocho/HGCAE.
