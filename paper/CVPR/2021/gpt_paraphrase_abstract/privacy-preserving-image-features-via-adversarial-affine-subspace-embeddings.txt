To address concerns regarding the privacy of sensitive information in computer vision systems, we propose a new approach for preserving privacy in image feature representation. Currently, users are required to upload image features to the cloud for processing and storage, which can potentially be exploited to reconstruct the original image and extract private information about the scene or subjects. Our method aims to overcome this privacy concern by embedding each feature descriptor within an affine subspace that includes not only the original feature but also adversarial feature samples. This embedding allows us to remove constraints from the feature descriptors. To enable feature matching on the privacy-preserving representation, we utilize the concept of subspace-to-subspace distance.Through experimental demonstrations, we highlight the effectiveness of our approach and its practical relevance in applications such as visual localization and mapping, as well as face authentication. Comparatively, our method significantly increases the difficulty for adversaries to recover private information when compared to using the original features.
