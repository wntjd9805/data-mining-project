This study focuses on the problem of unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic labeling of 3D point clouds, specifically addressing domain discrepancies caused by different LiDAR sensors. The researchers propose a novel approach called Complete and Label, which involves recovering the underlying surfaces of sparse 3D point clouds before passing them to a segmentation network. They develop a Sparse Voxel Completion Network (SVCN) that completes the surfaces of the point cloud without the need for manual labeling. Additionally, they incorporate local adversarial learning to capture surface priors. By using the recovered 3D surfaces as a canonical domain, the proposed method enables transfer of semantic labels across different LiDAR sensors. The authors evaluate their approach using a newly created benchmark for cross-domain semantic labeling of LiDAR data, and the results demonstrate a significant improvement of 6.3-37.6% compared to previous domain adaptation methods.
