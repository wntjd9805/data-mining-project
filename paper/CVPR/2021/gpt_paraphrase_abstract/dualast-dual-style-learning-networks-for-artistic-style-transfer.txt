We present a new approach called DualAST for artistic style transfer, which involves repainting everyday photographs with learned artistic styles. Current methods either learn styles from a single example or a collection of artworks, resulting in either low visual quality or limited style control. To address this issue, DualAST simultaneously learns both the overall artist-style from a collection of artworks and the specific artwork-style from a single style image. The artist-style sets the overall tone of the stylized image, while the artwork-style determines the details like color and texture. Additionally, we introduce a Style-Control Block (SCB) to adjust the styles of generated images using learnable style-control factors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework.
