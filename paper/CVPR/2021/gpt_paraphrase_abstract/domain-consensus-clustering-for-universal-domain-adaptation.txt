This paper focuses on Universal Domain Adaptation (UniDA), which involves transferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain with unaligned label spaces. The main challenge in UniDA is distinguishing between common classes (classes shared across domains) and private classes (classes unique to one domain). Previous approaches have treated private samples in the target as a single generic class, disregarding their intrinsic structure. As a result, the representations obtained are not compact enough in the latent space and can be easily confused with common samples. To address this, we propose Domain Consensus Clustering (DCC), which leverages domain consensus knowledge to identify discriminative clusters in both common and private samples. DCC incorporates semantic-level consensus, which identifies cycle-consistent clusters as common classes, and sample-level consensus, which uses cross-domain classification agreement to determine the number of clusters and discover private classes. By using DCC, we are able to separate private classes from common classes and differentiate between private classes themselves. Additionally, we apply a class-aware alignment technique to minimize distribution shift in identified common samples and use a prototypical regularizer to encourage discriminative target clusters. Experimental results on four benchmarks demonstrate that DCC outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.
