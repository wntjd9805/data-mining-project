This paper introduces a supervised mixing augmentation technique called SuperMix, which utilizes the prominent regions in input images to create mixed training samples. SuperMix aims to generate mixed images that are visually rich and align with realistic image priors. To improve the efficiency of the algorithm, a faster variant of the Newton iterative method is developed, which is 65 times faster than gradient descent for this problem. The effectiveness of SuperMix is validated through extensive evaluations and ablation studies on object classification and knowledge distillation tasks. In terms of classification, SuperMix performs comparably to advanced augmentation methods like AutoAugment and RandAugment. Specifically, combining SuperMix with RandAugment achieves a top-1 accuracy of 78.2% on ImageNet with ResNet50. For the distillation task, solely classifying mixed images using the teacher's knowledge achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art distillation methods. Additionally, incorporating mixed images into the distillation objective improves performance by 3.4% on CIFAR-100 and 3.1% on ImageNet, on average.
