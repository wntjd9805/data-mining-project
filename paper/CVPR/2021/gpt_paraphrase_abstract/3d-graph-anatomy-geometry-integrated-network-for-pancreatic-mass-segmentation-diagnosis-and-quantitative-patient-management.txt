The pancreatic disease taxonomy consists of ten different types of masses, including tumors and cysts. Previous research has focused on developing methods to segment or classify specific mass types, but there has been no investigation into using an automated image understanding approach for the differential diagnosis of all mass types. In this study, we aim to differentiate pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from the other nonPDAC masses using multi-phase CT imaging. Both the appearance of the images and the geometric relationship of the 3D organ-mass are crucial factors. To achieve this, we propose a comprehensive segmentation-mesh-classification network (SMCN) that utilizes both the anatomy and semantic detection-by-segmentation network. SMCN learns the segmentation task for the pancreas and mass, and creates an anatomical correspondence-aware organ mesh model by progressively deforming a prototype on the raw segmentation mask. We also develop a new graph-based residual convolutional network (Graph-ResNet) that fuses information from the mesh model and feature vectors extracted from the segmentation network to produce patient-level differential classification results. Our experiments on 661 patients' CT scans demonstrate that SMCN improves mass segmentation and detection accuracy compared to the baseline method nnUNet. Additionally, SMCN achieves similar sensitivity and specificity in differentiating PDAC and nonPDAC as expert radiologists and obtains results comparable to a multimodality test that combines clinical, imaging, and molecular testing for clinical management of patients.
