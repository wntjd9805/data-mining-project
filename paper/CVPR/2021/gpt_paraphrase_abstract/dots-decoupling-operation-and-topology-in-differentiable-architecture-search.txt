Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS) has gained significant attention for its efficiency in searching for cell structures. However, DARTS focuses mainly on operation search, which leads to poor accuracy in rating the importance of cell topology. To address this issue, we propose Decouple the Operation and Topology Search (DOTS), which separates topology representation from operation weights and introduces an explicit topology search. DOTS utilizes a topology search space that encompasses combinations of candidate edges, providing a direct reflection of the search objective. This search space can also be easily expanded to accommodate a flexible number of edges in the searched cell. Existing gradient-based NAS methods can be integrated into DOTS for further enhancements through topology search. To preserve topology-related operations that can impact the topology, we suggest a group operation search scheme. Experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that DOTS is an effective solution for differentiable NAS. The code for DOTS is available at https://github.com/guyuchao/DOTS.
