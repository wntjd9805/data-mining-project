This paper introduces a new technique called FastSinkhorn Filters for recovering accurate and bijective pointwise correspondences in shape correspondence methods. The technique combines the use of functional maps for correspondence representation with matrix scaling schemes from computational optimal transport. By exploiting the sparse structure of the kernel matrices involved in transport map computation, the technique achieves a balance between accuracy and complexity in dense shape correspondence, while ensuring bijectivity. The analysis in the paper also establishes a theoretical foundation for pointwise map recovery from functional maps and highlights its relationship to spectral alignment-based shape correspondence methods. Overall, FastSinkhorn Filters offers superior time and memory complexity compared to existing approaches.
