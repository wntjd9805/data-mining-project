We present a novel approach for identifying correct matches among a set of 2D-2D line correspondences. Existing methods rely on geometric constraints and are limited to structured scenes with orthogonality, parallelism, and coplanarity. In contrast, our approach is applicable to both structured and unstructured scenes by leveraging the spatial regularity on a sphere. Instead of using geometric constraints, we map line correspondences into tangent vectors on a sphere, which encode both angular and positional variations of image lines. These vectors exhibit a spatial regularity called local trend consistency, regardless of the scene type. To capture this regularity, we propose a neural network and a novel loss function that enforces smoothness in the vector field. Additionally, we create a large real-world dataset for image line matching. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and generalization.
