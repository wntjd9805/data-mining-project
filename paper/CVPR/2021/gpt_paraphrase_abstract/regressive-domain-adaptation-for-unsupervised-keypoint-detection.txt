We propose a method called regressive domain adaptation (RegDA) for unsupervised keypoint detection. Existing domain adaptation techniques are mainly focused on classification tasks and may not perform well in regression tasks like keypoint detection. To address this challenge, we use an adversarial regressor to maximize the difference between the source and target domains and train a feature generator to minimize this difference. However, the regressor fails to detect samples that deviate from the source domain. To overcome this, we introduce a spatial probability distribution to describe the sparsity of the output space and use it to guide the learning of the adversarial regressor. Additionally, we convert the adversarial training into the minimization of two opposite goals to make optimization easier in the high-dimensional space. Experimental results show that our method improves keypoint detection performance by 8% to 11% in terms of PCK on different datasets.
