Text segmentation is an important step in various text-related tasks, including text style transfer and scene text removal. However, due to the lack of high-quality datasets and dedicated research, this crucial step has been overlooked in many studies. To address this gap, we have developed TextSeg, a large-scale dataset with detailed annotations for text segmentation. This dataset includes annotations for word- and character-level bounding polygons, masks, and transcriptions. Additionally, we have introduced a novel text segmentation approach called TexR-Net, which is specifically designed to handle the unique properties of text such as non-convex boundaries and diverse textures. TexR-Net incorporates text-specific network designs, such as key features pooling and attention-based similarity checking, to tackle these challenges. We have also introduced trimap and discriminator losses, which significantly improve the accuracy of text segmentation. Through extensive experiments on our TextSeg dataset and other existing datasets, we have demonstrated that TexR-Net consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art segmentation methods, achieving nearly a 2% improvement in performance. Our dataset and code are publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Rethinking-Text-Segmentation.
