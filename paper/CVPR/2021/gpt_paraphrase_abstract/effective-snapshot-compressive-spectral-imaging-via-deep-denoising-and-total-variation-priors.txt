Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) is a novel system that compresses multiple image frames into a single snapshot measurement, offering cost-effectiveness, low bandwidth, and high-speed sensing. However, existing SCI methods applied to hyperspectral images fail to fully exploit their underlying structures, resulting in unsatisfactory reconstruction performance. To address this issue, this study proposes an effective approach that leverages two intrinsic priors of hyperspectral images: deep image denoising and total variation (TV) priors. Specifically, an optimization objective is introduced to incorporate these priors, leading to the integration of a weighted FFDNet and a 2DTV or 3DTV denoiser into the plug-and-play framework. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared to other state-of-the-art alternatives. Furthermore, a comprehensive convergence analysis of the resulting plug-and-play algorithm is provided, even without the use of diminishing step sizes.
