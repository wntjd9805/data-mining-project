This paper introduces a technique to address the computational intensity of generating novel views of a 3D scene using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). The proposed technique utilizes spatial decomposition, where smaller networks are dedicated to each decomposed part of the scene, resulting in near-constant inference time regardless of the number of decomposed parts. The authors observe that employing larger networks does not yield significant improvements, leading them to propose spatial decomposition. They argue that a Voronoi spatial decomposition is preferable as it is compatible with the efficient and GPU-friendly rendering algorithm known as the Painter's Algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method offers up to 3Ã— more efficient inference compared to NeRF with the same rendering quality, or an improvement of up to 1.0 dB in PSNR for the same inference cost.
