Despite recent advancements in deep learning, accurately recovering sharp boundaries and generating high-resolution outputs in stereo matching remains a challenge. This paper introduces Stereo Mixture Density Networks (SMD-Nets), a straightforward yet effective learning framework that addresses these issues. The proposed framework is compatible with various 2D and 3D architectures and improves disparity estimation by utilizing bimodal mixture densities as output representations. This approach enables precise disparity estimates near discontinuities and explicitly models the inherent uncertainty in the observations. Additionally, the authors formulate disparity estimation as a continuous problem in the image domain, allowing the model to estimate disparities with arbitrary spatial precision. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments conducted on both synthetic and real-world stereo datasets. The results show improved depth accuracy near object boundaries and the ability to generate ultra high-resolution disparity maps on standard GPUs. Furthermore, the flexibility of the technique is highlighted by its ability to enhance the performance of various stereo backbones.
