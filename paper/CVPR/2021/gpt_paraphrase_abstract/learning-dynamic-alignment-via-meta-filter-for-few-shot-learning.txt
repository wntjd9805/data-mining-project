Few-shot learning (FSL) is a challenging problem in computer vision, as it requires adapting learned knowledge to recognize new classes with very limited examples. Existing methods for feature alignment in few-shot learning often neglect the channel disparity, resulting in poor adaptation. This paper proposes a dynamic alignment approach that highlights both query regions and channels based on local support information. This is achieved by dynamically sampling the feature position's neighborhood conditioned on the input few-shot, and predicting a position-dependent and channel-dependent Dynamic Meta-filter. This filter aligns the query feature with position-specific and channel-specific knowledge. Additionally, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) is utilized to enhance alignment control. By capturing fine-grained semantic context and facilitating dynamic knowledge adaptation, the proposed model outperforms existing methods on popular few-shot visual recognition benchmarks such as miniImageNet and tieredImageNet.
