Camouflage plays a crucial role in the survival of various species as it is an effective defense mechanism. Common camouflage strategies include blending with the background and disguising body outlines to hide from predators. Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to identify and segment these hidden objects within their surroundings. However, existing COD models only focus on segmenting the objects without considering the level of camouflage. In this study, we argue that explicitly modeling the conspicuousness of camouflaged objects against their specific backgrounds can provide a better understanding of camouflage and animal evolution, as well as guide the development of more advanced camouflage techniques. Additionally, we observe that certain parts of camouflaged objects are what make them detectable by predators. Based on this understanding, we propose the Rank-Net, the first ranking-based COD network, which simultaneously localizes, segments, and ranks camouflaged objects. The localization model identifies the distinct regions that make the object stand out, while the segmentation model accurately segments the entire object. Furthermore, the ranking model assesses the detectability of different camouflaged objects. To evaluate the generalization ability of COD models, we contribute a large COD testing set. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a new state-of-the-art performance, leading to a more interpretable COD network.
