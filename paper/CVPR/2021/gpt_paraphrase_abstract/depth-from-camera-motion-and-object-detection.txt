This study focuses on the problem of estimating the depth of detected objects using camera motion measurements. The authors propose a recurrent neural network called DBox, which utilizes a generalized representation of bounding boxes and uncalibrated camera movement to estimate object depth. To support the training of DBox, the authors introduce the Object Depth via Motion and Detection Dataset (ODMD), which provides extensible and configurable training data. The ODMD benchmark consists of 21,600 examples across four validation and test sets, including experiments with mobile robots and perturbations in camera motion and bounding box data. In addition to the ODMD benchmark, the authors evaluate DBox's performance in other monocular application domains, achieving state-of-the-art results in driving and robotics benchmarks, as well as depth estimation using a camera phone.
