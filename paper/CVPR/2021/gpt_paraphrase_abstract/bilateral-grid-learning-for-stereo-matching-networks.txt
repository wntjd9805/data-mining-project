Stereo matching networks play a crucial role in various applications like autonomous driving, robot navigation, and augmented reality. However, striking a balance between real-time performance and accuracy remains a challenge. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called edge-preserving cost volume upsampling module, which is based on the slicing operation in the learned bilateral grid. This module efficiently generates a high-resolution cost volume from a low-resolution one using a parameter-free slicing layer guided by a learned guidance map. The module can be seamlessly integrated into existing stereo matching networks like GCNet, PSMNet, and GANet. By incorporating our upsampling module, these networks achieve significantly accelerated performance without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a real-time network called BGNet, which surpasses other published real-time deep stereo matching networks and even some complex networks on the KITTI stereo datasets. The code for our approach is available at https://github.com/YuhuaXu/BGNet.
