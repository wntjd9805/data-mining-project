We introduce Lite-HRNet, an efficient high-resolution network for human pose estimation. By incorporating the efficient shuffle block from ShuffleNet into HRNet, Lite-HRNet achieves better performance compared to lightweight networks like MobileNet, ShuffleNet, and Small HRNet. However, we found that the commonly used pointwise (1 Ã— 1) convolutions in shuffle blocks were computationally expensive. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight unit called conditional channel weighting, which replaces the costly pointwise convolutions. This channel weighting unit has a linear complexity with respect to the number of channels, making it more efficient than pointwise convolutions, which have a quadratic time complexity. Our solution learns the weights from all channels and multiple resolutions available in the parallel branches of HRNet. These weights serve as a bridge to exchange information across channels and resolutions, compensating for the role of pointwise convolutions. Lite-HRNet outperforms popular lightweight networks in human pose estimation and can also be easily applied to semantic segmentation tasks. The code and models for Lite-HRNet are publicly available at https://github.com/HRNet/Lite-HRNet.
