This paper focuses on multi-target domain adaptation (MTDA), which involves learning a robust predictor for multiple unlabeled target datasets with different data distributions, using only one labeled source dataset. The authors propose a method called Curriculum Graph Co-Teaching (CGCT) to address the challenges of multiple domain-shifts in MTDA. CGCT utilizes a dual classifier head, with one being a graph convolutional network (GCN) that aggregates features from similar samples across domains. To prevent overfitting on noisy pseudo-labels, a co-teaching strategy is developed, assisted by curriculum learning to obtain more reliable pseudo-labels. Additionally, when domain labels are available, a sequential adaptation strategy called Domain-aware Curriculum Learning (DCL) is proposed, which first adapts on easier target domains before moving on to harder ones. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in MTDA.
