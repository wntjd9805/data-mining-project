We propose a new approach for upsampling sparse and noisy point clouds generated by 3D scanning. Instead of using a single network, we divide the task into two cascaded sub-networks: a dense generator and a spatial refiner. The dense generator produces a coarse but dense output that approximates the underlying surface, while the spatial refiner further refines the output by adjusting the location of each point. We incorporate local and global refinement units in the spatial refiner to improve the feature map, and use per-point offset vectors for fine-scale adjustment. Our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of both qualitative and quantitative results on synthetic and real-scanned datasets. The code for our method is publicly available at https://github.com/liruihui/Dis-PU.
