This paper presents a decomposition model for stereo matching that addresses the problem of increased computational cost with higher resolution. To tackle this issue, the model performs dense matching at a low resolution and employs sparse matching at higher resolutions to recover lost details. The decomposed stereo matching is then combined through iterative fusion using an occlusion-aware mask. Additionally, a refinement network is utilized to enhance the fusion result. Compared to high-performance methods like PSMNet and GANet, our approach achieves a significant speed increase of 10-100 times while maintaining comparable disparity estimation results.
