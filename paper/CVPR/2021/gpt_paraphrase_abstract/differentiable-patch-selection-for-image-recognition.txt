To efficiently process high resolution images with Neural Networks, a large amount of memory and compute power is usually required, even though only a small portion of the image contains relevant information for the specific task. In this study, we propose a method that utilizes a differentiable Top-K operator to select the most significant parts of the input. This approach allows for the efficient processing of high resolution images and can be seamlessly integrated with any downstream neural network. Moreover, our method enables the aggregation of information from various patches in a flexible manner and facilitates end-to-end training using backpropagation. We present the results of our approach in the context of tasks such as traffic sign recognition, inter-patch relationship reasoning, and fine-grained recognition. Notably, our method achieves these tasks without relying on object/part bounding box annotations during the training process.
