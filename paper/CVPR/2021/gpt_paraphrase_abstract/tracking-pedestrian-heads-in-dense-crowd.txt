To address the challenge of tracking humans in crowded video sequences, we introduce the Crowd of Heads Dataset (CroHD), consisting of 9 sequences with over 2.2 million annotated heads and 5,230 tracks. We propose a new metric, IDEucl, to evaluate the effectiveness of tracking algorithms in preserving unique identities in crowded scenes. Additionally, we present a new head detector called HeadHunter, specifically designed for small head detection in crowded environments. We enhance HeadHunter with a Particle Filter and a color histogram-based re-identification module for head tracking. By comparing our tracker with existing state-of-the-art pedestrian trackers on CroHD, we demonstrate superior performance, particularly in identity preservation metrics. Our lightweight head detector and efficient tracking algorithm contribute to the advancement of pedestrian tracking in dense crowds. The dataset, code, and models are publicly available at the provided URL.
