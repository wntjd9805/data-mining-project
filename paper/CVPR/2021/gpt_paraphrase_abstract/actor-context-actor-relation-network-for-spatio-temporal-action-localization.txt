This study focuses on the challenging task of localizing persons and recognizing their actions in videos. Previous research has made progress by modeling direct pairwise relations between entities. However, this paper goes a step further by considering not only direct relations between pairs but also indirect higher-order relations established among multiple elements. The authors propose a novel approach called the Actor-Context-Actor Relation Network (ACAR-Net) which incorporates a High-order Relation Reasoning Operator and an Actor-Context Feature Bank. This allows for indirect relation reasoning in spatio-temporal action localization. Experimental results on the AVA and UCF101-24 datasets demonstrate the benefits of modeling actor-context-actor relations. The visualization of attention maps confirms that the proposed model effectively identifies relevant higher-order relations to support action detection. Significantly, the method achieves the top rank in the AVA-Kinetics action localization task of the ActivityNet Challenge 2020, outperforming other entries by a substantial margin (+6.71 mAP). The code for the proposed approach is available online.
