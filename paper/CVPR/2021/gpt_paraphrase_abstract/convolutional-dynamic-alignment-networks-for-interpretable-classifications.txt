We present Convolutional Dynamic Alignment Networks (CoDA-Nets), a novel family of neural network models that are highly interpretable and effective classifiers. CoDA-Nets utilize Dynamic Alignment Units (DAUs) as their main building blocks, which apply linear transformations to their input using weight vectors that adaptively align with task-relevant patterns. Consequently, CoDA-Nets represent the classification prediction through a sequence of input-dependent linear transformations, enabling the decomposition of the output into individual contributions from the input. By aligning with the DAUs, the resulting contribution maps correspond to discriminative input patterns. These inherent decompositions generated by CoDA-Nets exhibit excellent visual quality and outperform existing attribution methods based on quantitative metrics. Additionally, CoDA-Nets demonstrate comparable performance to popular models like ResNet and VGG on datasets such as CIFAR-10 and TinyImagenet.
