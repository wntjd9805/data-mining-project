Instance segmentation, a prominent area of research in computer vision, involves identifying and separating individual objects within an image. While existing feed-forward networks can produce accurate binary segmentation results, they heavily rely on post-processing to separate instances from the binary mask. In contrast, iterative methods can extract one object at a time without post-processing but struggle with large object counts. To combine the benefits of sequential segmentation methods with scalability, we introduce a novel iterative deep reinforcement learning agent. This agent learns to simultaneously differentiate multiple objects by constructing a relational graph between pixels and designing a reward function that encourages separation and grouping. Our method efficiently performs instance segmentation without extensive post-processing.
