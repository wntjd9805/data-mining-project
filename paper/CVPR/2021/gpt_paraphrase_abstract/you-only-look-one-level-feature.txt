This paper examines the effectiveness of feature pyramid networks (FPN) in one-stage object detectors and concludes that the success of FPN lies in its approach to solving the optimization problem in object detection rather than its multi-scale feature fusion. Instead of using complex feature pyramids, the paper proposes a simpler solution called You Only Look One-level Feature (YOLOF), which utilizes only one-level feature for detection. YOLOF introduces two key components, Dilated Encoder and Uniform Matching, which greatly improve its performance. Extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of YOLOF. It achieves comparable results to RetinaNet, its feature pyramid counterpart, while being 2.5 times faster. Without transformer layers, YOLOF can achieve the same performance as DETR in a single-level feature manner with only 7 times less training epochs. The code for YOLOF is available at https://github.com/megvii-model/YOLOF.
