Temporal grounding refers to the process of identifying specific time boundaries within untrimmed videos based on language queries. However, this process is hindered by two types of uncertainties stemming from human subjectivity: query uncertainty and label uncertainty. These uncertainties limit the overall effectiveness of temporal grounding.  To address these uncertainties, we propose a novel approach called DeNet (Decoupling and De-bias). Decoupling involves separating each query into a relation feature and a modified feature. The relation feature focuses on extracting fundamental and consistent information using skeleton-like words (such as nouns and verbs) to mitigate the impact of query uncertainty. On the other hand, the modified feature, associated with style-like words (like adjectives and adverbs), captures subjective information and enables personalized predictions.  Additionally, we introduce a de-bias mechanism to generate diverse predictions and mitigate the bias caused by single-style annotations in the presence of label uncertainty. Furthermore, we propose new multi-label metrics to evaluate the performance of our approach more comprehensively.  Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of effectiveness and robustness on the Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions datasets.
