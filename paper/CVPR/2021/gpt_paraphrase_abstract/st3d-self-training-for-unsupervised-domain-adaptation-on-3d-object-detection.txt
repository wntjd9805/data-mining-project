We introduce ST3D, a novel domain adaptive self-training pipeline for unsupervised domain adaptation in 3D object detection using point clouds. Our approach involves pre-training the 3D detector on the source domain using a random object scaling strategy to address source domain bias. Then, we iteratively improve the detector on the target domain through two steps: updating pseudo labels using a quality-aware triplet memory bank and training the model using curriculum data augmentation. These specific designs ensure that the detector is trained with consistent and high-quality pseudo labels, preventing overfitting to easy examples in pseudo labeled data. ST3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on all evaluated datasets and even surpasses fully supervised results on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark.
