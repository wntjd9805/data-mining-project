The effectiveness of message passing neural networks in representing node dependencies has been well-established. However, existing algorithms tend to focus on a single structure and utilize a single approach to estimate messages. In real-world scenarios, such as facial action units (AUs), dependencies can vary based on different expressions and individuals. This paper introduces a novel hybrid message passing neural network called HMP-PS, which incorporates complementary message passing methods and captures a wider range of possible structures in a Bayesian manner. The proposed method includes a performance-driven Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling approach for generating high-performance graph structures. Additionally, a hybrid message passing technique combines different types of messages to provide complementary information. The contribution of each message type is adaptively adjusted based on the input. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, BP4D and DISFA, demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
