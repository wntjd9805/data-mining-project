Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is a technique that allows knowledge to be transferred from a related source domain to an unlabeled target domain. However, there is still a significant performance gap between UDA and supervised learning with fully labeled target data. Active domain adaptation (ADA) aims to reduce this gap by selecting a small number of target samples to annotate and include in the training process, thereby minimizing annotation costs. However, existing active learning methods may not effectively select the most informative target samples due to domain shift.To address this issue, we propose a new approach called Transferable Query Selection (TQS). TQS uses an ensemble of three new criteria - transferable committee, transferable uncertainty, and transferable domainness - to select the most informative samples under domain shift. We also introduce a randomized selection algorithm to enhance the diversity of the selected samples. Experimental results demonstrate that TQS outperforms previous UDA and ADA methods on various domain adaptation datasets. Furthermore, in-depth analyses reveal that TQS effectively selects the most informative target samples even in the presence of domain shift.In summary, our proposed method, Transferable Query Selection (TQS), improves upon existing UDA and ADA methods by effectively selecting the most informative target samples under domain shift. Experimental results support the superiority of TQS, highlighting its potential in domain adaptation tasks.
