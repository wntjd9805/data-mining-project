This paper addresses the problem of finding new classes in unlabeled visual data using labeled data from different classes. Existing methods typically pre-train a model using labeled data and then use unsupervised clustering to identify new classes in unlabeled data. However, the labeled data is often underutilized in this process. The challenge lies in the fact that the labeled and unlabeled examples come from non-overlapping classes, making it difficult to establish a learning relationship between them. To overcome this, we propose OpenMix, a method that combines unlabeled examples from open set classes and labeled examples from known classes. We mix the non-overlapping labels and pseudo-labels of these examples into a joint label distribution. OpenMix achieves this by generating mixed training images that incorporate labeled examples with unlabeled examples. This integration benefits from the prior knowledge in novel class discovery, resulting in more credible pseudo-labels. This prevents overfitting on unlabeled samples that may have incorrect pseudo-labels. Additionally, OpenMix identifies unlabeled examples with high class-probabilities as reliable anchors and combines them with other unlabeled samples. This allows for the generation of more combinations in the unlabeled examples and the exploration of finer object relations among the new classes. Experimental results on three classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of OpenMix, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods in discovering novel classes.
