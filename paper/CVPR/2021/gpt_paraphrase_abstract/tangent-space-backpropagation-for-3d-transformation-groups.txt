In this study, we tackle the challenge of conducting backpropagation for computation graphs involving 3D transformation groups, specifically SO(3), SE(3), and Sim(3). These transformation groups are commonly used in fields such as 3D vision and robotics; however, they do not conform to vector spaces and instead exist on smooth manifolds.The conventional approach to backpropagation involves embedding 3D transformations in Euclidean spaces, but this method encounters numerical difficulties. To overcome these issues, we present a novel library that leverages the group structure of 3D transformations and performs backpropagation within the tangent spaces of manifolds. We demonstrate that our approach offers improved numerical stability, ease of implementation, and benefits a wide range of tasks.To facilitate the adoption of our method, we have developed a plug-and-play PyTorch library, which is readily available at https://github.com/princeton-vl/lietorch.
