We propose a new algorithm to address image degradation in under-display camera (UDC) technology used in smartphones. UDC technology eliminates the need for drilling holes on the display, but it leads to spatially variant blur and noise due to the opaque display in front of the camera. Our algorithm utilizes a pixel-wise UDC-specific kernel representation and a noise estimator to restore UDC images. The kernel representation is derived from an optical model that considers both normal and oblique light incidence. We also introduce noise-adaptive learning to control noise levels based on user preferences. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional image restoration algorithms in terms of both quantitative performance and perceptual quality. This is evident in both real-world and monitor-based aligned datasets.
