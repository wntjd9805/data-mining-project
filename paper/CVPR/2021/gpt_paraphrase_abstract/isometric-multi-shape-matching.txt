The problem of finding correspondences between shapes is crucial in computer vision and graphics, and has numerous applications such as 3D reconstruction, object tracking, and style transfer. Most existing correspondence methods focus on finding solutions between pairs of shapes, even when multiple instances of the same class are available. While isometries are commonly studied in shape correspondence problems, they have not been explicitly considered in the multi-matching context. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a new optimization formulation for isometric multi-shape matching. We introduce an optimization algorithm that effectively solves our formulation, and provide an analysis of its convergence and complexity. Our algorithm guarantees cycle-consistent multi-matchings. Through experiments on various datasets, we demonstrate the superior performance of our method, establishing a new state-of-the-art in isometric multi-shape matching.
