Trajectory prediction is an essential tool for autonomous vehicles to plan and execute actions safely. Our research tackles two main challenges in trajectory prediction: learning multiple possible outcomes and improving predictions by applying driving knowledge constraints. Current methods have achieved impressive results using Multi-Choice Learning objectives such as winner-takes-all (WTA) or best-of-many. However, the impact of these methods on generating diverse hypotheses has not been thoroughly studied, as they heavily rely on their initialization for diversity.   In our first contribution, we introduce a novel approach called Divide-And-Conquer (DAC) that acts as a better initialization technique for the WTA objective. This approach produces diverse outputs without introducing any false modes.   Our second contribution is a new trajectory prediction framework named ALAN. This framework utilizes existing lane centerlines as reference points to generate trajectories constrained to the input lanes. By capturing interactions through hypercolumn descriptors and incorporating scene information in the form of rasterized images and per-agent lane anchors, our framework is able to provide multi-agent trajectory outputs in a single pass.   Experiments conducted on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that our proposed DAC method better captures the data distribution compared to other objectives from the WTA family. Additionally, we show that our ALAN approach achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods when evaluated on the Nuscenes urban driving benchmark.
