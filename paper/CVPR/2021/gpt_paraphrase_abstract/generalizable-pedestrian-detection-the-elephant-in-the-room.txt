Pedestrian detection is widely used in various applications, such as video surveillance and autonomous driving. Although existing detectors perform well on their training datasets, their ability to generalize to unseen data remains largely unknown. This is crucial because a practical detector should be adaptable to different scenarios. In this study, we aim to address this issue by conducting a comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets. We discovered that state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors, while effective on their training datasets, struggle to generalize when tested on different datasets. We identified two main reasons for this. Firstly, their designs, including anchor settings, are biased towards popular benchmarks, limiting their generalization capability. Secondly, the training datasets typically lack diversity in pedestrian instances and scenarios. Surprisingly, we found that a general purpose object detector, without specific adaptations for pedestrians, actually generalizes better than existing pedestrian detectors. Additionally, we demonstrated that collecting diverse and dense datasets by crawling the web can serve as an efficient source for pre-training pedestrian detection models. Based on these findings, we propose a progressive training pipeline that proves effective for pedestrian detection in autonomous driving scenarios. Therefore, we conclude that future designs of pedestrian detectors should prioritize cross-dataset evaluation. For access to our code and models, please visit https://github.com/hasanirtiza/Pedestron.
