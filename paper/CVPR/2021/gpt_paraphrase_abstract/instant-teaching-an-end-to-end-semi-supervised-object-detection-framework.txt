Supervised learning methods for object detection require extensive manual annotations, which can be impractical in real-world applications. Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) utilizes unlabeled data to improve model performance, which is important for object detection models. In this study, we propose Instant-Teaching, an end-to-end SSOD framework that incorporates instant pseudo labeling and augmented weak-strong data for teaching during each training iteration. To address confirmation bias and enhance the quality of pseudo annotations, we introduce a correction scheme called Instant-Teachingâˆ—. Through extensive experiments on MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our framework. With only 2% labeled data, our method achieves a 4.2 mAP improvement over state-of-the-art methods on MS-COCO. Even with fully supervised information on MS-COCO, our method still outperforms existing approaches by approximately 1.0 mAP. On PASCAL VOC, we achieve over a 5 mAP improvement by using VOC07 as labeled data and VOC12 as unlabeled data.
