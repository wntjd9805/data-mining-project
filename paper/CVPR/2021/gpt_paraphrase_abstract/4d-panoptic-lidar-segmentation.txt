Temporal semantic scene understanding is crucial for autonomous vehicles and robots navigating in dynamic environments. This study introduces a 4D panoptic LiDAR segmentation method that assigns both a semantic class and a temporally consistent instance ID to a sequence of 3D points. The proposed approach utilizes a point-centric evaluation metric. Each point is assigned a semantic class, and object instances are modeled as probability distributions in the 4D spatio-temporal domain. Multiple point clouds are processed simultaneously, resolving point-to-instance associations without the need for explicit temporal data association. Drawing inspiration from recent advancements in benchmarking multi-object tracking, a novel evaluation metric is proposed, which separates the semantic and point-to-instance association aspects of the task. This research aims to pave the way for future advancements in temporal LiDAR panoptic perception.
