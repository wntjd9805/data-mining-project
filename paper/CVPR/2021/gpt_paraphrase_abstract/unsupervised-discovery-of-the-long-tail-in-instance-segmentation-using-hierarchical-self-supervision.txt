Instance segmentation in computer vision is typically addressed using supervised learning methods with large datasets of object level masks. However, creating such datasets for new domains is costly and time-consuming, and models trained on specific annotated categories struggle to generalize to unseen objects. This paper aims to introduce a technique for unsupervised discovery of long-tail categories in instance segmentation by learning instance embeddings of masked regions. By utilizing the relationships and hierarchical structures between objects in images, the paper proposes self-supervised losses for learning mask embeddings. The proposed method is trained on the COCO dataset without any additional annotations for long-tail objects, yet it is capable of identifying novel and more detailed objects compared to the standard categories in COCO. The paper demonstrates that the model achieves competitive quantitative results on LVIS compared to supervised and partially supervised methods.
