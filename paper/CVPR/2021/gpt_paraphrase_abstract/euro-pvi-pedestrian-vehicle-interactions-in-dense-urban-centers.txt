Accurate prediction of pedestrian and cyclist paths is crucial for the development of reliable autonomous vehicles in busy city environments. The interactions between vehicles and pedestrians or cyclists greatly influence the movements of traffic participants, such as stopping or changing direction to avoid accidents. Although recent datasets and trajectory prediction methods have contributed to the progress of autonomous vehicles, the representation of vehicle-pedestrian (cyclist) interactions in these datasets is limited. In this study, we introduce Euro-PVI, a dataset containing trajectories of pedestrians and cyclists. Our dataset specifically focuses on diverse and complex interactions in dense urban scenarios, surpassing the capabilities of existing datasets. To overcome the challenges of predicting future trajectories with dense interactions, we propose a joint inference model that learns a versatile multi-modal shared latent space across agents in urban scenes. This enables our Joint-Î²-cVAE approach to better capture the distribution of future trajectories. By achieving state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes and Euro-PVI datasets, we demonstrate the significance of capturing interactions between ego-vehicles and pedestrians (cyclists) for accurate trajectory predictions.
