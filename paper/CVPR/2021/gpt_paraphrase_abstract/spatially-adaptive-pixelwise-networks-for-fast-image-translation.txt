We present a novel generator architecture for efficient image-to-image translation at high resolutions. Our generator is designed to be lightweight by using pixel-wise networks, where each pixel is processed independently through simple transformations and nonlinearities. To ensure expressive power, we make the network parameters spatially varying, allowing for a broader range of functions compared to traditional convolutions. Additionally, these parameters are predicted by a fast convolutional network operating on a low-resolution input. We further enhance the input image by incorporating a sinusoidal encoding of spatial coordinates, which improves the generation of realistic high-frequency image content. Our model achieves a speedup of up to 18 times compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining comparable visual quality across different image resolutions and translation domains.
