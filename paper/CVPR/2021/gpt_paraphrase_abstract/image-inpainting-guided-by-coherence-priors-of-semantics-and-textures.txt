Current methods for image inpainting have shown promising results in recovering defective images of specific scenes. However, filling holes that involve multiple semantic categories is still a challenge. This is because the boundaries between different semantic categories are unclear and there is a mixture of different semantic textures. In this study, we propose using coherence priors between semantics and textures to address this challenge. These coherence priors allow us to focus on completing separate textures in a semantic-wise manner. We achieve this by employing a multi-scale joint optimization framework. First, we model the coherence priors and then optimize the image inpainting and semantic segmentation in a coarse-to-fine manner. To refine completed image textures across scales and mitigate the mixing of textures, we introduce a Semantic-Wise Attention Propagation (SWAP) module. This module leverages non-local semantic coherence to refine the completed textures. Additionally, we propose two coherence losses to ensure consistency between the semantics and the inpainted image. These losses constrain the overall structure and detailed textures of the inpainted image. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, especially in challenging cases with complex holes. Overall, our method outperforms existing methods in inpainting images with multiple semantic categories.
