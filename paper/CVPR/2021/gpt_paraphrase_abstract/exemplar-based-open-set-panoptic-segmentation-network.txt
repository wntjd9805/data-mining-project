We introduce a new task called open-set panoptic segmentation (OPS), which extends panoptic segmentation to include unknown classes. These unknown classes have not been seen during training. We address the practical challenges of OPS and create a benchmark using the COCO dataset. To tackle this task, we propose a novel network called exemplar-based open-set panoptic segmentation network (EOPSN) inspired by exemplar theory. EOPSN identifies new classes by clustering and uses them as pseudo-ground-truths. We increase the size of each class by finding new exemplars that are similar to existing ones. We evaluate EOPSN using our benchmark and show that our approach is effective. Our main objective is to bring attention to recognition in open-world scenarios. The implementation of our algorithm can be found on our project webpage.
