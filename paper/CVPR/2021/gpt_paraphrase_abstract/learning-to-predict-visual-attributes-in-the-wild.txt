The abstract discusses the importance of visual attributes in describing objects and introduces a large-scale dataset for visual attribute prediction. The dataset contains over 927K attribute annotations for more than 260K object instances. The paper addresses the challenges posed by this dataset, such as the large number of attributes, label sparsity, data imbalance, and object occlusion. To overcome these challenges, the paper proposes various techniques, including a base model that utilizes low- and high-level CNN features with multi-hop attention, reweighting and resampling techniques, a negative label expansion scheme, and a supervised attribute-aware contrastive learning algorithm. These techniques result in significant improvements in performance compared to the current state of the art.
