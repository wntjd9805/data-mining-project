This paper introduces a new method called DLRRPD for clustering. DLRRPD utilizes optimal projected representations to create a similarity graph that captures the multi-subspace structure. In addition to a global low-rank constraint, DLRRPD incorporates a projection distance penalty to leverage the local geometrical structure, resulting in a more favorable graph. To enhance the robustness of DLRRPD to noise, a Laplacian rank constraint is introduced to encourage a more discriminative graph for clustering tasks. The graph is enforced to be more block-diagonal using Frobenius norm instead of the commonly used nuclear norm, reducing complexity. Extensive experiments on synthetic, real, and noisy data demonstrate that DLRRPD outperforms existing alternatives by a margin of 1.0%âˆ¼10.1%.
