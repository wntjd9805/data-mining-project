Vanilla Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based detectors have shown satisfactory performance in detecting fake faces. However, these detectors often focus on a limited region of the face, indicating a lack of understanding of forgery. To address this limitation, we propose an attention-based data augmentation framework that guides the detector to refine and expand its attention. Our method involves tracking and occluding the top-N sensitive facial regions, encouraging the detector to explore previously overlooked regions for more accurate forgery detection. Importantly, our method is user-friendly and can be easily integrated with various CNN models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables a vanilla CNN-based detector to identify representative forgeries generated by different manipulation techniques. Furthermore, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance without modifying the detector's structure.
