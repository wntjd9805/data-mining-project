The removal of outlier correspondences is a crucial step in the successful registration of point clouds based on features. While deep learning techniques have become popular in this field, the concept of spatial consistency, which is established through a Euclidean transformation between point clouds, has been largely ignored in existing learning frameworks. This paper introduces PointDSC, a novel deep neural network that explicitly incorporates spatial consistency to eliminate outlier correspondences. The proposed approach includes a nonlocal feature aggregation module that combines feature and spatial coherence for embedding the input correspondences. Additionally, a differentiable spectral matching module is formulated to estimate the confidence of inliers based on pairwise spatial compatibility using the embedded features. Despite its modest computational cost, PointDSC outperforms state-of-the-art hand-crafted and learning-based outlier rejection methods by a significant margin on various real-world datasets. Furthermore, PointDSC demonstrates its versatility by being successfully combined with different 3D local descriptors. The code for PointDSC is also made publicly available.
