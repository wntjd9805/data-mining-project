A new approach is proposed to tackle the challenging task of parsing human body parts in an instance-aware manner. This approach combines category-level human semantic segmentation and multi-person pose estimation in a joint and end-to-end manner. It is a compact and efficient framework that leverages structural information at different levels of human granularity to overcome the difficulty of partitioning individuals. The framework learns a dense-to-sparse projection field that associates dense human semantics with sparse keypoints, progressively improving it over the network feature pyramid for robustness. The problem of grouping pixels is then simplified as a multi-person joint assembling task, which is solved using a differentiable solution based on maximum-weight bipartite matching. This allows for end-to-end training and direct supervision of multi-granularity human representation learning by back-propagating the grouping error. Unlike existing bottom-up human parsers or pose estimators that rely on post-processing or heuristic greedy algorithms, our method achieves superior performance on three instance-aware human parsing datasets with more efficient inference.
