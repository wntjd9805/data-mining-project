Data augmentation is a crucial technique in training deep learning systems. However, we have discovered that the commonly used data augmentation methods can lead to a shift in distribution, ultimately degrading performance on unaugmented data during inference. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective approach called KeepAugment. Our method aims to preserve the fidelity of augmented images by using saliency maps to identify important regions in the original images and retain these informative regions during augmentation. By employing this information-preserving strategy, we are able to generate more accurate training examples. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that our method outperforms several existing data augmentation schemes such as AutoAugment, Cutout, and random erasing. Our approach achieves promising results in various tasks including image classification, semi-supervised image classification, multi-view multi-camera tracking, and object detection.
