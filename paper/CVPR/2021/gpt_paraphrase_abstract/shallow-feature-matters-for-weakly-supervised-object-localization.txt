The objective of weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) is to locate objects using only image-level labels. Class activation maps (CAMs) are commonly used features for WSOL. However, previous methods based on CAMs did not fully utilize shallow features, which are crucial for WSOL, as they tend to get overshadowed by background noise during fusion. This paper proposes a straightforward yet effective model called Shallow feature-aware Pseudo supervised Object Localization (SPOL) for accurate WSOL. The SPOL model maximizes the use of low-level features in shallow layers. In practice, the SPOL model generates CAMs by multiplying shallow and deep feature maps, effectively filtering out background noise and generating sharper boundaries. Additionally, a general class-agnostic segmentation model is proposed to obtain accurate object masks using only the initial CAMs as pseudo labels, without any additional annotation. Finally, a bounding box extractor is applied to the object mask to locate the target. Experimental results demonstrate that the SPOL model outperforms the state-of-the-art on both CUB-200 and ImageNet-1K benchmarks, achieving 93.44% and 67.15% Top-5 localization accuracy, respectively. This represents an improvement of 3.93% and 2.13% compared to existing methods.
