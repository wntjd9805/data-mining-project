In recent years, there has been significant research in both semi-supervised learning and 3D room layout reconstruction. This study aims to combine these two fields in order to improve the accuracy of 3D indoor scene modeling with a reduced amount of labeled data. The proposed approach involves learning representations of room corners and boundaries using a combination of labeled and unlabeled data, specifically in a 360-degree panoramic scene. Extensive experiments were conducted, which demonstrated that the approach can improve layout estimation of complex indoor scenes with as few as 20 labeled examples. Additionally, when combined with a layout predictor pre-trained on synthetic data, the semi-supervised method performed equivalently to the fully supervised approach using only 12% of the labels. This research represents an important first step towards robust semi-supervised layout estimation, which has the potential to enable various applications in 3D perception even with limited labeled data.
