Neural architecture search (NAS) has been used to automatically find high-performance networks for medical image segmentation. However, previous methods have either been time-consuming for large-scale 3D image datasets or limited to specific network topologies. This study focuses on three key aspects of NAS in 3D medical image segmentation: flexible multi-path network topology, efficient search, and limited GPU memory usage. A new differentiable search framework called DiNTS is proposed to enable fast gradient-based search within a highly flexible network topology search space. To address the issue of sub-optimal results from discretization, a topology loss is introduced. Additionally, the GPU memory usage is constrained during the search process. The proposed method is evaluated on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge and achieves state-of-the-art performance and top ranking on the MSD challenge leaderboard.
