Safe local motion planning for autonomous driving in dynamic environments requires predicting how the scene will evolve. Traditional approaches involve manually annotating objects in the scene, which is time-consuming and costly. In this study, we propose an alternative representation called future freespace to support motion planning. Our main idea is to focus on avoiding occupied space rather than the specific objects occupying it. The advantage of using future freespace is that it can be computed without manual annotation. We first explore freespace forecasting as a self-supervised learning task. Then, we show how forecasted freespace can be used to identify collision-prone plans from existing motion planners. Additionally, we introduce future freespace as a source of annotation-free supervision and demonstrate how it can be integrated into learning-based planners. Experimental results on nuScenes and CARLA datasets indicate that both approaches significantly reduce collision rates.
