Efficiently representing a 3D object or scene is crucial for various applications such as 3D vision and robotics. Traditionally, this is achieved by densely sampling a collection of views and formulating it as a view selection problem or a set cover problem. However, in this paper, we propose a novel approach that eliminates the need for dense view sampling. Our approach involves training a view prediction network and a trainable aggregation module. These modules take predicted views as input and generate approximate scores based on criteria like surface coverage and viewing angle. By doing so, we convert the set cover problem into a continuous optimization problem. We also describe how to solve this optimization problem effectively using continuation, which involves aggregating a hierarchy of smoothed scoring modules. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves similar or better solutions compared to standard methods, while significantly reducing the running time by approximately 10 times.
