This paper introduces a novel technique for integrating surface normals to solve the inverse problem of local plane fitting. The reconstruction of surfaces from normal maps is crucial for accurately reconstructing the shape of objects based on their photometric properties. In this study, we propose a method that formulates the integration of normals in camera coordinates, allowing us to simultaneously determine the positions of 3D points and the displacements of local planes. Unlike existing methods that rely on vertical distances between 3D points, our approach minimizes the sum of squared distances between points and planes. Our method is capable of handling both orthographic and perspective normal maps with arbitrary boundaries. Compared to existing techniques, our method overcomes the checkerboard artifact and demonstrates greater robustness against natural boundaries, sharp features, and outliers. Additionally, we conduct a geometric analysis to explain the origin of artifacts observed in previous methods using our plane fitting formulation. Experimental results obtained from analytically computed, synthetic, and real-world surfaces demonstrate that our method achieves accurate and stable surface reconstruction for both orthographic and perspective normal maps.
