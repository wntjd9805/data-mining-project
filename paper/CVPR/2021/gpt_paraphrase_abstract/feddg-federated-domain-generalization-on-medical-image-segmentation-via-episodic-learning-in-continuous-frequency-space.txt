Federated learning enables medical institutions to collaborate and train a shared prediction model while maintaining privacy. However, when these models are deployed in different hospitals outside the collaboration, their performance may suffer. To address this issue, we introduce a new problem called federated domain generalization (FedDG), which aims to develop a model that can generalize to unseen target domains. Our proposed approach, Episodic Learning in Continuous Frequency Space (ELCFS), allows each client to utilize data from multiple source domains while maintaining data decentralization. We achieve this by transmitting distribution information across clients in a privacy-protected manner using a continuous frequency space interpolation mechanism. Additionally, we design a boundary-oriented episodic learning paradigm to adapt to domain distribution shifts and improve model generalization in medical image segmentation. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method through experiments on two medical image segmentation tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.
