We demonstrate that the method used for inference in few-shot segmentation tasks significantly impacts performance, an aspect often overlooked in the literature which tends to focus on the meta-learning paradigm. To address this, we propose a transductive inference approach that utilizes the statistical properties of unlabeled pixels in a query image. This is achieved by optimizing a new loss function that consists of three complementary components: i) cross-entropy on labeled support pixels, ii) Shannon entropy of posteriors on unlabeled query-image pixels, and iii) a global KL-divergence regularizer based on the predicted foreground proportion. Our inference method employs a simple linear classifier for feature extraction, making it computationally comparable to inductive inference and compatible with any base training. By forgoing episodic training and solely using standard cross-entropy training on base classes, our inference approach achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks in 1-shot scenarios. As the number of available shots increases, the performance gap widens. On the PASCAL-5i dataset, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by approximately 5% and 6% in the 5-shot and 10-shot scenarios, respectively. Additionally, we introduce a new setting involving domain shifts, where base and novel classes come from different datasets. In this more realistic scenario, our method achieves the best performance.
