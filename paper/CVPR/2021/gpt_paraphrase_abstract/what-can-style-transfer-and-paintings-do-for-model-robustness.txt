Data augmentation is a popular method for improving the robustness of models. It involves introducing variations in the data to help models learn certain invariances, such as being unaffected by changes in color or horizontal flipping. A recent approach to data augmentation is arbitrary style transfer, which involves transforming photographs into painting-like images. However, it is important to note that stylized photographs do not possess the same perceptually meaningful cues as artist-created paintings. Paintings are designed to enable humans to recognize important components in a scene, which is not necessarily the case with style transfer. This study aims to explore the differences between style transfer and paintings in terms of their impact on model robustness. The researchers first examine the role of paintings as style images for stylization-based data augmentation and find that style transfer can work effectively even without using paintings as style images. They then demonstrate that learning from paintings as a form of perceptual data augmentation can enhance model robustness. Additionally, the study investigates the invariances learned from stylization and paintings and reveals that models learn different invariances from these distinct types of data. These findings shed light on how stylization improves model robustness and provide evidence that artist-created paintings can serve as a valuable source of data for enhancing model robustness.
