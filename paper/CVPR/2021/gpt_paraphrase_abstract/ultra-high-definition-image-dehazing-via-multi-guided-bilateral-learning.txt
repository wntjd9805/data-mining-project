Most existing deep dehazing models have high computational complexity, limiting their application to high-resolution images. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel network that can perform real-time dehazing of 4K images on a single GPU. Our network consists of three deep CNNs, each serving a specific purpose. The first CNN extracts haze-relevant features from the hazy input at a reduced resolution and fits locally-affine models in the bilateral space. The second CNN learns multiple full-resolution guidance maps corresponding to the learned bilateral model. This allows for multi-guided bilateral upsampling, enabling the reconstruction of high-frequency feature maps. Finally, the third CNN combines the high-quality feature maps to produce a dehazed image. We also introduce a large-scale 4K image dehazing dataset for training and testing purposes. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art dehazing approaches on various benchmarks.
