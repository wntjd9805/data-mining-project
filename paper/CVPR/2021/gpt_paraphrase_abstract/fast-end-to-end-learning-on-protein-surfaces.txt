The use of geometric deep learning on mesh-based representations of proteins has shown promise in identifying functional sites. However, using meshes as the underlying representation has limitations, including the need for pre-computed features and mesh connectivities. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new framework for deep learning on protein structures. Our method allows for the computation and sampling of the molecular surface on-the-fly from the atomic point cloud, eliminating the need for pre-computed features. We also introduce a novel efficient geometric convolutional layer. Our approach enables the processing of large collections of proteins in an end-to-end fashion, using only the raw 3D coordinates and chemical types of the atoms as input. We evaluate our method on two tasks in protein structural bioinformatics: the identification of interaction sites and the prediction of protein-protein interactions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance with faster run times and fewer parameters compared to previous models. These results make it easier to deploy deep learning methods in protein science and pave the way for end-to-end differentiable approaches in protein modeling tasks such as function prediction and design.
