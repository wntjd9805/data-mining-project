Point cloud registration plays a crucial role in various 3D computer vision tasks, such as estimating the position of objects by aligning a 3D model with an observation. While classical registration methods excel in adapting to new domains, they struggle when faced with noisy observations or poor initializations. On the other hand, learning-based methods are more robust but lack the ability to generalize well. In this study, we propose a new approach to iterative point cloud registration by treating it as a reinforcement learning task. We introduce a novel registration agent called ReAgent, which leverages imitation learning to initialize its discrete registration policy using an expert policy. Additionally, we enhance the agent's registration performance by integrating policy optimization based on our proposed alignment reward. We evaluate our approach on synthetic (ModelNet40) and real data (ScanObjectNN) and demonstrate that our ReAgent achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. Furthermore, our agent's lightweight architecture enables faster inference compared to other similar approaches. The code for our method is available on GitHub at github.com/dornik/reagent.
