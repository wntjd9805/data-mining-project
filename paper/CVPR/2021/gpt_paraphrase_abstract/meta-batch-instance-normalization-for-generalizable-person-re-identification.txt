Supervised person re-identification (Re-ID) methods have achieved impressive performance but struggle to generalize to unseen domains. This has led to increasing interest in generalizable Re-ID. Existing methods have used instance normalization to reduce style variations but this often leads to a loss of discriminative information. In this study, we propose a new generalizable Re-ID framework called Meta Batch-Instance Normalization (MetaBIN). Our approach involves simulating unsuccessful generalization scenarios beforehand in the meta-learning pipeline to generalize normalization layers. We combine learnable batch-instance normalization layers with meta-learning to address challenges posed by both batch and instance normalization layers. We also enhance the virtual simulations through our meta-train loss and cyclic inner-updating method to improve generalization capability. The MetaBIN framework prevents overfitting to source styles and enhances generalization to unseen domains without requiring additional data augmentation or complex network design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on large-scale domain generalization Re-ID benchmark and cross-domain Re-ID problems.
