The research on text recognition faces numerous challenges. While progress has been made, the current focus is on reading cropped line text images, which limits the overall performance of optical character recognition (OCR) systems. To address this, we propose Implicit Feature Alignment (IFA), a straightforward and effective approach that can be easily integrated into existing text recognizers. This introduces a new inference mechanism called IFA-inference, allowing ordinary text recognizers to process multi-line text without relying on text detection. We integrate IFA into two popular text recognition streams (attention-based and CTC-based) and introduce attention-guided dense prediction (ADP) and Extended CTC (ExCTC) methods. Additionally, we propose Wasserstein-based Hollow Aggregation Cross-Entropy (WH-ACE) to suppress negative predictions and aid in training ADP and ExCTC. Experimental results demonstrate that IFA achieves state-of-the-art performance in end-to-end document recognition tasks while maintaining high speed. ADP and ExCTC complement each other in different application scenarios. The code for our approach is available at https://github.com/Wang-Tianwei/Implicit-feature-alignment.
