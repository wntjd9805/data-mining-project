This study presents a new algorithm for detecting the most suitable set of semantic lines. The algorithm consists of two networks: the selection network (S-Net) and the harmonization network (H-Net). Initially, S-Net calculates the probabilities and offsets of line candidates. Then, irrelevant lines are filtered out using a selection-and-removal process. Subsequently, a complete graph is constructed, and the edge weights are computed by the H-Net. Finally, a maximal weight clique is determined, representing the optimal set of semantic lines. Additionally, a novel metric called HIoU is proposed to evaluate the overall harmony of the detected lines. Experimental results demonstrate the effective and efficient detection of harmonious semantic lines using the proposed algorithm. The source code for this algorithm is available at https://github.com/dongkwonjin/Semantic-Line-MWCS.
