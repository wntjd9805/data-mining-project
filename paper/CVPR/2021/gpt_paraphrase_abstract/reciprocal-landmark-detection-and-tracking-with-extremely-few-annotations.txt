In echocardiography, the localization of anatomical landmarks is crucial for diagnosing cardiac diseases. However, manually labeling these landmarks is time-consuming and leads to variability among observers. Therefore, there is a need for automatic localization methods to improve workflow and reduce interobserver variability. One challenge in training machine learning models for this task is the scarcity of labeled data. Only a small percentage of cardiac cine series frames are typically manually labeled for clinical use. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end model that addresses this issue by specifically handling the sparse nature of echocardiography labels.Our model, called the reciprocal detection and tracking model, is trained using a few annotated frames across the entire cardiac cine sequence. This allows for consistent detection and tracking of landmarks. Additionally, we introduce adversarial training to leverage the annotated frames and further enhance the model's performance.We conducted several experiments to demonstrate the superiority of our proposed reciprocal model. The results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in accurately localizing anatomical landmarks in echocardiography.
