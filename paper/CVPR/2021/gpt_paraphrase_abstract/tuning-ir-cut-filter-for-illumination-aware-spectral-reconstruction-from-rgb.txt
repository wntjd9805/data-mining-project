Recently, there has been a growing interest in using multi-channel observations, specifically trichromatic RGBs, to reconstruct spectral signals instead of traditional scanning-based spectral imagers. It has been demonstrated that the accuracy of this reconstruction heavily depends on the spectral response of the RGB camera being used. To enhance the accuracy, data-driven algorithms have been proposed to obtain the optimal response curves of existing RGB cameras or even design new three-channel response curves. However, this paper takes a different approach by examining the filter-array based color imaging mechanism of current RGB cameras. It suggests designing the IR-cut filter appropriately to improve spectral recovery, offering a solution that strikes a better balance between reconstruction accuracy and implementation complexity. Additionally, the paper introduces a deep learning-based method for spectral reconstruction, enabling the recovery of the illumination spectrum as well. Experimental results, including both synthetic and real images captured under daylight illumination, demonstrate the advantages of our IR-cut filter tuning method and our illumination-aware spectral reconstruction method.
