Previous research on face recognition has focused on minimizing the impact of age variation by either extracting identity-related features that are not influenced by age or transforming faces of different age groups to appear as the same age group. However, these approaches have limitations. The first approach lacks visual results for model interpretation, while the second approach results in artifacts that compromise downstream recognition. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a unified, multi-task framework called MTL-Face. MTL-Face simultaneously handles age-invariant face recognition and face age synthesis, allowing for the learning of age-invariant identity-related representation while achieving high-quality face synthesis. This is achieved by decomposing mixed face features into identity- and age-related components using an attention mechanism, and then decorrelating these components through multi-task training and continuous domain adaptation. Unlike conventional methods that perform group-level face age synthesis, MTL-Face introduces a novel identity conditional module that enables identity-level face age synthesis, improving the smoothness of synthesized faces. Additionally, a large cross-age face dataset with age and gender annotations is collected and released to advance age-invariant face recognition and face age synthesis research. Extensive experiments on five benchmark cross-age datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MTL-Face compared to state-of-the-art methods for age-invariant face recognition and face age synthesis. MTL-Face is also validated on two popular general face recognition datasets, showing competitive performance in real-world scenarios. The source code and dataset are available for further exploration.
