This paper presents a new approach for encoding the blur operators of a diverse set of sharp-blur image pairs into a blur kernel space. By ensuring that the encoded kernel space closely represents real-world blur operators, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm for blind image deblurring. This algorithm approximates an unknown blur operator using a kernel in the encoded space and then searches for the corresponding sharp image. Unlike recent deep learning methods, our system can handle unfamiliar blur kernels without relying on complicated handcrafted assumptions about the blur operator commonly found in traditional methods. The encoded kernel space is fully differentiable, making it easily adaptable for deep neural network models. Additionally, our method can be used for blur synthesis by transferring existing blur operators from one dataset to another. We provide experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code for our approach is available at https://github.com/VinAIResearch/blur-kernel-space-exploring.
