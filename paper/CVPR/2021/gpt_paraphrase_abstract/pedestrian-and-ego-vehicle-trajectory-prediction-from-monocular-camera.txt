We propose a novel approach to predict the future positions of pedestrians in autonomous driving systems. By considering the predicted future position of the ego-vehicle, our method allows for timely response in critical situations. Our approach separates the actual movement of pedestrians from the vehicle's motion using a self-supervised future pose prediction network. This enables us to observe and predict pedestrian motion in a normalized view, capturing consistent real-world locations across frames. We evaluate our method on two public datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results in pedestrian trajectory prediction from an on-board camera.
