This paper presents a two-stage method for restoring high-quality bitonal manga from degraded versions found on the internet. The main issue with manga resources online is that they often contain screen-tone artifacts due to improper scanning and rescaling resolutions. The proposed method utilizes the aliasing effects caused by downsampling bitonal screentones as informative cues to infer the original resolution and screentones.   In the first stage, the target resolution is predicted using the Scale Estimation Network (SE-Net) with a spatial voting scheme. This helps determine the appropriate resolution for restoration. In the second stage, the Manga Restoration Network (MR-Net) is used to restore the bitonal screentones in a region-wise manner, based on the degree of degradation.   In pattern-identifiable regions, the original screentones are directly restored, while in pattern-agnostic regions, visually plausible screentones are synthesized. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through quantitative evaluation on synthetic data and visual assessment on real-world cases. Overall, this method offers a promising approach for restoring the quality of degraded bitonal manga.
