This paper examines the use of 1D radial cameras in structure from motion problems. In this camera model, the projection of a 3D point is represented by a line in the image plane that passes through the principal point. This model is immune to radial distortion and changes in focal length, allowing it to be effectively applied to uncalibrated image collections without the need for explicit estimation of camera intrinsics.The study demonstrates that the reprojection errors of 1D radial cameras are considered quasiconvex functions. This discovery enables the possibility of solving a broad range of reconstruction problems optimally on a global scale using convex optimization tools. The resulting algorithm is based on solving a series of linear programming (LP) problems.To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, extensive experiments were conducted using both synthetic and real data. The results showcase that a diverse set of multiview geometry problems, involving different camera models with varying and unknown intrinsic calibration, can be reliably and accurately solved within the same framework.
