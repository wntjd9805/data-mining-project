The popularity of deep learning has sparked significant interest and growth in computer vision, raising concerns about its impact on society. However, little is known about how these developments have affected the individuals involved in computer vision research and practice. While the community focuses on replicating human abilities, little attention is given to the personal consequences of this work. This study explores the emotional experiences of computer vision researchers and practitioners by asking them to share emotionally significant events they have encountered. Analyzing over 50 responses, we discovered a substantial emotional strain within the computer vision community. Although many participants expressed excitement and success, there was a notable prevalence of feelings such as isolation, cynicism, apathy, and exasperation towards the state of the field. This was particularly true for individuals who did not share the same level of enthusiasm for traditional standards in computer vision research or did not consider themselves part of the "in-crowd." Our findings suggest that these emotions are closely linked to the research and professional practices expected in computer vision. We argue that as a community with significant influence, it is crucial to foster an inclusive culture that acknowledges and addresses the emotional challenges faced by its members.
