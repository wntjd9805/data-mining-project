The field of fine-grained recognition has gained significant attention due to the need for retrieval requirements within the same superclass, such as birds, persons, and cars. However, extracting all the discriminative cues in this scenario is challenging due to the diverse and subtle inter-class differences. Traditional training mechanisms focus on optimizing the overall discriminativeness of the entire feature, potentially leaving some elements insufficiently trained. This results in a less generalizable feature extractor that only captures major discriminative cues and overlooks subtle ones. To address this limitation, we propose a Discrimination-Aware Mechanism (DAM) that identifies and improves insufficiently trained elements iteratively. DAM increases the number of well-learned elements, capturing more visual cues and leading to a more informative representation and better generalization performance. Our DAM approach can be easily applied to various existing paradigms in fine-grained recognition. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, we demonstrate the superiority of our DAM-based loss over other state-of-the-art approaches.
