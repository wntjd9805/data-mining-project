This abstract discusses the development of a model-based deep pan-sharpening approach using deep learning techniques. The approach involves formulating two optimization problems, each responsible for generating panchromatic and low-resolution multispectral images. These problems are then solved using a gradient projection algorithm, with the iterative steps generalized into two network blocks. By stacking these blocks alternately, a novel network called the gradient projection based pan-sharpening neural network is constructed. The experimental results using various satellite datasets show that this network outperforms existing methods both visually and quantitatively. The code for this approach is available at https://github.com/xsxjtu/GPPNN.
