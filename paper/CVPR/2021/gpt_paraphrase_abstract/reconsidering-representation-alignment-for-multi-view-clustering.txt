Aligning the distributions of view representations is a crucial aspect of modern deep multi-view clustering models. However, we have identified several limitations in simply aligning these distributions. These limitations result in less distinct clusters in the representation space and hinder the model's ability to prioritize views. Taking these observations into account, we have developed a straightforward baseline model for deep multi-view clustering. Our baseline model avoids aligning representations altogether, yet performs as well as, if not better than, the current leading models. Additionally, we have expanded our baseline model by incorporating a contrastive learning component. This introduces a selective alignment procedure that preserves the model's ability to prioritize views. Through experiments, we have demonstrated that the contrastive learning component significantly improves the baseline model, surpassing the current state of the art by a considerable margin on multiple datasets.
