Simulation has the potential to greatly enhance the evaluation and development of self-driving systems, ensuring both rapid progress and safe deployment. However, existing simulation environments lack realistic multi-agent behaviors, relying instead on rule-based models that cannot accurately capture complex maneuvers and interactions. In contrast, our proposed TRAFFICSIM model leverages real-world data to learn from human demonstrations, resulting in more naturalistic driving behaviors. By parameterizing the policy with an implicit latent variable model, we can generate socially-consistent plans for all actors in the scene. To train a robust policy for long horizon simulation, we optimize through fully differentiable simulation over time, incorporating both human demonstrations and common sense. Our experiments demonstrate that TRAFFICSIM outperforms a diverse set of baselines in generating significantly more realistic traffic scenarios. Furthermore, the trajectories generated by TRAFFICSIM can be effectively used as data augmentation to improve motion planner training.
