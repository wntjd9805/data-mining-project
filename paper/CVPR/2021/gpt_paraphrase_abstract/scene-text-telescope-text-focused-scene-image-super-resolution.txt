This paper presents a text-focused super-resolution framework called Scene Text Telescope (STT) for enhancing low-resolution text images. Existing methods often use generic super-resolution frameworks that do not consider text-specific properties such as text-level layouts and character-level details. To address this, the authors propose a Transformer-Based Super-Resolution Network (TBSRN) with a Self-Attention Module to handle texts in arbitrary orientations. They also introduce a Position-Aware Module and a Content-Aware Module to emphasize the position and content of each character. In low-resolution conditions where some characters appear indistinguishable, the authors use a weighted cross-entropy loss to mitigate this issue. The authors conducted experiments on TextZoom and various scene text recognition benchmarks, evaluating text recognition accuracy and image quality. The results demonstrate that STT generates text-focused super-resolution images that outperform existing methods in terms of recognition accuracy.
