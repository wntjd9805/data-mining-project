Transfer learning has become increasingly important in computer vision and natural language processing, with pre-training on large-scale datasets. However, it is often impractical to use these pre-training models for specific tasks due to factors such as latency constraints and specialized data distributions. This paper introduces GAIA, a transfer learning system focused on object detection, that can automatically generate customized solutions based on specific downstream requirements. GAIA provides pre-trained weights, selects models that meet latency constraints and specified data domains, and collects relevant data for practitioners with limited data points. GAIA achieves promising results on various datasets including COCO, Objects365, Open Images, Caltech, CityPersons, and UODB. For example, on COCO, GAIA efficiently produces models with latency ranging from 16ms to 53ms, achieving AP scores from 38.2 to 46.5. To benefit the object detection community, GAIA is made publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/GAIA-vision).
