Domain generalizable person re-identification (ReID) is a difficult problem as it does not have access to unseen target domain data during training. Existing methods in this area use a hybrid dataset from multiple source domains for training and then apply the trained model directly to unseen target domains for testing. However, these methods often overlook the discriminative characteristics of individual source domains and their relevance to the unseen target domains, which can actually improve the model's generalization. To address these issues, we propose a new method called the relevance-aware mixture of experts (RaMoE). This method utilizes a voting-based mixture mechanism to dynamically leverage the diverse characteristics of source domains and enhance the model's generalization. We introduce a decorrelation loss to preserve the diversity and discriminability of individual domains' characteristics in the source domain networks (experts). Additionally, we design a voting network to adaptively integrate the features of all experts into more generalizable aggregated features, taking into account domain relevance. Since the target domains are not visible during training, we propose a novel learning-to-learn algorithm combined with a relation alignment loss to update the voting network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed RaMoE method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in domain generalizable person re-identification.
