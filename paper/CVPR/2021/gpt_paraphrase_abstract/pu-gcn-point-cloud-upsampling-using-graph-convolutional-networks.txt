Learning-based point cloud upsampling pipelines rely heavily on the choice of upsampling modules and feature extractors. In this study, we propose a novel upsampling model called NodeShuffle, which utilizes a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively encode local point information from point neighborhoods. NodeShuffle is versatile and can be integrated into any point cloud upsampling pipeline. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NodeShuffle consistently enhances the performance of state-of-the-art upsampling methods. Additionally, we introduce a new multi-scale point feature extractor known as Inception DenseGCN for feature extraction. By aggregating features at multiple scales, this extractor enables further improvement in the quality of the upsampled point clouds. We combine Inception DenseGCN with NodeShuffle to create a new upsampling pipeline called PU-GCN. PU-GCN achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and more efficient inference. The publicly available code for PU-GCN can be accessed at https://github.com/guochengqian/PU-GCN.
