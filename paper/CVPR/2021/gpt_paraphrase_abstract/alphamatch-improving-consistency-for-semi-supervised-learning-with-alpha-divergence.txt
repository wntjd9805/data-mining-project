We propose AlphaMatch, a new semi-supervised learning (SSL) method that effectively utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data. Our approach leverages data augmentations to enforce label consistency between data points and their augmented versions. We make two key contributions: 1) using alpha-divergence to prioritize regularization on data with high confidence, similar to FixMatch but with more flexibility, and 2) introducing an optimization-based algorithm that enforces consistency and has better convergence compared to previous SSL methods. AlphaMatch is simple to implement and consistently outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10, SVHN, CIFAR-100, and STL-10. Notably, we achieve a test accuracy of 91.3% on CIFAR-10 with just 4 labeled data per class, surpassing the previous best accuracy of 88.7% achieved by FixMatch.
