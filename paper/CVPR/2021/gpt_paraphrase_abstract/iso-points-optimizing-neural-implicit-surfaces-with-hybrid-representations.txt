Neural implicit functions are a powerful way to represent 3D surfaces. However, optimizing these functions for accurate and robust reconstructions is challenging, especially when dealing with noisy or incomplete data. This study introduces a hybrid neural surface representation that incorporates geometry-aware sampling and regularization to improve reconstruction fidelity. The method uses iso-points as an explicit representation for the neural implicit function, which capture important geometric features and impose geometric constraints during optimization. The study demonstrates that this approach can enhance existing techniques for reconstructing neural implicit surfaces from multi-view images or point clouds. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, it is shown that the proposed method enables faster convergence, better generalization, and accurate recovery of details and topology compared to existing sampling and optimization methods.
