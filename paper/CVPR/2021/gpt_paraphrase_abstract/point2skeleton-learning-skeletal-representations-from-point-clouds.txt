We present Point2Skeleton, an unsupervised technique for acquiring skeletal representations from point clouds. Existing methods for skeletonization are limited to tubular shapes and require watertight input, whereas our approach aims to generate more versatile skeletal representations for complex structures and handle point clouds. Our approach leverages the insights of the medial axis transform (MAT) to capture the intrinsic geometric and topological characteristics of the original input points. Initially, we predict a set of skeletal points by learning a geometric transformation, and subsequently analyze the connectivity of these points to form skeletal mesh structures. Through extensive evaluations and comparisons, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of performance and robustness. The acquired skeletal representation can be beneficial for various unsupervised tasks involving point clouds, including surface reconstruction and segmentation.
