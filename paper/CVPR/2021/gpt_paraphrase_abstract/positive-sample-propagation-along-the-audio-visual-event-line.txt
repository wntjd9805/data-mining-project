The goal of this study is to locate and categorize audio-visual events (AVEs) in videos. To achieve this, the authors propose a positive sample propagation (PSP) module that identifies relevant audio-visual pairs by evaluating their relationship. By creating a similarity map between each audio and visual segment, the module only considers pairs with high similarity scores. To encourage the extraction of highly correlated features for positive samples, a new audio-visual pair similarity loss is introduced. Additionally, a weighting branch is proposed to better utilize temporal correlations in a weakly supervised setting. The authors conducted experiments on a public AVE dataset and achieved state-of-the-art accuracy in both fully and weakly supervised settings, validating the effectiveness of their method.
