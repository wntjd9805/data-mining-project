This paper introduces a novel system for solving the second sub-problem in computer-aided design (CAD) of reverse engineering 3D shapes. The system utilizes a new geometric representation called the zone graph, which allows for efficient handling of industry-standard CAD operations. Specifically, the focus is on CAD programs that involve sketching, extruding, and Boolean operations. The problem is framed as a search in the space of extrusions permitted by the zone graph, and a graph neural network is trained to score potential extrusions in order to speed up the search process. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both geometric reconstruction accuracy and reconstruction time. Additionally, the generated modeling sequences are more plausible.
