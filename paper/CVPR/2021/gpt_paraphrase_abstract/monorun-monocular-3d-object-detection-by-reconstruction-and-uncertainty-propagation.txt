This study focuses on the challenging task of localizing objects in 3D space using monocular 3D object detection. Current methods rely on ground truth object geometry, which is difficult to obtain in real outdoor scenes. To address this issue, the proposed framework, MonoRUn, learns dense correspondences and geometry in a self-supervised manner using simple 3D bounding box annotations. A regional reconstruction network with uncertainty awareness is used to regress the pixel-related 3D object coordinates. During testing, the network uncertainty is utilized to estimate object pose and its covariance. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on the KITTI benchmark.
