In recent years, object detection has made significant advancements. However, when applying an object detector trained in one domain to another, there is often a decrease in performance due to the domain shift problem. Existing methods address this issue by aligning features either on the backbone network or instance classifier to improve transferability. In contrast, our approach focuses on performing feature alignment in the RPN stage, allowing for effective discrimination between foreground and background RPN proposals in the target domain. To achieve this, we create a set of learnable RPN prototypes and align the RPN features with these prototypes in both the source and target domains. This cooperative learning process ensures alignment between the source and target RPN features. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective method for RPN feature alignment, using filtered detection results with IoU to generate high-quality pseudo labels for proposals in the target domain. Furthermore, we utilize Grad CAM to identify the discriminative region within a foreground proposal and enhance the discriminability of RPN features for alignment. We conduct extensive experiments across various cross-domain detection scenarios and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches.
