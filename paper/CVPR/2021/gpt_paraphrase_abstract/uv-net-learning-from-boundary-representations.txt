We introduce UV-Net, a new neural network architecture and representation designed to directly handle Boundary representation (B-rep) data from 3D CAD models. B-rep is widely used in industries like design, simulation, and manufacturing for precise CAD modeling. However, using B-rep data with modern machine learning presents unique challenges due to its complex data structure, support for both continuous non-Euclidean geometric entities, and discrete topological entities. In this study, we propose a unified representation for B-rep data that leverages the U and V parameter domain of curves and surfaces to model geometry, along with an adjacency graph to explicitly model topology. This results in an efficient network architecture called UV-Net, which combines image and graph convolutional neural networks in a computationally and memory-efficient manner. To facilitate future research, we provide a synthetic labeled B-rep dataset called SolidLetters, which includes variations in both geometry and topology based on human-designed fonts. Finally, we demonstrate that UV-Net can generalize to supervised and unsupervised tasks across five datasets, outperforming other 3D shape representations like point clouds, voxels, and meshes.
