Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) has made significant progress in recent years, but most studies require prior knowledge of the tracking target, limiting their ability to generalize to new categories. In contrast, Generic Multiple Object Tracking (GMOT), which requires minimal prior information, has been largely overlooked. This paper aims to advance the study of GMOT in three ways. Firstly, we create GMOT-40, the first publicly available dense GMOT dataset, consisting of 40 annotated sequences evenly distributed across 10 object categories. Two tracking protocols are used to evaluate different aspects of tracking algorithms. Secondly, recognizing the lack of dedicated GMOT algorithms, we develop a series of baseline GMOT algorithms. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations on GMOT-40, involving popular MOT algorithms with necessary modifications, as well as the proposed baselines.
