This paper introduces UnrealPerson, a pipeline that utilizes unreal image data to reduce costs in person re-identification (ReID) training and deployment. The pipeline includes a system that generates high-quality synthesized images with controllable distributions. Instance-level annotation accompanies the synthesized data, requiring minimal cost. The paper emphasizes the importance of certain details in image synthesis that significantly impact data quality. When directly transferred to MSMT17, our method achieves a rank-1 accuracy of 38.5%, surpassing previous records using both synthesized and real data. This establishes a strong foundation for unsupervised domain adaptation, as our pre-trained model can easily integrate with state-of-the-art algorithms for improved accuracy. Furthermore, our pipeline allows for flexible adjustment of data distribution to accommodate various ReID scenarios, expanding its application. We have made our data synthesis toolkit and synthesized data available on https://github.com/FlyHighest/UnrealPerson.
