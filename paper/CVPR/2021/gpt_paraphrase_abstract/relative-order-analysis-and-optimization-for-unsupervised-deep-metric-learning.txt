In unsupervised learning of image features without labels, it can be challenging to determine the specific object class a given image belongs to, especially for fine-grained object classes. However, we can reliably compare the similarity between two images. This study proposes a method to leverage this relative order of similarity to learn discriminative features using unsupervised metric learning. Instead of using clustering or self-supervision to create pseudo labels for absolute decisions, which often result in high label error rates, we create reliable relative orders for groups of image samples and train a deep neural network to predict these orders. The relative order prediction network and feature embedding network are closely connected during training, providing mutual constraints to improve the overall metric learning performance. During testing, the predicted relative orders are used as constraints to optimize the generated features and refine image retrieval results using a constrained optimization procedure. Experimental results show that this method, called Relative Orders for Unsupervised Learning (ROUL), significantly enhances the performance of unsupervised deep metric learning.
