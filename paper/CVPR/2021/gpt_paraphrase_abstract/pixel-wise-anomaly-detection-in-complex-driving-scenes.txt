State-of-the-art methods for semantic segmentation lack the ability to detect anomaly instances, which limits their use in safety-critical and complex applications like autonomous driving. Recent studies have focused on utilizing segmentation uncertainty and re-synthesizing images to identify anomalies. In this research, we demonstrate that these two approaches have complementary information and can be combined to achieve more reliable anomaly segmentation. We propose a pixel-wise anomaly detection framework that utilizes uncertainty maps to enhance the performance of existing re-synthesis methods in identifying dissimilarities between input and generated images. Our approach serves as a general framework that can be applied to pre-trained segmentation networks, ensuring accurate anomaly detection without compromising segmentation accuracy. Furthermore, our method outperforms similar approaches and exhibits robustness across various anomaly datasets, as demonstrated by its top-2 performance.
