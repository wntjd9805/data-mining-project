The problem of establishing dense correspondences between images is important, but current methods are often inaccurate in cases of large displacements or homogeneous regions. To address this, we propose a method that estimates a dense flow field between two images while also providing a confidence map indicating the reliability of the prediction. Our approach uses a probabilistic framework that learns both the flow prediction and its uncertainty. We model the predictive distribution using a constrained mixture model, which improves the modeling of accurate flow predictions and outliers. We also develop a specialized architecture and training strategy for robust and generalizable uncertainty prediction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging geometric matching and optical flow datasets, and we demonstrate its usefulness for pose estimation.
