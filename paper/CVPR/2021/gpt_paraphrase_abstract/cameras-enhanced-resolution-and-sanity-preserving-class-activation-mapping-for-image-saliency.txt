CAMERAS is a technique proposed to compute accurate backpropagation saliency maps without the need for external priors and while maintaining map sanity. This method involves multi-scale accumulation and fusion of activation maps and backpropagated gradients to generate precise saliency maps. The high-resolution mapping provided by CAMERAS offers valuable insights into deep visual models, including accurate image saliency, identification of important input features for different models, and discrimination between visually similar objects. Additionally, CAMERAS demonstrates its usefulness in the adversarial setup by reducing the norm of attack signals when focused on the regions identified by the saliency maps. This technique also contributes to the development of new evaluation metrics and a sanity check for the field of backpropagation image saliency.
