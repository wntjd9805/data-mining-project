We introduce QuantumSync, the initial quantum algorithm designed for addressing a synchronization problem in computer vision. Our focus is on permutation synchronization, which involves solving a discrete optimization problem with non-convexity. To begin, we formulate synchronization as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem (QUBO). Although this formulation respects the binary nature of the problem, additional measures are necessary to ensure the obtained result consists of permutations. Therefore, we accomplish two tasks: (i) we demonstrate how permutation constraints can be incorporated into a QUBO problem, and (ii) we solve the constrained QUBO problem using the current generation of adiabatic quantum computers, specifically D-Wave. By employing quantum annealing, we can provide a high probability of achieving global optimality while sampling the energy landscape to obtain confidence estimates. Our proof-of-concept implementation on the adiabatic D-Wave computer illustrates that quantum machines offer a promising approach for solving challenging synchronization problems.
