This abstract discusses the topic of rotation averaging (RA) and its application in 3D reconstruction. The current preferred method for RA is local optimization, but it only guarantees a local optimum. On the other hand, global optimizers ensure global optimality in low noise conditions, but they are inefficient and can be influenced by outliers or high levels of noise. To overcome these limitations, the authors propose a hybrid approach that combines the advantages of both global and local RA methods. They also incorporate a fast view graph filtering as preprocessing to make the approach robust to outliers. The hybrid rotation averaging approach is then applied to incremental Structure from Motion (SfM), where the resulting global rotations are used as regularizers in bundle adjustment. This approach improves the accuracy and robustness of SfM by effectively correcting bad camera poses and reducing drift. Overall, the proposed method demonstrates high practicality.
