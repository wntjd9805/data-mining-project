Hyperspectral photoacoustic (HSPA) spectroscopy is a promising imaging technology that can reveal the absorption distribution of a 3D volume at different wavelengths. However, the scanning process required by HSPA devices in both spatial and spectral domains is time-consuming, and the acquired data often suffer from complex noise. These factors greatly diminish the usability of HSPA. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the feasibility of restoring incomplete and noisy 4D HSPA data. In this study, we analyze the reliability of data in the depth and spectral domains and utilize this analysis to uncover inherent data correlations. Based on these findings, we develop an algorithm to restore 4D HSPA cubes. Experimental results using real data confirm that our proposed method successfully achieves satisfactory restoration outcomes.
