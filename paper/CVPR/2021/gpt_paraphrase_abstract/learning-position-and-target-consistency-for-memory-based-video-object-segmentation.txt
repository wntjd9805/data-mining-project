This study focuses on the problem of semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS). Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of memory-based approaches for video object segmentation, particularly through pixel-level matching in both spatial and temporal dimensions. However, these approaches overlook the sequential order of frames and fail to utilize object-level knowledge from the target. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework called LCM (Learn position and target Consistency framework for Memory-based video object segmentation). LCM employs a memory mechanism to globally retrieve pixels while also learning position consistency to enhance segmentation reliability. The learned location response facilitates better differentiation between the target and distractors. Additionally, LCM incorporates an object-level relationship from the target to maintain target consistency, thereby improving its robustness against error drifting. Experimental results demonstrate that LCM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DAVIS and Youtube-VOS benchmark datasets. Furthermore, our approach ranks first in the DAVIS 2020 challenge for semi-supervised VOS task.
