Despite the success of Siamese-based trackers, their performance is still unsatisfactory in complicated scenarios with distractors. We propose a new Siamese relation network that consists of two efficient modules: Relation Detector (RD) and Reﬁnement Module (RM). RD learns to filter distractors from the background, while RM integrates RD into the Siamese framework to generate accurate tracking results. Additionally, we employ a contrastive training strategy to improve the tracker's discriminability and robustness by learning to match the same target and distinguish different objects. Our tracker achieves accurate results in the presence of background clutters, fast motion, and occlusion. Experimental results on five benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, outperforming state-of-the-art trackers. The code is available at the provided GitHub link.Figure 1 shows the tracking results of our Siamese relation network compared to two state-of-the-art trackers in VOT2018. Our tracker, equipped with the Relation Detector and Reﬁnement Module, exhibits greater robustness to similar distractors, appearance changes, and complex backgrounds, resulting in more accurate results. Figure 4 demonstrates the ability of our tracker to filter distractors from the target region.
