This paper introduces a new dataset called SUTD-TrafficQA, which consists of 10,080 real-world videos and 62,535 annotated question-answer pairs. The dataset is designed for evaluating the cognitive capability of models in understanding complex traffic scenarios. The authors propose six challenging reasoning tasks that cover various traffic situations to assess the models' ability to reason about different events. Additionally, they present a novel efficient glimpse network called Eclipse, which uses dynamic inference to achieve reliable video reasoning while reducing computation costs. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches. The project page with the dataset and code is available at https://github.com/SUTDCV/SUTD-TrafficQA.
