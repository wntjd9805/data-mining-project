This study introduces a novel approach called ManiDP for dynamic pruning of redundant filters in neural networks. Unlike existing methods that independently identify effective sub-networks for each input instance, ManiDP leverages the relationship between different inputs to maximize redundancy excavation. The proposed method embeds manifold information of all instances into the space of pruned networks, aligning the manifold relationship between instances and sub-networks during training. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that ManiDP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational cost. For instance, it achieves a 55.3% reduction in FLOPs for ResNet-34 on ImageNet with only a 0.57% top-1 accuracy degradation.
