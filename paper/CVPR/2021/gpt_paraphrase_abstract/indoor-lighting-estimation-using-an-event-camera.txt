This abstract discusses the limitations of image-based methods for indoor lighting estimation, specifically the issue of intensity-distance ambiguity. To address this problem, the paper proposes a new setup utilizing an event camera. This setup helps alleviate the ambiguity and allows for the estimation of the distance of a light source, which is a well-posed problem in this context. The paper introduces two methods, an optimization-based approach and a learning-based approach, to estimate the distance of the light source. Experimental results demonstrate that these approaches not only achieve superior performance in indoor lighting estimation, particularly for close lights, but also significantly mitigate the intensity-distance ambiguity. The abstract also mentions the use of a light source, BRDF (bidirectional reflectance distribution function), diffuse reflection, event streams, a sphere, and an event camera.
