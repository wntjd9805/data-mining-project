We propose a novel method called Mem3D for 3D object reconstruction from single-view images. Existing methods rely solely on image features, which leads to poor reconstruction quality when dealing with noisy backgrounds and occlusions. To address this, Mem3D utilizes shape priors stored in a memory network to supplement missing information in the image. The shape priors are in the form of "image-voxel" pairs, and a voxel triplet loss function is introduced to retrieve precise 3D shapes related to the input image. Additionally, an LSTM-based shape encoder extracts information from retrieved 3D shapes, aiding in reconstructing heavily occluded or complex objects. Experimental results on ShapeNet and Pix3D datasets demonstrate that Mem3D significantly improves reconstruction quality and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
