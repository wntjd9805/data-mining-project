This study focuses on single domain generalization, which involves training a model to perform well on unseen domains with only one domain's data. Previous research has explored adversarial domain augmentation (ADA) to enhance the model's generalization ability. However, the impact of normalization statistics on domain generalization has not been thoroughly investigated. To address this gap, the authors propose a novel normalization approach called adaptive standardization and rescaling normalization (ASR-Norm). ASR-Norm utilizes neural networks to learn both standardization and rescaling statistics. This method can be considered a more generic form of traditional normalization techniques. When combined with ADA, ASR-Norm adapts its statistics to the data from different domains, thereby improving the model's generalization performance across domains, particularly in cases where the target domain significantly differs from the source domain.Experimental results demonstrate that ASR-Norm consistently enhances the state-of-the-art ADA approaches by average improvements of 1.6%, 2.7%, and 6.3% on the Digits, CIFAR-10-C, and PACS benchmarks, respectively. Importantly, the benefits provided by ASR-Norm are independent of the chosen ADA method, making it a versatile tool for improving domain generalization in various scenarios.
