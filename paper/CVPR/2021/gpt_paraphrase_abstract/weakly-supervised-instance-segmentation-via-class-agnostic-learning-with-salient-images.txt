We propose a solution for weakly-supervised instance segmentation called BoxCaseg, which is based on humans' ability to accurately outline the boundaries of unknown objects. The BoxCaseg model is trained using a combination of box-supervised images and salient images in a multi-task learning approach. The salient images provide precise object localization guidance for the box-supervised images. We refine the object masks predicted by a pretrained BoxCaseg model using a merged and dropped strategy to create proxy ground truth for training a Mask R-CNN for weakly-supervised instance segmentation. By using only 7991 salient images, our weakly-supervised Mask R-CNN performs similarly to a fully-supervised Mask R-CNN on PASCAL VOC and outperforms previous state-of-the-art box-supervised instance segmentation methods on COCO.
