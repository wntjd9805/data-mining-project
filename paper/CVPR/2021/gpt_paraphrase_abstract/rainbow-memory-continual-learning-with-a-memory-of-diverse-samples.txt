Continual learning is a realistic scenario for AI models, but the prevailing approach of disjoint sets of classes as tasks is artificial and less realistic. Instead, we focus on a more realistic and practical scenario where tasks have blurry boundaries and share classes. To address this, we propose Rainbow Memory (RM), a memory management strategy that enhances sample diversity using per-sample classification uncertainty and data augmentation. Through extensive empirical validations on various datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, we demonstrate that RM significantly improves accuracy in blurry continual learning setups. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods by large margins despite its simplicity. The code and data splits for RM are available at https://github.com/clovaai/rainbow-memory.
