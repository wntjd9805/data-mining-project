This paper introduces a method for facial expression analysis that focuses on extracting a compact and identity-ignored representation of expressions. The authors propose a Deviation Learning Network (DLN) that utilizes a pseudo-siamese structure to extract a feature vector representing the deviation from the identity. To simplify the optimization process, DLN employs a high-order polynomial to project the high-dimensional features to a low-dimensional manifold. To account for label noise, a crowd layer is added to DLN for robust embedding extraction. Additionally, hierarchical annotation is used for data augmentation to achieve a more compact representation. The authors evaluate their facial expression embedding on the FEC validation set and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in terms of fine-grained and identity-invariant properties. They also conduct extensive experiments to showcase the quality of their expression embedding for expression recognition, image retrieval, and face manipulation.
