Specular highlight detection and removal are challenging tasks that have seen recent progress with the use of synthetic training data. However, existing methods are often specialized for either detection or removal and struggle when applied to real-world images. In this paper, we propose a new network that addresses this issue by detecting and removing highlights in natural images. To bridge the gap between synthetic training data and real test images, we introduce a dataset containing 16K real images with corresponding ground truths for highlight detection and removal. Utilizing this dataset, we develop a multi-task network that combines highlight detection and removal, leveraging a new specular highlight image formation model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets and our new dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods in both highlight detection and removal.
