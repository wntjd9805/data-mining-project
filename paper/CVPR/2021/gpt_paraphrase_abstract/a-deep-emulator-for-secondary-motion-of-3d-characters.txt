We propose a learning-based approach to improve the animation of 3D characters by adding realistic secondary motion effects. Our method utilizes a neural network that encodes local patches of a character simulation mesh and predicts new vertex positions based on the current accelerations, velocities, and positions. This network is independent of the mesh topology and can work with different shapes of 3D character meshes. We also incorporate per-vertex constraints and material properties to easily adjust the dynamics in different parts of the mesh. Our method is evaluated on various character meshes and motion sequences, showing that it is over 30 times more efficient than physically based simulation and outperforms other fast approximation solutions.
