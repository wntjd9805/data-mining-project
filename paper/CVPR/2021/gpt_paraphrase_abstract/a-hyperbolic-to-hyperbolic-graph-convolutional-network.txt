This study introduces a new type of graph convolutional network called H2H-GCN, which operates directly on hyperbolic manifolds. Unlike existing methods that rely on tangent spaces as an approximation, H2H-GCN utilizes a manifold-preserving graph convolution technique. It consists of a hyperbolic feature transformation that ensures node representations remain on the hyperbolic manifold by imposing an orthogonal constraint, and a hyperbolic neighborhood aggregation that updates node representations using the Einstein midpoint. By avoiding the distortions caused by tangent space approximations, H2H-GCN maintains the global hyperbolic structure. Experimental results demonstrate that H2H-GCN achieves significant improvements in link prediction, node classification, and graph classification tasks.
