Designing a suitable representation for arbitrary-shaped text detection is a major challenge. Current methods use image spatial domain models or contour point sequences, but these have limitations such as expensive post-processing or inability to handle highly-curved shapes. To address these issues, we propose a novel method called Fourier Contour Embedding (FCE) that represents text contours as compact signatures in the Fourier domain. We also introduce FCENet, which consists of a backbone, feature pyramid networks, and a simple post-processing using Inverse Fourier Transformation and Non-Maximum Suppression. Unlike previous methods, FCENet predicts compact Fourier signatures and then reconstructs text contours during testing. Extensive experiments show that FCE accurately and robustly fits contours of scene texts, even with highly-curved shapes. FCENet demonstrates good generalization and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on challenging datasets, particularly for highly-curved text.
