The Capsule Network is believed to be more robust than Convolutional Networks, but there have been no comprehensive comparisons between the two and it is unclear which components in the CapsNet contribute to its robustness. This study examines the unique features of CapsNet that differ from typical ConvNets used for image classification. Five major differences are identified: a transformation process, a dynamic routing layer, a squashing function, a marginal loss instead of cross-entropy loss, and an additional class-conditional reconstruction loss for regularization. Ablation studies are conducted to evaluate three types of robustness: affine transformation, overlapping digits, and semantic representation. The results show that some designs considered crucial to CapsNet actually harm its robustness, such as the dynamic routing layer and the transformation process, while others are beneficial. Based on these findings, enhanced ConvNets are proposed by incorporating the essential components of CapsNet's success. These simple ConvNets achieve better robustness than CapsNet.
