Integrated Gradients (IG) is a widely used technique for attributing features in deep neural networks. However, it often generates noisy pixel attributions in unrelated regions when applied to visual models. Previous attempts to address this issue focused on reducing the noise in the resulting attributions. In this study, we identify one of the causes of this problem - the accumulation of noise along the IG path. To mitigate this noise, we propose adapting the attribution path itself by considering not only the image but also the model being explained. We introduce Adaptive Path Methods (APMs) as a generalization of path methods, with Guided IG as a specific example of an APM. Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate that Guided IG produces saliency maps that are better aligned with the model's prediction and the input image. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments show that Guided IG outperforms other related methods in nearly all scenarios.
