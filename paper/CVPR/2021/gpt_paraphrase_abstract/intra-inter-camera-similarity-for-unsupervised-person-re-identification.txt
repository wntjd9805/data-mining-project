This study addresses the issue in unsupervised person Re-Identification (Re-ID) methods where pseudo-labels are produced based on feature similarity without considering the differences in camera distributions. This often leads to decreased accuracy in label computation across cameras. To overcome this challenge, the study proposes a novel intra-inter camera similarity approach for pseudo-label generation. The process involves two stages: intra-camera computation and inter-camera computation. In the intra-camera computation, CNN features are used to calculate similarity within each camera. Pseudo-labels generated from different cameras are then used to train the re-ID model in a multi-branch network. In the second stage, the classification scores of each sample on different cameras are treated as a new feature vector. This new feature helps reduce the distribution discrepancy among cameras and generate more reliable pseudo-labels. The re-ID model is trained using both intra-camera and inter-camera pseudo-labels in two separate stages. Remarkably, this simple intra-inter camera similarity approach achieves high performance on multiple datasets, surpassing recent unsupervised works by more than 9% and comparable to the latest transfer learning methods that utilize additional annotations.
