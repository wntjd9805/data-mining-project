This abstract discusses the rapid development of image super-resolution (SR) techniques using deep neural networks. It acknowledges the difficulty in interpreting these networks and the lack of research on understanding them. The paper introduces a novel attribution approach called local attribution map (LAM) to determine the input pixels that strongly influence the SR results. The LAM approach uses a blurred image as the baseline input and adopts a progressive blurring function as the path function. The findings show that SR networks with a wider range of involved input pixels achieve better performance, attention networks and non-local networks extract features from a wider range of input pixels, the receptive field is large enough for most deep networks, and SR networks are more likely to notice textures with regular stripes or grids rather than complex semantics. This work opens new directions for designing SR networks and interpreting low-level vision deep models.
