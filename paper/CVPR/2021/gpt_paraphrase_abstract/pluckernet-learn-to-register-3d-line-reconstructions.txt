This paper presents a novel approach for aligning partially-overlapped line reconstructions in 3D space. The method utilizes a neural network with three interconnected modules. The first module, based on a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), extracts discriminative features and matchabilities from the PlÂ¨ucker representations of the lines. These matchabilities indicate the likelihood of each line having a match. The second module employs an Optimal Transport (OT) layer to estimate a 2D joint probability matrix using the line-wise features and matchabilities from two views. Each item in the matrix describes the likelihood of a line pair being a match. In the third module, line pairs with the highest matching probabilities are inputted into a 2-line minimal solver within a RANSAC framework to estimate a six Degree-of-Freedom (6-DoF) rigid transformation. Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher registration precision (rotation and translation) compared to baseline approaches.
