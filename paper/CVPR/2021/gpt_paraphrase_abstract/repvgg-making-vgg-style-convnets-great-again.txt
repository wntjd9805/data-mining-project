We introduce RepVGG, a convolutional neural network architecture that consists of a VGG-like body during inference, utilizing only 3 Ã— 3 convolution and ReLU operations. However, the training-time model employs a multi-branch topology. This separation of the training-time and inference-time architecture is achieved through a structural re-parameterization technique. RepVGG achieves an unprecedented top-1 accuracy of over 80% on ImageNet, surpassing plain models. Additionally, RepVGG models exhibit significantly faster performance, running 83% faster than ResNet-50 and 101% faster than ResNet-101 on an NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU, while maintaining higher accuracy. Moreover, RepVGG demonstrates a favorable trade-off between accuracy and speed compared to advanced models like EfficientNet and RegNet.
