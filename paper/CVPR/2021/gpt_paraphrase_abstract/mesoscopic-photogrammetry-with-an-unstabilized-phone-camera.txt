We introduce a novel photogrammetric technique that allows for accurate quantitative 3D imaging at the mesoscopic scale using a smartphone camera without any additional hardware. Our approach involves registering and stitching multiple images acquired by the smartphone camera, estimating a height map that corrects for radial deformation, and orthorectifying each camera image for plane-plus-parallax registration. The height maps are generated using an untrained encoder-decoder convolutional neural network, which helps eliminate reconstruction artifacts. Additionally, our method estimates the camera's 6D pose and distortion using a nonparametric model, which is crucial for mesoscopic applications with smartphone cameras not designed for short working distances. We also propose strategies to reduce computation time and memory usage, which can be applied to other multi-frame registration problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on various samples, including painting brushstrokes, circuit boards, and seeds, using sequences of high-resolution images captured by an unstabilized smartphone camera.
