This paper addresses the problem of adapting a pre-trained model of human mesh reconstruction to new domains, specifically out-of-domain streaming videos. Previous methods using the parametric SMPL model have struggled in new domains due to domain-specific attributes such as camera parameters, bone lengths, backgrounds, and occlusions. The authors propose a solution that dynamically fine-tunes the source model on test video streams, incorporating additional temporal constraints to bridge the domain gaps without overfitting the 2D information of individual frames. However, a challenge arises in reconciling the 2D and temporal constraints. To overcome this, the authors introduce a new training algorithm called Bilevel Online Adaptation (BOA), which divides the optimization process into two steps: weight probe and weight update. The effectiveness of BOA is demonstrated through experiments on two human mesh reconstruction benchmarks, where it achieves state-of-the-art results.
