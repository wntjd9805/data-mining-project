Recently, person re-identification (ReID) has greatly benefited from data-driven methods. However, these methods are not yet reliable enough for real-world use due to limitations in existing benchmarks. These benchmarks have insufficient generalization capabilities, limited data scale, variations in capture conditions, and diverse appearances. To address these issues, we have created a new dataset called Person30K, which has distinct features such as a large scale with 1.38 million images of 30K identities, a large capture system with 6,497 cameras deployed at 89 different sites, and diverse samples including varied backgrounds and person poses. Additionally, we propose a domain generalization ReID method called DMG-Net, which utilizes meta-learning in the training procedure and metric space learning. We have designed a meta-training procedure and a meta-discrimination loss to improve model generalization and discrimination capabilities. Through comprehensive experiments, we have confirmed the effectiveness of our DMG-Net.
