This paper introduces a new approach for semi-supervised mammographic mass detection using soft image-level labels generated from diagnosis reports. Traditional fully supervised training for mass detection is expensive and time-consuming due to the need for pixel-level annotations. The proposed framework utilizes a RoBERTa-based natural language processing model called Mammo-RoBERTa to generate soft labels from fully labeled data and associated mammography reports. The framework starts with a fully supervised model trained on pixel-level masks and then iteratively refines itself using the weakly labeled data with image-level soft labels in a self-training manner. A novel sample selection strategy is employed to identify the most informative samples for each iteration based on the model's output and the soft labels. To ensure effective classification, a soft cross-entropy loss and a soft focal loss are designed for image-level and pixel-level classification respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed semi-supervised framework improves mass detection accuracy compared to the supervised baseline, and even outperforms previous state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches with weakly labeled data by a significant margin.
