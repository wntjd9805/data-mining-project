This work introduces a new task called Part-aware Panoptic Segmentation (PPS), which aims to understand a scene at multiple levels of abstraction by combining scene parsing and part parsing. To support this task, consistent annotations are provided for Cityscapes and Pascal VOC datasets. Additionally, a single metric called Part-aware Panoptic Quality (PartPQ) is proposed to evaluate PPS. Baselines are established by merging the results of existing state-of-the-art methods for panoptic segmentation and part segmentation using the metric and annotations. The importance of different levels of abstraction in this task is evaluated through several experiments.
