This study explores the challenging task of human image completion, aiming to restore missing parts of the human body with a realistic shape. Traditional methods cannot restore these unique body parts by borrowing textures from other visible regions. Therefore, the researchers propose two types of learned priors to compensate for the damaged region. The first is a structure prior, which uses a human parsing map to represent the body structure. The second is a structure-texture correlation prior, which utilizes a structure and texture memory bank to encode common body structures and texture patterns. By leveraging these memory banks, the model can query and retrieve similar structure and texture patterns from visible regions to introduce reasonable structures and textures to the corrupted region. Additionally, the researchers propose multi-scale structure discriminators to restore a plausible topological structure, considering that multiple potential human shapes may underlie the corrupted region. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through experiments on various large-scale benchmarks. The study focuses on recovering the unique human body region in images by borrowing structure and texture information from a learned memory, leading to more realistic and plausible image generation.
