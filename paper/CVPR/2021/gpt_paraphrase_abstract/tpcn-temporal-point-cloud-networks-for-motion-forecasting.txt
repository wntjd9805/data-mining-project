We present Temporal Point Cloud Networks (TPCN), a new framework for trajectory prediction that combines spatial and temporal learning. Unlike existing methods that use 2D images or graph representations, TPCN utilizes point cloud learning to capture both spatial and temporal information. In the spatial dimension, agents are treated as unordered point sets, allowing us to apply point cloud learning techniques to model their locations. To account for kinematic and motion information, we introduce dynamic temporal learning to capture agents' motion over time. Experimental results on the Argoverse motion forecasting benchmark demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.
