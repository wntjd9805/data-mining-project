We present the YOLOv4 object detection neural network, which utilizes the CSP approach and can be scaled up or down for application in both small and large networks. Our approach not only modifies the depth, width, and resolution of the network but also its structure. The YOLOv4-large model achieves outstanding results on the MS COCO dataset, with an average precision (AP) of 55.5% (73.4% AP50) and a speed of approximately 16 frames per second (FPS) on Tesla V100. By employing test time augmentation, the YOLOv4-large model achieves an AP of 56.0% (73.3% AP50). Remarkably, this is currently the highest accuracy achieved on the COCO dataset among all published works. On the other hand, the YOLOv4-tiny model achieves an AP of 22.0% (42.0% AP50) at a rapid speed of approximately 443 FPS on RTX 2080Ti. By utilizing TensorRT, a batch size of 4, and FP16-precision, the YOLOv4-tiny model achieves an impressive speed of 1774 FPS.
