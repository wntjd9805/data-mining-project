In the super-resolution (SR) problem, a low-resolution (LR) image can be mapped to multiple high-resolution (HR) images. However, current learning-based SR algorithms are trained to map LR images to the corresponding ground truth (GT) HR images in the training dataset. This approach penalizes the algorithm when the output does not exactly match the GT target, even if the output is a valid solution according to the SR framework. This is a bigger challenge in blind SR, where unknown blur kernels make the problem more ill-posed. To address this, we propose a different approach called adaptive target SR. We generate an adaptive target by transforming the original GT target to match the output of the SR network. This adaptive target allows the SR algorithm to handle the ill-posed nature of the problem by accepting a variety of valid solutions. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm, particularly in improving the perceptual quality of HR outputs.
