Existing methods for lane marker detection typically rely on predicting the overall structure and deriving parametric curves through post-processing. However, this approach requires high-dimensional outputs from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to accurately model complex lane line shapes, leading to a higher demand for model capacity and training data.   In contrast, we propose a novel lane marker detection solution called FOLOLane that focuses on modeling local patterns and predicting global structures in a bottom-up manner. Our approach utilizes two separate heads in the CNN: the first head predicts the existence of key points, while the second head refines the location of these key points within a local range and correlates them with other key points on the same lane line. This approach aligns with the finite geometric variations and spatial coverage of lane markers, resulting in more stable training and improved generalization.  To enhance efficiency, we also introduce an efficiency-oriented decoding algorithm, as well as a greedy one, which achieve a 36% reduction in runtime with negligible performance degradation. Both decoding algorithms integrate local information into the global geometry of lane markers.  Remarkably, despite its simple network architecture design, our proposed method outperforms all existing methods on public datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results while maintaining real-time processing capabilities.
