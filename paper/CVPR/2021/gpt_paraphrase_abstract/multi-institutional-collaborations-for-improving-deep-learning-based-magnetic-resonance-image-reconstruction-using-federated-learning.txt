The reconstruction of magnetic resonance (MR) images from under-sampled data is crucial in clinical applications. Deep learning methods have shown great performance in MR image reconstruction, but they require a large amount of data that is challenging to collect and share due to cost and privacy concerns. To address this, we propose a federated learning (FL) approach that leverages MR data from different institutions while protecting patient privacy. However, models trained with FL may not generalize well due to variations in data from different institutions. To overcome this, we introduce a cross-site modeling technique that aligns the learned features from different source sites with the target site. We conduct extensive experiments to gain insights into FL for MR image reconstruction, and the results show that our framework is a promising way to utilize multi-institutional data without compromising patient privacy. The code for our framework is available at the provided GitHub link. Figure 1 illustrates the ground truth MR images, zero-filled images, and reconstructed images from different datasets, as well as t-SNE plots showing the distribution of latent features with and without cross-site modeling.
