This paper presents a novel approach to image steganography called the Invertible Steganography Network (ISN) that aims to increase the payload capacity while maintaining the stealthiness of the container image. The ISN treats steganography and hidden image recovery as inverse problems and utilizes a single invertible network to embed and extract hidden images. By sharing all parameters, the ISN efficiently generates high-quality container images and revealed hidden images. The capacity of image steganography is enhanced by increasing the number of channels in the hidden image branch. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ISN achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both visual quality and quantitative comparisons.
