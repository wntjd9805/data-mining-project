We address the challenge of recognizing places using point cloud data by introducing a novel network called SOE-Net. This network incorporates self-attention and orientation encoding to fully explore the relationships between points and incorporate long-range context into local descriptors. The PointOE module captures local information from eight orientations for each point, while a self-attention unit captures long-range feature dependencies among local descriptors. Additionally, we propose a new loss function called HPHN quadruplet loss, which outperforms commonly used metric learning losses. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our network achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Yan-Xia/SOE-Net.
