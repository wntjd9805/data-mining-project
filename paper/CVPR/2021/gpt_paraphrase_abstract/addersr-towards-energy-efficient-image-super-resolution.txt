This research paper investigates the use of adder neural networks (AdderNets) for the single image super-resolution problem. AdderNets differ from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by using additions instead of multiplications for calculating output features, resulting in lower energy consumption. However, transferring the success of AdderNets in large-scale image classification to image super-resolution is challenging due to differences in calculation methods. Adder operations struggle to learn the identity mapping required for image processing tasks, and they cannot guarantee the functionality of high-pass filters. To address these issues, the study analyzes the relationship between adder operations and the identity mapping and introduces shortcuts to improve the performance of super-resolution models using adder networks. Additionally, a learnable power activation is developed to adjust the feature distribution and enhance details. Experimental results on benchmark models and datasets show that our image super-resolution models using AdderNets achieve comparable performance and visual quality to CNN baselines while reducing energy consumption by approximately 2.5 times.
