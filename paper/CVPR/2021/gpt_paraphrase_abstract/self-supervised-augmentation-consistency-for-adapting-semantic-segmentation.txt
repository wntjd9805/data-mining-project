We present a practical and accurate approach to domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. Unlike previous methods, we do not rely on complex adversarial objectives, network ensembles, or style transfer. Instead, we use standard data augmentation techniques such as adding noise, flipping, and scaling, while ensuring consistency in semantic predictions across these transformations. Our lightweight self-supervised framework trains on co-evolving pseudo labels without the need for additional training rounds. Despite its simplicity, our approach achieves significant improvements in segmentation accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods, regardless of the backbone architecture or adaptation scenario.
