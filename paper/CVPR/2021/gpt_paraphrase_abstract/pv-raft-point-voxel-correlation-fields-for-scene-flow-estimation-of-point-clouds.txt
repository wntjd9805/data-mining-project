This paper introduces a method called PV-RAFT for estimating scene flow from point clouds. Scene flow estimation from point clouds is challenging due to the irregular and unordered nature of point clouds. Extracting features from all-pairs fields in the 3D space is particularly difficult. To address this challenge, the authors propose point-voxel correlation fields that capture both local and long-range dependencies of point pairs. They use the K-Nearest Neighbors search to capture point-based correlations and voxelize point clouds in a multi-scale manner to model long-range correspondences. By integrating these two types of correlations, the PV-RAFT method can handle both small and large displacements. The proposed method is evaluated on the FlyingThings3D and KITTI Scene Flow 2015 datasets, and the results demonstrate that PV-RAFT outperforms existing methods significantly. The authors illustrate the point-voxel correlation fields in Figure 1, showing how they extract point-based correlations and model long-range interactions using voxels centered around a source point. Overall, PV-RAFT captures all-pairs dependencies effectively for scene flow estimation.
