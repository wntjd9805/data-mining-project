This paper focuses on the design and computation of ensemble diversity in neural network ensembles. Ensemble diversity is important as it promotes high failure independence and improves overall ensemble accuracy. The paper makes three original contributions. First, it identifies the problems with existing diversity metrics and their poor correlation with ensemble accuracy. Second, it introduces focal model based ensemble diversity metrics called FQ-diversity metrics, which significantly improve the correlation between high ensemble diversity and high ensemble accuracy. Third, it proposes a diversity fusion method called EQ-diversity metric, which integrates the top three FQ-diversity metrics. Experimental results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the FQ and EQ diversity metrics in selecting high diversity ensemble teams and boosting overall ensemble accuracy.
