Graph-neural-networks (GNN) is a popular method for few-shot learning. However, the current approach of computing affinity in GNN, which is based on pairwise features, does not fully utilize the semantic labels associated with these features. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called Mutual CRF-GNN (MCGN). In MCGN, we leverage the labels and features of support data to infer GNN affinities in a principled and probabilistic manner using a Conditional Random Field (CRF). The CRF is conditioned on the labels and features of the support data to infer an affinity in the label space, which is then used as the node-wise affinity in the GNN. The GNN and CRF mutually contribute to each other in MCGN, with the CRF providing valuable affinity information to the GNN and the GNN providing better features for inferring affinity in the CRF. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the miniImageNet, tieredImageNet, and CIFAR-FS datasets in both 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot settings.
