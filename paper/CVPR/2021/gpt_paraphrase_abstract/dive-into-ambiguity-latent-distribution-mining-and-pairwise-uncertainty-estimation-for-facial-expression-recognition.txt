Facial Expression Recognition (FER) faces challenges due to subjective annotation and the similarity between facial expressions of different classes. This paper proposes a solution called ambiguity.DMUE to address the issue of annotation ambiguity. The proposed method tackles this problem from two perspectives: latent Distribution Mining and pairwise Uncertainty Estimation. To better understand the latent distribution in the label space, an auxiliary multi-branch learning framework is introduced. Additionally, the ambiguity extent in the instance space is estimated by fully exploiting the pairwise relationship of semantic features between instances. Importantly, this method is independent of backbone architectures and does not add any extra burden during inference. The proposed DMUE consistently achieves leading performance on popular real-world benchmarks and synthetic noisy datasets.
