We demonstrate that explicitly incorporating composition rules into the modeling process improves image cropping. Image cropping is an automated method for achieving aesthetic composition in professional photography. Previous attempts at modeling this process have implicitly captured professional knowledge by ranking potential candidates. We propose a discriminative approach to learning these rules and explicitly integrating them into the model. We introduce the concept of a key composition map (KCM) to encode these rules, which reveals the underlying principles shared by different composition rules and informs the cropping model about important elements in composition. Using the KCM, we introduce a new paradigm for cropping based on composition and design a network to implement composition-aware image cropping. Through extensive experiments on two benchmarks, we demonstrate that our approach enables effective, interpretable, and efficient image cropping.
