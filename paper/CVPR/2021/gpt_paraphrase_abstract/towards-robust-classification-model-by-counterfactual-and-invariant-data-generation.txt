Machine learning applications have seen significant success in various fields, but many approaches lack robustness and rely on spurious correlations for predictions. Spuriousness refers to when certain features are correlated with labels without being causally related, hindering models from generalizing to new environments where these correlations do not hold. This study focuses on image classification and proposes two data generation processes to reduce spuriousness. By utilizing human annotations of the causal features responsible for the labels (e.g. bounding boxes), the causal set is modified to create counterfactual images that no longer possess the same label. Additionally, non-causal features are altered to generate images that are still recognized as the original labels, aiding in the development of models that are invariant to these features. In various challenging datasets, these data generation techniques outperform existing methods in terms of accuracy when spurious correlations are absent, and they also enhance the emphasis on causal features, leading to better explanations.
