The performance of offline trained siamese trackers is becoming increasingly difficult to improve due to the limited information in the initial template. While existing trackers use template updating mechanisms, these methods are time-consuming and complex, hindering real-time tracking. To address this issue, we propose a new tracking framework that utilizes a space-time memory network to adapt to appearance changes during tracking. Our framework incorporates a memory mechanism to store historical information and guide the tracker to focus on informative regions. Additionally, our tracker uses pixel-level similarity computation to generate more accurate bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our tracker outperforms state-of-the-art methods in real-time tracking, achieving a frame rate of 37 FPS. The code for our tracker is available at https://github.com/fzh0917/STMTrack.
