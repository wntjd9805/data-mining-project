We propose a novel meta-regularization framework for learning-based image registration. Current methods use high-resolution architectures and explicit regularization to ensure smooth estimated displacements. However, these methods struggle with large deformations. Our approach utilizes advanced meta-regularization based on Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space theory, approximated through a meta-regularization convolutional layer with radially symmetric, positive semi-definite filters. We also develop a method to learn these regularization filters while simultaneously learning to register. Experimental results demonstrate that our method improves anatomical correspondence, reduces folding and tearing, and exhibits better regularization and model generalization compared to existing methods.
