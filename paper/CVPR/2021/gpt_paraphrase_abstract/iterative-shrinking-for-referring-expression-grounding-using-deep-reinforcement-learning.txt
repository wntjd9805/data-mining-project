This paper addresses the problem of localizing a target object based on a query sentence, without using pre-existing object proposals. Existing methods for this task employ a query-image matching approach to determine the target box center, with its width and height predicted separately. However, these methods do not consider the contextual relationship between the target and reference objects, and lack interpretability in their reasoning process. To address these issues, we propose an iterative shrinking mechanism that uses reinforcement learning to determine the shrinking direction, taking into account all contents within the current image patch. Additionally, the sequential shrinking processes allow us to demonstrate how the target is iteratively found. Experimental results show that our proposed method improves accuracy by 4.32% compared to the previous state-of-the-art method on the RefCOCOg dataset, which contains long and complex query sentences with multiple targets referred to by other reference objects.
