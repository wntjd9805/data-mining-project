The problem of selecting the appropriate pretrained network for a target task, known as expert model selection, typically relies on the availability of labeled images and access to powerful probe networks. This study examines the current dependence on these assumptions and proposes algorithms that can handle cases where either assumption fails. In the case of unlabeled data, the study demonstrates that pseudolabels generated by the probe network can still provide sufficient gradients for effective task selection, even when the probe network is trained on unrelated imagery. Additionally, the study introduces the Task Tangent Kernel (TTK), a method that computes embeddings without relying on a probe network. TTK utilizes a kernelized distance across multiple random networks and achieves performance that exceeds other methods using randomly initialized models.
