The dilated convolution is a variation of standard convolution that allows for controlling effective receptive fields and handling large scale variance of objects without increasing computational costs. In this study, we propose a new type of dilated convolution called inception convolution, which introduces independent dilation patterns among different axes, channels, and layers. To effectively learn complex inception convolution based on data, we develop a search algorithm called efficient dilation optimization (EDO). This method operates in a cost-effective and fast manner, especially on large scale datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach consistently improves performance in various tasks such as image recognition, object detection, instance segmentation, human detection, and human pose estimation. For example, by replacing the standard convolution in the ResNet-50 backbone with inception convolution, we achieve a significant improvement in the average precision (AP) of Faster R-CNN from 36.4% to 39.2% on the MS COCO dataset.
