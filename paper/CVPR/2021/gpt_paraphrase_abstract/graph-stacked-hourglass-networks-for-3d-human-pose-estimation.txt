This study presents a new graph convolutional network called Graph Stacked Hourglass Networks for the task of estimating 3D human pose from 2D images. The proposed architecture consists of multiple encoder-decoder layers, where graph-structured features are processed across three different scales of human skeletal representations. This architecture allows the model to learn both local and global features, which are important for accurate 3D human pose estimation. The study also introduces a multi-level feature learning approach using intermediate features of varying depths, which leads to improved performance. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed approach, and the results demonstrate that the model surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods.
