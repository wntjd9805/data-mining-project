PnPL algorithms are widely used in robotic and AR/VR systems for camera localization. However, existing methods either ignore uncertainties or consider only 2D feature detection uncertainties. In our approach, we consider uncertainties in both 3D coordinates and 2D projections of features. We propose PnP(L) solvers based on EPnP and DLS for uncertainty-aware pose estimation. Additionally, we modify motion-only bundle adjustment to account for 3D uncertainties. Through synthetic and real experiments, we demonstrate that our new PnP(L) methods outperform existing methods in terms of translation accuracy. Specifically, on a subset of the KITTI dataset, our methods achieve an 18% increase in mean translation accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art. Moreover, our uncertain refinement technique improves pose accuracy for most solvers, reducing mean translation error by 16% for EPnP.
