This paper introduces SetVAE, a hierarchical variational autoencoder designed for generating set-structured data, specifically point clouds. Generating sets requires understanding both local and global structures at various scales, which is challenging due to the need for permutation invariance. SetVAE addresses this issue by incorporating attentive modules that partition the set and project the partition back to its original size. This hierarchical VAE learns latent variables at multiple scales, capturing the coarse-to-fine dependencies of the set elements while maintaining permutation invariance. The model is evaluated on point cloud generation tasks and achieves competitive performance with smaller model capacity compared to previous approaches. The model's generalization to unseen set sizes and its ability to learn interesting subset relations without supervision are qualitatively demonstrated. The implementation of SetVAE is available at https://github.com/jw9730/setvae.
