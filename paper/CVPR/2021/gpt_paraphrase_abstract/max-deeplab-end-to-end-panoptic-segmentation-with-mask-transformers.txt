We introduce MaX-DeepLab, the first comprehensive model for panoptic segmentation. This model simplifies the current pipeline which relies on sub-tasks and manually designed components. Despite being handled by area experts, these sub-tasks do not fully solve the target task. In contrast, MaX-DeepLab directly predicts class-labeled masks using a mask transformer and is trained with a panoptic quality-inspired loss through bipartite matching. The mask transformer incorporates a dual-path architecture that includes a global memory path alongside a CNN path, enabling direct communication with CNN layers. As a result, MaX-DeepLab achieves a significant 7.1% PQ gain in the box-free regime on the challenging COCO dataset, bridging the gap between box-based and box-free methods for the first time. A slight variation of MaX-DeepLab outperforms DETR by 3.0% PQ with similar parameters and computational requirements. Moreover, MaX-DeepLab achieves a new state-of-the-art performance of 51.3% PQ on the COCO test-dev set without test time augmentation.
