LiDAR R-CNN is a second stage detector designed to enhance existing 3D detection in autonomous driving perception systems using point cloud data. To meet real-time and high precision requirements, the paper introduces a point-based approach instead of the commonly used voxel-based approach. However, the authors identify an overlooked issue in previous work, where applying point-based methods like PointNet can cause the learned features to disregard proposal sizes. The paper addresses this problem by analyzing it in detail and proposing several solutions, which significantly improve performance. The effectiveness of LiDAR R-CNN is demonstrated through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) and KITTI dataset, with various popular detectors. The results highlight the universality and superiority of LiDAR R-CNN, especially when compared to a variant of PointPillars, achieving state-of-the-art performance with minimal additional complexity.
