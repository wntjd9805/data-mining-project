Stereo imaging systems face a challenge in achieving a balance between imaging volume and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) due to the conflicting impact of aperture size on these variables. This study draws inspiration from cameras with extended depth of field (EDOF) and proposes a new learning-based technique to overcome this limitation. The technique involves introducing a phase mask at the aperture plane of the cameras in a stereo imaging system. This phase mask creates a depth-dependent point spread function that is numerically invertible, allowing for the recovery of sharp image texture and stereo correspondence over a significantly extended depth of field compared to conventional stereo.To achieve this, the phase mask pattern, EDOF image reconstruction, and stereo disparity estimation are all trained together using a deep neural network. The proposed approach is analyzed and characterized theoretically, demonstrating a 6Ã— increase in the volume that can be imaged in simulation. Furthermore, an experimental prototype is built and the approach is validated using real-world results obtained from this prototype system.
