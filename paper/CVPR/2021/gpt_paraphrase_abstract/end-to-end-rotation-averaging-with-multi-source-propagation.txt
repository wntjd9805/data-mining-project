This study presents a neural network approach for solving the problem of multiple rotation averaging in Structure-from-Motion (SfM). Traditional methods for this task involve two separate steps: initializing the rotations using a spanning tree and then optimizing them iteratively. However, these methods can be affected by bad initializations due to noisy spanning trees or outliers in the input rotations. To address these issues, the authors propose a unified graph neural network that integrates the initialization and optimization processes. This is achieved through a novel differentiable multi-source propagation module, which leverages image context and geometric information to mitigate the impact of outliers. In contrast to existing methods that initialize rotations based on a single reference node in a top-down manner using a spanning tree, the proposed network initializes rotations based on multiple sources and incorporates information from all neighbors in a differentiable manner. Importantly, the end-to-end formulation of the network also allows for iterative re-weighting of the input rotations at test time, aiming to minimize the influence of outliers and improve estimation accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated on two real-world datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.
