The cost of sewerage infrastructure is surprisingly high in modern society. Currently, sewer pipes are manually inspected for defects, but this process is limited by the availability of qualified inspectors and the time it takes to inspect each pipe. Therefore, there is a need to automate this process. However, computer vision approaches for sewer defect classification have not been as successful as in other fields due to the lack of public datasets. In this study, we introduce a large and publicly available dataset called Sewer-ML, which contains 1.3 million images of sewer defects annotated by professional inspectors from three utility companies over nine years. Along with the dataset, we present a benchmark algorithm and a novel metric for evaluating performance. The benchmark algorithm is a combination of the best-performing algorithms from the sewer defect classification and multi-label classification domains. The novel metric, called F2CIW, takes into account the economic impact of each defect class and is used together with the F1Normal score for normal pipes. The benchmark algorithm achieves an F2CIW score of 55.11% and an F1Normal score of 90.94% on the Sewer-ML dataset, indicating that there is room for improvement.
