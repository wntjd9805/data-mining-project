Weakly supervised semantic segmentation is a technique that uses a classifier to identify pixels belonging to a specific object. However, this approach often focuses only on a small discriminative region of the object. To overcome this limitation, a method called AdvCAM is proposed. AdvCAM is an attribution map of an image that is manipulated to increase the classification score. Unlike adversarial attacks, which perturb images along pixel gradients in a specific direction, AdvCAM perturbs images in the opposite direction. This manipulation forces initially non-discriminative regions to become involved in subsequent classifications, resulting in attribution maps that identify more regions of the target object.To improve the accuracy of the attribution maps, a new regularization procedure is introduced. This procedure prevents incorrect attributions of regions unrelated to the target object and limits the attributions of regions that already have high scores. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 test images demonstrate that the proposed method achieves mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) scores of 68.0 and 76.9 for weakly and semi-supervised semantic segmentation, respectively, which outperform previous state-of-the-art methods. The code for AdvCAM is publicly available at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/jbeomlee93/AdvCAM.
