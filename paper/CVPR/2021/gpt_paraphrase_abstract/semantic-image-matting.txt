Previous approaches to natural image matting have not considered the underlying causes of matting due to different foreground semantics. This paper proposes a framework that incorporates semantic classification of matting regions to improve alpha mattes. The authors introduce a semantic trimap, obtained through patch structure analysis, which extends the conventional trimap. They also develop a multi-class discriminator to regulate alpha prediction at the semantic level, and content-sensitive weights to balance different regularization losses. Experimental results demonstrate that their method outperforms other approaches and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, the authors provide a large-scale Semantic Image Matting Dataset, ensuring data balance across different semantic classes. The code and dataset can be accessed on their GitHub repository.
