Accurate ranking of candidate detections is crucial for achieving high performance in dense object detectors. Existing methods use classification scores or a combination of classification and predicted localization scores to rank candidates, but these options do not provide a reliable ranking, leading to degraded detection performance. This paper proposes a new approach called IoU-Aware Classification Score (IACS) that combines object presence confidence and localization accuracy to achieve a more accurate ranking of candidate detections. The paper introduces a new loss function called Varifocal Loss to train a dense object detector to predict the IACS. Additionally, a new star-shaped bounding box feature representation is proposed for IACS prediction and bounding box refinement. These two new components, along with a bounding box refinement branch, are integrated into an IoU-aware dense object detector called VarifocalNet (VFNet) based on the FCOS+ATSS architecture. Experimental results on MS COCO dataset demonstrate that VFNet consistently outperforms the strong baseline by approximately 2.0 average precision (AP) with different backbones. The best model, VFNet-X-1200 with Res2Net-101-DCN, achieves a single-model single-scale AP of 55.1 on COCO test-dev, setting a new state-of-the-art among various object detectors. The code for VFNet is available at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/hyz-xmaster/VarifocalNet.
