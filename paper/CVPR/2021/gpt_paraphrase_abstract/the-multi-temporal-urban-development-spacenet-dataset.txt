Satellite imagery analytics have various applications in human development and disaster response, especially when using time series methods. One important application is quantifying population statistics, which is crucial for many United Nations Sustainable Development Goals Indicators. However, there is a lack of effective Civil Registration systems in over 100 countries. To address this issue and develop novel computer vision methods for time series data, we introduce the Multi-Temporal Urban Development SpaceNet (MUDS) dataset, also known as SpaceNet 7. This dataset is open source and includes medium resolution satellite imagery mosaics with a resolution of 4.0m. It consists of approximately 24 images, captured monthly, covering over 100 unique geographies. The dataset covers a total area of over 40,000 km2 and provides exhaustive polygon labels of building footprints, with more than 11 million individual annotations. Each building is assigned a unique identifier (address), allowing for tracking of individual objects over time. The labeling of the dataset is of higher fidelity than the image resolution, which is a unique feature that enables the creation of precise algorithmic models. We demonstrate methods to track the construction or demolition of building footprints over time, providing direct assessment of urbanization. The performance of these methods is evaluated using the SpaceNet Change and Object Tracking (SCOT) metric, which measures both object tracking and change detection. Despite the moderate resolution of the data, we show that it is possible to track individual building identifiers over time.
