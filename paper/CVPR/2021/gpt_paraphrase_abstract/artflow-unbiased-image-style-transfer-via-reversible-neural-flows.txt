ArtFlow is a new approach to universal style transfer that addresses the issue of content leak, where the image content becomes corrupted during the stylization process. Unlike existing methods, ArtFlow incorporates reversible neural flows and an unbiased feature transfer module to prevent content leak. It operates in a projection-transfer-reversion scheme, allowing both forward and backward inferences. The forward inference projects input images into deep features, while the backward inference remaps deep features back to input images without any loss or bias. Through extensive experiments, ArtFlow achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art style transfer methods while successfully avoiding content leak.
