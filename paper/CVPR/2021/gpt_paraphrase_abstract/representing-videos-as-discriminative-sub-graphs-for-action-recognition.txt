This paper introduces a novel approach called MUlti-scale Sub-graph LEarning (MUSLE) to discover and represent the combinatorial structures and patterns in human actions. The MUSLE framework uses sub-graphs to encode the discriminative patterns of each action in videos. It builds space-time graphs and clusters them into compact sub-graphs on each scale based on the number of nodes. In this approach, 3D bounding boxes (tubelets) are represented as graph nodes, and dense connectivity serves as graph edges between tubelets. For each action category, online clustering is performed to decompose the graph into sub-graphs on each scale using a Gaussian Mixture Layer. The discriminative sub-graphs are then selected as action prototypes for recognition. The proposed method achieves superior results compared to state-of-the-art methods in extensive experiments conducted on Something-Something V1 & V2 and Kinetics-400 datasets. Notably, MUSLE achieves the highest reported accuracy of 65.0% on the Something-Something V2 validation set.
