We introduce the latent belief energy-based model (LB-EBM) for diverse human trajectory prediction in autonomous platforms. This probabilistic model uses a cost function in the latent space to consider movement history and social context. The model's low-dimensional latent space and expressive energy-based model allow it to capture the multiple possibilities of pedestrian trajectory distributions. We train LB-EBM using expert demonstrations projected into the latent space. By sampling or optimizing the model, we obtain a belief vector that informs path planning and long-range trajectory prediction. Our approach outperforms previous methods, achieving accurate, multi-modal, and socially-compliant trajectory predictions. Experimental results demonstrate a 10.9% improvement on the Stanford Drone trajectory prediction benchmark and a 27.6% improvement on the ETH-UCY benchmark.
