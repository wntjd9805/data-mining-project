In real-world image enhancement, it is often difficult to obtain ground-truth data, making it challenging to use distance metrics for objective quality assessment. As a result, subjective quality assessment is commonly used to evaluate image enhancement. However, this method has limitations due to biases in sample selection. To address this issue, we propose a method that automatically selects a diverse set of images for testing. We achieve this by maximizing the discrepancy between enhancers and the diversity among selected input images. By visually inspecting the resulting enhanced images, we can provide a unbiased ranking of enhancement algorithms. We demonstrate our method using three popular image enhancement tasks: dehazing, super-resolution, and low-light enhancement.
