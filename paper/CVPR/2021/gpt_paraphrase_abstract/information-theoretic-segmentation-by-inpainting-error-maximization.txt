We propose a new adversarial method for image segmentation that is based on information theory. Our method aims to partition images into foreground and background by maximizing the independence between the two sets. We use a simple loss function to drive a greedy search process that maximizes the inpainting error over these partitions. Unlike other approaches, our method does not require training deep networks and is computationally efficient. It is also applicable to single unlabeled images. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior unsupervised segmentation quality compared to existing approaches, while also being faster and more versatile.
