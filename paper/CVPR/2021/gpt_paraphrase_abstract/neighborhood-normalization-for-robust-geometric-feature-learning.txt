The extraction of geometric features from 3D models is a crucial step in various applications such as 3D registration, tracking, and scene flow estimation. Different methods, both hand-crafted and learning-based, have been developed to generate consistent and distinguishable geometric features for 3D models with partial overlap. However, these methods face challenges when dealing with 3D data obtained independently, where the global scale and scene overlap are unknown. Such resolution mismatch scenarios are common in practice, especially when aligning data from multiple sensors. In this study, we propose a new normalization technique called Batch-Neighborhood Normalization to address the issue of mean-std variation in local feature distributions that may occur in samples with varying point density. Our empirical results demonstrate that this normalization method outperforms other comparison methods in indoor and outdoor environments, as well as on a clinical dataset. The method shows particularly promising results in resolution-mismatch settings. The source code and clinical dataset are publicly available for reference.
