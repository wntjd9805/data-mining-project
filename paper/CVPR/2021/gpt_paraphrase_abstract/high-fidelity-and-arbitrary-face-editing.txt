Cycle consistency is a commonly used technique for face editing. However, we have noticed that the generator often finds ways to hide information from the original image in order to meet the requirements of cycle consistency. This results in a loss of important details, such as wrinkles and moles, in areas of the face that are not being edited. In this study, we introduce a solution called HifaFace to address this issue from two angles. Firstly, we alleviate the burden on the generator by directly incorporating high-frequency information from the input image into the end of the generator. This helps in synthesizing and maintaining rich details. Secondly, we introduce an additional discriminator that encourages the generator to generate images with rich details. We achieve this by applying wavelet transformation to the image, which allows us to identify and recover the high-frequency parts that contain the rich details. We also recognize the importance of having fine-grained and wide-ranging control over facial attributes in the editing process. To accomplish this, we propose a novel attribute regression loss. With our proposed framework, we are able to achieve high-quality and versatile face editing, surpassing the performance of other existing approaches.
