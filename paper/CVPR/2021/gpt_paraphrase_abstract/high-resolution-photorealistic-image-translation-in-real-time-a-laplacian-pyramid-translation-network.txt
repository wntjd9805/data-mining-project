In this paper, the focus is on accelerating high-resolution image-to-image translation tasks by using a closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. The authors observe that attribute transformations like illumination and color manipulation are primarily related to the low-frequency component, while content details can be refined on high-frequency components. To address this, they propose a Laplacian Pyramid Translation Network (LPTN) that simultaneously handles both tasks. The network includes a lightweight module for translating the low-frequency component with reduced resolution and a progressive masking strategy for efficiently refining the high-frequency ones. By avoiding heavy computation on high-resolution feature maps, the model preserves image details while achieving real-time translation of 4K images using a single GPU. The proposed method demonstrates comparable performance to existing methods. The datasets and codes for this method can be found at https://github.com/csjliang/LPTN.
