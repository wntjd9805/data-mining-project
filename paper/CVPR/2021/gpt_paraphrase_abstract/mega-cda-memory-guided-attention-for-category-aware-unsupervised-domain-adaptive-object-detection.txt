Current methods for unsupervised domain adaptive object detection use adversarial training to align features. However, these methods often align features without taking into account the specific categories, leading to negative feature transfer. To address this issue, we propose a new method called Memory-Guided Attention for Category-Aware Domain Adaptation (MeGA-CDA). This method incorporates category information into the domain adaptation process by using category-wise discriminators to align features. Since category information is not available for target samples, we generate memory-guided category-specific attention maps to guide feature routing to the corresponding category discriminator. Our proposed method outperforms existing approaches on various benchmark datasets.
