Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) has become essential in ensuring the reliability and stability of face recognition systems in unconstrained scenarios. Previous methods focus on estimating quality scores based on the uncertainty of individual samples or the similarity between pairs, but they fail to consider valuable information from inter-class comparisons. In this study, we propose a novel unsupervised FIQA method called Similarity Distribution Distance for Face Image Quality Assessment (SDD-FIQA). Our method calculates the Wasserstein Distance between intra-class and inter-class similarity distributions to generate quality pseudo-labels. These labels are then used to train a regression network for quality prediction. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SDD-FIQA outperforms existing methods by a significant margin and exhibits good generalization across different recognition systems.
