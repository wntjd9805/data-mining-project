The goal of image-based virtual try-on is to place a clothing item onto a person's body by fitting it to the desired body part and merging it with the person. However, current methods suffer from low resolution, limiting their usefulness for online consumers. This is due to challenges such as noticeable artifacts in misaligned areas and poor performance in generating high-quality body parts and sharp textures. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new method called VITON-HD that can synthesize high-resolution (1024Ã—768) virtual try-on images. Our approach involves using a segmentation map to guide the synthesis process, fitting the clothing item to the body, and employing ALIAS normalization and ALIAS generator to handle misaligned areas and preserve details. Through rigorous comparison with existing methods, we show that VITON-HD outperforms the baselines in terms of image quality, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
