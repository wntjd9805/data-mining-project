This paper presents a real-time scanning method that combines volumetric fusion and multiview shape-from-shading (SfS) to achieve high-detail geometry. Traditional multiview SfS methods are computationally expensive and mainly used for offline purposes. On the other hand, volumetric fusion allows real-time scanning but suffers from limited geometry resolution. To address these limitations, the proposed method first acquires photometric normals in texture space to achieve high-detail geometry. It then introduces geometry-aware texture mapping to refine the registration between the texture space and the volumetric distance field. This enables real-time multiview SfS. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in capturing high-detail geometry using an RGB-D camera at a frame rate of approximately 20 fps. The geometry quality achieved by the proposed method is comparable to that of offline multiview SfS methods.
