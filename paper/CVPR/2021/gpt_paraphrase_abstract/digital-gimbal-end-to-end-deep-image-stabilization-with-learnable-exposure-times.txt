This study proposes a digital emulation of a mechanically stabilized system for capturing long-exposure shots without blur caused by camera motion. The traditional method of using physically cumbersome and expensive devices is replaced by a CNN that estimates a sharp high-SNR image by aggregating a burst of noisy short-exposure frames. The exposure times of the burst are learned in an end-to-end manner to balance noise and blur. The superiority of this method over deblurring a single image or denoising a fixed-exposure burst is demonstrated using synthetic and real data.
