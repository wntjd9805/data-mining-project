We present a new algorithm called guided interactive segmentation (GIS) for video object segmentation. The goal of this algorithm is to enhance the accuracy of segmentation and reduce the time required for user interaction. Our approach involves three main components. Firstly, we have designed a reliability-based attention module that evaluates the reliability of multiple annotated frames. This module helps in analyzing the quality of annotations and assists in achieving more accurate segmentation results. Secondly, we have developed an intersection-aware propagation module that enables the propagation of segmentation results to neighboring frames. This module takes into account the intersections between video frames and ensures that the propagated results are consistent and coherent. Lastly, we introduce the GIS mechanism, which allows the user to quickly select unsatisfactory frames with minimal effort. This mechanism facilitates the user's interaction with the algorithm and helps in refining the segmentation results efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms conventional algorithms in terms of both segmentation accuracy and speed. The algorithm is available for use at https://github.com/yuk6heo/GIS-RAmap.
