We propose an unsupervised learning technique to improve optical flow estimation by enhancing upsampling and learning in a pyramid network. To address the issue of interpolation blur caused by bilinear upsampling between pyramid levels, we introduce a self-guided upsample module. Additionally, we suggest a pyramid distillation loss to supervise intermediate levels by distilling the finest flow as pseudo labels. By combining these two components, our method achieves superior performance in unsupervised optical flow learning on various benchmarks, including MPI-SIntel, KITTI 2012, and KITTI 2015. Notably, we outperform previous state-of-the-art methods by 22.2% and 15.7% in terms of EPE (end-point error) on KITTI 2012 and F1 score on KITTI 2015, respectively.
