Recent studies have shown that features that are equivariant to a larger group of symmetries are more effective and powerful. However, these higher-order equivariant features often require a significant increase in computational cost. Additionally, little research has been conducted on how rotation-equivariant features can be utilized for 3D shape alignment tasks. While previous approaches have relied on non-equivariant or invariant descriptors for aligning 3D shapes, we argue that an equivariant framework can greatly benefit these tasks.   In this paper, we propose a practical and efficient SE(3) equivariant network for analyzing point clouds, which addresses both of these challenges. First, we introduce SE(3) separable point convolution, a novel framework that breaks down the 6D convolution into two separable convolutional operators performed alternately in the 3D Euclidean and SO(3) spaces. This significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining performance. Second, we incorporate an attention layer to effectively utilize the expressive power of equivariant features. This attention layer, trained jointly with the network, derives the intrinsic local frame in the feature space and generates attention vectors that can be integrated with various alignment tasks.   We extensively evaluate our approach and provide visual interpretations. The empirical results demonstrate that our model outperforms strong baselines across multiple benchmarks.
