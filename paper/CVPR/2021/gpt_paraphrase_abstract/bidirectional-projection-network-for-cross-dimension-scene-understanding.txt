We propose a bidirectional projection network (BPNet) that enables joint reasoning between 2D images and 3D point clouds. While 2D images offer fine-grained texture information, 3D point clouds provide abundant geometry information. Current visual recognition systems tend to process these domains separately, neglecting their complementary nature. BPNet consists of 2D and 3D sub-networks with symmetric architectures, connected by our bidirectional projection module (BPM). The BPM allows the interaction of complementary information at multiple architectural levels, combining the advantages of both domains for improved scene recognition. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate the simultaneous benefits of joint reasoning for 2D and 3D scene understanding. Our BPNet achieves top performance on the ScanNetV2 benchmark for both 2D and 3D semantic segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/wbhu/BPNet.
