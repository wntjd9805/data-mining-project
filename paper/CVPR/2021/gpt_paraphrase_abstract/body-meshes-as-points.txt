We present a new approach called Body Meshes as Points (BMP) for multi-person 3D body mesh estimation. Existing methods use a two-stage process, which is inefficient and performs poorly in complex scenes. BMP simplifies the pipeline by representing each person as a point in the spatial-depth space, allowing for simultaneous localization and body mesh estimation. To handle depth ordering, BMP uses an inter-instance ordinal depth loss. Additionally, BMP introduces a keypoint-aware augmentation to improve robustness to occluded person instances. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that BMP achieves state-of-the-art efficiency and accuracy in multi-person body mesh estimation.
