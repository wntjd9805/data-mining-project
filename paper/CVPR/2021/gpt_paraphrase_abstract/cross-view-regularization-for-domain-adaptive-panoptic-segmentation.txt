The increasing popularity of panoptic segmentation, which combines semantic segmentation and instance segmentation, has led to extensive research in the field. However, most existing studies focus on supervised learning setups and neglect the importance of unsupervised domain adaptive panoptic segmentation in various tasks and applications. To address this gap, we propose a domain adaptive panoptic segmentation network that utilizes inter-style consistency and inter-task regularization to achieve optimal domain adaptation. Inter-style consistency takes advantage of the semantic invariance present in images of different styles, providing self-supervision signals to guide the network in learning domain-invariant features. On the other hand, inter-task regularization exploits the complementary nature of instance segmentation and semantic segmentation, using it as a constraint to improve feature alignment across domains. Through extensive experiments on various domain adaptive panoptic segmentation tasks, such as synthetic-to-real and real-to-real scenarios, our proposed network outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior segmentation performance.
