The challenge of dealing with long occlusions in multiple object tracking (MOT) has not been fully addressed despite recent advancements in joint detection and tracking techniques. This is because these techniques often overlook the long-term motion information. This paper presents a novel approach by introducing a probabilistic autoregressive motion model that evaluates tracklet proposals based on their likelihood. The model is trained to learn the natural distribution of tracklets, enabling it to not only assign new detections to existing tracklets but also fill in gaps caused by occlusions by sampling tracklets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in tracking objects in challenging sequences, surpassing the state-of-the-art performance in various MOT benchmark datasets (MOT16, MOT17, and MOT20) based on standard MOT metrics.
