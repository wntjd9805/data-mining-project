Deep hashing has been successful in large-scale image retrieval due to its ability to learn representations and perform efficient computations. However, deep hashing networks are susceptible to adversarial examples, which is a security issue that has not been extensively studied in the field of hashing-based retrieval. This paper introduces a novel approach called ProS-GAN, which is a prototype-supervised adversarial network designed for efficient and effective targeted hashing attacks. This is the first method to use a generation-based approach to attack deep hashing networks. The proposed framework consists of a PrototypeNet, a generator, and a discriminator. The PrototypeNet incorporates the target label into the semantic representation and learns a prototype code as a representative of the target label at the category level. The generator utilizes the semantic representation and the original image to generate flexible targeted attacks. The prototype code supervises the generator, ensuring that the generated adversarial example has a low Hamming distance from the prototype code's hash code. Additionally, the generator competes against the discriminator to ensure the adversarial examples are visually realistic and the semantic representation remains informative. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework can efficiently produce adversarial examples with superior targeted attack performance and transferability compared to existing targeted attack methods in deep hashing.
