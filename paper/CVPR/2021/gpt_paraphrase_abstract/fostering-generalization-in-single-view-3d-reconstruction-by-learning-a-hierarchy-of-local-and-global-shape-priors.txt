Single-view 3D object reconstruction has made significant advancements, but it still struggles to accurately reconstruct novel shapes that were not part of the training data. Current methods heavily rely on learned global shape priors, neglecting detailed local observations. To address this limitation, our approach focuses on learning a hierarchy of priors at different levels of locality using ground truth input depth maps. By incorporating local priors, our method effectively utilizes input observations, leading to improved generalization in visible areas of unfamiliar shapes. Additionally, the combination of local and global priors allows for meaningful generation of unobserved parts, resulting in consistent 3D shapes. Our results demonstrate that the hierarchical approach outperforms the global approach in terms of generalization, not only across different instances of a class but also across different classes and unseen object arrangements.
