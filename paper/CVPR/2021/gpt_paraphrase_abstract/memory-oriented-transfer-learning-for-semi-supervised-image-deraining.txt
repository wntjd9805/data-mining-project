Deep learning has significantly improved image rain removal using synthetic datasets. However, real rain streaks differ from those in synthetic data, making it challenging to apply existing methods to real-world scenes. To address this, we propose a memory-oriented semi-supervised (MOSS) method that allows the network to learn from both synthetic and real data. Our method uses an encoder-decoder neural network with a self-supervised memory module to record rain degradation patterns. This enables comprehensive derivation of rainy styles without the need for clean labels. We also introduce a self-training mechanism that transfers deraining knowledge from supervised to unsupervised cases. By utilizing an additional target network and pseudo-labels for unlabeled rainy images, we optimize the deraining network with supervised objectives on both synthetic and pseudo-paired noisy data. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, achieving appealing results on both limited labeled data and unlabeled real-world images.
