This paper presents a novel approach to automated floorplan generation using a generative adversarial layout refinement network. The proposed architecture combines a graph-constrained relational GAN and a conditional GAN, allowing for iterative refinement by using a previously generated layout as the next input constraint. The researchers discovered that a simple non-iterative training process called component-wise GT-conditioning is effective in training the generator. Additionally, the iterative generator enables meta-optimization techniques to improve a chosen metric by controlling the input constraints used during refinement. The proposed system outperforms the current state-of-the-art in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, even competing with floorplans designed by professional architects. The code, model, and data for this system are available at https://ennauata.github.io/houseganpp/page.html.
