We demonstrate the ability of an image classifier network to generate high-resolution, realistic, and diverse images on a large scale. Our approach, called Synthesize-It-Classifier (STIC), does not rely on a separate generator network to estimate data distribution density and sample images. Instead, we use the classifier's understanding of class boundaries to perform gradient ascent on class logits and synthesize images using the Gram Matrix Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (GRMALA) on a blank canvas. During training, the classifier uses these synthesized images as fake samples and repeatedly refines the class boundary to improve classification accuracy and the quality of synthetic images. We find that combining hard fake samples (generated by one-hot class conditioning) with soft fake samples (generated through a mixup of classes) enhances class interpolation. We also present an Attentive-STIC network that iteratively generates synthesized images on the ImageNet dataset with thousands of classes. Moreover, we introduce Score-STIC, which utilizes a class conditional score classifier instead of a regular image classifier, and demonstrate improved results on real-world datasets such as ImageNet, LSUN, and CIFAR 10.
