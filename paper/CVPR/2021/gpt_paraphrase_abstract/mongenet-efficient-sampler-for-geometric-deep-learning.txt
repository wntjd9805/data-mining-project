Advancements in geometric deep-learning have presented complex computational challenges when evaluating the distance between meshes. To assess surface quality or incorporate it into the training process, point clouds and a robust distance metric are required. Existing methods often rely on a uniform random mesh discretization, resulting in irregular sampling and imprecise distance estimation. This paper introduces MongeNet, a sampler based on fast and optimal transport, which enables an accurate mesh discretization with improved approximation properties. A comparison with the commonly used random uniform sampling demonstrates that MongeNet achieves nearly half the approximation error with minimal computational overhead.
