This paper introduces the "LUPerson" dataset, a large-scale unlabeled dataset for person re-identification (Re-ID). The goal of this dataset is to address the limited scale of existing person Re-ID datasets, which are costly to annotate. Previous research has attempted to use pre-training on ImageNet to overcome the data shortage in person Re-ID, but this approach suffers from a large domain gap between ImageNet and person Re-ID data. LUPerson is a dataset with 4 million images of over 200,000 identities, making it 30 times larger than the largest existing Re-ID dataset. It also includes a diverse range of capturing environments. The paper explores two key factors for learning Re-ID features: data augmentation and contrastive loss. By performing unsupervised pre-training on LUPerson, a generic Re-ID feature is developed that can improve the performance of existing person Re-ID methods. The pre-trained model achieves state-of-the-art results on four widely used Re-ID datasets (CUHK03, Market1501, DukeMTMC, and MSMT17) without any additional enhancements. The results also indicate that the performance improvement is more significant for small-scale target datasets or in a few-shot setting.
