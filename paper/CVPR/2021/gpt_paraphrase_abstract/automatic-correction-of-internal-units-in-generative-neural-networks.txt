Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are effective in generating realistic images, but they often produce images with visual defects called artifacts. While previous approaches focus on modifying the latent code to fix artifacts, we propose a method that identifies the internal units responsible for generating different types of artifacts. We introduce a sequential correction algorithm that modifies these artifact units to improve the quality of image generation while maintaining the original outline. Our method outperforms existing approaches in terms of FID-score and is also positively evaluated by humans.
