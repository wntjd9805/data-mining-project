We propose a novel solution called HybrIK that addresses the limitations of existing methods for 3D pose and shape estimation. Current methods either struggle with non-linear parameter estimation or produce unrealistic body structures. HybrIK bridges the gap between body mesh estimation and 3D keypoint estimation by combining analytical solutions with neural network cues. It directly transforms accurate 3D joints into relative body-part rotations for more accurate 3D body mesh reconstruction. Our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks, with improvements of 13.2 mm MPJPE and 21.9 mm PVE on the 3DPW dataset. The code for our method is publicly available.
