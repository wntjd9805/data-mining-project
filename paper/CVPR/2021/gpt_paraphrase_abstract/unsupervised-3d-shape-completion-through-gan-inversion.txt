Current 3D shape completion methods for filling in missing parts of objects often struggle when faced with partial shapes in different forms or real-world scans due to differences in data domains. This paper introduces ShapeInversion, a novel approach that utilizes Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) inversion for shape completion. ShapeInversion leverages a pre-trained GAN that has learned complete shapes to find a latent code that generates the best complete shape from a given partial input. Unlike previous methods, ShapeInversion does not require paired training data and can incorporate prior knowledge obtained from the pre-trained generative model. Experimental results on the ShapeNet benchmark show that ShapeInversion outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods and performs comparably to supervised methods trained with paired data. It also demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, providing robust results for various types and levels of incompleteness in real-world scans and partial inputs. Additionally, ShapeInversion enables additional functionalities such as generating multiple valid complete shapes for ambiguous partial inputs and shape manipulation and interpolation, thanks to the involvement of the pre-trained GAN.
