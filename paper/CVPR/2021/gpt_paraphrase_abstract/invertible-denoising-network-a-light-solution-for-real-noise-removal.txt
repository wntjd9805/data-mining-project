We introduce InvDN, an invertible denoising network designed to address the challenge of applying invertible models to remove noise from images. InvDN transforms a noisy input into a low-resolution clean image and a latent representation that contains noise. To restore the clean image, InvDN replaces the noisy latent representation with another sample from a prior distribution during reversion. Our proposed InvDN outperforms existing competitive models in terms of denoising performance, achieving a new state-of-the-art result on the SIDD dataset while also having a shorter run time. Additionally, InvDN has a significantly smaller size, with only 4.2% of the parameters compared to the recently proposed DANet. Furthermore, by manipulating the noisy latent representation, InvDN can generate noise that is more similar to the original noise. The code for InvDN is available at the provided GitHub repository.
