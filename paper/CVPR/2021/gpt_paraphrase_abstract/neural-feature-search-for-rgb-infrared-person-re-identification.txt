RGB-Infrared person re-identification (RGB-IR ReID) is a challenging problem that involves matching individuals across visible and infrared camera views. Existing approaches typically rely on manually-designed feature selection modules, which require domain knowledge and experience. In this study, we propose a general paradigm called Neural Feature Search (NFS) to automate the feature selection process. NFS combines a dual-level feature search space and a differentiable search strategy to select identity-related cues in coarse-grained channels and fine-grained spatial pixels. This enables NFS to adaptively filter out background noise and focus on informative parts of human bodies in a data-driven manner. Additionally, a cross-modality contrastive optimization scheme guides NFS to search for features that minimize modality discrepancy while maximizing inter-class distance. Extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly showing significant improvements of 11.20% and 8.64% in Rank-1 and mAP, respectively, on the RegDB dataset.
