This study introduces a new approach to weakly supervised segmentation methods that use bounding box annotations. Instead of relying on a class-agnostic mask generator, the authors utilize higher-level information from the behavior of a trained object detector. They identify the smallest areas of the image that produce similar results to the whole image when processed by the object detector, creating a bounding-box attribution map (BBAM). This map serves as pseudo ground-truth for weakly supervised semantic and instance segmentation. The proposed approach outperforms recent techniques on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmarks. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the method and its behavior. The code for the approach is available at the provided GitHub link.
