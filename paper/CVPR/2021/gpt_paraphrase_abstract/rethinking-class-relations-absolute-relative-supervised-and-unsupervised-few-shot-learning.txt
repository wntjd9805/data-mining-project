Most existing few-shot learning methods use binary labels to describe image relations. However, these binary relations are not sufficient to teach the network complex real-world relations because they lack decision smoothness. Additionally, current few-shot learning models only capture similarity through relation labels and do not consider class concepts associated with objects. This underutilization of class labels can be detrimental to classification performance. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called Absolute-relative Learning. This approach simultaneously learns similarity and class concepts by refining image and relation representations using label information in both supervised and unsupervised scenarios. Our proposed paradigm improves the performance of several state-of-the-art models on publicly available datasets.
