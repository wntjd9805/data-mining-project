High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance (MR) images provide detailed information for accurate diagnosis and analysis. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promise in enhancing low-resolution (LR) MR images through super-resolution (SR). However, existing CNN-based SR methods treat all spatial pixels equally and fail to capture the full potential of the input space. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach called squeeze and excitation reasoning attention networks (SERAN) for precise MR image SR.  SERAN incorporates squeeze attention to extract global spatial information from the input and generate global descriptors. These descriptors enable the network to focus on more informative regions and structures within MR images. Additionally, we introduce primitive relationship reasoning attention to establish connections among these global descriptors. Furthermore, we refine the global descriptors using learned attention, allowing for adaptive recalibration of feature responses with attention vectors. These attention vectors selectively choose relevant global descriptors to enhance the accuracy of detail and texture reconstruction.  To ensure stability during training and flexibility with other basic networks, we introduce squeeze and excitation attention with residual scaling. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SERAN, as it outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and visually in benchmark evaluations.  Overall, our proposed SERAN approach leverages global spatial information, establishes relationships among descriptors, and utilizes adaptive attention vectors to enhance the accuracy and quality of MR image SR.
