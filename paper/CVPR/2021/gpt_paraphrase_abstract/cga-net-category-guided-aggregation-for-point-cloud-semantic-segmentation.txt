Prior point cloud semantic segmentation networks struggle with effectively aggregating features from different categories of points. This is due to the fact that the joint area between two objects typically represents only a small portion of the overall scene. In order to address this limitation, this study proposes a novel approach called Category Guided Aggregation (CGA). The CGA module differentiates between points of the same category and points of different categories, using distinct aggregation strategies for each. By first identifying whether neighbors belong to the same category as the center point, the CGA module can then apply appropriate modules tailored to each type of neighbor. This customizable module can be integrated into any existing semantic segmentation network. Experimental results using three different backbones demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.
