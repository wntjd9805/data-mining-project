The role of language prior is crucial in how humans detect and recognize text in natural scenes. Existing methods for scene text recognition utilize lexicons to enhance performance, but their simplistic approach of matching the output with dictionary words based solely on edit distance has limitations. This paper introduces a new method that incorporates a dictionary during both the training and inference stages of a scene text recognition system. The dictionary is used to generate a list of potential outcomes, and the one most visually compatible with the text's appearance is selected. This novel approach improves the robustness of scene text recognition models, particularly in handling ambiguous cases encountered in real-world scenarios, and enhances the overall performance of state-of-the-art scene text spotting frameworks. The study suggests that incorporating language prior is a promising strategy for advancing scene text detection and recognition methods. Additionally, the authors contribute VinText, a challenging dataset for Vietnamese scene text, which includes characters with visual ambiguity due to accent symbols. This dataset serves as a rigorous benchmark for evaluating the effectiveness and resilience of scene text detection and recognition algorithms.
