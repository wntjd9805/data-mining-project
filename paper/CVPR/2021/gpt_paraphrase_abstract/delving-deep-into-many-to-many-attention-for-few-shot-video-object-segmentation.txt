This paper addresses the problem of Few-Shot Video Object Segmentation (FSVOS), which involves segmenting objects in query videos using a few labeled support images. The focus is on establishing a relationship between the query videos and support images to propagate object information. This task often requires computationally intensive full-rank attention, which is a many-to-many problem. To overcome this, we propose a novel approach called Domain Agent Network (DAN), which breaks down full-rank attention into two smaller ones. In DAN, a single frame of the query video acts as a domain agent, connecting the support images and query video. Our DAN offers a linear space and time complexity, while maintaining performance. Additionally, we introduce a learning strategy that combines meta-learning with on-line learning to further enhance segmentation accuracy. We have created a FSVOS benchmark using the Youtube-VIS dataset and conducted experiments that demonstrate the superiority of our method in terms of computational cost and accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/scutpaul/DANet.
