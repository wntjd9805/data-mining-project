The use of point sets in 3D deep learning is common due to their flexibility and lightweight nature. However, their discrete nature limits their ability to represent continuous and intricate geometry, which is problematic for shape generation through learning. To address this issue, we propose a method that transforms discrete point sets into smooth surfaces using the implicit moving least-squares (IMLS) surface formulation. This formulation allows us to define locally implicit functions on point sets. We integrate IMLS surface generation into deep neural networks, combining the flexibility of point sets with the high quality of implicit surfaces. Our approach, called IMLSNet, predicts an octree structure to generate the necessary MLS points and characterizes shape geometry using learned local priors. Additionally, our implicit function evaluation is independent of the neural network once the MLS points are predicted, enabling fast runtime evaluation. Our experiments on 3D object reconstruction demonstrate that IMLSNets surpass state-of-the-art learning-based methods in terms of reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. Extensive ablation tests also confirm the effectiveness of our network design and loss functions.
