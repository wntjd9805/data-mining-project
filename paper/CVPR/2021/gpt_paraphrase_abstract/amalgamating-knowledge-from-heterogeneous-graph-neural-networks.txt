This paper focuses on a new task in the field of graph neural networks (GNNs), which involves training a student GNN without using human annotations. The goal is to create a student GNN that combines knowledge from multiple teacher GNNs with different architectures and tasks, while maintaining a compact structure. To achieve this, the authors propose a novel method for training a slimmable GNN that can learn from teachers with varying feature dimensions. Additionally, they introduce a topological attribution map (TAM) to align the structural characteristics between the student and teachers, allowing the student to mimic the teachers' information aggregation methods. The experiments conducted on seven datasets across different tasks demonstrate that the student GNN, with its lightweight architecture, achieves impressive results comparable to or even better than the specialized teachers.
