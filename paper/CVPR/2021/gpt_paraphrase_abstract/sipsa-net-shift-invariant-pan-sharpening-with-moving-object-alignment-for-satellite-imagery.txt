Pan-sharpening involves merging a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a low-resolution multi-spectral (MS) image to create a high-resolution and pan-sharpened image. However, PAN and MS image pairs often have misalignment issues due to different sensor characteristics and acquisition times. Existing deep-learning-based methods trained on misaligned PAN-MS pairs result in artifacts like double-edge and blur artifacts in pan-sharpened images. This paper introduces a novel framework called SIPSA-Net that addresses the large misalignment of moving object regions in PAN sharpening. SIPSA-Net includes a feature alignment module (FAM) that adjusts features between PAN and MS domains to achieve better alignment in pan-sharpened images. A shift-invariant spectral loss is also designed to improve alignment by ignoring the inherent misalignment in the original MS input. Experimental results demonstrate that SIPSA-Net significantly improves visual quality and alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods.
