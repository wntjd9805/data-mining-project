The importance of physical contact between hands and objects in human grasping is highlighted in this study. The researchers propose a method to improve the accuracy of hand poses inferred from image-based methods by optimizing the hand's pose to achieve expected contact with an object. A deep model trained on actual contact data is used to infer desirable contact across the surfaces of the hand and object meshes. The optimized hand pose is achieved using a differentiable contact model called ContactOpt. This model promotes mesh interpenetration to mimic the behavior of deformable soft tissue in the hand. The evaluation of this approach demonstrates that it produces grasps that closely match ground truth contact, have lower kinematic error, and are preferred by human participants. The code and models used in this study are available online.
