Image matting is a challenging problem in computer vision and graphics. Most current methods rely on a user-provided trimap to generate accurate alpha matte. However, obtaining a high-quality trimap is difficult, limiting the application of these methods. Although some trimap-free methods have been developed, their matting quality is not as good as trimap-based methods. The main reason for this is the lack of trimap guidance, which causes ambiguity in determining the foreground target. Choosing the foreground is a subjective process that depends on the user's intention. In this paper, we propose an improved deep image matting framework that does not require a trimap and only requires a few user click interactions to eliminate ambiguity. Additionally, we introduce an uncertainty estimation module that predicts areas requiring further refinement and a local refinement module. Users can choose how many local parts to improve based on their computation budget, guided by the uncertainty estimation. Our method outperforms existing trimap-free methods and achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art trimap-based methods with minimal user effort.
