The understanding of dynamic environments relies on accurate scene flow estimation in 3D point clouds. Although deep neural networks have made progress in this field, their performance is still lacking as they only consider per-point translational motion and ignore the constraints of rigid motion in local regions. To address this issue, we propose a solution that introduces motion consistency to ensure smoothness among neighboring points, and includes constraints on the rigidity of local transformations by sharing rigid motion parameters within each local region. To achieve this, we utilize a high-order Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) based relation module called Con-HCRFs, which explores both point-wise smoothness and region-wise rigidity. Additionally, we incorporate a position-aware flow estimation module into the Con-HCRFs to provide discriminative unary terms for the CRFs. Our proposed framework, HCRF-Flow, achieves state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms previous approaches in extensive experiments conducted on the FlyingThings3D and KITTI datasets.
