Surgical skills play a crucial role in ensuring surgical safety and the well-being of patients. However, the traditional manual assessment of surgical skills is time-consuming and lacks efficiency and consistency. To address this issue, we propose an automated approach to predict the quality of surgery using surgical videos. Our approach, called a unified multi-path framework, considers various aspects of surgical skills, such as the use of surgical tools, patterns of intraoperative events, and other skill indicators. We specifically model the dependency relationships between these aspects using a path dependency module within the framework. We evaluate our framework on two datasets: the JIGSAWS dataset, which consists of simulated surgical tasks, and a new clinical dataset of real laparoscopic surgeries. Our experiments demonstrate promising results on both datasets, with the state-of-the-art performance on the simulated dataset improving from a Spearman's correlation of 0.71 to 0.80 using our framework. Furthermore, we show that combining multiple skill aspects leads to better performance compared to relying on a single aspect.
