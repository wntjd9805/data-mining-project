Current research on 3D object recognition primarily focuses on real-time, onboard scenarios. However, there are numerous offboard use cases that have not been extensively explored, such as the automatic generation of high-quality 3D labels using machines. Existing 3D object detectors are inadequate for offboard uses due to limited input and speed constraints. This paper introduces a new offboard 3D object detection pipeline that utilizes point cloud sequence data. By recognizing that different frames capture different perspectives of objects, the offboard detector incorporates temporal points through multi-frame object detection and innovative object-centric refinement models. The proposed pipeline, called 3D Auto Labeling, surpasses state-of-the-art onboard detectors and offboard baselines when evaluated on the Waymo OpenDataset. Its performance even matches that of human labels confirmed through a human label study. Additional experiments demonstrate the use of auto labels for semi-supervised learning and offer extensive analysis to validate various design choices.
