This paper introduces Roof-GAN, a new generative adversarial network that generates residential roof structures as a collection of roof primitives and their relationships. The generator creates a structured roof model in the form of a graph, including raster images encoding facet segmentation and angles at each node, colinear/coplanar relationships between primitives at each edge, and vector geometry generated by a differentiable vectorizer at each node. The discriminator is trained to evaluate the raster geometry, primitive relationships, and vector geometry in an end-to-end architecture. Our approach is shown to effectively generate diverse and realistic roof models compared to other methods, as demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative evaluations using a novel metric proposed in this study. The code and data for Roof-GAN are available at https://github.com/yi-ming-qian/roofgan.
