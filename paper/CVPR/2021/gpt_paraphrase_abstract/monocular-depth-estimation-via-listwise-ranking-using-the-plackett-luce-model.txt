The relative depth of objects in images is important for understanding scenes in real-world applications. Previous methods for predicting depth in monocular images have treated it as a regression task. However, ranking methods that use pairwise comparisons ("object A is closer to the camera than B") offer a natural alternative to regression. These ranking approaches have shown promising results in depth prediction. This paper explores the use of listwise ranking, which is a generalization of pairwise ranking. The method combines the Plackett-Luce model, a probability distribution on rankings, with a state-of-the-art neural network architecture and a simple sampling strategy to simplify training. Additionally, the proposed predictor allows for the recovery of metric depth information from ranking-only training data. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through empirical evaluation on benchmark datasets in a "zero-shot" setting, showing improved performance compared to existing ranking and regression methods.
