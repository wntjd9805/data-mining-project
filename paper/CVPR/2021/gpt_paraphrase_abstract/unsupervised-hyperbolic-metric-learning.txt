Learning feature embedding directly from images without any human supervision is a difficult and important task in computer vision and machine learning. Most existing unsupervised metric learning approaches focus on binary similarity in Euclidean space, but these methods do not perform well in practical applications where manual information is lacking and data exhibits non-Euclidean latent anatomy. To overcome this limitation, we propose an Unsupervised Hyperbolic Metric Learning method with Hierarchical Similarity. This method takes advantage of hyperbolic metric learning and hierarchical clustering to consider the natural hierarchies of data, allowing for the excavation of richer similarity information beyond binary modeling. Additionally, we introduce a new loss function to capture the hierarchical similarity among samples, enhancing the stability of our method. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms current unsupervised deep metric learning approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
