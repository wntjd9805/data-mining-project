We present a new method for 3D object detection that combines the advantages of voxel-based and point-based features. Existing methods either lack fine-grained 3D structure representation or are computationally expensive. Our method, called HVPR, integrates both features into a single 3D representation using a convolutional neural network architecture. We enhance the point-based features with a memory module to reduce computational costs and aggregate them to obtain a hybrid 3D representation resembling a pseudo image. We also introduce an Attentive Multi-scale Feature Module to extract scale-aware features from sparse and irregular point clouds. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good balance between speed and accuracy.
