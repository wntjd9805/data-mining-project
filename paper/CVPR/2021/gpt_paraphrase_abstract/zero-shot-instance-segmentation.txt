The precision of instance segmentation has greatly improved with deep learning, but collecting and labeling data in certain fields like medicine and manufacturing is challenging. To address this, we propose a new task called zero-shot instance segmentation (ZSI). In ZSI, the model is trained with known data and then used to segment both known and unknown instances during testing. We introduce the ZSI task and a method to tackle it, which includes a Zero-shot Detector, Semantic Mask Head, Background Aware RPN, and Synchronized Background Strategy. We also create a benchmark for ZSI using the MS-COCO dataset. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in zero-shot object detection and achieves promising results in ZSI. Our approach serves as a strong foundation for future research in zero-shot instance segmentation. The code for our method is available at ZSI.
