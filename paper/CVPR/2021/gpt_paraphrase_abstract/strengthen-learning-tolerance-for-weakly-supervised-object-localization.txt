Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) is a technique that aims to locate objects of interest using only image-level labels as supervision. However, existing approaches still face two challenges: the domination of object parts and a lack of learning robustness. The former issue causes the localizer to focus on discriminative regions instead of the whole object, while the latter makes the localizer overly sensitive to variations in input images, resulting in localization results that are not robust to different visual stimuli. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called SLT-Net for WSOL, which aims to strengthen the learning tolerance. Our framework incorporates two mechanisms to enhance tolerance. The first is the semantic tolerance strengthening mechanism, which allows the localizer to make mistakes in classifying similar semantics, preventing it from overly relying on discriminative local regions. The second is the visual stimuli tolerance strengthening mechanism, which ensures that the localizer is robust to different image transformations, reducing its sensitivity to specific input images. We conducted comprehensive experiments on two widely-used datasets, CUB and ILSVRC2012, to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The results demonstrate the superiority of our framework in addressing the challenges faced by WSOL.
