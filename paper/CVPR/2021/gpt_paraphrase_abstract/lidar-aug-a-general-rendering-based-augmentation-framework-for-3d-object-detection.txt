The annotation of LiDAR point clouds is essential for training deep learning-based 3D object detection models. However, labeling costs can be expensive, making data augmentation necessary. The commonly used strategy of "copy" and "paste" (GT-Aug) does not consider occlusion between objects. To address this limitation, we propose LiDAR-Aug, a rendering-based augmentation framework that enhances training data and improves LiDAR-based object detection performance. LiDAR-Aug is a plug-and-play module that can easily integrate into various 3D object detection frameworks. Compared to traditional augmentation methods, LiDAR-Aug is more realistic and effective. We evaluate our framework on the KITTI dataset using different 3D object detectors and demonstrate its superiority over other augmentation strategies. We intend to share our data and code to facilitate result replication by other researchers.
