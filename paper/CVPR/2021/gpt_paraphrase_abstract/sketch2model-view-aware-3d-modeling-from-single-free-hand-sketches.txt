We explore the problem of creating 3D meshes from hand-drawn sketches, with the goal of enabling fast 3D modeling for inexperienced users. While this can be seen as a task of reconstructing a 3D object from a single viewpoint, it presents unique challenges due to the variability and simplicity of the sketches. Ambiguities in poorly-drawn sketches make it difficult to determine the pose of the sketched object. In this study, we emphasize the significance of specifying the viewpoint to overcome such ambiguities and propose a new approach that is aware of the viewpoint. By explicitly incorporating the given viewpoint into the generation process, our method can automatically generate plausible shapes along with predicted viewpoints, or generate shapes based on specified viewpoints to assist users in expressing their intentions more effectively. Extensive evaluations on diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our viewpoint-aware approach in resolving sketch ambiguities and enhancing the quality of reconstruction.
