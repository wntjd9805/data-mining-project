Time-to-contact (TTC) is a valuable tool for path planning as it provides more information compared to depth, velocity, and acceleration of objects in a scene, even for humans. Traditionally, TTC estimation requires a monocular, uncalibrated camera, but regressing TTC for each pixel is challenging and existing methods oversimplify the scene. To overcome this, we propose a method that estimates TTC through a series of binary classifications. Instead of predicting exact per-pixel TTC, we focus on determining whether the observer will collide with an obstacle within a specific time, which is more critical in certain situations. Our approach offers a temporal geofence in just 6.4 ms, which is over 25 times faster than existing methods. Additionally, our method can estimate per-pixel TTC with fine quantization, including continuous values, if the computational budget allows. As far as we know, our method is the first to provide TTC information (binary or coarsely quantized) at high frame rates suitable for practical use.
