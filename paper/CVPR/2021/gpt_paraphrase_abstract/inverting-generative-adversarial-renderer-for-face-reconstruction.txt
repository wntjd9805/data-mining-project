This study explores the field of 3D face geometry reconstruction using a monocular face image as input. Previous methods have utilized differentiable renderers, based on graphics rules, to achieve promising results. However, these renderers simplify the realistic aspects of illumination and reflection, leading to domain-shift noise in the optimization or training process. To address this issue, the authors propose a novel Generative Adversarial Renderer (GAR) that can produce realistic images by learning the complexities of the real world, rather than relying on simplified rules. The GAR is integrated into a fitting pipeline to tackle the domain-shift noise problem. The authors also introduce a new approach for predicting 3D face parameters, involving the use of Renderer Inverting for initial parameter estimation followed by refinement with gradient-based optimizers. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GAR and optimization-based framework, with the method achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple face reconstruction datasets.
