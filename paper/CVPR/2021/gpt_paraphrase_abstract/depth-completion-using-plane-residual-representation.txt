This paper presents an improved approach to depth completion, which involves predicting a dense depth map using sparse input data. The proposed method reformulates the problem by combining depth plane classification and residual regression. Initially, the sparse depth information is densified by assigning each pixel to a discretized depth plane, and then the final depth value is calculated by predicting the distance from the specified plane. This approach reduces the burden of directly regressing absolute depth information and improves the accuracy of depth prediction while requiring less computation power and inference time. The authors introduce a novel interpretation of depth information called Plane-Residual (PR) representation, which includes a closest depth plane label and a residual value. They also propose a depth completion network that utilizes PR representation, consisting of a shared encoder and two decoders. One decoder classifies the pixel's depth plane label, while the other decoder regresses the normalized distance from the classified depth plane. By adopting the PR representation and using the proposed network, the authors achieve improved depth completion performance with faster computation compared to previous approaches.
