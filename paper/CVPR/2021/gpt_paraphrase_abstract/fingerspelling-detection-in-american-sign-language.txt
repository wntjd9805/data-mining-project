Fingerspelling, an essential aspect of American Sign Language, involves signing words letter by letter. Previous research on automatic fingerspelling recognition has focused on videos where the boundaries of fingerspelling regions are already known. However, this paper addresses the challenge of detecting fingerspelling in raw, untrimmed sign language videos, which is crucial for developing practical fingerspelling recognition systems. To facilitate progress in this area, we propose a benchmark and a set of evaluation metrics that consider the impact of detection on fingerspelling recognition. Furthermore, we introduce a novel model that utilizes multi-task training, incorporating pose estimation, fingerspelling recognition, and detection. We compare our model to various alternatives and demonstrate its superior performance across all metrics, establishing it as the state of the art on the benchmark.
