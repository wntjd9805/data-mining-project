Mainstream object detectors based on fully convolutional networks have made significant progress in performance. However, these detectors still rely on a hand-designed non-maximum suppression (NMS) post-processing step, which hinders fully end-to-end training. This paper analyzes the possibility of discarding NMS and highlights the importance of proper label assignment in achieving accurate results. To address this, a Prediction-aware One-To-One (POTO) label assignment method is proposed for classification in fully convolutional detectors, enabling end-to-end detection and achieving comparable performance to NMS. Additionally, a simple 3D Max Filtering (3DMF) technique is introduced to leverage multi-scale features and enhance the discriminability of convolutions in the local region. By employing these techniques, the proposed end-to-end framework achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art detectors with NMS on COCO and CrowdHuman datasets.
