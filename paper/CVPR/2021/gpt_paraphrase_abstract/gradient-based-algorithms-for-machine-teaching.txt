The problem of machine teaching is explored in this study, with a focus on an optimal student. An optimal student is defined as one who performs at least as well as machine learning systems in terms of empirical risk minimization. The study reveals that the optimal student can always learn the optimal predictor for a classification task if given unlimited effort. Therefore, the role of the optimal teacher is to minimize the student's effort by selecting the most efficient teaching set. This is approached as a problem of functional optimization, where the teacher aims to align the steepest descent directions of the risk for both the teaching set and the entire example population. The optimal teacher, referred to as MaxGrad, is demonstrated to maximize the risk gradient on the set of new examples selected per iteration. MaxGrad teaching algorithms are provided for binary and multiclass tasks, showing similarities with boosting algorithms. Experimental evaluations highlight the superior performance of MaxGrad compared to previous algorithms on classification tasks for both machine learning and human students from MTurk.
