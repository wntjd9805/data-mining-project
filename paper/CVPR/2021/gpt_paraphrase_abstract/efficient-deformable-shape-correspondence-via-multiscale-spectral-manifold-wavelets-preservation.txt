The functional map framework has been highly effective in representing dense correspondences between deformable shapes. One crucial aspect of this framework is formulating appropriate preservation constraints to encode the necessary geometric information. In order to address this issue, we have developed novel and powerful constraints that ensure the preservation of multiscale spectral manifold wavelets at each corresponding scale. These constraints allow us to extract a significantly greater amount of information compared to previous methods that rely on descriptor preservation constraints. Furthermore, our constraints strongly guarantee the isometric property of the map. Additionally, we have introduced an efficient iterative method for updating the functional maps and pointwise maps. By utilizing tight wavelet frames during the iterations, the computation of functional maps simplifies to a straightforward filtering procedure with low-pass and various band-pass filters. This avoids the time-consuming process of solving large systems of linear equations often encountered in functional maps. Through extensive experimentation with diverse datasets, we have demonstrated that our approach yields substantial improvements in both the quality of shape correspondence and the computational efficiency.
