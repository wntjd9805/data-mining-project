We propose a method called Wasserstein Barycenter Transport (WBT) for multi-source domain adaptation, which enables training a model on data from different probability distributions. The WBT method constructs an intermediate domain between the source and target domains by utilizing the barycenter on Wasserstein spaces to aggregate the source probability distributions. The aggregated sources are then transported to the target domain using standard Optimal Transport for Domain Adaptation. We also explore the application of our algorithm to single-source domain adaptation tasks in the context of multi-source scenarios, specifically in object and face recognition datasets. Furthermore, we expand the range of applications by examining music genre recognition and music-speech discrimination tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to the current state-of-the-art approaches.
