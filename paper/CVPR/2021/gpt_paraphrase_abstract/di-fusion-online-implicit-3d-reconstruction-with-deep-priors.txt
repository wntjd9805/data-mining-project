Current online 3D dense reconstruction methods face challenges in balancing memory storage and surface quality due to the use of stagnant underlying geometry representations, such as TSDF or surfels, without considering scene priors. In this study, we introduce DI-Fusion (Deep Implicit Fusion), which utilizes a novel 3D representation called Probabilistic Local Implicit Voxels (PLIVoxs) for online 3D reconstruction using an RGB-D camera. Our PLIVoxs incorporate scene priors by considering local geometry and uncertainty, which are parameterized by a deep neural network. By leveraging these deep priors, our approach achieves superior camera trajectory estimation accuracy and mapping quality compared to existing online implicit 3D reconstruction methods, while also improving storage efficiency.
