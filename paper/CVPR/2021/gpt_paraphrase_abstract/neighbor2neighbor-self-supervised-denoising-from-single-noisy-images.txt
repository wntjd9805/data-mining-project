Image denoising has greatly benefited from the advancements in neural networks. However, the need for a large number of noisy-clean image pairs for supervision hinders the widespread use of these models. Existing self-supervised denoising methods have limitations such as inefficient network training, loss of useful information, or reliance on noise modeling. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a simple yet effective approach called Neighbor2Neighbor for training an image denoising model with only noisy images. The method involves the use of a random neighbor sub-sampler to generate training image pairs, where the paired pixels of the images are neighbors and exhibit similar appearance. A denoising network is then trained on these sub-sampled pairs, with an additional regularizer as a loss function to improve performance. The Neighbor2Neighbor framework benefits from the advancements in supervised denoising networks' architecture design and reduces dependence on assumptions about noise distribution. The approach is explained theoretically and validated through extensive experiments, including synthetic experiments with various noise distributions in sRGB space and real-world experiments on a denoising benchmark dataset in raw-RGB space.
