This paper introduces a new framework for integrating predictions from deep neural networks (DNNs) and solutions from geometric solvers, such as the 5-point algorithm. The goal is to leverage the complementary benefits of these two approaches in a learnable way. The fusion is achieved by training the DNN uncertainty based on the geometric uncertainty, allowing the network to consider the geometric solution in relation to its prediction. The proposed method uses a self-attention graph neural network to facilitate strong interactions between correspondences and model complex relationships between points. The authors also propose motion parameterizations suitable for learning and demonstrate that their approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DeMoN and ScanNet datasets, which focus on relative pose estimation. Although the focus is on relative pose, the authors believe that their pipeline can be broadly applied to fuse classical geometry and deep learning.
