Specialized knowledge in a specific field is often required to accurately annotate training sets for detailed analysis. However, obtaining this knowledge from domain experts can be time-consuming and burdensome. This problem is particularly prevalent in automated behavior analysis, where the movements or actions of interest are detected from video tracking data. In order to minimize the effort required for annotation, we propose TREBA, a method that learns efficient trajectory embedding for behavior analysis through multi-task self-supervised learning. Our approach allows domain experts to efficiently create tasks using "task programming," a process that encodes structured knowledge from domain experts into programs. By exchanging data annotation time for the creation of a small number of programmed tasks, the overall effort of domain experts can be reduced. We evaluate this trade-off using data from behavioral neuroscience, where specialized knowledge is used to identify behaviors. Our experimental results, conducted on three datasets from mice and fruit flies, demonstrate that using embeddings from TREBA can reduce annotation burden by up to 10 times without compromising accuracy compared to state-of-the-art features. These findings suggest that task programming and self-supervision can effectively reduce the effort required for annotation by domain experts.
