We introduce Neural Splines, a novel method for reconstructing 3D surfaces using random feature kernels derived from shallow ReLU networks with infinite width. Our technique surpasses the performance of recent neural network-based approaches and the widely utilized Poisson Surface Reconstruction method, which can also be considered a kernel approach. Due to its straightforward kernel formulation, our method is easily analyzable and can be expedited using general techniques for kernel-based learning. We provide explicit mathematical expressions for our kernel and argue that our formulation extends cubic spline interpolation to higher dimensions. Notably, the regularized kernel Hilbert space norm associated with Neural Splines favors smooth interpolations.
