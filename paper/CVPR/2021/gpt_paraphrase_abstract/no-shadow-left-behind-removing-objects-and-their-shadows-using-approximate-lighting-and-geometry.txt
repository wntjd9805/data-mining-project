Removing objects from images is a difficult technical problem that has significant implications for various applications, such as mixed reality. It is crucial to also eliminate the shadows cast by the removed objects to achieve realistic outcomes. Existing methods based on inpainting only erase the object itself, leaving behind the shadows or requiring manual identification of shadow regions for inpainting. To address this limitation, we propose a deep learning pipeline that not only removes the object but also eliminates its associated shadow. Our approach utilizes rough scene models to effectively handle a wide range of shadow types (hard or soft, dark or subtle, large or thin) on various textured surfaces. We train our pipeline using synthetic data and present both qualitative and quantitative results on synthetic and real scenes.
