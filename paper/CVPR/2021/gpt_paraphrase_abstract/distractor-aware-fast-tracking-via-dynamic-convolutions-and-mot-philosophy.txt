Most current long-term trackers lack the necessary properties for practical use, such as efficient model design, effective global re-detection strategies, and robust distractor awareness. As a result, these trackers may either be time-consuming or become distracted by irrelevant objects. To overcome these limitations, we propose a two-task tracking framework called DMTrack. This framework utilizes one-shot detection and re-identification association components, combined with dynamic convolutions and multiple object tracking philosophy, to achieve fast and distractor-aware tracking. We employ a lightweight one-shot detector with a novel dynamic convolutions generation method to achieve precise and fast global detection. Additionally, we use the philosophy of multiple object tracking to explicitly reason about distractors by maintaining potential similarities' tracklets. By leveraging high recall detection and explicit object association, our tracker outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets and runs in real-time, being three times faster than comparable trackers.
