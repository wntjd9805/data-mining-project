Analyzing complex scenes that contain multiple objects and occlusion is a difficult task for Deep Neural Networks. Existing methods for image analysis typically process objects independently and do not consider the occlusion relationships between nearby objects. In this study, we propose a robust deep network for multi-object instance segmentation that can be trained using bounding box supervision alone. Our approach builds upon Compositional Networks, which utilize a generative model of neural feature activations to locate occluders and classify objects based on their non-occluded parts. We extend this generative model to handle multiple objects and introduce a framework for efficient inference in challenging occlusion scenarios. Specifically, our method provides feed-forward predictions of object classes, as well as their instance and occluder segmentations. We also introduce an Occlusion Reasoning Module (ORM) that identifies incorrect segmentations and estimates the occlusion order to rectify them. The improved segmentation masks are then integrated into the network in a top-down manner to enhance image classification. We evaluate our model on the KITTI INStance dataset (KINS) and a synthetic occlusion dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness in multi-object instance segmentation under occlusion. The code for our model is publicly available at https://github.com/XD7479/Multi-Object-Occlusion.
