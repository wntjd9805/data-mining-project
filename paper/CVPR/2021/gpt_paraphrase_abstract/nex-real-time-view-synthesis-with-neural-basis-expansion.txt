We introduce NeX, a novel approach to generating new views in real time using an improved version of multiplane image (MPI). Unlike traditional MPI, which relies on simple RGBÎ± planes, our method represents each pixel as a linear combination of basis functions learned from a neural network to capture view-dependent effects. Additionally, we propose a hybrid implicit-explicit modeling strategy that enhances fine detail and produces superior outcomes compared to existing techniques. We evaluate our approach on standard forward-facing datasets and a newly-created dataset that includes more challenging effects like rainbow reflections on a CD. Our method outperforms other methods in terms of overall scores across various metrics on these datasets, and it is over 1000 times faster than the current state-of-the-art rendering technique.
