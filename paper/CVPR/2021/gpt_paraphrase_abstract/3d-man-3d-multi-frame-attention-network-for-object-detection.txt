This paper introduces a 3D-MAN system for object detection in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods often rely on single frames for 3D detection and fail to fully utilize information from multiple frames. To address this, 3D-MAN utilizes a fast single-frame detector to generate box proposals and stores them in a memory bank along with corresponding feature maps. The system then employs a multi-view alignment and aggregation module, utilizing attention networks, to extract and combine temporal features from different perspectives. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Waymo Open Dataset, surpassing both single-frame and multi-frame methods.
