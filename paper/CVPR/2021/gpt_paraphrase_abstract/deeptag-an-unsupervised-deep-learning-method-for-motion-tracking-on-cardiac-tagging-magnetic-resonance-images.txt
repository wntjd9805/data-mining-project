Cardiac tagging magnetic resonance imaging (t-MRI) is currently the most reliable method for assessing regional myocardium deformation and cardiac strain. However, its clinical application is limited due to difficulties in accurately tracking motion in t-MRI images. This paper introduces a new deep learning-based approach for motion tracking on t-MRI images. The proposed method utilizes a bi-directional generative diffeomorphic registration neural network to estimate the motion field between consecutive t-MRI frames. This estimated motion field is then used to determine the Lagrangian motion field between the reference frame and any other frame using a differentiable composition layer. By incorporating temporal information, this novel method provides a practical solution for motion tracking and image registration in dynamic medical imaging. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been demonstrated through validation on a representative clinical t-MRI dataset. Experimental results indicate that our approach outperforms conventional motion tracking methods in terms of landmark tracking accuracy and inference efficiency.
