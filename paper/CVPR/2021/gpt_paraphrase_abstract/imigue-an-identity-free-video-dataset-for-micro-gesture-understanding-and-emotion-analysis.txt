We present a novel dataset called iMiGUE for research in emotional artificial intelligence. Unlike existing datasets, iMiGUE focuses on nonverbal body gestures without using any identity information. Previous studies on emotion analysis primarily rely on sensitive biometric data such as face and speech. iMiGUE specifically targets micro-gestures, which are unintentional behaviors driven by inner feelings. This distinguishes iMiGUE from other gesture datasets that mainly consist of intentionally performed gestures for illustrative purposes. Additionally, iMiGUE aims to assess models' ability to analyze emotional states by integrating information from recognized micro-gestures, rather than solely recognizing prototypes in isolated sequences. This holistic approach is crucial for true emotion AI. To address the challenge of imbalanced sample distribution, we propose an unsupervised learning method to capture latent representations from the micro-gesture sequences themselves. Through systematic investigations, we discover intriguing insights from the iMiGUE dataset, such as the potential of micro-gesture-based analysis in enhancing emotion understanding. The results confirm that iMiGUE has the potential to advance studies in micro-gesture and emotion AI.
