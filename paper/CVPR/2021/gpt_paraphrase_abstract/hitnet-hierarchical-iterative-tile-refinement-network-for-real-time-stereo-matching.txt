This study introduces HITNet, a new neural network architecture for real-time stereo matching. Unlike other recent neural network approaches that use a full cost volume and rely on 3D convolutions, our method does not explicitly construct a volume. Instead, it utilizes a fast multi-resolution initialization step, differentiable 2D geometric propagation, and warping mechanisms to infer disparity hypotheses. In addition to reasoning about disparities geometrically, our network also infers slanted plane hypotheses, which improves the accuracy of geometric warping and upsampling operations. Our architecture is inherently multi-resolution, allowing information propagation across different levels. Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high accuracy with significantly less computation compared to state-of-the-art methods. As of writing, HITNet consistently ranks among the top positions on metrics published on the ETH3D website for two view stereo. It also outperforms other end-to-end learning approaches on most metrics for Middlebury-v3 and ranks first on the widely used KITTI 2012 and 2015 benchmarks among methods faster than 100 ms.
