This study aims to utilize the Wasserstein metric to generate pseudo labels for unlabeled images in order to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) for classification. The key principle of our approach is that the disparity between two discrete empirical measures, such as clusters, originating from the same or similar distributions should be smaller compared to measures from completely different distributions. In our proposed method, we initially pre-train the CNN using a self-supervised learning technique to make assumptions about the clusters in the unlabeled images. Subsequently, we employ the Wasserstein metric, which considers the geometric aspects of the metric space to establish a natural concept of similarity between discrete empirical measures. This metric is used to cluster the unlabeled images, and the clusters are then matched with their corresponding class of labeled images to assign pseudo labels to the data within each cluster. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we have conducted evaluations and comparisons with state-of-the-art SSL methods using standard datasets.
