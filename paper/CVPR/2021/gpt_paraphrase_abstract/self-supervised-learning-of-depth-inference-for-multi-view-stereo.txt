Supervised multi-view depth estimation networks have achieved promising results, but they require ground-truth data for training, which is challenging to collect in large amounts. To address this, we propose a self-supervised learning framework for multi-view stereo that uses pseudo labels from the input data. Initially, we learn to estimate depth maps as pseudo labels using an unsupervised learning framework with image reconstruction loss as supervision. We then refine these pseudo labels using depth information from a higher resolution image and neighboring views. These refined pseudo labels are used to train the network and improve its performance through self-training iterations. Our experiments on the DTU dataset demonstrate that our self-supervised learning framework significantly outperforms existing unsupervised multi-view stereo networks and performs comparably to supervised approaches. The code for our framework is available at https://github.com/JiayuYANG/Self-supervised-CVP-MVSNet.
