This paper addresses the problem of dynamic scene deblurring. Existing deep learning approaches for this task use a generic model for all test images, which is sub-optimal as it does not utilize the specific information within each image. SelfDeblur, a self-supervised approach, allows for internal training within a test image but does not fully utilize external datasets. To improve deblurring performance, we propose a novel self-supervised meta-auxiliary learning method that combines external and internal learning. We introduce a self-supervised auxiliary reconstruction task that shares part of the network with the primary deblurring task and is trained on an external dataset. Additionally, we propose a meta-auxiliary training scheme to further optimize the pre-trained model for fast adaptation at test time. The performance of both tasks is coupled during training, allowing us to exploit internal information at test time through the auxiliary task to enhance deblurring performance. Extensive experiments on evaluation datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for test-time adaptation.
