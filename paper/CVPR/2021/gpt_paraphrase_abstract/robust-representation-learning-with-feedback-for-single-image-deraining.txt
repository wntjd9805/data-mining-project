The abstract discusses the development of a deraining network, which aims to remove rain streaks from images. Existing methods often overlook model errors caused by uncertainty, resulting in decreased embedding quality. In contrast, the proposed method replaces low-quality features with latent high-quality features to improve performance. The approach incorporates a closed-loop feedback system inspired by automatic control principles to obtain these high-quality features. Additionally, a novel technique for error detection and feature compensation is introduced to address model errors. Extensive experiments on benchmark and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current state-of-the-art techniques. The code for the method is available at: https://github.com/LI-Hao-SJTU/DerainRLNet.
