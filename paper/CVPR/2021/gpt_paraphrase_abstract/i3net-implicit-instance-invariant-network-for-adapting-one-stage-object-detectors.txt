Recent research on adapting two-stage cross-domain detection methods has focused on utilizing local feature patterns to improve adaptation accuracy. These methods heavily rely on region proposal mechanisms and ROI-based instance-level features to align fine-grained features for foreground objects. However, one-stage detectors face challenges in obtaining explicit instance-level features in their detection pipelines. To address this issue, we propose an Implicit Instance-Invariant Network (I3Net) specifically designed for adapting one-stage detectors. I3Net implicitly learns instance-invariant features by leveraging the natural characteristics of deep features in different layers. Our approach facilitates adaptation through three key aspects: 1. Dynamic and Class-Balanced Reweighting (DCBR) strategy: This strategy takes into account both intra-domain and intra-class variations, assigning higher weights to sample-scarce categories and easy-to-adapt samples. 2. Category-aware Object Pattern Matching (COPM) module: This module enhances cross-domain matching of foreground objects by utilizing categorical information and suppressing uninformative background features.3. Regularized Joint Category Alignment (RJCA) module: This module enforces category alignment at different domain-specific layers through consistency regularization.Experimental results demonstrate that I3Net outperforms existing methods on benchmark datasets.
