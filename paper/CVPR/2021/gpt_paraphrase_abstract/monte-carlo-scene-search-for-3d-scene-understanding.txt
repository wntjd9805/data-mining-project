We investigate the utilization of a general AI algorithm for understanding 3D scenes in order to decrease the reliance on training data. Specifically, we suggest modifying the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to extract objects and room layouts from noisy RGB-D scans. Although MCTS was initially designed for game-playing purposes, we demonstrate its applicability to complex perception problems. Our adapted MCTS algorithm possesses a small number of easily adjustable hyperparameters and can optimize general losses. We employ it to optimize the posterior probability of object and room layout hypotheses based on the RGB-D data. This approach adopts an analysis-by-synthesis methodology, where the solution space is explored by rendering the current solution and comparing it to the RGB-D observations. To enhance the efficiency of this exploration, we propose simple modifications to the standard MCTS' tree construction and exploration policy. We validate our approach using the ScanNet dataset and find that our method frequently produces configurations that are superior to certain manual annotations, particularly in terms of layouts.âˆ—The first two authors contributed equally.
