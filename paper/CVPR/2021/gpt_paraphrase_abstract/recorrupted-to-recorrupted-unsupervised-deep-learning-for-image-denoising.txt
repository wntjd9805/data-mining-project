Recent developments in image denoising have focused on deep denoiser, a deep network specifically designed for denoising. However, the performance of unsupervised deep denoisers, which only utilize noisy images without ground truth for training, is not as competitive as their supervised counterparts. To address this issue and create a more powerful unsupervised deep denoiser, this study introduces a data augmentation technique called recorrupted-to-recorrupted (R2R). R2R helps mitigate overfitting caused by the absence of truth images. By utilizing the R2R method to construct pairs of noisy/noisy images, it is demonstrated that the resulting cost function is statistically equivalent to the cost function used in supervised denoisers that utilize pairs of noisy/truth images. Through extensive experiments, it is shown that the proposed R2R method outperforms existing unsupervised deep denoisers and is competitive with representative supervised deep denoisers.
