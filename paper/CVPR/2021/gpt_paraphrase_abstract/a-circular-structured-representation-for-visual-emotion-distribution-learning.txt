Visual Emotion Analysis (VEA) has gained significant attention due to the popularity of image sharing on social networks. Instead of approaching VEA as a single-label classification task, it is more reasonable to address it in a label distribution learning (LDL) paradigm, considering the ambiguous and subjective nature of human emotions. Unlike other LDL tasks, emotions have intrinsic relationships and distinct characteristics as shown in psychological theories. Building upon this insight, we propose a well-grounded circular-structured representation that incorporates prior knowledge for visual emotion distribution learning. Specifically, we create an Emotion Circle that encompasses all emotional states. Each emotion distribution is represented by an emotion vector on the Emotion Circle, defined by three attributes (emotion polarity, emotion type, and emotion intensity) and two properties (similarity and additivity). Additionally, we introduce a novel Progressive Circular (PC) loss to penalize dissimilarities between predicted and labeled emotion vectors in a coarse-to-fine manner, enhancing emotion-specific learning. Through extensive experiments and comparisons on public visual emotion distribution datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches.
