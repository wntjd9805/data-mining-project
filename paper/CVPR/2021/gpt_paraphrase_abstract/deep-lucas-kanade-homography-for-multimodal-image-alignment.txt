Estimating homography to align image pairs captured by different sensors or image pairs with large appearance changes is a crucial challenge in computer vision applications. Our proposed solution addresses this challenge by extending the traditional Lucas-Kanade algorithm with networks. Our method introduces a feature map called deep Lucas-Kanade feature map (DLKFM), which learns to recognize invariant features under various appearance-changing conditions. The DLKFM has two key properties: (1) The template feature map maintains brightness consistency with the input feature map, minimizing color differences, and (2) The Lucas-Kanade objective function built on DLKFM has a smooth landscape around ground truth homography parameters, enabling easy convergence to the ground truth through iterative solutions. By updating the Lucas-Kanade algorithm on our feature maps, we achieve precise alignment of image pairs with significant appearance changes. We provide access to the datasets, code, and demo video online.
