This abstract discusses the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in style transfer between images. Style transfer involves transferring the artistic style of one image onto another while preserving the content of the latter. The current state-of-the-art technique in neural style transfer is AdaptiveInstance Normalization (AdaIN), which can transfer a variety of styles in real time by transferring the statistical properties of style features to a content image. However, AdaIN is a global operation and often ignores local geometric structures in the style image during the transfer process.To address this limitation, the authors propose a new technique called Adaptive Convolutions (AdaConv). AdaConv is a generic extension of AdaIN that allows for the simultaneous transfer of both statistical and structural styles in real time. This means that not only can AdaConv transfer the statistical properties of style features, but it can also capture and transfer the local geometric structures of the style image. In addition to style transfer, the proposed method can also be easily extended to style-based image generation and other tasks where AdaIN is already being used.
