Recently, there has been an increased focus on few-shot object detection to address situations where there is limited data. However, most previous research has only concentrated on the performance of detecting a few-shot categories. We argue that it is crucial to be able to detect all classes since test samples in realistic applications can contain any instances. This requires the few-shot detector to learn new concepts without forgetting previous knowledge. By analyzing transfer learning methods, we have identified some overlooked but beneficial properties that can be leveraged to design a simple yet effective few-shot detector called Retentive R-CNN. This detector includes a Bias-Balanced RPN to address biases in the pretrained RPN and a Re-detector to locate few-shot class objects without forgetting previous knowledge. We have conducted extensive experiments on few-shot detection benchmarks and our results show that Retentive R-CNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of overall performance across all settings. It achieves competitive results on few-shot classes while maintaining the performance of base classes. Our approach demonstrates that a never-forgetting learner is now achievable in object detection.
