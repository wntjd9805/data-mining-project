We propose a new method for removing reflections from images taken with both flash and ambient lighting. Our approach utilizes a flash-only image, generated by subtracting the ambient image from the flash image in raw data space. We find that the flash-only image is free of reflections and can be used as a reliable cue for identifying reflections in the ambient image. To address artifacts present in the flash-only image, we develop a dedicated model that accurately estimates both the reflection and transmission in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that our model, using reflection-free flash-only cues, outperforms existing reflection removal methods in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) by significant margins. Our source code and dataset are publicly available for further research.
