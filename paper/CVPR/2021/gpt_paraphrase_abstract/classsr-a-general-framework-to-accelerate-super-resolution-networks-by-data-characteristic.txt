Our goal is to speed up super-resolution (SR) networks for large images (2K-8K). In practical usage, these large images are divided into smaller sub-images. We have observed that different regions of an image have varying levels of difficulty for restoration, with smoother areas being easier to enhance compared to complex textures. To take advantage of this, we propose a new solution pipeline called ClassSR that combines classification and SR in a unified framework. ClassSR consists of two modules: the Class-Module and the SR-Module. The Class-Module classifies the sub-images into different classes based on their restoration difficulties, while the SR-Module performs SR for different classes. The Class-Module is a conventional classification network, while the SR-Module is a container that includes the SR network to be accelerated and its simplified versions. We also introduce a new classification method with two losses - Class-Loss and Average-Loss - to generate classification results. Through joint training, a majority of sub-images can be processed by smaller networks, resulting in significant reduction in computational cost.Experimental results demonstrate that our ClassSR approach can help existing methods such as FSRCNN, CARN, SRResNet, and RCAN save up to 50% of FLOPs (floating point operations) on DIV8K datasets. This general framework can also be applied to other low-level vision tasks.
