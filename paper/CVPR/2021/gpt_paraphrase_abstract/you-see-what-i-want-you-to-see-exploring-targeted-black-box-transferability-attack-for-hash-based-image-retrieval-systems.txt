Deep hashing techniques have gained popularity for efficient image retrieval and storage in the era of large multimedia content online. However, these techniques, which inherit the algorithmic backend from softmax classification, are susceptible to adversarial examples. Moreover, the extensive collection of online images in databases creates new opportunities for attackers to embed adversarial images and target specific categories for retrieval by user queries. This paper takes an adversarial approach to investigate and enhance targeted black-box transferability attacks for deep hashing. The research is motivated by empirical studies that highlight the unique challenges in image retrieval. The authors explore the relationship between adversarial subspace and black-box transferability using random noise as a proxy. They then propose a novel attack that is both adversarial and robust to noise, thereby enhancing transferability. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements of 1.2-3Ã— in black-box transferability compared to existing mechanisms. The code for the proposed method is available at the given GitHub link.
