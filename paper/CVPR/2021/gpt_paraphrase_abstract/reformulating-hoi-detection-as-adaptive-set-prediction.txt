Determining the optimal image regions for detecting Human-Object Interaction (HOI) is crucial. Existing HOI detectors focus on either detected human and object pairs or predefined interaction locations, limiting their ability to learn effective features. This paper introduces a new approach called AdaptiveSet-based one-stage framework (AS-Net) that formulates HOI detection as an adaptive set prediction problem. AS-Net consists of parallel instance and interaction branches. It utilizes a trainable interaction query set and transformer to map it to an interaction prediction set. Each query adaptively aggregates interaction-relevant features from global contexts through multi-head co-attention. The training process is supervised adaptively by matching ground-truth with interaction predictions. Additionally, an instance-aware attention module is designed to incorporate instructive features from the instance branch into the interaction branch. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three challenging HOI detection datasets, including a significant 31% relative improvement on the large-scale HICO-DET dataset.
