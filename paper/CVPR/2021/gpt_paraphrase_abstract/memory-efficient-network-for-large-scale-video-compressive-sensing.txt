This paper presents a novel approach for video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) using a memory-efficient network based on multi-group reversible 3D convolutional neural networks. SCI captures a sequence of video frames in a single shot by applying different masks on a high-speed scene during one exposure time. Optimization algorithms or deep learning methods are typically used to reconstruct the desired video frames from the compressed measurement. However, these methods have limitations such as long running time and large memory occupation, which hinder their practical application. The proposed model overcomes these limitations and achieves superior results in terms of memory efficiency and performance compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. The model is capable of reconstructing color videos directly from Bayer measurements by combining demosaicing and SCI reconstruction. Experimental results on simulated and real data captured by SCI cameras validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.
