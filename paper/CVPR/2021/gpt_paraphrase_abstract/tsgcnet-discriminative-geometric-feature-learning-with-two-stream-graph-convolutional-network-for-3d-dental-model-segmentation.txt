Precise segmentation of teeth from 3D dental models is a crucial task in computer-aided orthodontic surgical planning. Deep learning methods have been widely used for this purpose. However, current state-of-the-art methods overlook the different geometric meanings provided by the raw attributes of the 3D inputs, which can lead to confusion in learning discriminative geometric features and inaccurate predictions. To address this issue, we propose a two-stream graph convolutional network (TSGCNet) that learns multi-view geometric information from different attributes. Our TSGCNet consists of two graph-learning streams that extract high-level geometric representations from coordinates and normal vectors, respectively. These representations are then fused to integrate the complementary information for tooth segmentation. We evaluate our method on a dataset of real-patient dental models and demonstrate that it outperforms existing methods for 3D shape segmentation. The results suggest that simply concatenating the raw attributes as a single feature vector, as commonly done in conventional single-stream networks, fails to properly integrate the complementary information and leads to inaccurate predictions.
