Low-light image enhancement is crucial in the field of low-level vision. Existing deep learning models for this task often involve complex architectural design and high computational burden. In this study, we propose a new approach called Retinex-inspired Unrolling with Architecture Search (RUAS) to develop a lightweight yet effective enhancement network for low-light images in real-world scenarios. RUAS utilizes the Retinex rule to establish models that capture the inherent underexposed structure of low-light images. It then unrolls the optimization processes to construct a comprehensive propagation structure. Additionally, RUAS incorporates a cooperative reference-free learning strategy to explore low-light prior architectures from a compact search space. This enables the development of a high-performing image enhancement network that is fast and requires minimal computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of RUAS over recently proposed state-of-the-art methods. More information about the project can be found at http://dutmedia.org/RUAS/.
