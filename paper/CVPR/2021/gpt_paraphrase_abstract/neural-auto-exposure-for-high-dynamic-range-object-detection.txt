This abstract discusses the limitations of current imaging sensors in capturing real-world scenes with high dynamic ranges. It mentions the use of high dynamic range (HDR) sensors to recover HDR images from multiple captures with different exposures, but notes the disadvantages of these sensors including artifacts, reduced fill-factor, lower resolution, and high cost. The abstract proposes an alternative solution by revisiting auto-exposure control and introducing a neural network for exposure selection. This network is trained together with an object detector and an image signal processing pipeline. The authors use an HDR dataset for automotive object detection and a corresponding training procedure. The abstract concludes by stating that the proposed neural auto-exposure control outperforms conventional methods by more than 6 points in mean average precision (mAP).
