Detecting spliced images is a growing challenge in computer vision. Instead of focusing on low-level artifacts, we propose using image retrieval to address this problem. Our aim is to retrieve the original image when given a spliced query image from a database of authentic images. To achieve this, we suggest representing an image by its constituent objects, as the finest manipulations often occur at the object-level. We introduce a framework called OE-SIR that utilizes object detectors to localize object regions and embeds each region to collectively represent the image. Additionally, we propose a student-teacher training approach to learn discriminative embeddings within object regions efficiently. We also conduct a detailed analysis of different feature embedding models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OE-SIR achieves state-of-the-art performance in spliced image retrieval.
