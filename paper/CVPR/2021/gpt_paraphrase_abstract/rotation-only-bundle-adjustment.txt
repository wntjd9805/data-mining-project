We present a new technique for determining the global rotations of cameras without considering their positions and the scene structure. By observing five or more common points with calibrated cameras, we can calculate the relative rotation independently of translation. We expand this concept to multiple views, separating rotation estimation from translation and structure estimation. Our approach offers several advantages, including immunity to imprecise translations and structures, as well as improved accuracy when combined with rotation averaging. Through extensive evaluations on synthetic and real datasets, we consistently achieve significant accuracy gains when using our method alongside the state-of-the-art rotation averaging technique.
