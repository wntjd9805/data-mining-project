We introduce Scale-aware AutoAug as a method for learning data augmentation policies specifically for object detection. Our approach involves defining a new scale-aware search space, which incorporates both image- and box-level augmentations to ensure scale invariance. To enhance search efficiency, we propose a new metric called Pareto Scale Balance. Through experiments, we demonstrate that Scale-aware AutoAug consistently and significantly improves the performance of various object detectors, including RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN, and FCOS. These improvements are even observed when compared to strong multi-scale training baselines. Furthermore, the augmentation policies learned through our method can be transferred to other datasets and box-level tasks, such as instance segmentation and keypoint estimation, to enhance performance in those domains.Importantly, the search cost of our approach is much lower than previous automated augmentation methods for object detection. Additionally, the augmentation policies discovered through our method exhibit meaningful patterns, providing valuable insights for human-designed data augmentation strategies.For access to the code and models used in our study, please visit https://github.com/Jia-Research-Lab/SA-AutoAug.
