Current face forgery detection methods have achieved high accuracy in identifying forgeries within a single database. However, their performance is unsatisfactory when dealing with forgeries generated by different algorithms in a cross-database scenario. This is because CNN-based detectors tend to overfit to specific color textures, making it difficult for them to generalize. To address this issue, we propose using high-frequency noises in images to detect face forgeries. We have developed three functional modules to effectively utilize these high-frequency features. The first module extracts high-frequency noises at multiple scales to create a new modality. The second module guides the low-level RGB feature extractor to focus more on forgery traces using residual-guided spatial attention. The third module leverages the correlation between the two modalities to promote feature learning through cross-modality attention. Our proposed method has been extensively evaluated on various benchmark databases, and the results confirm its superior performance in generalization.
