This study focuses on the challenge of human pose estimation in computer vision, which involves locating key points on the human body. While human vision can handle various data corruptions like blur and pixelation, current pose estimators struggle with these corruptions. To address this problem, the researchers develop robust benchmarks (COCO-C, MPII-C, and OCHuman-C) to evaluate the weaknesses of existing pose estimators. They also propose a model-agnostic algorithm called AdvMix, which improves the robustness of pose estimators against different corruptions. AdvMix utilizes adversarial augmentation and knowledge distillation techniques. Adversarial augmentation involves training two neural network modules jointly and competitively, where a generator network mixes corrupted images to confuse the pose estimator and enhance its robustness. Knowledge distillation is then applied to transfer clean pose structure knowledge to the pose estimator, compensating for the noise patterns introduced by adversarial augmentation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdvMix significantly improves the robustness of pose estimations across various corruptions while maintaining accuracy on clean data in challenging benchmark datasets.
