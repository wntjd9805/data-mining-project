This paper introduces a new approach for efficient video recognition called conditional early exiting. Instead of selecting specific frames to reduce computation costs, the proposed method uses a simple sampling strategy combined with conditional early exiting. The model learns to process fewer frames for simpler videos and more frames for complex ones. This is achieved through a cascade of gating modules that automatically determine the earliest point in processing where an inference is sufficiently reliable. On-the-fly supervision signals are generated to dynamically balance accuracy and computational cost. The proposed model outperforms existing methods on three large-scale video benchmarks, including ActivityNet1.3, mini-kinetics, and HVU. Notably, it achieves better results with significantly fewer GFLOPs compared to state-of-the-art efficient video recognition methods.
