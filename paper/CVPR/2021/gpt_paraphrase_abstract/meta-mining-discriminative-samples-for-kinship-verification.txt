Kinship verification is the process of determining whether there is a familial relationship between two given facial images. However, kinship verification databases often have imbalanced data, with a large number of negative pairs compared to positive pairs. This poses a challenge in effectively utilizing the limited positive pairs and extracting discriminative information from the abundant negative samples for kinship verification.  To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel approach called Discriminative Sample Meta-Mining (DSMM). Unlike existing methods that create a balanced dataset with fixed negative pairs, our approach leverages all possible pairs and automatically learns discriminative information from the data. This is achieved by sampling an unbalanced train batch and a balanced meta-train batch for each iteration. Next, a meta-miner is trained using the meta-gradient on the balanced meta-train batch. Finally, the samples in the unbalanced train batch are re-weighted based on the learned meta-miner to optimize the kinship models.  Experimental results conducted on popular kinship verification datasets, including KinFaceW-I, KinFaceW-II, TSKinFace, and Cornell Kinship, demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.  In summary, this paper presents the DSMM approach for kinship verification. By utilizing all possible pairs and leveraging a meta-miner, our approach effectively addresses the challenge of imbalanced data in kinship verification databases. The experimental results validate the efficacy of our approach across various datasets.
