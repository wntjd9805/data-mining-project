Unsupervised object re-identification aims to learn distinctive representations for object retrieval without any annotations. Currently, clustering-based methods dominate this research area, but they are still affected by the problem of noisy pseudo labels. To address this challenge, we propose a strategy that involves estimating pseudo label similarities between consecutive training generations using clustering consensus and refining pseudo labels through temporal propagation and ensembling. This is the first attempt to apply the concept of temporal ensembling to improve classification in scenarios with dynamically changing classes over generations. Our proposed pseudo label refinement strategy is simple yet effective and can easily be integrated into existing clustering-based unsupervised re-identification methods. By adopting our approach, the state-of-the-art method can achieve up to an 8.8% mean average precision improvement on the challenging MSMT17 dataset.
