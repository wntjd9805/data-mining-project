To address the issue of errors caused by mirror surfaces in depth sensing and 3D reconstruction, we have created the Mirror3D dataset. This dataset consists of a collection of 7,011 mirror instance masks and corresponding 3D planes, derived from three RGBD datasets (Matterport3D, NYUv2, and ScanNet). Additionally, we have developed a module called Mirror3DNet, which aims to refine the depth data obtained from sensors or estimated from other methods, specifically focusing on correcting errors on mirror surfaces.  The main concept behind Mirror3DNet is to estimate the 3D plane of the mirror using RGB input and the surrounding depth context. This estimate is then used to directly predict the depth of the mirror surface. Through a series of experiments, we have demonstrated that Mirror3DNet effectively reduces errors in various types of input depth data, including raw sensor depth and depth estimation or completion methods.
