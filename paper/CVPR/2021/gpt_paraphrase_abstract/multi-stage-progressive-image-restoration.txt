We introduce a novel approach for image restoration tasks that effectively balances spatial details and contextual information. Our proposed multi-stage architecture breaks down the image recovery process into manageable steps by progressively learning restoration functions. Our model combines contextualized features with a high-resolution branch to retain local information, and utilizes per-pixel adaptive design to reweight local features using supervised attention. Our architecture also includes information exchange between stages through sequential and lateral connections to ensure no loss of information. The resulting MPRNet architecture demonstrates strong performance across various image restoration tasks, such as deraining, deblurring, and denoising.
