We present the Soft Shadow Network (SSN), an interactive tool for generating controllable soft shadows in image compositing. The SSN is flexible and can be used with different types of images, such as paintings and vector art. By utilizing an environment light map, the characteristics of the shadows, including angle and softness, can be adjusted. The SSN incorporates an Ambient Occlusion Prediction module, which predicts an intermediate ambient occlusion map that can be further refined by the user to provide geometric cues for modulating the shadow generation. To train the model, we have developed an efficient pipeline that uses 3D object models to create diverse soft shadow training data. Additionally, we propose using an inverse shadow map representation to enhance the model training. Our experiments demonstrate that the SSN produces realistic soft shadows in real-time. User studies indicate that the generated shadows are often indistinguishable from those calculated by a physics-based renderer, and users can easily generate specific shadow effects within minutes using the interactive SSN application.
