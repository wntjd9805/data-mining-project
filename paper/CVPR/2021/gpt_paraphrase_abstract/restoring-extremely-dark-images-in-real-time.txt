A new deep learning architecture is proposed for enhancing extremely low-light single images. The proposed model achieves fast and lightweight inference while producing visually appealing restorations comparable to computationally intense models. The model processes most of the information in higher scale-spaces, skipping intermediate scales whenever possible. Additionally, the model has the capability to process all scale-spaces concurrently, resulting in a 30% speedup without compromising restoration quality. To address the need for pre-amplification in extreme low-light image enhancement, an amplifier module is introduced. This module estimates the amplification factor using only the input raw image and can be used with pre-trained models without any fine-tuning. The model demonstrates the ability to restore ultra-high-definition 4K resolution images in just 1 second on a CPU and at 32 fps on a GPU while maintaining competitive restoration quality. Furthermore, the proposed model generalizes well to unseen cameras during training and can be applied to other tasks such as object detection without the need for fine-tuning.
