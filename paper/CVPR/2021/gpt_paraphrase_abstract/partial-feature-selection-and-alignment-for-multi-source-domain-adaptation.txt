Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA) has gained attention in the research community as a way to transfer knowledge from multiple source domains to an unlabeled target domain. Current studies on MSDA assume that the source and target domains have consistent key feature representations and identical label space. These studies typically use the entire set of features from both the source and target domains to align the feature map for each category and domain. However, this approach overlooks the issue of "partialness", where some features in the source domains may not be present in the target domain, and the label space of the target domain may not completely overlap with the source domains. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Source Partial Domain Adaptation (MSPDA) as a more generalized MSDA task. We propose a novel model called Partial Feature Selection and Alignment (PFSA) to address both MSDA and MSPDA tasks. PFSA utilizes a feature selection vector based on the correlation among the features of multiple sources and target domains. We also design three feature alignment losses to align the selected features by preserving the domain information and discrimination between different classes. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PFSA outperforms state-of-the-art MSDA and unimodal PDA methods in both MSDA and MSPDA tasks.
