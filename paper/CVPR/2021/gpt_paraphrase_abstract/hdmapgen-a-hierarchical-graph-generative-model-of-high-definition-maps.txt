HD maps are crucial for autonomous driving systems, as they provide precise definitions of road lanes and traffic rules. However, the limited availability of real-world road topologies and geometries hinders the testing of self-driving technology in new scenarios. To tackle this problem, we propose a challenging task of generating HD maps. We explore different autoregressive models, such as sequence, plain graph, and hierarchical graph, to generate these maps. Our model, HDMapGen, follows a coarse-to-fine approach and produces high-quality and diverse HD maps. Experimental results on the Argoverse dataset and our own dataset show that HDMapGen outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, HDMapGen exhibits scalability and efficiency.
