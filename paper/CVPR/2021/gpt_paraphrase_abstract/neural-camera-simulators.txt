We have developed a camera simulator that uses deep neural networks to generate raw image data with different camera settings. Our simulator includes modules for exposure correction, noise simulation, and aperture effects. To train our simulator, we collected a dataset of 10,000 raw images with varying exposure settings. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms other methods in synthesizing raw data across multiple cameras. In addition, our simulator can be used for applications such as enhancing large apertures, HDR imaging, auto exposure, and data augmentation for training local feature detectors. This work is the first attempt to simulate a camera sensor's behavior by combining traditional raw sensor features with data-driven deep learning. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ken-ouyang/neural image simulator.
