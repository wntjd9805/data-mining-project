This paper presents NBNet, a new framework for image denoising that approaches the problem from a different perspective. Instead of traditional methods, the proposed approach focuses on noise reduction through image-adaptive projection. The framework trains a network to separate signal and noise by learning a set of reconstruction basis in the feature space. By selecting the corresponding basis of the signal subspace and projecting the input into this space, image denoising is achieved while maintaining the local structure of the input signal, particularly in areas with low light or weak textures. To enable this, the paper introduces SSA, a non-local attention module designed to learn basis generation and subspace projection explicitly. SSA is incorporated into NBNet, a UNet structured network designed for end-to-end image denoising. The performance of NBNet is evaluated on benchmark datasets (SIDD and DND), demonstrating state-of-the-art results in terms of PSNR and SSIM with significantly reduced computational cost.
