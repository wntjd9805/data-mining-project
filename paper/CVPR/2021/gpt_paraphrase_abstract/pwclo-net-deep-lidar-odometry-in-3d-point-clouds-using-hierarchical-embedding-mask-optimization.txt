This paper introduces a new 3D point cloud learning model called PWCLO-Net for deep LiDAR odometry. The model utilizes hierarchical embedding mask optimization to refine the estimated pose in a coarse-to-fine manner. The proposed model incorporates the Pyramid, Warping, and Cost volume (PWC) structure to enhance the accuracy of LiDAR odometry. It constructs an attentive cost volume to associate two point clouds and extract motion patterns. Additionally, a novel trainable embedding mask is introduced to weigh the local motion patterns of all points and predict the overall pose while filtering outlier points. The estimated pose is used to warp the first point cloud, bridging the gap to the second point cloud, and generating a cost volume for residual motion. The embedding mask is optimized hierarchically from coarse to fine, providing more accurate filtering information for pose refinement. The trainable pose warp-refinement process is iteratively employed to enhance the robustness of pose estimation against outliers. Experimental results on the KITTI odometry dataset demonstrate the superior performance and effectiveness of the proposed PWCLO-Net compared to recent learning-based methods and the geometry-based approach, LOAM with mapping optimization, across most sequences.
