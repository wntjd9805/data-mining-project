We introduce SMURF, an unsupervised learning technique for optical flow. SMURF surpasses the previous best method, UFlow, by 36% to 40% on benchmark tests, and even outperforms supervised approaches such as PWC-Net and FlowNet2. Our approach combines improvements from supervised optical flow models, specifically the RAFT model, with novel ideas for unsupervised learning. These ideas include a self-supervision loss that is aware of sequential information, a method for handling motion that occurs outside the frame, and an effective way to learn from multi-frame video data while only using two frames for inference.
