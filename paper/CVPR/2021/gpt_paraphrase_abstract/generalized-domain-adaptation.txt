Various unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) problems have been proposed and solved individually, but this approach is limited as methods that work for one variant often do not work for others. To address this, we introduce Generalized Domain Adaptation (GDA), which provides a comprehensive framework that covers major UDA variants. GDA also introduces a new challenging setting where domain labels are unknown and class labels are only partially provided for each domain. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach based on self-supervised class-destructive learning, allowing the learning of class-invariant representations and domain-adversarial classifiers without the need for domain labels. Extensive experiments using three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art UDA methods in this new setting and remains competitive in existing UDA variations.
