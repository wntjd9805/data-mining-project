Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a commonly used method for processing temporal data. However, existing approaches lack the ability to learn discriminative prototypes for different classes and utilize them for further analysis. To address this limitation, we propose a new method called Discriminative Prototype DTW (DP-DTW) for learning class-specific prototypes in temporal recognition tasks. DP-DTW outperforms traditional DTWs in time series classification benchmarks. When combined with end-to-end deep learning, DP-DTW successfully tackles challenging weakly supervised action segmentation problems, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. Additionally, the learned action prototypes enable detailed reasoning on input videos, allowing for action-based video summarization by aligning the input sequence with the prototypes.
