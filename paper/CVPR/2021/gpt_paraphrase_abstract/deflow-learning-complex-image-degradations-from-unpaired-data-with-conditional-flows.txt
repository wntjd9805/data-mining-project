Obtaining paired data is a major obstacle in learning image restoration and enhancement models for real-world applications. To address this issue, current strategies focus on generating synthetic training data that mimic real-world noise and degradations. In this study, we introduce DeFlow, a method for learning stochastic image degradations from unpaired data. Our approach utilizes a unique formulation for conditional normalizing flows, allowing us to model the degradation process in the latent space of a shared flow encoder-decoder network. By minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the marginal distributions, we can learn the conditional distribution of a noisy image given the clean input. We evaluate our DeFlow formulation on the task of joint image restoration and super-resolution and compare it to previous learnable approaches using three recent datasets. The models trained with synthetic data generated by DeFlow outperform the existing methods. We will provide the code and trained models at: https://github.com/volflow/DeFlow.
