Recently, there has been significant progress in image-to-image translation for both multi-label and multi-style tasks. However, existing approaches struggle with the independence and exclusivity of labels, leading to uncontrolled manipulations in the translation results. To address this issue, we propose Hierarchical Style Disentanglement (HiSD). Our approach organizes labels into a hierarchical tree structure, allocating independent tags, exclusive attributes, and disentangled styles from top to bottom. We design a new translation process that adapts this structure and identifies styles for controllable translations. We evaluate the effectiveness of HiSD using qualitative and quantitative results on the CelebA-HQ dataset. The code for HiSD is available at https://github.com/imlixinyang/HiSD.
