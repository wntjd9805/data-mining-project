Scene graph generation is a challenging task in computer vision due to the uneven distribution of classes and variations within classes. To overcome these challenges, we present a new bipartite graph neural network that incorporates confidence awareness and adaptive message propagation. Additionally, we propose a bi-level data resampling strategy to address the issue of imbalanced data distribution during training. Our approach outperforms previous methods on various datasets, such as Visual Genome and Open Images V4/V6, highlighting its effectiveness and versatility.
