Glass surfaces can pose challenges for computer vision tasks. A recent method for detecting glass surfaces using multi-scale contextual information is limited in its effectiveness due to its reliance on general context integration and lack of consideration for specific glass surface properties. In contrast, humans rely on identifying reflections and locating boundaries to detect glass surfaces. To address this, we propose a model for glass surface detection that includes a rich context aggregation module (RCAM) to extract multi-scale boundary features and a reflection-based refinement module (RRM) to differentiate glass regions from non-glass regions by detecting reflections. We also introduce a dataset of 4,012 annotated glass images for glass surface detection. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms existing methods in related fields.
