Self-supervised scene flow learning in point clouds has become a popular topic due to the lack of annotated data. Previous methods have used point-wise matching based on 3D point coordinates to establish correspondences between point clouds. However, this approach overlooks other important measures such as color and surface normal, leading to sub-par performance and potential mismatches. To address these issues, we propose formulating the matching task as an optimal transport problem. By considering multiple descriptors and enforcing mass equality constraints, our approach ensures more accurate and discriminative matching. Additionally, we introduce a random walk module to promote local consistency of the pseudo labels obtained from the optimal assignment matrix. Experimental results on FlyingThings3D and KITTI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other self-supervised learning methods. Remarkably, our self-supervised approach even performs on par with some supervised learning approaches, despite not requiring any ground truth flow for training.
