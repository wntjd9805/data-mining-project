We introduce Picasso, a new CUDA-based library that offers innovative modules for deep learning on complex real-world 3D meshes. Previous studies have shown that hierarchical neural architectures are effective for extracting multi-scale features, which necessitates fast mesh decimation. However, current methods rely on CPU-based implementations to obtain multi-resolution meshes. To address this, we have developed GPU-accelerated mesh decimation that efficiently reduces network resolution on-the-fly. During decimation, we define pooling and unpooling modules based on the vertex clusters that are gathered. For feature learning on meshes, Picasso includes three types of novel convolutions: facet2vertex, vertex2facet, and facet2facet convolution. Unlike previous methods that treat a mesh as a spatial graph with edges, we treat it as a geometric structure consisting of vertices and facets. In order to handle variations in mesh sampling (vertex density), Picasso incorporates a fuzzy mechanism in its filters. Gaussian mixtures are utilized to define fuzzy coefficients for the facet2vertex convolution, while barycentric interpolation defines the coefficients for the other two convolutions. In this release, we showcase the effectiveness of our proposed modules by achieving competitive segmentation results on the S3DIS dataset. We plan to make the library publicly available on GitHub.
