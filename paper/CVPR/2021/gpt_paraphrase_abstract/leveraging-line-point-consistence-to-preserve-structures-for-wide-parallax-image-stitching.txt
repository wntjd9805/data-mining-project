In computer vision, generating high-quality stitched images with natural structures is a difficult task. However, this paper introduces a method that successfully preserves both local and global geometric structures in wide parallax images, while reducing artifacts and distortions. The method utilizes a projective invariant called Characteristic Number to match co-planar local sub-regions in input images, resulting in consistent line and point pairs that suppress artifacts in overlapping areas. Additionally, global collinear structures are incorporated into an objective function to specify and balance desired characteristics for image warping, ultimately preserving both local and global structures and mitigating distortions. The paper also presents comprehensive measures for stitching quality, which quantify the collinearity of points and the discrepancy of matched line pairs, taking into account human vision's sensitivity to linear structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing techniques, producing stitched images with sharp textures and prominent natural structures. Notably, the method exhibits lower errors and minimal divergence across all test images. The code for this method can be accessed at https://github.com/dut-media-lab/Image-Stitching.
