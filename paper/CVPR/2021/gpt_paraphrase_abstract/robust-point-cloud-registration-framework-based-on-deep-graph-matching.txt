This paper presents a new approach to point cloud registration using a deep graph matching-based framework. Traditional learning-based methods have shown progress but are sensitive to outliers, leading to incorrect correspondences. To address this issue, the authors propose transforming point clouds into graphs and extracting deep features for each point. They develop a module based on deep graph matching to calculate a soft correspondence matrix, which considers not only the local geometry but also the structure and topology of each point in a larger range. The network is trained using a loss defined on the correspondences, and during testing, the soft correspondences are transformed into hard one-to-one correspondences for registration. Additionally, a transformer-based method is introduced to generate edges for graph construction, improving the quality of the correspondences. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in registering clean, noisy, partial-to-partial, and unseen category point clouds. The code for this method will be publicly available at the provided GitHub link.
