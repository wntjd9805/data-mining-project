Consensus maximisation (MaxCon) is a commonly used method in computer vision for accurate fitting. Its objective is to identify the largest subset of data that fits a given model within a specified tolerance level. This paper explores the relationship between the MaxCon problem and the problem of finding the maximum upper zero of a Monotone Boolean Function (MBF) defined over the Boolean Cube. By connecting these two concepts, the paper establishes a link between the influences of points in a MBF and outliers in the MaxCon problem. It demonstrates that the influences of points belonging to the largest structure in the data tend to be smaller under certain conditions. Leveraging this observation, an iterative algorithm is proposed for performing consensus maximisation. Experimental results using both synthetic and real visual data indicate that the MBF based algorithm can generate near-optimal solutions relatively quickly. This is particularly valuable in scenarios where there are a significant number of outliers, whether they are gross errors or pseudo outliers, in the observed data.
