This paper introduces a novel method called ArtCoder, which utilizes the Neural Style Transfer technique to generate personalized and visually appealing QR codes. Traditional QR codes lack visual aesthetics, leading to recent efforts to enhance their appearance. However, existing methods can only generate QR codes with a fixed style. ArtCoder addresses this limitation by allowing for the creation of diverse and attractive QR codes while ensuring scanning robustness. To achieve this, the proposed method incorporates a Sampling-Simulation layer, a module-based code loss, and a competition mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that the stylized QR codes generated by ArtCoder maintain high quality in terms of visual effect and scanning-robustness, making them suitable for real-world applications.
