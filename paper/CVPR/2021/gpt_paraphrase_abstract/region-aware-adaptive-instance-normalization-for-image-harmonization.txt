This paper addresses the importance of image composition in photo editing and the need to adjust the appearance and visual style of the foreground to match the background in order to create photo-realistic composite images. Existing deep learning methods for harmonizing composite images focus on learning an image mapping network without explicitly considering the visual style consistency between the foreground and background. To address this, the paper proposes a Region-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (RAIN) module that formulates the visual style from the background and applies it adaptively to the foreground. The RAIN module can be easily integrated into existing image harmonization networks and provides significant improvements. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. The code for the method is available at https://github.com/junleen/RainNet.
