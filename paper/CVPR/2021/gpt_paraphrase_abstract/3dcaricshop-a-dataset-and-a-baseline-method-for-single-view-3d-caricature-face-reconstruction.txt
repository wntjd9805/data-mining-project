We introduce 3DCaricShop, a large-scale dataset of 2000 high-quality 3D caricatures created by professional artists. This dataset includes paired 2D caricature images, camera parameters, and 3D facial landmarks. We also present a novel approach for reconstructing 3D caricatures from 2D images using this dataset. Our method connects detail-rich implicit functions with parametric mesh representations to ensure faithful and plausible face deformations. We use a view-collaborative graph convolution network (VC-GCN) to accurately align key points on the implicit mesh. Our method produces high-fidelity 3D caricatures with a pre-defined mesh topology suitable for animation. We have conducted extensive experiments on the 3DCaricShop dataset to validate the significance of the database and the effectiveness of our approach. We plan to release 3DCaricShop upon publication.
