In recent decades, the problems of image denoising, demosaicing, and super-resolution have been extensively researched in the field of image restoration. These problems often need to be addressed simultaneously in practical applications. However, the concept of finding a joint solution for multiple image restoration tasks has only recently gained increased attention from researchers. In this study, we propose an end-to-end solution for the joint demosaicing, denoising, and super-resolution problems using a specially designed deep convolutional neural network (CNN). We systematically investigate various methods to tackle this problem and compare them with our proposed approach. Through extensive experiments conducted on large image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively. Furthermore, we explore the use of different loss functions in our proposed scheme and show that employing the mean absolute error as a loss function yields superior results compared to other cases.
