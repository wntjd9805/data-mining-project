This study addresses the limitation of existing gaze target detection methods by proposing a three-stage approach that incorporates 3D contexts. The first stage involves estimating a 3D gaze orientation using a coarse-to-fine strategy based on head movement. The predicted gaze is then divided into a planar gaze on the image plane and a depth-channel gaze. In the second stage, a Dual Attention Module (DAM) is introduced to generate the field of view and mask interfering objects based on depth information. Finally, in the third stage, the dual attention is used to determine whether the gaze target is within the image and, if so, to locate it. Through extensive experiments, the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the GazeFollow and VideoAttentionTarget datasets.
