This study introduces an attention-based architecture for temporal action localization in real-world videos. Unlike previous approaches that focus on video-level co-occurrence of actions, this architecture distinguishes between actions occurring at the same time-step and those occurring at different time-steps. The authors define these relationships as action dependencies and propose a novel Multi-Label Action Dependency (MLAD) layer to model them. The MLAD layer consists of two branches: one for co-occurrence action dependencies and another for temporal action dependencies. The authors also develop new metrics to measure the effectiveness of modeling these action dependencies. Through empirical evaluation, they demonstrate improved performance compared to existing methods on multi-label action localization benchmarks (MultiTHUMOS and Charades) based on f-mAP and their proposed metric. The code is available for public use at https://github.com/ptirupat/MLAD.
