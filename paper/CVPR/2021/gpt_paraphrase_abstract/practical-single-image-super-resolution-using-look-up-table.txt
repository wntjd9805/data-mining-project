Various super-resolution algorithms have been developed to enhance or generate missing details in low-resolution images, ranging from interpolation techniques to deep neural networks (DNNs). As the advancements in mobile devices and display hardware continue, there is an increasing demand for practical super-resolution technology. Currently, state-of-the-art methods rely on DNNs to achieve better quality results. However, these methods are primarily suitable for parallel computing modules such as GPUs and face difficulties in being implemented in general applications like end-user software, smartphones, and televisions. In order to address this issue, we propose an efficient and practical approach for super-resolution using a look-up table (LUT). We train a deep super-resolution network with a small receptive field and transfer the output values of this model to the LUT. During testing, we retrieve the precomputed high-resolution output values from the LUT for the given low-resolution input pixels. This proposed method offers fast performance as it avoids the need for a large number of floating-point operations. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach, particularly highlighting its faster execution time and superior quality compared to bicubic interpolation.
