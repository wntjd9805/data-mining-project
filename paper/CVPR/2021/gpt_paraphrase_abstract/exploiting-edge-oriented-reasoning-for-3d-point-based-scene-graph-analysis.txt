This paper presents a novel framework called SGGpoint for scene understanding in computer vision. The framework consists of three stages: scene graph construction, reasoning, and inference. The reasoning stage utilizes the EdgeGCN, which is a Graph Convolutional Network focused on multi-dimensional edge features. This allows for explicit relationship modeling between elements in the scene graph. Additionally, the framework incorporates twinning interaction mechanisms to independently evolve the representations of nodes and edges in the scene graph. The SGGpoint framework is designed to analyze both real-world and synthetic 3D point-based scenes and infer interesting scene structures. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the edge-oriented reasoning approach in generating scene graphs. Furthermore, the framework shows advantages in traditional graph representation learning benchmarks, such as node-wise classification and whole-graph recognition tasks.
