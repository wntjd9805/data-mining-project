This paper introduces a normalizing flow-based kernel prior (FKP) for blind image super-resolution (SR), addressing the limitation of existing methods in fully exploiting the assumption that anisotropic Gaussian kernels are sufficient for image SR. FKP utilizes an invertible mapping between the anisotropic Gaussian kernel distribution and a tractable latent distribution to optimize the kernel in the latent space. This approach improves kernel initialization, enables traversal of the learned kernel manifold, and enhances optimization stability. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world images demonstrate that FKP significantly improves kernel estimation accuracy with fewer parameters, reduced runtime, and lower memory usage, achieving state-of-the-art blind SR results.
