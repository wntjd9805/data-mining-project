Non-maximum Suppression (NMS) is a crucial step in object detection using convolutional neural networks. While convolutions can be easily parallelized, the commonly used GreedyNMS for NMS cannot, causing it to be a performance bottleneck. To address this, a parallelizable alternative called MaxpoolNMS was introduced, which achieves faster speed with comparable accuracy. However, MaxpoolNMS can only replace GreedyNMS in the first stage of two-stage detectors. When applied in the final detection stage, MaxpoolNMS results in a significant drop in accuracy as it fails to approximate GreedyNMS accurately. In this paper, we propose a new approach called PSRR-MaxpoolNMS that can replace GreedyNMS in all stages of all detectors. By incorporating a Relationship Recovery module and a Pyramid Shifted MaxpoolNMS module, our PSRR-MaxpoolNMS achieves a more precise approximation of GreedyNMS compared to MaxpoolNMS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms MaxpoolNMS by a large margin and is faster than GreedyNMS with comparable accuracy. PSRR-MaxpoolNMS offers a fully parallelizable solution for customized hardware design, enabling acceleration of NMS across different applications. The proposed method is visualized and its pipeline is described in Figure 1. Overall, our approach presents a novel and configurable solution for efficient NMS in object detection systems.
