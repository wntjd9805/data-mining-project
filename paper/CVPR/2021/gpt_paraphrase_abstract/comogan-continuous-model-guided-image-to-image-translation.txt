CoMoGAN is a novel continuous GAN that utilizes unsupervised reorganization of target data on a functional manifold. The approach introduces a new Functional Instance Normalization layer and residual mechanism, which effectively separate image content from its position on the target manifold. Naive physics-inspired models are employed to guide the training process, while also allowing private model/translations features. CoMoGAN is compatible with any GAN backbone and enables various types of image translation, including cyclic image translation like timelapse generation or detached linear translation. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMoGAN consistently outperforms existing literature on different datasets. The source code for CoMoGAN can be accessed at https://github.com/cv-rits/CoMoGAN.
