This paper examines the absorption effect in the context of removing reflections from single images. It demonstrates that the absorption effect can be approximated by averaging the refractive amplitude coefficient map. The paper introduces a two-step solution that explicitly considers the absorption effect. The first step estimates the absorption effect from a reflection-contaminated image, and the second step recovers the transmission image using the reflection-contaminated image and the estimated absorption effect. Experimental results on multiple datasets show that the proposed solution successfully removes reflection artifacts and accurately restores the intensity distortion caused by absorption. Further analysis confirms that the method performs well in recovering overall intensity and has a strong generalization capacity. The code for the proposed solution is available at https://github.com/q-zh/absorption.
