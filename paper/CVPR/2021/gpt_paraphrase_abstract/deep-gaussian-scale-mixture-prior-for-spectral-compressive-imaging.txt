This study presents a new method for reconstructing hyperspectral images (HSIs) using coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) system. Previous model-based methods used hand-crafted priors to solve the reconstruction problem but achieved limited success due to the poor representation capability of these priors. Deep learning-based methods, on the other hand, achieved better results by directly learning the mappings between compressive images and HSIs. However, designing a powerful deep network for satisfactory results is challenging. To address this, the authors propose a novel method based on Maximum a Posterior (MAP) estimation framework using a learned Gaussian Scale Mixture (GSM) prior. Unlike existing GSM models that use hand-crafted scale priors, the authors propose to learn the scale prior through a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). Additionally, the authors propose estimating the local means of the GSM models using the DCNN. The parameters of the MAP estimation algorithm and the DCNN are jointly optimized through end-to-end training. Experimental results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.
