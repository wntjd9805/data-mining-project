This paper discusses the method of three-dimensional scanning using structured light illumination. This technique involves projecting and capturing striped patterns, and then using the observed distortion of the stripes to reconstruct the surface of the target object. However, a problem called multi-path occurs when a camera pixel detects features from multiple projector coordinates simultaneously. Bimodal multi-path is a common situation along step edges, where the camera pixel detects both the foreground and background surfaces. This paper examines a more general case called sparse or N-modal multi-path, where the camera pixel detects at least two reflective surfaces, leading to decoding errors. To address this issue, the proposed solution is to treat each camera pixel as an underdetermined linear system of equations and find the solution with the fewest paths using a Bayesian learning approach specific to the application. The algorithm is validated through simulations and real-world scenarios, showing better performance compared to existing techniques.
