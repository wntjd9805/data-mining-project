We examine the ability of recent learning-based point cloud registration methods to perform well in different conditions not represented in the training set. These methods often struggle in mismatched situations, such as unseen object categories, complex scenes, or unknown depth sensors. Traditional non-learning methods like Iterative Closest Point have better generalization ability in these cases. Hybrid learning methods that combine learning and deterministic steps have shown some improvement, but still have limitations. We revisit PointNetLK, a recent innovation, and demonstrate that incorporating an analytical Jacobian can significantly enhance generalization while maintaining the fidelity advantages of a learning framework. Our approach surpasses the current state-of-the-art in mismatched conditions and achieves competitive results with existing learning methods when applied to real-world test data similar to the training set.
