Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a challenging task in autopilot technology due to the complex interactions between pedestrians. Existing approaches that rely on dense undirected interactions suffer from modeling unnecessary interactions and neglecting trajectory motion tendencies, leading to significant deviations from reality. To address these issues, we propose a Sparse Graph Convolution Network (SGCN) for pedestrian trajectory prediction. The SGCN explicitly models sparse directed interactions using a sparse directed spatial graph to capture adaptive pedestrian interactions. Additionally, we use a sparse directed temporal graph to model motion tendencies, allowing for prediction based on observed direction. By combining these two sparse graphs, we estimate the parameters of a bi-Gaussian distribution for trajectory prediction. We evaluate our method on ETH and UCY datasets and find that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 9% in Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 13% in Final Displacement Error (FDE). Importantly, visualizations demonstrate that our method effectively captures adaptive interactions between pedestrians and their motion tendencies.
