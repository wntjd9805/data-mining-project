The abstract describes a domain adaptation setting called Open Compound Domain Adaptation (OCDA), which involves modeling the target domain as a compound of multiple unknown homogeneous domains. This approach improves generalization to unseen domains. The authors propose a meta-learning based approach called MOCDA for semantic segmentation in OCDA. The approach involves clustering the target domain into sub-target domains based on image styles, and treating them independently using batch normalization parameters. A meta-learner is used to fuse the predictions from different sub-target domains, conditioned on the style code. The model is also updated online using the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) algorithm to further enhance generalization. The approach is validated through extensive experiments on a synthetic-to-real knowledge transfer benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both compound and open domains.
