Single image dehazing is a difficult problem due to the loss of information. Existing deep learning methods for dehazing only use clear images as positive samples, ignoring negative information. Additionally, these methods often focus on increasing the depth and width of the network, which requires significant computation and memory. To address these issues, we propose a novel contrastive regularization (CR) approach that utilizes both hazy and clear images as negative and positive samples, respectively. CR ensures that the restored image is closer to the clear image and farther away from the hazy image in the representation space. Furthermore, we develop a compact dehazing network based on an autoencoder-like (AE) framework to balance performance and memory storage. This network includes an adaptive mixup operation and a dynamic feature enhancement module, which preserve information flow and improve the network's transformation capability. We refer to our dehazing network as AECR-Net. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that AECR-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
