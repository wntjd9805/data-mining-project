Blind deblurring has been a topic of interest in recent years, but current methods struggle with processing saturated blurry images. This is because the pixels around saturated regions do not conform to the commonly used linear blur model. Previous approaches have suggested excluding these pixels during deblurring, but this can lead to the removal of informative edges and insufficient information for kernel estimation when large saturated regions are present. To overcome this issue, we propose a new blur model that can handle both saturated and unsaturated pixels, allowing all informative pixels to be considered in the deblurring process. We develop an effective maximum a posterior (MAP)-based optimization framework based on our model. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluations on benchmark datasets and challenging real-world examples, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods.
