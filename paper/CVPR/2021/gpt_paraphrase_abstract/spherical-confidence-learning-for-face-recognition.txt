Recent research has shown that facial images are better represented using spherical spaces, as demonstrated by the success of facial recognition methods that utilize spherical representations. However, these approaches suffer from the feature ambiguity dilemma, where ambiguous or noisy images are mapped to poorly learned areas in the representation space, resulting in inaccuracies. The Probabilistic Face Embeddings (PFE) method was developed to address this dilemma, but it has two main failures when applied to spherical deterministic embeddings. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a new framework for learning face confidence in spherical space. This framework extends the von Mises-Fisher density to its r-radius counterpart and introduces a new optimization objective. The proposed probabilistic framework provides better interpretability, allowing for principled feature comparison and pooling. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework in comparison to prior probabilistic methods and spherical deterministic embeddings in various face recognition tasks.
