Learning-based approaches have been successful in low-light image denoising, but their performance relies on the realism of the physical model used to generate training data. Existing approaches mainly focus on everyday photography and may not be suitable for extremely low-light images of permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) on the lunar surface. In this study, we propose a denoising approach specifically designed for PSR images taken by the Narrow Angle Camera on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter satellite. Our approach improves upon existing methods by incorporating a physical noise model of the camera, real noise samples, and training image scene selection based on 3D ray tracing to generate realistic training data. Additionally, we consider the camera's environmental metadata, such as temperature and age, during image capture to enhance the denoising model's performance. Our quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing camera calibration routine and other baselines. The implications of our findings are significant for lunar science and exploration, as our approach can aid in the identification of surface water-ice and reduce uncertainty in rover and human traverse planning in PSRs.
