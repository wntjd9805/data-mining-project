In recent years, there has been rapid progress in the field of scene text detection, enabling text detectors to successfully locate text in challenging scenarios. However, these detectors still face difficulties when dealing with text instances that have extreme aspect ratios and varying scales. To address these challenges, we propose a new algorithm for scene text detection that introduces a set of strategies to greatly enhance the accuracy of text localization.   Our algorithm includes a Text Feature Alignment Module (TFAM) that dynamically adjusts the receptive fields of features based on initial raw detections. This allows for better adaptation to text instances with different aspect ratios and scales. Additionally, we have developed a Position-Aware Non-Maximum Suppression (PA-NMS) module that selectively focuses on reliable raw detections while excluding unreliable ones.   Furthermore, we introduce an Instance-wise IoU loss for balanced training, which effectively handles text instances of varying scales. Through an extensive ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed strategies.   By integrating these strategies with the leading scene text detector EAST, our resulting text detection system achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance on various standard benchmarks for text detection, all while maintaining a fast running speed.
