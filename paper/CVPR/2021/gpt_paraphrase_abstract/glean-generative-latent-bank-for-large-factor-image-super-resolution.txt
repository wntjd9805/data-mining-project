We propose a method called Generative LatEnt bANk (GLEAN) that utilizes pre-trained Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) like StyleGAN to enhance the quality of large-factor image super-resolution (SR). Unlike traditional SR approaches that focus on generating realistic textures through adversarial loss learning, GLEAN directly leverages the rich and diverse priors captured in a pre-trained GAN. This approach eliminates the need for expensive image-specific optimization during runtime, as GLEAN only requires a single forward pass to produce the upscaled image. GLEAN can be easily integrated into a simple encoder-bank-decoder architecture with multi-resolution skip connections. By switching the bank, GLEAN can handle images from various categories such as cats, buildings, human faces, and cars. Compared to existing methods, GLEAN significantly improves fidelity and texture faithfulness of the upscaled images, as demonstrated in Figure 1.
