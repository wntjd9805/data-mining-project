Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable accuracy in object detection tasks, but their training and scaling are expensive due to the need for supervision. To address this issue, weakly supervised and zero-shot learning techniques have been explored, but they have not been widely adopted or successful compared to supervised models. In this paper, we present a new formulation of the object detection problem called open-vocabulary object detection, which is more general, practical, and effective than weakly supervised and zero-shot approaches. Our proposed method involves training object detectors using both bounding box annotations for a limited set of object categories and image-caption pairs that cover a larger variety of objects at a significantly lower cost. We demonstrate that our method achieves higher accuracy in detecting and localizing objects that were not provided with bounding box annotations during training, outperforming zero-shot approaches. Furthermore, objects with bounding box annotations can be detected almost as accurately as supervised methods, surpassing weakly supervised baselines. As a result, we establish a new state of the art for scalable object detection.
