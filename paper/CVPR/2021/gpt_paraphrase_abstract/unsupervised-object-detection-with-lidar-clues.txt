Despite the lack of previous research addressing the problem of unsupervised object detection, this study aims to fill this gap. One major challenge is the ambiguity and unreliability of object boundaries derived solely from 2D image appearance. To overcome this, the researchers propose utilizing LiDAR clues to enhance unsupervised object detection. By leveraging the 3D structure of the scene, the issue of localization can be significantly alleviated. Additionally, they identify another issue that has been overlooked by the community - the need to accommodate the long-tailed and open-ended distribution of object categories. In this paper, the authors present the first practical method for unsupervised object detection with the assistance of LiDAR clues. Their approach involves generating candidate object segments based on 3D point clouds and conducting an iterative segment labeling process. This process assigns segment labels and trains a segment labeling network using features from both 2D images and 3D point clouds. The labeling process is carefully designed to address the issue of long-tailed and open-ended distribution. The final segment labels serve as pseudo annotations for training an object detection network. Extensive experiments on the Waymo Open dataset demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised object detection method achieves reasonable accuracy compared to strong supervision within the LiDAR visible range.
