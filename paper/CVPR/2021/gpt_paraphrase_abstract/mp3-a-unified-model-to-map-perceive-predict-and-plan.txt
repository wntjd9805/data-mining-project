High-definition maps (HD maps) are crucial for self-driving systems as they provide essential semantic and geometric information. However, the cost and strict localization requirements of HD maps hinder their scalability. To address this issue, we propose MP3, an end-to-end approach for mapless driving. MP3 utilizes raw sensor data and high-level commands to predict an online map and the current and future state of dynamic agents. These predictions are then used by a novel neural motion planner to make informed decisions considering uncertainty. In extensive simulations and real-world tests, our approach outperforms baselines and even expert drivers in terms of safety, comfort, and command following. By eliminating the reliance on HD maps, MP3 offers a scalable solution for self-driving systems and enhances their fault tolerance.
