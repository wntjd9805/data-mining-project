HDR cameras capture multiple measurements with different exposures, gains, and photodiodes to reconstruct high dynamic range (HDR) images. However, recovering HDR images from dynamic scenes is challenging due to motion and different noise characteristics in stitched captures. Image signal processors (ISPs) are used to resolve artifacts in real time at high resolutions, but traditionally, ISP settings are chosen by domain experts and frozen camera designs are used for training data acquisition. In this study, we propose an end-to-end optimization approach that jointly learns sensor, ISP, and detector network weights using RAW image data augmented with emulated SNR transition region artifacts. We evaluate the method for human vision and image understanding, specifically in automotive object detection. The proposed method outperforms expert-tuned HDR imaging and vision pipelines as well as state-of-the-art optimization methods, improving mean average precision (mAP) and mean average recall (mAR) by 33% and 22% respectively in HDR laboratory rig and field experiments.
