Deep learning has become popular for multiple object tracking (MOT) due to its ability to improve tracking performance. However, finding a solution to the data-association problem in an end-to-end manner is challenging. This paper presents a novel proposal-based learnable framework that models MOT as a proposal generation, scoring, and trajectory inference process using an affinity graph. The framework is similar to the two-stage object detector Faster RCNN and solves the MOT problem using a data-driven approach. To generate proposals, an iterative graph clustering method is proposed, which reduces computational costs while maintaining proposal quality. For proposal scoring, a trainable graph-convolutional-network (GCN) is used to learn structural patterns and rank proposals based on quality scores. Trajectory inference employs a deoverlapping strategy to generate tracking output that adheres to the constraint of not assigning multiple detections to a single track. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves performance in both MOTA and IDF1 compared to previous state-of-the-art methods on two public benchmarks.
