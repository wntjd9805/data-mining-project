We present Mask Guided (MG) Matting, a robust matting framework that utilizes a coarse mask as guidance. Our approach, MG Matting, employs a network design called PRN to refine uncertain regions through the decoding process, providing self-guidance. To enhance its robustness to external guidance, we introduce guidance mask perturbation operations during training. Remarkably, PRN can generalize to different types of guidance masks like trimap and low-quality alpha matte, making it suitable for various applications. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective solution to the foreground color prediction problem in matting, addressing dataset limitations. Through evaluation on both real and synthetic benchmarks, we demonstrate that MG Matting achieves state-of-the-art performance using different types of guidance inputs.
