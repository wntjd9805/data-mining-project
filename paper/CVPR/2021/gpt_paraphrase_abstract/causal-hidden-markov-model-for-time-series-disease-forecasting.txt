We present a novel approach using a causal hidden Markov model to accurately predict irreversible diseases at an early stage, which is crucial for effective medical treatment. Our model incorporates hidden variables that generate medical data over time. To prevent learning irrelevant associations and biases, we explicitly separate these hidden variables into three categories: a) disease-related variables, b) non-clinical disease-related variables, and c) others that may contain spurious correlations with the disease. By leveraging personal attributes and disease labels as additional information, we demonstrate that the disease-related hidden variables can be disentangled from the others, ensuring generalization to medical data from different distributions. Based on this finding, we propose a sequential variational auto-encoder with a revised objective function. We apply our model to predict peripapillary atrophy at an early stage and achieve promising results on unseen test data. Additionally, our ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each component in our method, and our visualization accurately identifies lesion regions.
