Fine-grained object recognition aims to develop effective features for distinguishing visually similar objects by focusing on subtle differences. While most existing methods use attention mechanisms to highlight discriminative regions, they often struggle with complex backgrounds and fail to explore the interrelationship between different semantic features. In this study, we propose a novel approach that utilizes graph-based relation discovery to establish a contextual understanding of high-order relationships. Our method involves creating a high-dimensional feature bank and regularizing it using semantic and positional constraints, thereby enriching the feature representations. To address the issue of high dimensionality, we introduce a graph-based semantic grouping strategy that embeds the high-order tensor bank into a low-dimensional space. Additionally, we propose a group-wise learning strategy to regularize the features based on the cluster embedding center. By combining these three modules, our approach effectively captures the intricate contextual details of fine-grained objects. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four widely-used benchmarks for fine-grained object recognition.
