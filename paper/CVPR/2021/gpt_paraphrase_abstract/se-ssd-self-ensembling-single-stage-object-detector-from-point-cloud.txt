We introduce SE-SSD, a Self-Ensembling Single-Stage object Detector, that achieves accurate and efficient 3D object detection in outdoor point clouds. Our approach focuses on utilizing both soft and hard targets by optimizing the model without adding extra computation during inference. SE-SSD consists of a teacher and student detector, where we employ an effective IoU-based matching strategy to filter soft targets from the teacher and create a consistency loss to align the student's predictions with them. Additionally, we propose a novel augmentation scheme to generate shape-aware augmented samples for training the student, encouraging it to infer complete object shapes and maximize the distilled knowledge from the teacher. To better exploit hard targets, we design an ODIoU loss to supervise the student, imposing constraints on the predicted box centers and orientations. SE-SSD achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods and achieves top precision for car detection on the KITTI benchmark, ranking first and second on the BEV and 3D leaderboards, respectively, while maintaining an ultra-high inference speed.
