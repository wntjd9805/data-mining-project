The detection of 3D objects in LiDAR data is crucial for autonomous driving systems. To achieve safe and high-speed driving, new LiDARs with larger detection ranges have been developed. However, these larger ranges require more efficient and accurate detection models. In response to this, we propose the Range Sparse Net (RSN), a simple, efficient, and accurate 3D object detector designed specifically for real-time detection in extended ranges.RSN utilizes range images to predict foreground points and applies sparse convolutions on these selected points to detect objects. By using lightweight 2D convolutions on dense range images, RSN significantly reduces the number of selected foreground points, enabling efficient operation of sparse convolutions. Additionally, combining features from the range image further improves detection accuracy.RSN has demonstrated impressive performance, running at over 60 frames per second on a 150m Ã— 150m detection region using the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). It outperforms previously published detectors in terms of accuracy while being several times faster. As of November 2020, RSN holds the top ranking in the WOD leaderboard for LiDAR-based pedestrian and vehicle detection based on the APH/LEVEL 1 metrics.
