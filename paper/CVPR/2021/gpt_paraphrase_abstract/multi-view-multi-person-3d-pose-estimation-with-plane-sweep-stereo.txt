Our approach for multi-view multi-person 3D pose estimation tackles the challenge of establishing cross-view correspondences in multi-person scenes, which is crucial for accurate pose estimation. We propose a novel method based on plane sweep stereo that performs depth regression for each joint of each 2D pose in a target camera view. Cross-view consistency constraints are enforced using multiple reference camera views through the plane sweep algorithm, ensuring accurate depth regression. We adopt a coarse-to-fine scheme to first estimate the person-level depth and then refine it with per-person joint-level relative depth estimation. Finally, 3D poses are obtained through back-projection using the estimated depths. Our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets and is highly efficient. The code for our approach is available on the project website.
