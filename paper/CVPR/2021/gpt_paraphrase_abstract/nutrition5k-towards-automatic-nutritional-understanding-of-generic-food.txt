Understanding the nutritional content of food using visual data is a difficult problem in computer vision that has the potential to greatly impact public health. However, current studies in this field are limited by datasets that lack diversity and necessary labels for training models to understand nutrition. To address this, we have created Nutrition5k, a unique dataset consisting of 5,000 diverse real-world food dishes accompanied by video streams, depth images, component weights, and highly accurate nutritional content annotations. Through this dataset, we have trained a computer vision algorithm that can accurately predict the caloric and macronutrient values of complex dishes, outperforming professional nutritionists. Additionally, we have established a baseline for utilizing depth sensor data to enhance nutrition predictions. By releasing Nutrition5k, we aim to encourage innovation in the field of nutritional understanding. The dataset can be accessed at https://github.com/google-research-datasets/Nutrition5k.
