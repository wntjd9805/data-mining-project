Human drivers have the ability to observe others and learn driving maneuvers, even if they have never performed them before. However, existing techniques for learning to drive assume access to a fully instrumented ego-vehicle, which is not possible when learning by watching others. This means that a large portion of valuable training data from surrounding vehicles is discarded. To address this, we propose the Learning by Watching (LbW) framework, which allows learning a driving policy without full knowledge of the state or expert actions. LbW uses the observations of other vehicles in a scene to increase its data by transforming the ego-vehicle's observations to their points of view and inferring their expert actions. Our LbW agent learns more robust driving policies while being data-efficient and able to adapt quickly to rare and novel scenarios. It achieves a high success rate on the original CARLA benchmark with significantly less driving data compared to existing methods. For example, it achieves an average success rate of 92% with only 30 minutes of total driving data and 82% with only 10 minutes.
