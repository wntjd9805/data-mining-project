Semi-supervised object detection aims to develop a detection model using limited labeled data, thereby reducing the need for labeling large amounts of unlabeled data. Previous approaches based on self-training or consistency regularization fail to account for discrepancies in detection results and variations among different detection models. This paper introduces an interactive self-training method using mean teachers for semi-supervised object detection. The proposed approach addresses the instability in detection results across iterations by fusing results using nonmaximum suppression. It also employs multiple detection heads to predict pseudo labels and provide complementary information. To prevent collapse between detection heads, a mean teacher model is utilized for predicting pseudo labels instead of the original detection model. This enables training the object detection model on both labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
