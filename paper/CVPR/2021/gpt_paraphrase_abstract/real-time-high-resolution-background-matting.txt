We present a novel method for real-time background replacement that works at a high resolution and frame rate. By employing background matting, we capture an additional frame of the background to recover the alpha matte and foreground layer. The key challenge is to compute a high-quality alpha matte that preserves fine hair details while processing high-resolution images in real-time. To address this, we utilize two neural networks: a base network that generates a low-resolution result, and a second network that operates at high-resolution on selective patches to refine the output. Furthermore, we introduce two large-scale datasets for video and image matting. Our approach outperforms previous methods in terms of both quality and speed, providing a significant improvement in background matting for real-time applications.
