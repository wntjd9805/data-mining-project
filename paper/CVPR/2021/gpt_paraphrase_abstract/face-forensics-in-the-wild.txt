Face forgery detection techniques have been successful on existing public benchmarks. However, their performance is unsatisfactory when applied to multi-person videos, where only a small subset of people are manipulated. To address this, we have created a new dataset called FFIW10K, consisting of 10,000 high-quality forgery videos with an average of three human faces per frame. The manipulation process is automated, reducing human involvement and making the dataset scalable. Additionally, we have developed a novel algorithm that tackles the challenge of detecting multi-person face forgery. This algorithm uses video-level labels and employs multiple instance learning to automatically identify tampered faces. Our algorithm performs better than existing approaches in forgery classification and localization on FFIW10K, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities on other benchmarks. We believe that our dataset and research will contribute to further exploration of this emerging field.
