This abstract discusses the challenges in visual object tracking, specifically in accurately estimating the bounding box for the target. Existing approaches use a multiple-stage strategy to improve estimation, but they still have limited precision and lack transferability. To address these issues, the authors propose a new refinement module called Alpha-Reﬁne (AR) that significantly improves the quality of bounding box estimation. By focusing on extracting and maintaining detailed spatial information, Alpha-Reﬁne incorporates pixel-wise correlation, corner prediction, and auxiliary mask heads as core components. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the performance of base trackers with minimal additional latency. The authors also introduce strengthened trackers, including ARSiamRPN, ARDiMP50, and ARDiMPsuper, which achieve a good trade-off between efficiency and precision, as well as competitive real-time performance. The code and pretrained models for the Alpha-Reﬁne method are available at the provided GitHub repository.
