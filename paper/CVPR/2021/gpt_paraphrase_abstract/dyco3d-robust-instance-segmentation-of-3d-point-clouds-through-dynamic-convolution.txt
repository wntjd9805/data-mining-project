Previous approaches to instance segmentation of point clouds have relied on a bottom-up strategy that involves inefficient operations and complex pipelines. These methods often require grouping over-segmented components, introducing additional steps for refinement, and designing complicated loss functions. However, these approaches are sensitive to hyper-parameter values due to the variation in instance scales. In this study, we propose a dynamic, proposal-free, data-driven approach that generates convolution kernels based on the nature of the instances. To ensure discriminative kernels, we gather homogeneous points with identical semantic categories and similar geometric centroids to explore a large context. We decode instances using simple convolutional layers. To capture long-range dependencies and high-level interactions among point samples, we introduce a small, lightweight transformer in addition to sparse convolution. Our proposed method achieves promising results on both ScanetNetV2 and S3DIS datasets and is robust to different hyper-parameter values. It also improves inference speed by more than 25% compared to the current state-of-the-art. The code for our method is available at https://git.io/DyCo3D.
