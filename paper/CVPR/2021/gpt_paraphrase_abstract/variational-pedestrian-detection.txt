Pedestrian detection in crowded environments is a difficult task due to the large number of overlapping individuals, which leads to ambiguity and challenges in assigning ground truth labels based on intersection over union (IoU) in traditional object detection methods. This study presents a novel approach to pedestrian detection by treating it as a variational inference problem. The proposed algorithm models dense proposals as latent variables and utilizes a customized Auto-Encoding Variational Bayes (AEVB) algorithm for efficient detection. By optimizing this algorithm, a classical detector can be transformed into a variational pedestrian detector. Experiments conducted on CrowdHuman and CityPersons datasets demonstrate that our algorithm effectively addresses the dense pedestrian detection problem for both single-stage and two-stage detectors. Notably, our method achieves significant performance improvements.
