The certainty of uncertainty is undeniable. In regression analysis, it is crucial to incorporate data uncertainty, particularly in unconstrained scenarios. Traditionally, uncertainty is addressed by modifying the output space of regression models to fit specific probabilistic distributions. However, in practical applications, classification-based regression and ranking-based solutions are more commonly used due to the limited performance of direct regression methods. Consequently, effectively modeling uncertainty in regression using present-day technologies remains an unresolved issue. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel approach called probabilistic ordinal embeddings. Instead of representing each data point as a single value in a latent space, we represent it as a multivariate Gaussian distribution. By leveraging the ordinal nature of regression, we introduce an ordinal distribution constraint. This enables our probabilistic ordinal embeddings to be integrated into popular regression approaches, enhancing their ability to estimate uncertainty. Through experimental evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/Li-Wanhua/POEs.
