Accurate 3D object detection from monocular images is a difficult task in autonomous driving. Through extensive experiments, we identify the "localization error" as the main factor hindering monocular 3D detection. We investigate the reasons behind these errors and propose three strategies. First, we address the misalignment between the 2D bounding box center and the projected center of the 3D object, which greatly affects localization accuracy. Second, we recognize that accurately localizing distant objects is almost impossible with current technologies, and such samples mislead the learned network. To improve overall performance, we suggest removing these samples from the training set. Lastly, we introduce a novel 3D IoU oriented loss for object size estimation, which is not affected by localization errors. Our proposed method achieves real-time detection and significantly outperforms previous approaches on the KITTI dataset. The code is available at: https://github.com/xinzhuma/monodle.
