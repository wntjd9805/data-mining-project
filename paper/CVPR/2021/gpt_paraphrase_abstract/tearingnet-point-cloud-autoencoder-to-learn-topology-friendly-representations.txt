Topology is an important factor in processing point cloud data, but it is difficult to capture the complex topologies using learning models. In this study, we propose an autoencoder called TearingNet to represent point clouds using a fixed-length descriptor. Unlike existing methods that deform predeÔ¨Åned primitives to match point clouds, TearingNet consists of a Tearing network module and a Folding network module that work together iteratively. The Tearing network module learns the point cloud topology by breaking the edges of a primitive graph and tearing it into patches or with holes to mimic the target point cloud's topology, resulting in accurate reconstructions. Our experiments demonstrate that TearingNet outperforms existing benchmarks in terms of reconstructing point clouds and generating topology-friendly representations.
