This study introduces AlignPS, an anchor-free framework for person search that aims to simultaneously localize and identify a query person from uncropped images. Person search involves both pedestrian detection and person re-identification (re-id). Existing methods, such as Faster-RCNN, utilize two-stage detectors, which achieve high accuracy but require significant computational resources. AlignPS addresses the challenges of misalignment in scale, region, and task for anchor-free detectors. The framework includes an aligned feature aggregation module that generates more discriminative and robust feature embeddings, improving the baseline anchor-free model's performance on the CUHK-SYSU dataset by over 20% in mean average precision (mAP). Additionally, AlignPS outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage methods while maintaining higher processing speed. The code for AlignPS is available at https://github.com/daodaofr/AlignPS.
