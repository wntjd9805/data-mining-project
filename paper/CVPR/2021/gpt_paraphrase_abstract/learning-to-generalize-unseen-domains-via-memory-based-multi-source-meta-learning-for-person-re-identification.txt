Recent advancements in person re-identification (ReID) have achieved impressive accuracy in both supervised and unsupervised learning settings. However, existing methods often require access to new domain data in order to train a new model, which can be problematic due to privacy concerns and limited data availability. This limits the applicability of these methods. In this paper, we address the problem of multi-source domain generalization in ReID. Our goal is to develop a model that can perform well on unseen domains using only a few labeled source domains. To tackle this challenge, we propose the Memory-based Multi-Source Meta-Learning (M3L) framework. This framework incorporates meta-learning to simulate the train-test process of domain generalization and learn more generalizable models. To overcome the instability of meta-optimization caused by the parametric classifier, we introduce a memory-based identification loss. This non-parametric loss function aligns with the principles of meta-learning and helps stabilize the optimization process. Additionally, we introduce a meta batch normalization layer (MetaBN) to diversify meta-test features, further enhancing the advantages of meta-learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our M3L framework effectively improves the model's generalization ability for unseen domains. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on four large-scale ReID datasets.
