The use of Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) and its variants has become widespread in computer vision applications. However, these methods either require manual adjustment of parameters or prior knowledge of the rank of a low-rank matrix. To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive rank estimate based RPCA (ARE-RPCA) approach. This method assigns weights to different singular values based on adaptive rank estimation. We improve the Gerschgorin disk theorem to accurately estimate the rank of the low-rank matrix by considering its characteristics. Additionally, we present an adaptive setting method to address the manual pre-definition of adjustment factors in the Gerschgorin disk theorem, making the approach more practical. We then update the weights of singular values in the nuclear norm based on the iteratively estimated rank, resulting in a low-rank matrix that closely matches the target. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of ARE-RPCA compared to state-of-the-art methods in various complex scenarios.
