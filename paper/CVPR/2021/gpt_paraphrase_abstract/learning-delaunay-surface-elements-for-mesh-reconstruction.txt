A method is presented for reconstructing triangle meshes from point clouds. Existing learning-based methods often struggle to create manifold meshes as they generate triangles individually. To address this, the properties of 2D Delaunay triangulations are utilized to construct a mesh from manifold surface elements. The method involves estimating local geodesic neighborhoods around each point and performing a 2D projection of these neighborhoods using a learned logarithmic map. By applying a Delaunay triangulation in this 2D domain, a manifold patch known as a Delaunay surface element is created. The local 2D projections of neighboring elements are synchronized to maximize the manifoldness of the reconstructed mesh. The results demonstrate superior manifoldness compared to current methods for reconstructing meshes with arbitrary topology.
