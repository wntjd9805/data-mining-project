Photorealistic synthesis techniques have advanced to the point where it is becoming difficult to distinguish between real and manipulated images. Therefore, there is a need for benchmarking and improving digital forgery analysis. However, existing face forgery datasets have limited diversity and only support basic analysis. To address this issue, the authors have created the ForgeryNet dataset, which is a large-scale face forgery dataset. It includes unified annotations for image- and video-level data for four tasks: image forgery classification, spatial forgery localization, video forgery classification, and temporal forgery localization. The dataset contains a significant amount of data (2.9 million images, 221,247 videos), various types of manipulations, and extensive annotations. The authors have conducted benchmarking and studies using existing face forensics methods and have made valuable observations. They hope that the ForgeryNet dataset will inspire further research and innovation in the field of face forgery classification, spatial and temporal forgery localization, and other related areas.
