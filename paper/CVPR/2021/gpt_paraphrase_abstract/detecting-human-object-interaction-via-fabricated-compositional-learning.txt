Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is a crucial task for understanding high-level scenes, involving inferring the relationships between humans and objects in images or videos. However, traditional HOI detection methods often struggle with the open long-tailed nature of object interactions, as humans have a remarkable ability to recognize rare or unseen HOI samples. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework called Fabricated Compositional Learning (FCL) for open long-tailed HOI detection. FCL utilizes an object fabricator to generate effective representations of objects and combines these objects with verbs to create new HOI samples. By leveraging the object fabricator, we can generate a large number of HOI samples for rare and unseen categories, thereby mitigating the challenges associated with open long-tailed HOI detection. Our extensive experiments on the widely-used HICO-DET dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in handling imbalanced HOI detection and significantly improving the state-of-the-art performance on rare and unseen HOI categories.
