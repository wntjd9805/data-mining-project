We propose a method for accurately estimating dense depth using a sparse set of points. Our approach involves optimizing the positions, depths, and weights of these points based on a loss function that minimizes the reprojection error from RGB supervision. To achieve this, we utilize differential splatting, which represents points as Gaussians with analytic transmittance. Additionally, we have developed an efficient optimization routine that can handle complex scene reconstruction by simultaneously optimizing over 50,000 points. We have validated our routine using ground truth data and have achieved high-quality reconstruction results. Moreover, we have applied our method to light field and wider baseline images through self-supervision, resulting in improved depth maps compared to those generated from inaccurate sparse points. Finally, we have compared our results with those obtained from image processing and deep learning techniques, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
