This paper introduces MagDR, a defense mechanism against deepfakes that utilizes a mask-guided detection and reconstruction pipeline. Previous studies have shown that adversarial perturbations can disrupt deepfakes, but we argue that the threat still persists. MagDR employs a detection module to assess the abnormality of deepfake outputs based on specific criteria. This module then guides a learnable reconstruction process. Adaptive masks are generated to capture changes in local facial regions. Experimental results demonstrate that MagDR successfully defends against various types of deepfake attacks, exhibiting robust performance against both black-box and white-box attacks. The effectiveness of the learned reconstruction pipeline is also confirmed when applied to different input data.
