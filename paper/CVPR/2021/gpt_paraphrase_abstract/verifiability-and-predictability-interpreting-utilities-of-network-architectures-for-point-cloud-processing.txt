This study analyzes deep neural networks (DNNs) used for processing 3D point clouds and investigates the usefulness of different intermediate-layer network architectures. The researchers propose several hypotheses regarding the impact of specific intermediate-layer network architectures on the representation capacity of DNNs. To test these hypotheses, they develop five metrics to evaluate different types of DNNs from various perspectives, including information discarding, information concentration, rotation robustness, adversarial robustness, and neighborhood inconsistency. Comparative studies are conducted using these metrics to validate the hypotheses. Additionally, the researchers employ the validated hypotheses to modify the intermediate-layer architectures of existing DNNs, resulting in improved performance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach. The code used in this study will be made available upon acceptance of the paper.
