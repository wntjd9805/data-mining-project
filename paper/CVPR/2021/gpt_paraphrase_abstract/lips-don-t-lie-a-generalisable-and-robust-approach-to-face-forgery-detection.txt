Current deep learning-based face forgery detectors perform well in controlled scenarios but are vulnerable to samples created using unseen manipulation methods. Some recent works improve generalization but rely on cues that are easily corrupted by common post-processing operations. In this paper, we propose LipForensics, a detection approach that can generalize to novel manipulations and withstand various distortions. LipForensics focuses on high-level semantic irregularities in mouth movements, which are common in generated videos. It first pretrains a spatio-temporal network for visual speech recognition (lipreading), learning internal representations related to natural mouth motion. Then, a temporal network is fine-tuned on fixed mouth embeddings of real and forged data to detect fake videos based on mouth movements without overfitting to manipulation-specific artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this simple approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of generalization to unseen manipulations and robustness to perturbations. Additionally, the experiments shed light on the factors responsible for its performance.
