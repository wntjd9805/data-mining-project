This paper introduces a semi-weakly supervised segmentation algorithm for pixel-wise segmentation tasks, particularly in challenging medical applications. The algorithm utilizes a new formulation of deep supervision and a student-teacher model, allowing for the integration of different supervision signals. It emphasizes the importance of multi-label deep supervision in lower layers for successful segmentation. The proposed training regime for segmentation can effectively reduce the need for expensive labels by 94.22%, while achieving a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) that is only 5% lower than the best fully supervised baseline. The algorithm is validated through extensive experiments on retinal fluid segmentation, and the impact of different annotation types on segmentation performance is thoroughly analyzed.
