This study addresses the issue of hidden features in neural networks failing to learn informative representations for 3D segmentation. The lack of supervision on intermediate layers can be overcome by using omni-scale supervision. The authors propose a method called gradual Receptive Field Component Reasoning (RFCR) for point cloud segmentation. Target Receptive Field Component Codes (RFCCs) are designed to record categories within receptive fields for hidden units in the encoder. These target RFCCs then supervise the decoder to gradually infer the RFCCs in a coarse-to-fine reasoning manner, leading to the generation of semantic labels.To improve the accuracy of RFCC prediction, the authors propose a Feature Densification technique that uses centrifugal potential to obtain more unambiguous features. This technique is equivalent to entropy regularization over features and helps activate more features, thereby enhancing the potential of the omni-supervision method.The proposed method is incorporated into four popular backbones and evaluated on three challenging benchmarks. It significantly improves the performance of the backbones on all three datasets. Specifically, the method achieves state-of-the-art results for the S3DIS and Semantic3D benchmarks and ranks first among all point-based methods on the ScanNet benchmark.The authors provide the code for their method on GitHub. Overall, the RFCR method effectively addresses the limitations of hidden features in neural networks for 3D segmentation and achieves impressive results on various benchmarks.
