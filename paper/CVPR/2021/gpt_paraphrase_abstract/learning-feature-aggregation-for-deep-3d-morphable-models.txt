This study focuses on deep 3D morphable models, which use deep learning on 3D mesh data with a hierarchical structure to capture information at different scales. The researchers propose an attention-based module to improve the aggregation of vertex features across hierarchical levels. Instead of mesh decimation, they use a compatibility function to generate mapping matrices based on trainable variables called keys and queries. These variables are optimized through end-to-end training and shared by all samples of the same object class. The proposed module can be used as a replacement for feature aggregation in existing architectures for both downsampling and upsampling. Experimental results demonstrate that the approach achieves state-of-the-art results on various 3D shape datasets compared to existing morphable models.
