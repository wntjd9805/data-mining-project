Face clustering is a promising technique for labeling unlabeled face images. Although recent supervised approaches have improved the accuracy of face clustering, their performance is still unsatisfactory. These approaches can be categorized as global-based or local-based methods. Global-based methods have limited training data, while local-based methods struggle to capture the entire graph structure and have slow inference times. Previous approaches have not effectively addressed both challenges simultaneously. To overcome the challenge of large-scale training and efficient inference, we propose the STructure-AwaRe Face Clustering (STAR-FC) method. Our method utilizes a structure-preserved sub-graph sampling strategy to leverage large-scale training data, increasing the training data scale significantly. During inference, STAR-FC conducts efficient full-graph clustering using two steps: graph parsing and graph refinement. In the second step, we introduce the concept of node intimacy to extract local structural information. STAR-FC achieves a pairwise F-score of 91.97 on partial MS1M within 310 seconds, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we are the first to train on a very large-scale graph with 20 million nodes and achieve superior inference results on 12 million testing data. Overall, STAR-FC is a simple and effective method that serves as a strong baseline for large-scale face clustering. The code for STAR-FC is available at https://sstzal.github.io/STAR-FC/.
