Current online multiple object tracking (MOT) methods primarily focus on two aspects to improve tracking performance. One is predicting the positions of objects in incoming frames based on tracking information from previous frames. The other is enhancing data association by generating more distinctive identity embeddings. While some approaches have combined these directions, they often treat them as separate tasks, resulting in minimal benefits. This paper introduces a novel unified model that integrates both position prediction and embedding association, leveraging synergy between the two. The model achieves this through temporal-aware target attention and distractor attention, as well as an identity-aware memory aggregation model. The attention modules help prioritize targets over distractors during prediction, enabling more reliable embeddings for association. In turn, these reliable embeddings enhance identity-awareness through memory aggregation, reinforcing the attention modules and reducing drifts. This synergy between position prediction and embedding association enhances robustness to occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed model compared to existing methods on MOTChallenge benchmarks.
