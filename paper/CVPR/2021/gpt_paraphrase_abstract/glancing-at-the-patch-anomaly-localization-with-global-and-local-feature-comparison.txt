Anomaly localization is a challenging task in image segmentation due to the wide range of anomaly types. Current methods mainly focus on training deep models using the entire image without considering the local distribution, which is crucial for accurate pixel-level anomaly detection. This study proposes an unsupervised patch-based approach that incorporates both global and local information. Specifically, a Local-Net and a Global-Net are utilized to extract features from individual patches and their surroundings, respectively. The Global-Net is trained to imitate the local feature, enabling the detection of abnormal patches when their features do not match the contextual information. Additionally, Inconsistency Anomaly Detection (IAD) and Distortion Anomaly Detection (DAD) heads are introduced to identify the discrepancies between global and local features. A scoring function derived from the multi-head design enhances the precision of anomaly localization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.
