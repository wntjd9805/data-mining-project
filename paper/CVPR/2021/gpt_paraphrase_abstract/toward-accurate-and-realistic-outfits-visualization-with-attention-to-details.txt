This study focuses on the development of virtual try-on methods for generating realistic images of fashion models wearing different combinations of garments. Previous attempts at virtual try-on often resulted in images filled with artifacts and lacking important visual details necessary for commercial applications. In response, the researchers propose a new approach called Outfit Visualization Net (OVNet) that aims to capture these important details, such as buttons, shading, textures, realistic hemlines, and interactions between garments. OVNet consists of a semantic layout generator and an image generation pipeline that utilizes multiple coordinated warps. The warper is trained to refine each successive warp, focusing on poorly generated regions from the previous warp, resulting in consistent improvements in detail. The researchers also introduce a method for matching outfits with the most suitable model, which significantly enhances the performance of both their method and other previous try-on methods. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, the researchers demonstrate that their method generates substantially higher-quality studio images compared to previous works for multi-garment outfits. The method has been deployed on fashion e-commerce websites and has received overwhelmingly positive feedback from users.
