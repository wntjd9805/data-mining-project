We present a novel approach to active learning using a sequential Graph Convolution Network (GCN). In our framework, each image in a pool of data is represented as a node in a graph, with edges encoding their similarities. By using a small number of randomly selected labeled images as seed examples, we train the graph to distinguish between labeled and unlabeled nodes by minimizing the binary cross-entropy loss. The GCN performs message-passing operations between nodes, which leads to similar representations for strongly associated nodes. Exploiting this characteristic, we select unlabeled examples that are sufficiently different from labeled ones using graph node embeddings and confidence scores. We employ sampling techniques like CoreSet and uncertainty-based methods to query these nodes. We update the labels of the newly queried nodes from unlabeled to labeled, retrain the learner to optimize the downstream task, and modify the objective of the graph. This process continues within a fixed budget. We evaluate our method on six different benchmarks, including real image classification, depth-based hand pose estimation, and synthetic RGB image classification datasets. Our approach outperforms competitive baselines such as VAAL, Learning Loss, and CoreSet, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple applications.
