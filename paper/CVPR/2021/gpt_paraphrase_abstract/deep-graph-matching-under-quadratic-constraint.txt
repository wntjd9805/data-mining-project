Deep learning methods have shown promising results in solving the graph matching problem by using deep features extracted from graph nodes. However, existing deep graph matching (DGM) methods have a limitation in that they do not consider the explicit constraint of graph structures, which can cause the model to get stuck in local minimum during training. To address this issue, this paper proposes a new approach that explicitly formulates pairwise graph structures as a quadratic constraint within the DGM framework. This quadratic constraint aims to minimize the discrepancy between the structures of the graphs, reducing ambiguities caused by relying solely on CNN features. Additionally, the paper presents a differentiable implementation of the quadratic constrained optimization, making it compatible with unconstrained deep learning optimizers. To provide more precise supervision, the paper introduces a false matching loss that addresses class imbalance, effectively penalizing false negatives and false positives without overfitting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive performance on real-world datasets. The code for this method is available at https://github.com/Zerg-Overmind/QC-DGM.
