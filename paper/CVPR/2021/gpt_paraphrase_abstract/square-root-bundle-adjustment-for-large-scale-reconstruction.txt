We present a novel approach to the bundle adjustment problem that utilizes QR decomposition and nullspace marginalization of landmark variables. Our method, named square root bundle adjustment, is mathematically equivalent to the commonly used Schur complement trick, but offers improved numerical stability and enables the solution of large-scale problems using single-precision floating-point numbers. Through experiments on real-world datasets, specifically the BAL datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed solver achieves similarly accurate solutions as Schur complement solvers using double precision, despite operating in single precision. Moreover, our solver exhibits significantly faster runtime, although it may require more memory for dense problems. By relying on basic linear algebra operations, our formulation paves the way for efficient implementations of bundle adjustment on hardware platforms optimized for single-precision linear algebra processing.
