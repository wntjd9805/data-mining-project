The potential of using GANs for tasks beyond image synthesis has not been fully explored. This study investigates whether GANs can learn meaningful structural parts of objects while attempting to reproduce them. A simple and effective approach is proposed, using GANs for semantic part segmentation with minimal labeled data. The idea is to extract a pixel-wise representation from an input image using a trained GAN and use it as feature vectors for a segmentation network. Experimental results show that this GAN-derived representation is highly discriminative and achieves comparable results to supervised baselines trained with more labeled data. This novel repurposing of GANs suggests a new class of unsupervised representation learning that can be applied to various tasks. Additional results can be found at https://RepurposeGANs.github.io/.
