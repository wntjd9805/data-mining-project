This paper introduces a new approach called G2R-ShadowNet for shadow removal in computer vision. Most existing methods require shadow-free images for training, but this approach does not have that requirement. Instead, it uses a set of shadow images and their corresponding shadow masks for training. The G2R-ShadowNet consists of three sub-networks that generate shadows, remove shadows, and refine the results. These sub-networks are trained together in an end-to-end fashion. The shadow generation sub-network transforms non-shadow regions to appear as shadow regions, creating paired data for training the shadow removal sub-network. Experimental results on the ISTD dataset and the VideoShadow Removal dataset demonstrate that the proposed G2R-ShadowNet performs competitively compared to existing methods and outperforms a patch-based shadow removal method introduced by Le and Samaras in ECCV 2020.
