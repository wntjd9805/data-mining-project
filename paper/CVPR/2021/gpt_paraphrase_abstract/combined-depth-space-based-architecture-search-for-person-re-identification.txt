Most studies on person re-identification (ReID) utilize large backbone networks like ResNet, which are designed for image classification rather than ReID, for extracting features. However, these backbones may not be computationally efficient or the most suitable architectures for ReID. This research aims to develop a lightweight and appropriate network for ReID. A novel search space called Combined Depth Space (CDS) is proposed, and through this space, an efficient network architecture named CDNet is obtained using a differentiable architecture search algorithm. CDNet focuses on combined pattern information commonly found in pedestrian images by utilizing the combined basic building blocks in CDS. To fully utilize the search space and avoid getting trapped in local optimal results, a low-cost search strategy called the Top-k Sample Search strategy is introduced. Additionally, an effective Fine-grained Balance Neck (FBLNeck) is presented to balance the effects of triplet loss and softmax loss during the training process. FBLNeck can be removed during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CDNet, with approximately 1.8 million parameters, achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art lightweight networks.
