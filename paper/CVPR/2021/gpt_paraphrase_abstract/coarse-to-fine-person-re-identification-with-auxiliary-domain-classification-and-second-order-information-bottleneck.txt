Person re-identification (Re-ID) is an important task in computer vision that involves retrieving a specific person from different camera captures. This task is crucial for security surveillance and analyzing pedestrian behavior. However, due to various factors such as occlusions, illuminations, viewpoints, and poses, there is a significant intra-class variation of a person across cameras, making Re-ID challenging.To address the issues related to intra-class variation, this paper proposes a coarse-to-fine Re-ID framework that incorporates auxiliary-domain classification (ADC) and second-order information bottleneck (2O-IB). The ADC is introduced as an auxiliary task to extract coarse-grained essential features that can effectively distinguish a person from the background. This leads to the generation of both coarse and fine-grained feature representations for Re-ID.Furthermore, to handle the redundancy, irrelevance, and noise in the Re-ID features caused by intra-class variations, the network integrates 2O-IB. This integration helps compress and optimize the features without adding additional computation overhead during inference.Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. It significantly reduces the neural network output variance of intra-class person images and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance.In summary, this paper proposes a novel approach to address the challenges of person re-identification by utilizing a coarse-to-fine framework with ADC and 2O-IB. The method effectively reduces intra-class variation and achieves superior performance compared to existing methods.
