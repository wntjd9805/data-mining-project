Siamese network trackers are commonly used for visual tracking tasks, but they have limitations in capturing both foreground and background information accurately. Additionally, the global matching approach used in these trackers does not consider the target structure and part-level information. To address these issues, we propose a target-aware Siamese graph attention network for general object tracking. Our method establishes part-to-part correspondence between the target and search regions using a bipartite graph and applies graph attention to propagate target information. Instead of using fixed region cropping, we introduce a target-aware area selection mechanism to accommodate size and aspect ratio variations of different objects. Experimental results on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed SiamGAT outperforms state-of-the-art trackers and achieves leading performance. The code for our method is available at: https://git.io/SiamGAT.
