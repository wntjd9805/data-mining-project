In Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (Semi-VOS), current methods generate segmentation masks for each frame by propagating information from previous frames. While this approach produces high-quality segmentations in challenging scenarios, such as appearance changes and occlusion, it also involves unnecessary computations for stationary or slow-moving objects that exhibit minimal changes across frames. To address this issue, we propose a novel dynamic network that leverages temporal information to identify frames with minimal change and skip the computationally expensive mask generation step. Our network estimates the change across frames and decides whether to compute a full network or reuse the features from the previous frame based on the expected similarity. Experimental results on challenging Semi-VOS datasets (DAVIS 16, DAVIS 17, and YouTube-VOS) demonstrate that our approach significantly improves inference speed without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, our method is applicable to multiple Semi-VOS techniques, highlighting its generality. The code for our approach is available at the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/HYOJINPARK/ReuseVOS.
