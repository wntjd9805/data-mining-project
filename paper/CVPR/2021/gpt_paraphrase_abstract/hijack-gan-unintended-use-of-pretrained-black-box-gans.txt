Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have significantly improved in performance, with generated images becoming increasingly realistic and difficult to differentiate from natural images. However, these advancements come with significant data and computational requirements. This study demonstrates that the latest state-of-the-art GAN models, released by researchers and industry, can be utilized for various applications beyond just generating unconditional images.To achieve this, an iterative scheme is employed, allowing control over the image generation process despite the complex and nonlinear latent spaces of these advanced GAN models. This breakthrough enables the reuse of pre-trained GANs that are typically challenging to train, even with limited black-box access. It highlights the potential of leveraging high-level control over state-of-the-art GANs, even without complete understanding of their internal workings.However, this study also raises concerns about the unintended use cases of publicly released GAN models. The authors emphasize the need for considering the potential implications and consequences before fully releasing these models to the public.
