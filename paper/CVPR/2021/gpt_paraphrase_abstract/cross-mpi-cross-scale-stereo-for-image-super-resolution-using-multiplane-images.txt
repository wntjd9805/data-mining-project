There are various combinations of cameras used in computational photography, with reference-based super-resolution (RefSR) being an important aspect of multiscale imaging systems. However, current RefSR methods are unable to achieve high-quality super-resolution when there is a large resolution gap, such as 8Ã— upscaling, due to insufficient consideration of the scene structure. This paper proposes a solution to the RefSR problem in actual multiscale camera systems by drawing inspiration from multiplane image (MPI) representation. The proposed approach, called Cross-MPI, is an end-to-end RefSR network that consists of a novel plane-aware attention-based MPI mechanism, a multiscale guided upsampling module, and a super-resolution synthesis and fusion module. Instead of directly and exhaustively matching the cross-scale stereo, the proposed plane-aware attention mechanism effectively utilizes the concealed scene structure for efficient attention-based correspondence searching. Combined with a gentle coarse-to-fine guided upsampling strategy, Cross-MPI achieves robust and accurate detail transmission. Experimental results on digitally synthesized and optical zoom cross-scale data demonstrate that the Cross-MPI framework outperforms existing RefSR methods and is suitable for actual multiscale camera systems, even with significant differences in scale.
