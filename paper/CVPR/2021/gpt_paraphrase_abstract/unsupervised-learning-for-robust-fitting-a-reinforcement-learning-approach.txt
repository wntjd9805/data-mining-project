Robust model fitting is a fundamental algorithm used in numerous computer vision applications. However, efficiently solving this problem for datasets contaminated with outliers remains a challenge due to its computational complexity. Recent research has focused on learning-based algorithms, but most of these approaches require a large amount of labeled training data. In this study, we propose a novel unsupervised learning framework that directly solves robust model fitting. Unlike other methods, our approach is independent of the input features used and can be easily applied to a wide range of LP-type problems with quasi-convex residuals. Our empirical results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing unsupervised learning approaches and achieves competitive performance compared to traditional methods in various important computer vision tasks.
