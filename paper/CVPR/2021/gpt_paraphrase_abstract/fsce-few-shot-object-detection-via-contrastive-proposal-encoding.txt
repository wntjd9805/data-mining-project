Few-shot object detection (FSOD) is a growing interest in recognizing objects with limited training examples. Recent studies have shown that effective feature embedding is crucial for achieving good few-shot learning performance. We propose a method called Few-Shot object detection via Contrastive proposals Encoding (FSCE) that leverages the concept of supervised contrastive learning to improve the representation of objects in FSOD. We draw an analogy between object proposals with different Intersection-of-Union (IoU) scores and intra-image augmentation used in contrastive visual representation learning. By incorporating a contrastive-aware object proposal encoding, we enhance the classification of detected objects. Our approach addresses the issue of degraded average precision (AP) for rare objects, which is mainly caused by misclassifying novel instances as similar classes. We mitigate this problem by promoting instance-level intra-class compactness and inter-class variance through our contrastive proposal encoding loss (CPE loss). Experimental results show that our design outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on both standard benchmark PASCAL VOC and challenging COCO benchmark, with improvements of up to +8.8% and +2.7% respectively.
