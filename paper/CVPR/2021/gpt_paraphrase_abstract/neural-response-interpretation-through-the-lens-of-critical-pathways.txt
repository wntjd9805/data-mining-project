This study examines whether important information in a neural network is encoded within specific sparse pathways. The authors discuss the problem of identifying these critical pathways and propose a method for interpreting the network's response to input by leveraging them. Previous research has suggested using pruning to identify critical pathways, but the authors demonstrate that sparse pathways derived from pruning may not encode critical input information. To address this, they propose pathway selection based on the contribution of neurons to the response. The authors explain how critical pathways can reveal important input features and prove that pathways selected via neuron contribution are locally linear. They introduce a feature attribution method called "pathway gradient" based on this property. The interpretation method is validated using mainstream evaluation experiments, which confirm that the selected pathways using neuron contributions correspond to critical input features. The code for this study is publicly available.
