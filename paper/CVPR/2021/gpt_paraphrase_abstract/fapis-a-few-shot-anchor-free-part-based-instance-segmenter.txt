This paper presents a novel approach called Few-Shot Anchor-Free Part-Based Instance Segmentation (FAPIS) for handling few-shot instance segmentation tasks where the training and test image sets have different object classes. The key innovation of FAPIS lies in explicitly modeling latent object parts that are shared across training object classes, which improves the few-shot learning performance on new classes during testing. The paper introduces a new anchor-free object detector that scores and regresses the locations of foreground bounding boxes, as well as estimates the relative importance of latent parts within each box. Additionally, a new network is proposed for delineating and weighting latent parts to achieve the final instance segmentation within each detected bounding box. Experimental results on the COCO-20i dataset demonstrate that FAPIS significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.
