We present Position Adaptive Convolution (PAConv), a new convolution operation for processing 3D point cloud data. PAConv constructs the convolution kernel by dynamically combining weight matrices stored in a Weight Bank. The coefficients of these matrices are learned from point positions using ScoreNet, allowing the kernel to be data-driven and adaptable to the irregular and unordered nature of point cloud data. This approach reduces the complexity of the learning process by combining weight matrices instead of predicting kernels directly from point positions. Unlike existing point convolution operators that require complex network architectures, PAConv can be easily integrated into classical MLP-based point cloud pipelines without changing network configurations. Despite its simplicity, our method achieves state-of-the-art results and significantly improves performance on classification and segmentation tasks while maintaining efficiency. We provide thorough analysis and visualizations to explain the workings of PAConv, and the code is available at https://github.com/CVMI-Lab/PAConv.
