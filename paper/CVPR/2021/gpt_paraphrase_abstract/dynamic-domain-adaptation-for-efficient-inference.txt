This study introduces a dynamic domain adaptation (DDA) framework that addresses the challenge of achieving efficient target inference in low-resource scenarios while maintaining cross-domain generalization. Unlike static models, DDA is a simple and versatile method that can integrate different domain confusion constraints into adaptive networks. It incorporates multiple intermediate classifiers to dynamically infer "easier" and "harder" target data. The authors also propose two strategies to enhance the adaptation performance of multiple prediction exits: 1) a confidence score learning strategy that utilizes prediction consistency to derive accurate target pseudo labels, and 2) a class-balanced self-training strategy that adapts multi-stage classifiers from source to target while preserving prediction diversity. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the consistent improvement in adaptation performance and acceleration of target inference under domain shift and limited resources scenarios.
