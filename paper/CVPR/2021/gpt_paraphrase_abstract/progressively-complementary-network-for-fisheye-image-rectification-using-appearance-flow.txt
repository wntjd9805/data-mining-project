Distortion rectification is a common requirement for fisheye images. One popular approach is the generation-based method, which does not require labeled data. However, this method has some drawbacks including blur and incomplete correction. The use of skip-connections in the generation-based method can introduce distortion and result in incomplete correction. Additionally, the decoder in this method is overburdened, leading to vague performance when simultaneously reconstructing the image's content and structure.To address these issues, this paper proposes a feature-level correction scheme for the distortion rectification network. A correction layer is embedded in the skip-connection, allowing for pre-correction of image features using appearance flows from different layers. This approach enables the decoder to reconstruct a plausible result with the remaining distortion-less information. Furthermore, a parallel complementary structure is introduced to reduce the burden on the decoder by separating content reconstruction and structure correction.The proposed method is evaluated through subjective and objective experiments on different datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of this approach.
