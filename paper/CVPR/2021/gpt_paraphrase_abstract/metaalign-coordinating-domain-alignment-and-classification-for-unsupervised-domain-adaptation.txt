To address the optimization inconsistency problem between domain alignment and classification tasks in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), many approaches align the source and target domains in the feature space. However, the optimization objectives of domain alignment and classification are not coordinated, leading to inconsistent descent directions for optimization. This reduces the effectiveness of domain alignment in improving UDA performance. In this study, we propose a meta-optimization based strategy called MetaAlign to alleviate this issue. MetaAlign treats domain alignment and classification objectives as meta-train and meta-test tasks in a meta-learning scheme. It encourages coordinated optimization of both tasks by maximizing the inner product of their gradients during training. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MetaAlign compared to various alignment-based baseline approaches in object classification and object detection tasks. MetaAlign achieves state-of-the-art performance.
