Our proposed Group-aware Label Transfer (GLT) algorithm addresses the limitations of traditional Unsupervised Domain Adaptive (UDA) person re-identification (ReID) methods. UDA-ReID aims to adapt a model trained on a labeled source-domain dataset to a target-domain dataset without additional annotations. Current UDA-ReID approaches combine clustering-based pseudo-label prediction with representation learning, but the offline interaction between these two steps can introduce noisy pseudo labels that hinder the model's performance.In our paper, we introduce the GLT algorithm, which enables online interaction and mutual promotion of pseudo-label prediction and representation learning. This algorithm simultaneously trains the data using pseudo labels and refines the pseudo labels as an online clustering algorithm. To achieve this, we treat the online label refinement problem as an optimal transport problem, where we aim to minimize the cost of assigning M samples to N pseudo labels.Furthermore, we propose a group-aware strategy to assign implicit attribute group IDs to samples. By combining the online label refining algorithm and the group-aware strategy, we can effectively correct noisy pseudo labels in an online manner and narrow down the search space for the target identity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of GLT, with Rank-1 accuracy of 82.0% for Market1501→DukeMTMC and 92.2% for DukeMTMC→Market1501. These results significantly bridge the gap between unsupervised and supervised performance in person re-identification.
