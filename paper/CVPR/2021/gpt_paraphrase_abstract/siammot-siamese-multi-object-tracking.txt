This paper focuses on improving online multi-object tracking (MOT) by introducing a region-based Siamese Multi-Object Tracking network called SiamMOT. SiamMOT incorporates a motion model to estimate the movement of instances between frames and associate detected instances. Two variants of Siamese tracker are presented to explore the impact of motion modeling on tracking capability, one implicitly modeling motion and the other explicitly modeling it. Extensive quantitative experiments are conducted on three different MOT datasets, namely MOT17, TAO-person, and Caltech Roadside Pedestrians. The results demonstrate the significance of motion modeling for MOT and the superior performance of SiamMOT compared to the state-of-the-art methods. SiamMOT also outperforms the winners of ACM MM'20 HiEve Grand Challenge on the HiEve dataset. Additionally, SiamMOT is efficient, achieving a frame rate of 17 FPS for 720P videos using a single modern GPU.
