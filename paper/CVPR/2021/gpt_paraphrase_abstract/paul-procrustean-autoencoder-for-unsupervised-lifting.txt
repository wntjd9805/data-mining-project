Recent advancements in Non-rigid Structure from Motion (NRSfM) have prompted inquiries into the potential contributions of deep learning. This paper proposes the utilization of a 3D deep auto-encoder framework as a distinct NRSfM prior. The framework's uniqueness stems from its ability to solely learn the weights of the 3D auto-encoder from 2D projected measurements and its Procrustean nature, which enables the simultaneous determination of the unknown rigid pose for each shape instance. Referred to as Procrustean Autoencoder for Unsupervised Lifting (PAUL), this architecture exhibits superior performance compared to recent innovations like Deep NRSfM and C3PDO.
