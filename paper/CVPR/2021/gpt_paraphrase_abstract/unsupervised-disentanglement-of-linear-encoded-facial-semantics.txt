We present a novel approach to separate facial features encoded in a linear manner from StyleGAN without relying on external supervision. Our method combines linear regression and sparse representation learning techniques to ensure that the disentangled latent representations are easily interpretable. To achieve this, we integrate a stabilized 3D deformable facial reconstruction method with StyleGAN, allowing us to break down single-view GAN generations into multiple facial semantics. From these decomposed generations, we extract latent representations that capture meaningful and interpretable facial semantics. Importantly, our method eliminates the need for labeled data to disentangle these facial features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that extrapolating along the disentangled representations can serve as a useful data augmentation technique, particularly for handling unbalanced datasets. Additionally, through an analysis of our learned localized facial representations, we confirm that the encoded semantic information aligns remarkably well with human intuition. Overall, our unsupervised design offers greater flexibility in representation learning for real-world applications.
