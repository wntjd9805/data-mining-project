Current model extraction attacks typically assume that the attacker has access to a surrogate dataset that closely resembles the proprietary data used to train the target model. However, this requirement limits the applicability of existing model extraction techniques to valuable models trained on rare or hard-to-acquire datasets. In contrast, we propose data-free model extraction methods that do not rely on a surrogate dataset. Our approach leverages techniques from data-free knowledge transfer to extract the victim model. During our study, we discover that the choice of loss function plays a crucial role in ensuring the accuracy of the extracted model as a replica of the victim model. Additionally, we tackle challenges arising from limited access to the victim model in a black-box setting. For instance, we approximate gradients by recovering the model's logits from its probability predictions. Our proposed data-free model extraction approach achieves high accuracy with a reasonable query complexity, achieving 0.99x and 0.92x the accuracy of the victim model on the SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets, respectively, using 2M and 20M queries.
