In this study, we aim to simplify video super-resolution (VSR) approaches by focusing on the essential components necessary for effective VSR. We identify four key functionalities: Propagation, Alignment, Aggregation, and Upsampling. By reusing existing components with minimal redesigns, we propose a streamlined pipeline called BasicVSR. Compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, BasicVSR achieves significant improvements in both speed and restoration quality. We provide a systematic analysis to explain the reasons behind these gains and discuss potential pitfalls. Additionally, we demonstrate the versatility of BasicVSR by introducing an information-refill mechanism and a coupled propagation scheme to enhance information aggregation. Our proposed BasicVSR, along with its extension IconVSR, can serve as strong benchmarks for future VSR approaches.
