This paper introduces HESIC, a deep network designed for stereo image compression (SIC). The network utilizes a deep regression model to estimate the homography matrix, which is used to spatially transform the left image. By encoding only the residual information between the left and right images, HESIC achieves efficient bit-rate savings. The network employs a two-branch auto-encoder architecture for the left and right images, respectively. To further reduce coding bit-rates, two conditional stereo entropy models, including a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) based model and a context-based model, are used. In the decoding process, a cross quality enhancement module enhances image quality based on the inverse H matrix. Experimental results demonstrate that HESIC outperforms existing SIC methods in terms of both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the InStereo2K and KITTI datasets.
