Recent studies have found that CNN-generated images suffer from a flaw in replicating high frequency Fourier spectrum decay attributes. This flaw has been successfully exploited to detect CNN-generated images with high accuracy. In this research, we aim to investigate the claims that CNN-generated images cannot achieve high frequency spectral decay consistency. We conduct experiments using various GAN models and show that this frequency discrepancy can be avoided by making a minor change to the last upsampling operation. We use images from these experiments to bypass a recently proposed forensics detector that relies on high frequency Fourier spectrum decay attributes. Our findings challenge the belief that high frequency Fourier spectrum decay discrepancies are inherent in existing CNN-based generative models and suggest a re-evaluation of using these attributes for CNN-generated image detection.
