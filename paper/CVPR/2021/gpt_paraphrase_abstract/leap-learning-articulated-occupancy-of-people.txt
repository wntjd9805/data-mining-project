Significant progress has been made in developing deep implicit representations for modeling rigid 3D objects. However, applying these methods to learn neural models of human shape is still in its early stages. The complexity of human bodies poses a major challenge in learning a representation that can effectively express body shape deformations for unseen subjects in highly-articulated poses. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new neural occupancy representation called LEAP (LEarning Articulated occupancy of People) for the human body. LEAP utilizes a set of bone transformations and a query point in space to map the point to a canonical space using learned linear blend skinning (LBS) functions. It then efficiently determines the occupancy value using an occupancy network that models accurate deformations specific to identity and pose in the canonical space. Experimental results demonstrate that our canonicalized occupancy estimation with the learned LBS functions significantly enhances the generalization capability of the learned occupancy representation across different human shapes and poses, surpassing existing solutions in all scenarios.
