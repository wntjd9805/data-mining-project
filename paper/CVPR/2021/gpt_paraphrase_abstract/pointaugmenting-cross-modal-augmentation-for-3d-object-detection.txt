Camera and LiDAR are two sensors used for 3D object detection in autonomous driving. The challenge is combining 2D camera images with 3D LiDAR points effectively. This paper introduces a new algorithm called PointAugmenting that enhances point clouds with CNN features from pretrained 2D detection models, improving object detection. Additionally, PointAugmenting utilizes a novel cross-modal data augmentation algorithm that inserts virtual objects into images and point clouds during network training. Experimental results on nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of PointAugmenting, surpassing the LiDAR-only baseline detector by 6.5% mAP and achieving state-of-the-art results on the nuScenes leaderboard.
