Few-shot instance segmentation methods have shown promise in situations where there is limited labeled training data for new classes. However, existing approaches have limitations in terms of the flexibility to add new classes and the memory requirements for training and testing. In this study, we introduce iMTFA, the first incremental approach to few-shot instance segmentation. We generate discriminative embeddings for object instances, which are then combined into class representatives. By storing embedding vectors instead of images, we effectively address the memory overhead issue. We match these class embeddings using cosine similarity at the region of interest (RoI) level, enabling the addition of new classes without the need for further training or access to previous training data. Through a series of experiments, we consistently outperform the current state-of-the-art in few-shot instance segmentation. Additionally, the reduced memory requirements allow us to evaluate the performance of few-shot instance segmentation on all classes in COCO jointly for the first time.
