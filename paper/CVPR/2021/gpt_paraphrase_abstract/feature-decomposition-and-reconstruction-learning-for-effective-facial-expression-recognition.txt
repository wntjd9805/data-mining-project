This paper introduces a new approach called Feature Decomposition and Reconstruction Learning (FDRL) for effective facial expression recognition. The authors consider expression information as a combination of shared information across different expressions and unique information specific to each expression. The proposed FDRL method consists of two key networks: a Feature Decomposition Network (FDN) and a Feature Reconstruction Network (FRN).   The FDN decomposes the basic features obtained from a backbone network into facial action-aware latent features to model expression similarities. The FRN captures intra-feature and inter-feature relationships within the latent features to represent expression-specific variations and reconstruct the expression feature. The FRN includes two modules: an intra-feature relation modeling module and an inter-feature relation modeling module.  The effectiveness of the FDRL method is evaluated on both in-the-lab databases (CK+, MMI, and Oulu-CASIA) and in-the-wild databases (RAF-DB and SFEW). The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed FDRL method consistently achieves higher recognition accuracy compared to several state-of-the-art methods. This highlights the advantage of feature decomposition and reconstruction in accurately classifying facial expressions.
