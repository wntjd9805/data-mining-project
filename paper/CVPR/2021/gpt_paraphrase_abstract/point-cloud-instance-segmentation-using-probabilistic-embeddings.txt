This paper introduces a novel framework for segmenting instances in point clouds. The framework consists of two steps: embedding and clustering. In the embedding step, the authors propose a new approach to represent each point as a tri-variate normal distribution. This probabilistic embedding space allows for more accurate representation of the point cloud. In the clustering step, a novel loss function is proposed, which improves both the semantic segmentation and clustering processes. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art, with a 3.1% increase in average per-category mAP on the PartNet dataset.
