This paper focuses on addressing the issue of semi-supervised semantic segmentation by utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data. A new method called cross pseudo supervision (CPS) is proposed, which involves applying consistency regularization to two segmentation networks that are perturbed with different initializations for the same input image. The pseudo one-hot label map generated by one perturbed network is used to supervise the other network using the cross-entropy loss, and vice versa. The CPS approach serves two purposes: promoting similarity between the predictions of the perturbed networks for the same input image, and augmenting the training data by incorporating unlabeled data with pseudo labels. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in semi-supervised segmentation on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets.
