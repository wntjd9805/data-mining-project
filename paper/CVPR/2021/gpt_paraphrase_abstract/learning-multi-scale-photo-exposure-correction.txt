The issue of incorrect exposures in camera-based imaging is a significant source of errors in photography. These errors can be categorized as either overexposure, where the image appears too bright and washed-out due to a long camera exposure, or underexposure, where the image appears dark due to a short exposure. Both types of exposure problems diminish the image's contrast and visual appeal. Previous research has primarily focused on addressing underexposed images or general image enhancement techniques. In contrast, our proposed method aims to correct both over- and underexposure errors in photographs. We approach the exposure correction problem by dividing it into two main sub-problems: color enhancement and detail enhancement. To address these sub-problems, we introduce a deep neural network model that can be trained end-to-end. A crucial aspect of our solution is a new dataset consisting of over 24,000 images covering the widest range of exposure values to date, each paired with a properly exposed image. Our method achieves comparable results to existing state-of-the-art techniques for underexposed images and significantly improves the quality of images suffering from overexposure errors.
