This paper presents a novel approach to view synthesis using an iterative deformation method. Traditional methods, such as autoencoders, often fail to preserve source content during view translation, leading to unnecessary changes. Although using skipped connections, like Unet, can alleviate this issue, it often results in view non-conformity. In contrast, the proposed architecture incorporates soft and hard deformation modules that warp encoder features to the target view at different resolutions. These warped features are then used by the decoder to enhance details in the target image. The current warping flow not only aligns features of the same resolution but also coarsely deforms high-resolution features. This deformation is further refined through the estimation and application of residual flow in the high resolution, creating a coarse-to-fine deformation process. To improve model constraint, a rough target view image is synthesized based on intermediate flows and their warped features. Extensive experimentation on different datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model. The paper can be found at https://github.com/MingyuY/Iterative-view-synthesis.
