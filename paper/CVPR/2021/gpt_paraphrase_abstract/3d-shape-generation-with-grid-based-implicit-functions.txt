Previous methods for generating 3D shapes using a GAN trained on the latent space of an autoencoder (AE) have two major drawbacks. Firstly, the GAN is limited to reproducing the dataset that the AE was trained on, making it impossible to use a trained AE for generating new data. Secondly, incorporating spatial supervision into the generation process is challenging because the AE only provides a global representation. To address these issues, we propose training the GAN on grids where each cell represents a part of a shape and is associated with a latent vector from an AE. This localized representation allows for greater expressiveness by combining the cell-based latent vectors in novel ways, and also enables spatial control over the generation process using bounding boxes. Our approach surpasses the current state of the art in terms of established evaluation measures for quantitatively assessing the generative capabilities of GANs. We highlight the limitations of these measures and suggest using a robust criterion from statistical analysis as an alternative.
