This paper introduces a new point cloud completion network called Cycle4Completion, which is capable of generating complete geometries from partial 3D objects without paired data. Existing completion methods focus solely on learning geometric correspondence from incomplete shapes to complete shapes, neglecting the reverse direction. As a result, these methods suffer from low completion accuracy due to limited understanding of 3D shapes. To address this issue, we propose two simultaneous cycle transformations between the latent spaces of complete and incomplete shapes. The first cycle transforms incomplete shapes to complete shapes and then projects them back to the incomplete domain, effectively learning the geometric characteristics of complete shapes while maintaining consistency with the incomplete input. Similarly, the inverse cycle transformation starts from complete shapes, goes to incomplete shapes, and then returns to the complete domain to learn the characteristics of incomplete shapes. Experimental results demonstrate that our model, with its learned bidirectional geometry correspondence, outperforms state-of-the-art unpaired completion methods. The code for our model is available at https://github.com/diviswen/Cycle4Completion.
