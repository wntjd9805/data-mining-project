This study addresses the challenge of detecting and understanding objects in complex biomedical data. Obtaining labeled datasets for supervised tasks in this domain is expensive, and there is a need for unbiased scientific discovery by identifying novel objects. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose using annotations from benchmark computer vision datasets to perform unsupervised instance segmentation on diverse biomedical datasets. The main obstacle is the significant domain shift between common and biomedical images. To address this, the authors introduce a Domain Adaptive Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (DARCNN) that leverages object definitions from COCO, a large labeled vision dataset, and applies it to multiple biomedical datasets. The DARCNN model includes a domain separation module, a self-supervised representation consistency loss, and an augmented pseudo-labelling stage to effectively adapt across large domain shifts. The authors demonstrate the performance of DARCNN on various biomedical datasets for unsupervised instance segmentation.
