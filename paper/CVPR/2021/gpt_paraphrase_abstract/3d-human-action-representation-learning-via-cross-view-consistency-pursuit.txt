We propose CrosSCLR, a framework for unsupervised 3D skeleton-based action representation. CrosSCLR combines single-view contrastive learning (Skeleton-CLR) with cross-view consistent knowledge mining (CVC-KM) modules, enabling collaborative learning. The CVC-KM module ensures cross-view consistency by exchanging high-confidence positive/negative samples and their distributions based on embedding similarity. Our experiments on NTU-60 and NTU-120 datasets demonstrate that CrosSCLR achieves impressive action recognition results and generates higher-quality action representations. The code for CrosSCLR is available at https://github.com/LinguoLi/CrosSCLR.
