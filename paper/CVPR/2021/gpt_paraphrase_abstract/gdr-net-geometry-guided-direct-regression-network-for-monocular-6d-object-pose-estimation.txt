The current leading methods for 6D pose estimation from a single RGB image in computer vision rely on a two-stage process: establishing 2D-3D correspondences and then applying the PnP/RANSAC algorithm. However, this pipeline is not trainable end-to-end, limiting its use for tasks requiring differentiable poses. Direct regression methods are currently inferior to geometry-based methods. In this study, we thoroughly investigate both direct and indirect methods and propose a Geometry-guided Direct Regression Network (GDR-Net) that learns the 6D pose in an end-to-end manner using dense correspondence-based geometric representations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on LM, LM-O, and YCB-V datasets. The code for our method is available at https://git.io/GDR-Net.
