This paper presents ChallenCap, a method for capturing complex 3D human motions using a single RGB camera. The current monocular setting often faces difficulties due to intricate motion patterns and self-occlusion. ChallenCap introduces a template-based approach within a learning-and-optimization framework, incorporating multi-modal references for assistance. The method includes a hybrid motion inference stage with a generation network that employs a temporal encoder-decoder to extract motion details from sparse-view references. It also utilizes a motion discriminator to extract challenging motion characteristics from marker-based references in a data-driven manner. Additionally, a robust motion optimization stage is implemented to enhance tracking accuracy. This stage combines the learned motion details from supervised multi-modal references with reliable motion hints from the input image reference. The effectiveness and robustness of ChallenCap are demonstrated through extensive experiments on a newly created dataset of challenging human motions.
