This paper presents a variational framework called VRC-Net for completing incomplete point clouds. Existing methods for point cloud completion often generate shape skeletons and lack fine local details. They also focus on deterministic partial-to-complete mapping and overlook structural relations in man-made objects. To address these challenges, VRC-Net has two key properties. Firstly, it employs a dual-path architecture for probabilistic modeling, using a point VAE to reconstruct complete point clouds and generating complete shapes for partial point clouds guided by the reconstructed distribution. Secondly, it incorporates relational enhancement through point self-attention and selective kernel modules, refining local shape details based on coarse completion. The paper also introduces a multi-view partial point cloud dataset (MVP dataset) with over 100,000 high-quality scans. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VRC-Net outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard point cloud completion benchmarks and exhibits strong generalizability and robustness with real-world point cloud scans.
