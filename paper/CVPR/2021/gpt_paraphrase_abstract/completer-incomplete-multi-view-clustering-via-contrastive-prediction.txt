This paper addresses two difficult problems in incomplete multi-view clustering analysis: learning a meaningful and consistent representation among different views without labeled data, and recovering missing views from available data. The paper proposes a new objective that combines representation learning and data recovery using information theory. Specifically, the proposed method maximizes the mutual information between different views through contrastive learning to learn an informative and consistent representation, and minimizes the conditional entropy of different views through dual prediction to recover missing views. This work is novel in providing a theoretical framework that integrates consistent representation learning and cross-view data recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms 10 competitive multi-view clustering methods on four challenging datasets.
