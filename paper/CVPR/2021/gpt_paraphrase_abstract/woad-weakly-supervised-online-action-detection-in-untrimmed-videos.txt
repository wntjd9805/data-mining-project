Online action detection in untrimmed videos is crucial for real-time applications. However, current methods rely on time-consuming annotations of action boundaries for training, limiting the scalability of detection systems. To address this, we propose WOAD, a weakly supervised framework that can be trained using only video-class labels. WOAD consists of two modules: the temporal proposal generator (TPG) and the online action recognizer (OAR). TPG, supervised by video-class labels, mines pseudo frame-level labels for OAR. OAR then learns to detect actions in an online manner with guidance from TPG. Our experiments on THUMOS'14, ActivityNet1.2, and ActivityNet1.3 demonstrate that our weakly supervised method outperforms baselines and achieves comparable performance to strongly supervised methods. Moreover, WOAD can also leverage strong supervision when available, achieving state-of-the-art results in online per-frame action recognition and action start detection.
