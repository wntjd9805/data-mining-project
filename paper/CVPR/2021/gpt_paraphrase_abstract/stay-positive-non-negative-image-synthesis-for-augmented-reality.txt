In applications like optical see-through and projector augmented reality, the challenge lies in generating images by adding light to existing images. However, most image generation methods are not suitable for this problem because they assume that any color can be assigned to each pixel. Even in simple cases like MNIST digits, existing methods fail because they cannot create darker pixels by adding light. However, we know that the human visual system can be tricked by optical illusions involving brightness and contrast. Based on this understanding, we propose a new optimization procedure that can produce high-quality images without noticeable artifacts. By brightening surrounding pixels, we can create the illusion of darker patches. Our approach can incorporate existing state-of-the-art methods and performs well in tasks such as image-to-image translation and style transfer.
