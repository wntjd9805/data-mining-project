We introduce PD-GAN, a probabilistic diverse GAN designed for image inpainting. By leveraging a vanilla GAN that generates images based on random noise, PD-GAN produces multiple inpainting results that exhibit diverse and visually realistic content. Our approach involves modulating the deep features of input random noise in a coarse-to-fine manner during image generation. This modulation incorporates an initially restored image and the hole regions at multiple scales. We argue that during the process of filling the holes, pixels near the hole boundary should exhibit more determinism, relying on context and the initially restored image to create a natural inpainting boundary. Conversely, pixels located in the center of the hole should have more degrees of freedom, depending on random noise to enhance diversity. To address this, we propose the use of spatially probabilistic diversity normalization (SPDNorm) within the modulation process to model the probability of generating a pixel based on contextual information. SPDNorm dynamically balances realism and diversity within the hole region, resulting in more diverse content towards the center of the hole and content that resembles neighboring image content towards the hole boundary. Additionally, we introduce a perceptual diversity loss to further enhance PD-GAN's ability to generate diverse content. Our experiments on benchmark datasets such as CelebA-HQ, Places2, and Paris Street View demonstrate that PD-GAN is effective in achieving diverse and visually realistic image restoration.
