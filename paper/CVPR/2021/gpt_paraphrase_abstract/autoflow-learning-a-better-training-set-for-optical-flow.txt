The generation of synthetic datasets for pre-training CNN models in optical flow is a time-consuming and challenging task. Adapting these datasets to new applications is also difficult. To address this issue, we propose AutoFlow, a straightforward and efficient method for generating training data for optical flow that enhances model performance on a specific dataset. AutoFlow utilizes a layered approach to create synthetic data, allowing control over the motion, shape, and appearance of each layer through learnable hyperparameters. Our experimental results demonstrate that AutoFlow achieves superior accuracy in pre-training both PWC-Net and RAFT models. The code and data for AutoFlow are accessible at autoflow-google.github.io.
