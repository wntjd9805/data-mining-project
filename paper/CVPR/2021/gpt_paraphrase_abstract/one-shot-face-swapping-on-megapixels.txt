This paper introduces a new method called MegaFS for high-quality face swapping, which has both positive and negative applications. MegaFS utilizes a Hierarchical Representation Face Encoder (HieRFE) to maintain more facial details in the face representation. It also incorporates a Face Transfer Module (FTM) to transfer identity from a source image to the target without explicit feature disentanglement. The swapped faces are synthesized using StyleGAN2 for its training stability and generative capability. Each component of MegaFS can be trained separately to meet the GPU memory requirement for megapixel face swapping. The paper highlights three novel contributions: complete face representation, stable training, and limited memory usage. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of MegaFS, and a megapixel level face swapping database is made available for research on DeepFake detection and face image editing.
