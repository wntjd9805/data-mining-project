We present IQDet, a dense object detector that utilizes an instance-wise sampling strategy. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on human prior sampling strategies, our method extracts regional features from each ground-truth object to estimate the instance-wise quality distribution. This distribution is robust to noise and adapts to the semantic pattern of each object. Using this distribution, we propose a quality sampling strategy that selects training samples probabilistically and focuses on high-quality samples. Our experiments on MS COCO dataset demonstrate that our method consistently improves the baseline performance by approximately 2.4 average precision (AP) without any additional enhancements. Furthermore, our best model achieves an AP of 51.6, surpassing all existing state-of-the-art one-stage detectors, while being computationally efficient during inference.
