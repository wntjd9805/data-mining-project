1-bit detectors often have lower performance compared to real-valued detectors due to errors during binarization. This paper proposes a layer-wise searching strategy to generate 1-bit detectors that maintain similar performance to real-valued models. The approach utilizes angular and amplitude loss functions to increase detector capacity. At 1-bit layers, a differentiable binarization search is employed to minimize angular error within a student-teacher framework. The scale factor is also learned by minimizing amplitude loss in the same framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LWS-Det outperforms existing 1-bit detectors by a significant margin on the PASCAL VOC and COCO datasets. For instance, LWS-Det achieves a 1-bit Faster-RCNN with ResNet-34 backbone that is within 2.0% mAP of its real-valued counterpart on the PASCAL VOC dataset.
