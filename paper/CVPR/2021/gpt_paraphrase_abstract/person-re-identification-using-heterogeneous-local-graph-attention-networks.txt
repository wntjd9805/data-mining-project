Recently, there has been a focus on learning the local relationship between different parts of pedestrian images in order to improve person re-identification (Re-ID) accuracy. However, existing methods only consider the intra-local relationship within a single pedestrian image and neglect the inter-local relationship between parts from different images. This leads to incomplete local relation information. To address this limitation, we propose a new deep graph model called Heterogeneous Local Graph Attention Networks (HLGAT). Our model simultaneously models the inter-local relationship and the intra-local relationship within a completed local graph. First, we construct the completed local graph using local features. Then, we utilize the attention mechanism to aggregate the local features, emphasizing the importance of different local features during the learning process. For the inter-local relationship, we introduce an attention regularization loss, which constrains the attention weights based on the identities of local features. This helps accurately describe the inter-local relationship. For the intra-local relationship, we incorporate contextual information into the attention weights to consider structural information. We conduct extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (Market-1501, CUHK03, DukeMTMC-reID, and MSMT17) to evaluate the performance of HLGAT. The results show that our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in person re-identification.
