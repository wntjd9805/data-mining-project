We introduce Sparse R-CNN, a novel approach to object detection in images that relies on a sparse set of learned object proposals instead of dense object candidates. Traditional methods for object detection use a large number of predefined anchor boxes on the image feature map, resulting in a high computational cost. In Sparse R-CNN, we replace this dense set of object candidates with a fixed sparse set of N learnable proposals. By reducing the number of object candidates from HW k to N, we eliminate the need for manual object candidate design and label assignment. Additionally, our approach directly outputs final predictions without the need for non-maximum suppression post-processing.Sparse R-CNN achieves comparable accuracy, runtime, and training convergence performance to established detector baselines on the challenging COCO dataset. For example, using the ResNet-50 FPN model, Sparse R-CNN achieves 45.0 AP in the standard 3x training schedule and runs at 22 fps. We hope that our work will encourage a reconsideration of the convention of using dense priors in object detectors.We provide the code for Sparse R-CNN at: https://github.com/PeizeSun/SparseR-CNN.
