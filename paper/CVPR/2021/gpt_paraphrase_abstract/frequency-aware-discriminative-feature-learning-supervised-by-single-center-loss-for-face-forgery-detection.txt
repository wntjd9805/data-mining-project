The detection of face forgeries using Softmax lossSCLFace has become increasingly important in the field of computer vision due to concerns over facial manipulation technologies. While recent advancements have achieved some success, there are still significant issues that need to be addressed. Firstly, the features learned through softmax loss are separable but lack discriminative power, as the loss function does not explicitly promote compactness within classes and separability between classes. Secondly, the use of fixed filter banks and hand-crafted features is insufficient for capturing the diverse patterns of forgery frequencies. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for frequency-aware discriminative feature learning. Specifically, a single-center loss (SCL) is introduced to compress intra-class variations of natural faces and enhance inter-class differences in the embedding space. This enables the network to learn more discriminative features with less optimization complexity. Additionally, an adaptive frequency feature generation module is developed to extract frequency clues from data in a data-driven manner. By combining these two modules, the framework is capable of learning more discriminative features in an end-to-end fashion. Extensive experiments conducted on three versions of the FF++ dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework.
