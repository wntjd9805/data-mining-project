This paper presents an efficient stereo imaging method for capturing wide fields of view using fisheye lenses. Traditional scan-line stereo algorithms based on epipolar geometry are not suitable for fisheye lenses, resulting in limited real-time performance in existing complete 360-degree RGB-D imaging systems. The proposed method, called sphere-sweeping stereo, allows for direct processing of multi-view fisheye images without the need for additional spherical rectification. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: 1. An adaptive spherical matching method is introduced, taking into account the resolving power of each fisheye camera in relation to spherical distortion. 2. A fast inter-scale bilateral cost volume filtering method is proposed, which refines distance estimation in noisy and textureless areas with optimal complexity. This method enables real-time dense distance estimation while preserving edges. 3. The fusion of fisheye color and distance images into a complete 360-degree RGB-D image is achieved through fast inpainting of the dense distance map. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, an embedded 360-degree RGB-D imaging prototype consisting of a mobile GPU and four fisheye cameras is implemented. The prototype is capable of capturing complete 360-degree RGB-D videos at a resolution of two megapixels with a frame rate of 29 fps. Experimental results show that the real-time method outperforms traditional omnidirectional stereo and learning-based omnidirectional stereo in terms of accuracy and performance.
