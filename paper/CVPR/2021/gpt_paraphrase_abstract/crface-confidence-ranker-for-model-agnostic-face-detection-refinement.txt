Face detection is an essential task for various face applications, and there is a growing need for faster and more accurate face detectors that can handle higher resolution images. Although smartphones can now capture videos in 8K resolution, existing face detectors often fail due to issues with anchor size and training data. To address this, we examine the reasons for these failures and find that many correct predictions have incorrect confidence scores. To rectify this, we propose a confidence ranking network that uses a pairwise ranking loss to locally reorder the predicted confidences within the same image. Our confidence ranker is versatile, allowing us to augment the training data by selecting pairs from multiple face detectors, and it can be applied to a wide range of face detectors during testing. On the WiderFace dataset, our approach achieves the highest average precision (AP) on single-scale detection, and its AP is competitive with previous multi-scale methods while also being significantly faster. Additionally, our method overcomes GPU memory limitations, enabling us to indirectly train on 8K resolution data. We have created an 8K resolution test set to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and plan to release it as a benchmark for future research.
