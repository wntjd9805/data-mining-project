Convolutional neural networks have made significant progress in the field of face recognition. However, as the technology advances, there is an increased risk to user privacy if face templates are exposed. To address this issue, we propose a modular architecture called IronMask, which can be integrated with any face recognition system that uses angular distance metric. Unlike existing methods that rely on binarization, which leads to performance degradation, IronMask utilizes a new real-valued error-correcting code that is compatible with real-valued templates. This minimizes performance degradation and enhances template protection. We conducted extensive experiments on two face recognition systems, ArcFace and CosFace, using three datasets (CMU-Multi-PIE, FEI, and Color-FERET) to evaluate the effectiveness of IronMask. Our experimental results show that IronMask achieves a true accept rate (TAR) of 99.79% at a false accept rate (FAR) of 0.0005% when combined with ArcFace, and a TAR of 95.78% at 0% FAR with CosFace. Furthermore, IronMask provides at least 115-bit security against known attacks.
