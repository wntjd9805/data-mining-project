Improving the performance of face forgery detectors often requires better quality and more diverse identity-swapped images. One key objective of identity swapping is to generate faces that are easily distinguishable from the target but identical to the source. However, separating identity-related information from irrelevant details is a complex task. In this study, we introduce a novel network called InfoSwap, which disentangles and swaps information to extract the most informative identity representations from a pre-trained face recognition model. Our approach involves optimizing an information bottleneck trade-off to achieve an optimal compression of the latent features obtained from the pre-trained model. Additionally, we propose a new identity contrastive loss that enforces a proper distance between the generated identity and the target, further enhancing disentanglement. Unlike previous methods that rely on implicit guidance through loss functions, our model provides explicit supervision for learning disentangled representations. As a result, our approach demonstrates impressive performance in generating identity-discriminative swapped faces.
