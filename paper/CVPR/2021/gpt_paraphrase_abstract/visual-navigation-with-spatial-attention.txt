This study focuses on object goal visual navigation, which involves locating a specific object from a given class using egocentric RGB images of the scene. The researchers propose using reinforcement learning to train the agent's policy, and their main contribution is a new attention probability model for visual navigation tasks. This attention model incorporates both semantic information about observed objects and spatial information about their location, enabling the agent to navigate more effectively towards the desired object. Experimental results demonstrate that the attention model enhances the agent's policy and achieves state-of-the-art performance on widely-used datasets.
