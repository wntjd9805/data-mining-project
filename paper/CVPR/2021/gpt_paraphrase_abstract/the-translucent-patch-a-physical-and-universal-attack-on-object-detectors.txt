Physical adversarial attacks against object detectors have gained traction in recent years. These attacks necessitate direct access to the object of interest in order to apply a physical patch. Moreover, to conceal multiple objects, an adversarial patch must be affixed to each individual object. This study proposes a contactless, translucent physical patch that encompasses a meticulously designed pattern. The patch is placed on the camera lens to deceive cutting-edge object detectors. The primary objective of the patch is to obscure all occurrences of a specific target class. Additionally, the optimization method employed in constructing the patch strives to ensure that the detection of other non-targeted classes remains unaffected. To evaluate the efficacy of the patch, experiments are conducted on state-of-the-art object detection models utilized in autonomous driving. The impact of the patch on both the targeted class and other classes is examined. The results demonstrate that the patch successfully prevents the detection of 42.27% of all stop sign instances while maintaining a high detection rate (nearly 80%) for the other classes.
