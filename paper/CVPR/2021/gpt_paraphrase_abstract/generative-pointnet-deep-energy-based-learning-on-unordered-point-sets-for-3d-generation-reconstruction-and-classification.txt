We present a novel approach for generating unordered point sets, such as point clouds, using an energy-based model. Our model utilizes a neural network to parameterize the energy function, which is invariant to the order of input points. By learning a coordinate encoding for each point and aggregating their features, we can determine the overall energy of the point cloud. We refer to our model as the Generative PointNet, derived from the Discriminative PointNet. Unlike other point cloud generators, our model does not rely on hand-crafted distance metrics and instead matches observed examples based on statistical properties defined by the energy function. Additionally, we can employ a short-run Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) as a flow-like generator for point cloud reconstruction and interpolation. The resulting point cloud representation can be effectively utilized for point cloud classification. Our experiments demonstrate the advantages of our proposed generative model for point clouds.
