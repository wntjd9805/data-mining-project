This paper addresses the challenge of predicting the future movements of a dynamic agent, called a target agent, based on its current and past states and information about its environment. The goal is to develop a prediction model that can utilize contextual information from both static and dynamic environments surrounding the target agent and generate diverse trajectory samples that are meaningful in a traffic context. To achieve this, the authors propose a new prediction model called the lane-aware prediction (LaPred) network. This model utilizes instance-level lane entities extracted from a semantic map to predict multi-modal future trajectories. For each lane candidate in the vicinity of the target agent, LaPred extracts joint features that relate the lane to the trajectories of neighboring agents. These features, along with attention weights learned through a self-supervised learning task, are used to fuse the features for all lane candidates and identify the most likely lane candidate to be followed by the target agent. By incorporating instance-level lane information, LaPred is able to generate trajectories that are more compliant with the surrounding environment compared to 2D raster image-based methods. Additionally, it can generate diverse future trajectories by considering multiple lane candidates. The experimental results on the nuScenes and ArgoVerse datasets demonstrate that LaPred outperforms existing prediction models and achieves state-of-the-art performance in benchmark tests.
