The popularity of generative adversarial networks (GANs) is due to their ability to replicate images. However, GANs struggle with reproducing images accurately when they are degraded by blur, noise, or compression. A recent solution called noise robust GAN (NR-GAN) can generate clean images from noisy ones by using two generators. However, NR-GAN only works for reversible noise degradation and cannot handle irreversible degradation like blur and compression. To address this limitation, we propose a new GAN called blur, noise, and compression robust GAN (BNCR-GAN). BNCR-GAN can generate clean images from degraded images without knowing the specific degradation parameters. It uses multiple generators for image, blur-kernel, noise, and quality-factor. Unlike NR-GAN, we introduce masking architectures to adjust degradation strength in a data-driven manner and adaptive consistency losses to ensure consistency between irreversible degradation processes. We evaluate the effectiveness of BNCR-GAN through large-scale studies on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ datasets, and demonstrate its applicability in image restoration.
