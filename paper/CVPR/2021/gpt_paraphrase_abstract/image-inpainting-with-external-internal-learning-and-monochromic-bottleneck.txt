Current inpainting methods using deep neural networks have shown improvement in filling missing regions, but they still suffer from issues such as blunt structures and abrupt colors. To address these problems, we propose an external-internal inpainting scheme that incorporates a monochromic bottleneck to assist in removing these artifacts. In the external learning stage, we reconstruct missing structures and details in the monochromic space to simplify the learning process. In the internal learning stage, we introduce a novel internal color propagation method with progressive learning strategies to achieve consistent color restoration. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed scheme enables image inpainting models to produce results that preserve structure and are visually compelling.
