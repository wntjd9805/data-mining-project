Dense depth estimation is crucial in various applications like robotics, 3D reconstruction, and augmented reality. However, using sparse signal, such as LiDAR and Radar, to enhance dense depth estimation has limitations due to its low density and imbalanced distribution. To address this issue, we introduce the Sparse Signal Superdensity (S3) technique, which expands the depth value from sparse cues while estimating the confidence of the expanded region. S3 can be incorporated into different guided depth estimation approaches and trained end-to-end at various stages, including input, cost volume, and output. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and flexibility of S3 on LiDAR and Radar signals.
