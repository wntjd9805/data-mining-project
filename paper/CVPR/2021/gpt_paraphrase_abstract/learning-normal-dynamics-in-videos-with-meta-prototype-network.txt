Frame reconstruction using Auto-Encoder (AE) is a popular technique for detecting anomalies in videos. Typically, anomalous scenes result in larger reconstruction errors compared to normal scenes when models are trained on normal data. Previous methods have incorporated memory banks into AE to encode various normal patterns from training videos. However, these methods are memory-intensive and cannot handle new, unseen scenarios in testing data. In this study, we propose a dynamic prototype unit (DPU) that encodes normal dynamics as real-time prototypes without incurring additional memory costs. Additionally, we introduce meta-learning to our DPU, creating a novel few-shot normalcy learner called Meta-Prototype Unit (MPU). MPU allows for fast adaptation to new scenes with only a few update iterations. We conducted extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks and our method outperformed the state-of-the-art, demonstrating its effectiveness. The code for our method is publicly available at https://github.com/ktr-hubrt/MPN/.
