We propose a new method called Multiple Instance Active Object Detection (MI-AOD) to address the lack of instance-level active learning methods for object detection. MI-AOD leverages instance-level uncertainty to select the most informative images for detector training. It incorporates an instance uncertainty learning module that predicts the uncertainty of unlabeled images by comparing two adversarial instance classifiers trained on the labeled set. MI-AOD treats unlabeled images as instance bags and estimates image uncertainty by re-weighting instances using a multiple instance learning approach. This iterative process helps suppress noisy instances and bridge the gap between instance uncertainty and image-level uncertainty. Experimental results show that MI-AOD performs better than state-of-the-art methods, particularly when labeled sets are small. The code for MI-AOD is available at https://github.com/yuantn/MI-AOD.
