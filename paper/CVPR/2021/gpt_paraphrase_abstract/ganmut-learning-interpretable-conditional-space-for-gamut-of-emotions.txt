This paper addresses the limitations of conditional GANs in generating a wide range of facial expressions with different intensities, nuances, and ambiguities. The current approach relies on a label system to encode expressions, which either requires extensive labeling efforts or results in a confounded label space. Alternatively, learning from basic categorical emotion labels leads to limited variability in emotions. To overcome these limitations, the paper proposes a novel GAN-based framework that learns an expressive and interpretable conditional space of emotions instead of relying on handcrafted labels. This framework utilizes only basic categorical emotion labels to jointly learn the conditional space and emotion manipulation. By leveraging the image variability within discrete labels, the framework can effectively control and generate a diverse set of complex and compound emotions during training. The experiments conducted demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The source code for the framework is available at the provided GitHub link.
