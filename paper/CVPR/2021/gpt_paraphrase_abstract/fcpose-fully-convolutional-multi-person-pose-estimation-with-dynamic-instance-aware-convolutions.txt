We present FCPose, a novel framework for multi-person pose estimation that utilizes dynamic instance-aware convolutions. Unlike existing methods, FCPose eliminates the need for ROI operations and grouping post-processing by employing dynamic keypoint estimation heads. These heads are conditioned on each individual instance and can encode the instance concept in their dynamically-generated filter weights. Additionally, FCPose's keypoint heads are designed to be compact, resulting in fast inference and consistent inference time regardless of the number of persons in the image. On the COCO dataset, a real-time version of FCPose using the DLA-34 backbone is approximately 4.5 times faster than Mask R-CNN (ResNet-101) while achieving improved performance. FCPose also exhibits a better trade-off between speed and accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Our experimental results demonstrate that FCPose is a simple yet effective framework for multi-person pose estimation. The code for FCPose is available at: https://git.io/AdelaiDet.
