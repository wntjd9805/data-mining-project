The last ten years have witnessed significant progress in person re-identification (re-ID) due to the success of deep learning. However, most approaches assume that the input is perfect and rarely consider imperfect input, which can lead to a significant decline in performance if existing methods are applied without adjustments. This paper focuses on recognizing flawed input by introducing Part-Part Correspondence Learning (PPCL), a self-supervised learning framework that learns the correspondence between image patches without any part-level supervision. To achieve this, the paper proposes the Part-Part Cycle (PP-Cycle) constraint and Part-Part Triplet (PP-Triplet) constraint, which exploit the duality and uniqueness of corresponding image patches, respectively. The proposed PPCL is evaluated on various partial person re-ID benchmarks, and the experimental results demonstrate that it outperforms previous methods in terms of the standard evaluation metric.
