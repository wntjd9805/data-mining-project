In this study, we address the limitations of existing deep deraining models that fail to restore fine-grained local details and remove blurry rainy traces. We propose a new approach that leverages the inherent characteristics of rainy images and incorporates intrinsic loss functions to improve training of deraining networks. Our method involves decomposing a rainy image into a rain-free background layer and a rainy layer containing intact rain streaks. We introduce a quasi-sparsity prior to generate two sparse layers with intact textures of different objects, and a low-value prior to ensure all rain streaks are preserved in one layer while non-rain contents are in another layer, thus restoring image details. Furthermore, we adopt a multi-decoding structure to supervise the generation of various deraining features, allowing us to learn the most effective features in different spaces. To mitigate potential artifacts and enhance computational efficiency, we stabilize feature values across multiple spaces through information sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed deraining method surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.
