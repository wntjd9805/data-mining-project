Current methods for analyzing human motion in videos typically focus on analyzing raw pixels or keypoints. However, we propose that incorporating higher-level motion primitives can enhance the analysis process by capturing natural, larger units of motion such as "backswing" or "follow-through". These higher-level abstractions can also capture important features like repeated motion patterns that are not easily accessible with lower-level representations. To address this, we introduce Motion Programs, a neuro-symbolic representation that represents motions as compositions of high-level primitives. Additionally, we present a system that automatically learns motion programs from videos and utilizes them in video synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that motion programs can accurately describe various human motions, with inferred programs containing meaningful primitives like arm swings and jumping jacks. Furthermore, our representation benefits downstream tasks such as video interpolation and prediction, outperforming pre-existing models. We also showcase how these programs can detect diverse repetitive motions and facilitate interactive video editing.
