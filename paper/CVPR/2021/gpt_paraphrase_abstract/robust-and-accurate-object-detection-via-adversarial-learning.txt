Data augmentation is commonly used in training deep image classifiers, but its potential for object detection has not been fully explored. Previous studies have shown that fine-tuning a pre-trained classifier can improve object detection performance, so we investigated how data augmentation techniques used for classifiers could be transferred to object detection. However, our findings were disappointing, as the gains in accuracy and robustness obtained from data augmentation diminished after fine-tuning. To address this issue, we propose a new approach that augments the fine-tuning stage for object detectors using adversarial examples, which can be seen as a model-dependent form of data augmentation. Our method selects the strongest adversarial images from the detector's classification and localization branches, ensuring that the augmentation policy remains up-to-date and relevant as the detector evolves. Compared to AutoAugment, a model-agnostic augmentation policy designed for a specific detector, our model-dependent augmentation performs better across different object detectors. Specifically, our approach improves the performance of the state-of-the-art EfficientDets by 1.1 mAP on the COCO object detection benchmark. Furthermore, it enhances the detectors' robustness against natural distortions by 3.8 mAP and against domain shift by 1.3 mAP.
