Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image. However, obtaining dense labels for segmentation is challenging. To address this, researchers have started using weak labels, which reduces the annotation burden. Existing methods focus on expanding the seed of pseudo labels within the salient region of an image. In this study, we propose a new approach for weakly supervised semantic segmentation that mines objects in non-salient regions. We introduce a graph-based global reasoning unit that enhances the classification network's ability to capture global relationships between disjoint and distant regions. This allows the network to activate object features outside the salient area. To further mine non-salient region objects, we leverage the self-correction ability of the segmentation network. We introduce a potential object mining module to decrease the false-negative rate in pseudo labels. Additionally, we propose a non-salient region masking module for complex images, which generates masked pseudo labels and helps discover objects in the non-salient region. We conduct extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC dataset and achieve state-of-the-art results compared to current methods.
