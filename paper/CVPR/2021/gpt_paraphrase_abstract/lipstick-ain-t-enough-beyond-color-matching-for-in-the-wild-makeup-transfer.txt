The task of makeup transfer involves applying the makeup style from a reference image onto a source face. Existing works have focused on color manipulation and light makeup styles, neglecting other components such as patterns, stickers, blushes, and jewelries. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework for makeup transfer that addresses all these components. Our framework includes an improved color transfer branch and a novel pattern transfer branch, allowing us to learn and transfer makeup properties like color, shape, texture, and location. To facilitate the training and evaluation of our system, we have curated new makeup datasets that include both real and synthetic extreme makeup styles. Our experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for both light and extreme makeup styles. The code for our framework is available at https://github.com/VinAIResearch/CPM.
