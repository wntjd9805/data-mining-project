Recently, there has been significant progress in transductive graph-based methods for few-shot classification. However, most existing approaches overlook the importance of class-level knowledge, which can be easily acquired by humans with just a small number of examples. In this study, we introduce an approach called the Explicit Class Knowledge Propagation Network (ECKPN) to tackle this issue. ECKPN consists of three modules: comparison, squeeze, and calibration. The comparison module is used to explore pairwise relationships between samples and learn comprehensive representations at the instance level. Then, we employ the squeeze module to transform the instance-level graph into a class-level graph, enabling the acquisition of class-level visual knowledge and facilitating modeling of inter-class relationships. Next, the calibration module is utilized to explicitly characterize the relationships between classes, resulting in more discriminative class-level knowledge representations. Finally, we combine the class-level knowledge with the instance-level sample representations to guide the inference process for query samples. We evaluate ECKPN on four different few-shot classification benchmarks and demonstrate its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
