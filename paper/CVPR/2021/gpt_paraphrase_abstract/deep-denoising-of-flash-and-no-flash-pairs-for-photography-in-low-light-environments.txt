We present a novel approach using a neural network to remove noise from pairs of images captured in low-light conditions, with and without a flash. Our objective is to generate a high-quality representation of the scene that maintains the color and atmosphere of the ambient lighting in the no-flash image, while enhancing the surface texture and details captured by the flash. Our network produces a gain map and a set of kernels, achieved by blending elements of a low-rank kernel basis for each image. We apply the kernel field to the no-flash image and then multiply the result by the gain map to obtain the final output. Our network effectively learns to combine a smoothed estimation of the scene's ambient appearance from the no-flash image with high-frequency albedo details extracted from the flash input, resulting in high-quality images. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over alternative methods that lack a flash and baseline denoisers that utilize flash-no-flash pairs. Notably, our approach generates noise-free images with accurate ambient colors, avoiding the presence of sharp shadows or intense specular highlights observed in the flash image.
