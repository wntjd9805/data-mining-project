Graph Edit Distance (GED) is a widely used measure of similarity for comparing pairs of graphs and also involves finding the sequence of edits required to transform one graph into another. However, the traditional A* algorithm, which is commonly used for this task, encounters scalability issues due to its exhaustive nature and reliance on human prior knowledge for search heuristics. This study proposes a hybrid approach that combines the interpretability of traditional search-based techniques with the efficiency and adaptivity of deep embedding models in order to create a cost-effective GED solver. By incorporating node-level embedding in a dynamic reuse manner inspired by dynamic programming, the method effectively prunes suboptimal branches. This allows for the integration of the proposed approach into the A* procedure dynamically, while also significantly reducing the computational burden through the use of a learned heuristic. Experimental results on various graph datasets demonstrate that the approach greatly simplifies the search process of A* without sacrificing much accuracy. Additionally, this work represents the first deep learning-based GED method for recovering the edit path.
