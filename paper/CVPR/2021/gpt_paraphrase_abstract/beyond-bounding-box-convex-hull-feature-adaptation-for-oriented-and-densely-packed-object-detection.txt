Detecting objects that are oriented and densely packed is challenging due to spatial feature aliasing caused by the overlap of reception fields between objects. In this paper, we propose a method called convex-hull feature adaptation (CFA) to address this issue. CFA utilizes a convex-hull feature representation that predicts dynamically guided feature points using the convex intersection over union (CIoU) to bound the object extent. By constructing convex-hull sets and dynamically splitting positive or negative convex-hulls, CFA achieves optimal feature assignment. It takes into account overlapping convex-hulls and objects, penalizing convex-hulls shared by multiple objects to mitigate spatial feature aliasing. Experimental results on DOTA and SKU110K-R datasets demonstrate that CFA outperforms the baseline approach and achieves state-of-the-art detection performance. The code for CFA is available at github.com/SDL-GuoZonghao/BeyondBoundingBox. The problem of feature aliasing is illustrated in Figure 1, where oriented and densely packed objects cause issues when using box representation, but CFA solves this problem by adapting features on regular convolutional maps to such objects using convex-hull representation.
