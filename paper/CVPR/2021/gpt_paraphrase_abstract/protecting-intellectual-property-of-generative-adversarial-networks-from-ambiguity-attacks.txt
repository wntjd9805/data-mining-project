With the rise of Machine Learning as a Service, which utilizes deep learning models to generate profitable revenue, Intellectual Property Right (IPR) has become a significant concern. These deep learning models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) commonly used for creating photorealistic images, are vulnerable to replication, sharing, and redistribution by unauthorized parties. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have pioneering IPR protection methods, GANs currently lack such protection. This paper introduces a comprehensive framework to enforce IPR protection on GANs, both in black-box and white-box settings. The proposed method successfully safeguards the original GANs' performance in image generation, image super-resolution, and style transfer, while also withstanding removal and ambiguity attacks on embedded watermarks. The code for this framework is accessible at https://github.com/dingsheng-ong/ipr-gan.
