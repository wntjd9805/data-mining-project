Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to enhance the classification performance in an unlabeled target domain by utilizing information from a fully labeled source domain. Current methods focus on developing domain-invariant and class-discriminant representations for this task. However, these approaches overlook the interaction between domain alignment learning and class discrimination learning, which leads to an inadequate tradeoff between the two and increases the risk of negative transfer. This paper introduces Dynamic Weighted Learning (DWL) as a solution to address the problem of discriminability vanishing due to excessive alignment learning and domain misalignment caused by excessive discriminant learning. DWL dynamically adjusts the learning losses of alignment and discriminability by considering their respective degrees. Additionally, this work also addresses the issue of sample imbalance across domains by assigning weights to the samples to ensure information balance. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance of DWL.
