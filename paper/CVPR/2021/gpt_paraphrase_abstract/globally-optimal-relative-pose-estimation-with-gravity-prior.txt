Smartphones, tablets, and camera systems commonly have inertial measurement units (IMUs) that can accurately measure the gravity vector. By utilizing this information, the alignment of the y-axes of the cameras can be improved, reducing their relative orientation to a single degree-of-freedom. In this study, we propose a new solver that optimally minimizes the algebraic error in the least squares sense to estimate the relative pose, particularly in cases where there is an overabundance of data. By applying the epipolar constraint, we transform the optimization problem into solving two polynomials with only two unknowns. Additionally, we introduce a fast solver that utilizes a first-order approximation of the rotation. To evaluate the performance of our proposed solvers, we compare them with existing state-of-the-art methods using four real-world datasets containing approximately 50,000 image pairs in total. Furthermore, we have collected a dataset consisting of 10,933 image pairs, gravity directions, and ground truth 3D reconstructions using a smartphone.
