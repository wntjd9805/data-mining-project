Recently, Space-Time Memory based networks have demonstrated the usefulness of object cues from past frames in segmenting objects in the current frame. However, these methods suffer from mismatching similar objects and high computational complexity due to global-to-global matching between frames. To overcome these issues, we present a new solution for semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation (VOS) called Regional Memory Network (RMNet). RMNet constructs precise regional memory by memorizing local regions where target objects appeared in the past frames. For the current frame, query regions are tracked and predicted using optical flow from the previous frame. Our local-to-local matching approach effectively reduces ambiguity among similar objects in memory and query frames, enabling efficient and effective transfer of information from regional memory to query regions. Experimental results on DAVIS and YouTube-VOS datasets demonstrate that RMNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
