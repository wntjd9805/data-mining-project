This paper explores the question of whether a visual object should be classified at a fine-grained level or simply as a broader category. The authors propose a new approach to fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) that takes into account different definitions of objects based on varying levels of expertise. They suggest a top-down traversal of a label hierarchy, where the classification progresses from a general category to a more specific one. For example, instead of labeling an object as a "flamingo," it would be classified as a "bird," "Phoenicopteriformes," "Phoenicopteridae," and finally "flamingo." The authors conducted a human study and found that most participants preferred multi-granularity labels, regardless of their expertise. They also discovered that coarse-level label prediction enhances fine-grained feature learning, while fine-level features improve the learning of coarse-level classifiers. Based on these findings, they propose a simple yet effective solution that uses level-specific classification heads to separate coarse-level and fine-grained features and allows fine-grained features to contribute to coarser-grained label predictions, leading to better disentanglement. Experimental results demonstrate that their method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in the new FGVC setting and achieves superior performance in traditional single-label FGVC as well. The simplicity of their method allows for easy implementation on existing FGVC frameworks without the need for additional parameters.
