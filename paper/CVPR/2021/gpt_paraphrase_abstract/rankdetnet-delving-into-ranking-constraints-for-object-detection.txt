Current object detection methods focus on optimizing the classification and localization tasks separately, leading to a mismatch between the two objectives. To address this issue, we propose a ranking-based optimization algorithm that learns to rank and localize proposals instead of solely classifying them. We investigate three types of ranking constraints: global ranking, class-specific ranking, and IoU-guided ranking losses. These constraints help establish relationships between samples and improve detection performance. Our approach is easy to implement, compatible with existing detection frameworks, and does not require additional computation during inference. Experimental results show that our RankDetNet outperforms previous anchor-based and anchor-free methods, achieving a 2.5% improvement in average precision on the COCO test-dev set. We also apply our ranking constraints to 3D object detection and observe enhanced performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of our approach.
