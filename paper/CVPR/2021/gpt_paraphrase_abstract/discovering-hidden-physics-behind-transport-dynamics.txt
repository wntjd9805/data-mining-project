Transport processes are found in various fields such as optical flow and perfusion imaging. The advection-diffusion equation is commonly used to describe these processes. The aim of this study is to estimate the underlying physics of advection-diffusion equations, specifically the velocity and diffusion tensor fields. A learning framework called YETI is proposed, which utilizes an auto-encoder structure between 2D and 3D image time-series and incorporates the advection-diffusion model. To enhance identifiability, an advection-diffusion simulator is developed to pre-train the model using supervised learning and the velocity and diffusion tensor fields. Rather than directly learning these fields, the study introduces representations that ensure incompressible flow and symmetric positive semi-definite diffusion fields. These representations improve estimation accuracy. Additionally, transfer learning is employed to apply YETI on a public brain MR perfusion dataset of stroke patients. The results demonstrate the model's ability to successfully distinguish stroke lesions from normal brain regions using the estimated velocity and diffusion tensor fields.
