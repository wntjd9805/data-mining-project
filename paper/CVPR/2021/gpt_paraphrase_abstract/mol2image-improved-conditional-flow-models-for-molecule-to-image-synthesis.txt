This paper introduces Mol2Image, a flow-based generative model designed to synthesize cell microscopy images under different molecular interventions. The motivation behind this research is to aid in drug development. The proposed model utilizes graph neural networks for learning molecular embeddings and flow-based models for image generation. To generate cell features at various resolutions and scale up to high-resolution images, a novel multi-scale flow architecture based on a Haar wavelet image pyramid is developed. To ensure the generated images capture the molecular interventions effectively, a training strategy based on contrastive learning is devised to maximize the mutual information between the generated images and the interventions. The model's performance is evaluated using a new set of metrics specifically designed for biological image generation, which are robust, interpretable, and relevant to practitioners. The quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully learns a meaningful embedding of the molecular intervention, which is then translated into an image representation that reflects the biological effects of the intervention.
