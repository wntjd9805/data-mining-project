Blind super-resolution (SR) methods aim to enhance the quality of low-resolution images by generating high-resolution versions, even when the degradation factors are unknown. However, natural images often contain different types and levels of blurring, some of which may be intentional for aesthetic purposes. This poses a challenge for SR methods as they struggle to distinguish between the blur that needs to be removed and the blur that should be preserved. In this study, we propose a new blind SR framework called KOALAnet, which utilizes kernel-oriented adaptive local adjustment (KOALA) of SR features. This approach simultaneously learns spatially-variant degradation and restoration kernels to adapt to the varying blur characteristics present in real images. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our KOALAnet outperforms recent blind SR methods when applied to synthesized low-resolution images with randomized degradations. Additionally, we show that KOALAnet produces the most natural results for artistic photographs with intentional blur. It effectively handles images containing both in-focus and out-of-focus areas, avoiding over-sharpening and achieving more visually pleasing outcomes.
