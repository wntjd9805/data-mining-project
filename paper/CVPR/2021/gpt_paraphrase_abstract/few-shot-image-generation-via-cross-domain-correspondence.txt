This study aims to address the issue of overfitting when training generative models, such as GANs, on a limited number of examples in the target domain. To overcome this, the researchers propose utilizing a large source domain for pretraining and transferring the diversity information from the source to the target. They introduce a novel cross-domain distance consistency loss to preserve the relative similarities and differences between instances in the source domain. Additionally, an anchor-based strategy is presented to reduce overfitting by encouraging different levels of realism in different regions of the latent space. The researchers provide extensive results in both photorealistic and non-photorealistic domains, demonstrating that their few-shot model automatically discovers correspondences between the source and target domains and generates more diverse and realistic images.
