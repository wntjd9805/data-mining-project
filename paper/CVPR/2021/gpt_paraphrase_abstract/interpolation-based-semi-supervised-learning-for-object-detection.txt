This paper introduces a novel Interpolation-based Semi-supervised learning method for object Detection (ISD) that addresses the challenges of applying conventional Interpolation Regularization (IR) directly to object detection. The proposed method divides the model's output into two types based on the objectness scores of original patches mixed in IR. For each type, a separate unsupervised loss is applied. These losses significantly enhance the performance of both supervised and semi-supervised learning. In supervised learning, the proposed method outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin. In semi-supervised learning, the algorithm demonstrates improved performance on the PASCAL VOC and MSCOCO benchmark datasets using the SSD architecture. The code for the proposed method is available at https://github.com/soo89/ISD-SSD.
