We introduce the Zillow Indoor Dataset (ZInD), a comprehensive collection of indoor data consisting of 71,474 panoramas from 1,524 real unfurnished homes. ZInD offers detailed annotations of 3D room layouts, 2D and 3D floor plans, the location of each panorama within the floor plan, as well as the positions of windows and doors. The process of creating this dataset involved more than 1,500 hours of meticulous annotation work. Currently, ZInD stands as the largest known real dataset that includes layout annotations. Notably, the uniqueness of ZInD lies in its room layout data, which represents a real-world distribution encompassing cuboid, more general Manhattan, and non-Manhattan layouts, in contrast to the predominantly cuboid or Manhattan layouts found in existing publicly available datasets. The scale and accuracy of the annotations included in ZInD make it an invaluable resource for conducting research on room layout and floor plan analysis. To showcase the advantages of ZInD, we performed benchmarking tests on room layout estimation from individual panoramas and multi-view registration.
