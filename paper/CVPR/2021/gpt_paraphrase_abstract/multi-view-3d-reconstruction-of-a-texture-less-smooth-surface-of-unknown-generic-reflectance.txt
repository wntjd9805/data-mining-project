Recovering the 3D shape of an object without texture and with unknown surface reflectance is a difficult task in multi-view reconstruction. The main challenge lies in establishing correspondences between different views when there are violations of photometric constancy. This paper presents a practical solution to this problem by using a camera-light scanner device. Unlike existing approaches, we do not explicitly solve for correspondence. Instead, we argue that the problem can be effectively solved using geometric and photometric constraints from a small number of input views. We formulate the reconstruction task as an energy minimization problem that considers both the surface geometry and reflectance. Despite the non-convex nature of this energy, we have developed an optimization algorithm that robustly recovers the globally optimal shape and reflectance even from a random initialization. Extensive experiments on simulated and real data have confirmed the effectiveness of our method, and we discuss potential future extensions.
