Significant progress has been made in the field of visual navigation for embodied agents. However, most studies assume static environments, which limits the potential of intelligent navigation. In this paper, we address this limitation by studying interactive navigation, where agents learn to modify the environment to navigate more efficiently. We introduce the Neural Interaction Engine (NIE), which predicts the changes in the environment caused by the agent's actions. Through planning and modeling these changes, we observe significant improvements in the agents' navigational capabilities. We evaluate our approach in two tasks: reaching a target when the path is blocked, and moving an object to a target location by pushing it. Agents equipped with the NIE outperform those without understanding the effects of their actions, demonstrating the benefits of our approach.
