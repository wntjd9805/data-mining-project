Temporal Action Weakly-supervised Localization (WTAL) is a method used to detect action segments in videos by only labeling the video-level action. The main challenge in this process is distinguishing the action segments of interest from the unlabelled background. While previous approaches view the background as a hindrance, we view it as an advantage. In this study, we employ causal analysis to identify that common localization errors are caused by an unobserved confounder present in visual recognition. To address this, we propose a model-agnostic and non-intrusive approach called Temporal Smoothing PCA-based deconfounder (TS-PCA). This method utilizes the unlabelled background to model an observed substitute for the unobserved confounder, effectively eliminating its influence. Importantly, the TS-PCA deconfounder can be seamlessly integrated into any WTAL method without requiring modifications to the underlying model. Through extensive experiments using four state-of-the-art WTAL methods, we demonstrate that the deconfounder significantly improves performance on widely-used datasets such as THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-1.31.
