Storing rapidly growing big data poses a challenge, requiring high-performance lossless compression techniques. Generative models based on likelihood have been successful in this regard, with flow based models being particularly desirable due to their ability to optimize data likelihood using bijective mappings. However, common continuous flows are at odds with the discreteness of coding schemes, leading to either the imposition of strict constraints on flow models that degrade performance or the coding of numerous bijective mapping errors that reduce efficiency. This study explores volume preserving flows for lossless compression and demonstrates the possibility of achieving a bijective mapping without error. A Numerical Invertible Volume Preserving Flow (iVPF) is proposed, derived from general volume preserving flows. By introducing novel computation algorithms for flow models, an exact bijective mapping is achieved without any numerical error. Additionally, a lossless compression algorithm based on iVPF is proposed. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that the iVPF-based algorithm achieves a state-of-the-art compression ratio compared to lightweight compression algorithms.
