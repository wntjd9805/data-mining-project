The focus of this study is on artistic warping in the field of Style Transfer, which involves texturing a content image using an art example. The significance of geometric changes made by artists has recently been recognized as an important aspect of style. The authors propose a neural network that learns a mapping from a 4D array of inter-feature distances to a non-parametric 2D warp field. This system is not limited by semantic class and can be applied to various examples using a single learned model. The approach combines the speed of a previous study by Liu et al. with the non-parametric warping technique introduced by Kim et al. Additionally, the system allows for the use of two style exemplars, one for texture and another for geometry, providing greater flexibility in different use cases compared to using a single exemplar.
