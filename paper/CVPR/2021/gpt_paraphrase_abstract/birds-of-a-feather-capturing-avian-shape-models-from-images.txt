We propose a method for creating a deformable shape model of new animal species, specifically focusing on birds. Due to the lack of 3D data, it is often challenging to build shape models for new species. To overcome this limitation, we utilize an articulated template and images of the species to capture their shape. Our approach involves fitting the articulated template to each training sample, allowing us to disentangle pose and shape. By doing so, we are able to learn a shape space that captures both inter-species and intra-species variation based on image evidence. We apply this method to birds, as there is currently no accurate shape model available for this diverse group. We learn shape models for multiple bird species using the CUB dataset and contribute newly developed species-specific and multi-species shape models. These models can be valuable for various downstream reconstruction tasks. Furthermore, by employing a low-dimensional embedding, we demonstrate that our learned 3D shape space accurately reflects the phylogenetic relationships among birds, surpassing the performance of learned perceptual features.
