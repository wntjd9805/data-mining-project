The fashion recommendation problem in the multimedia community has gained significant attention recently. Many studies have focused on modeling the compatibility between fashion items and users' personal preferences for outfits. However, a challenge that hasn't been addressed thoroughly is the limited number of outfits available for new users to learn from, typically less than 5. This makes it difficult to reliably model their preferences. In this research, we propose a novel solution for personalized outfit recommendation that can handle this scenario. Our approach utilizes a stacked self-attention mechanism to capture the interactions between items. We then embed the items in an outfit into a single compact representation within the outfit space. To account for the diverse preferences of users, we characterize each user with a set of learnable latent vectors called anchors, which represent the outfits they like. Additionally, we learn a set of general anchors to capture the preferences shared by all users. By leveraging these representations of outfits and users, we introduce a simple yet effective strategy for new user profiling tasks. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.
