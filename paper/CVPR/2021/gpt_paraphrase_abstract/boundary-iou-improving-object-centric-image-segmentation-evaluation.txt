We introduce a new evaluation measure called Boundary IoU, which focuses on the quality of boundaries in segmentation. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that Boundary IoU is more sensitive to boundary errors for larger objects and avoids penalizing errors on smaller objects excessively. This measure possesses desirable attributes such as symmetry between prediction and ground truth pairs, as well as balanced responsiveness across different scales. Consequently, it is more suitable for segmentation evaluation compared to other boundary-focused measures like Trimap IoU and F-measure. With Boundary IoU as a foundation, we propose updated evaluation protocols for instance and panoptic segmentation tasks, namely Boundary AP and Boundary PQ metrics, respectively. Our experiments reveal that these new evaluation metrics effectively capture improvements in boundary quality that are commonly overlooked by current Mask IoU-based metrics. By adopting these boundary-sensitive evaluation metrics, we anticipate accelerated progress in segmentation methods that enhance boundary quality.
