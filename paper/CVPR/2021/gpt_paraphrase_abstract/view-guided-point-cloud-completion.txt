This paper proposes a novel approach called ViPC (view-guided point cloud completion) for completing point clouds. Unlike existing methods that rely on shape priors, ViPC utilizes an additional single-view image to extract missing global structure information. By incorporating a framework that sequentially combines cross-modality and cross-level fusions, our method surpasses traditional solutions on a newly created large-scale dataset for view-guided point cloud completion.
