The performance of image dehazing using deep learning methods has been impressive. However, these methods are mainly trained on synthetic hazy images, causing a drop in performance when applied to real-world hazy images. To address this, we propose the Prin-cipled Synthetic-to-real Dehazing (PSD) framework, which improves the generalization performance of dehazing. PSD starts with a pre-trained dehazing model on synthetic data and fine-tunes it using real hazy images in an unsupervised manner. We incorporate several well-grounded physical priors into a prior loss committee for fine-tuning. PSD is compatible with various existing dehazing models, and the combination of multiple physical priors significantly enhances dehazing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PSD framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in real-world dehazing. This is evidenced by superior visual quality assessed using no-reference quality metrics, subjective evaluation, and downstream task performance indicators.
