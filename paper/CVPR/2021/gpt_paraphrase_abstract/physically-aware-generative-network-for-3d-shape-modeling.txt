Most existing generative models focus on the visual or geometric aspects of shapes and neglect their physical or structural properties. To address this limitation, we propose a new method that incorporates physical reasoning into deep generative models. Our approach introduces a loss function and learning framework that encourage two important characteristics of generated shapes: connectivity and physical stability. The connectivity aspect ensures that each generated shape is a single connected component, while the physical stability aspect promotes the shape's ability to withstand gravity. Our physical losses are fully differentiable, allowing for end-to-end learning. Importantly, our method does not sacrifice the expressive power or variability of the generated results. Through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art generative models, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, all while avoiding the need for costly differentiable physical simulations during training.
