Regression tracking has become more popular due to its ease of implementation, but existing trackers often neglect the relationships between object parts and the complete object. This can lead to drift from the target object when some parts are missing. Capsule Network (CapsNet) has shown promise for image classification by considering part-object relationships, but it is computationally demanding. Therefore, directly applying CapsNet to regression tracking would significantly impact the tracker's speed. To address these issues, we propose CapsuleRRT, a regression framework that explores the spatial-temporal relationships provided by CapsNet. CapsuleRRT consists of three parts: S-Caps captures the spatial relationships between object parts, T-Caps exploits temporal relationships within the target, and STCaps Learning obtains the target response. We also introduce a prior-guided capsule routing algorithm to generate more accurate capsule assignments for subsequent frames. Additionally, we address the computational burden of CapsNet by using a knowledge distillation pose matrix compression strategy that achieves a more compact and discriminative representation with fewer samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CapsuleRRT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and speed.
