Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) is a challenging task in computer vision due to the limited ability of classification networks to accurately identify object extent. While previous studies have focused on spatial regularization techniques to improve object localization, they have overlooked the importance of extracting structural information from the trained classification network. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach called structure-preserving activation (SPA) to address this issue. In the first stage, we introduce a restricted activation module (RAM) to address the problem of missing structure caused by the classification network. By observing that the unbounded classification map and global average pooling layer tend to focus only on object parts, we design the RAM to mitigate this issue. In the second stage, we present a post-process approach called self-correlation map generating (SCG) module. This module utilizes high-order self-correlation (HSC) to extract the inherent structural information preserved in the learned model. We then aggregate the HSC of multiple points to achieve precise object localization. We evaluate the proposed SPA method on two publicly available benchmarks, CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant and consistent performance improvements compared to baseline methods. To facilitate further research, we have made the code and models of our SPA method available on GitHub at github.com/Panxjia/SPA CVPR2021.
