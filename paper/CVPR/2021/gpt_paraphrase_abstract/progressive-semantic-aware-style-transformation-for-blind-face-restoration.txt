This paper introduces a new approach called PSFR-GAN for face restoration. Unlike previous methods, which use an encoder-decoder framework, PSFR-GAN formulates the restoration of low-quality (LQ) face images as a multi-scale progressive restoration procedure through semantic-aware style transformation. The framework utilizes both the semantic information from parsing maps and the pixel information from LQ images at different scales. Additionally, a semantic aware style loss is introduced to improve the details of face textures. The authors also pretrain a face parsing network to generate accurate parsing maps from real-world LQ face images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PSFR-GAN model trained with synthetic data produces more realistic high-resolution results for synthetic LQ inputs and generalizes better to natural LQ face images compared to existing methods.
