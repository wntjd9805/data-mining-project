Cross-view image geo-localization is a task that involves determining the locations of street-view images by comparing them to GPS-tagged reference images from an aerial view. While recent studies have achieved impressive retrieval accuracy on large-scale datasets, these results rely on the assumption that there is a reference image exactly centered at the location of any query image. However, in practical scenarios, this assumption is not applicable.In this paper, we redefine the problem by considering a more realistic assumption: the query image can be located anywhere within the area of interest, and the reference images are captured before the queries emerge. This new assumption breaks the one-to-one retrieval setting of existing datasets, as the queries and reference images are not perfectly aligned pairs, and there may be multiple reference images covering one query location.To address this gap between the realistic setting and existing datasets, we introduce a new large-scale benchmark called VIGOR for cross-view image geo-localization beyond one-to-one retrieval. We evaluate existing state-of-the-art methods using this benchmark and propose a novel end-to-end framework for localizing the query in a coarse-to-fine manner. In addition to measuring image-level retrieval accuracy, we also assess the localization accuracy in terms of actual distance (in meters) using the raw GPS data.We conduct extensive experiments under various application scenarios to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The results highlight the challenges of cross-view geo-localization in this realistic setting and motivate further research in this direction.
