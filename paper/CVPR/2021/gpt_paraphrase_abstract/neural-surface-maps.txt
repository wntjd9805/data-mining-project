Surface maps are widely used in differentiable geometry for various applications such as parametrization, shape analysis, remeshing, and deformation. However, existing computational representations of surface maps are often difficult to manipulate and optimize, posing discrete problems. Although problem-specific algorithms exist, a general framework for surface maps is still lacking. This paper proposes the use of neural networks as a means to encode surface maps. Neural networks can be easily composed and are differentiable, allowing for the definition of surfaces through atlases, surface-to-surface mappings, and optimization of differentiable objectives related to distortion. The authors demonstrate this approach by representing surfaces using neural maps that approximate a UV parameterization of a 3D model. These neural maps are then composed and optimized to minimize distortion. The results show that this formulation enables straightforward optimization of challenging mapping tasks, including maps between multiple surfaces.
