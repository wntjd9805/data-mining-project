We present NeRD, a Neural 3D Reﬂection Symmetry Detector, which accurately detects the normal direction of objects' mirror planes. Previous methods either assume symmetry or use heuristic-based approaches. NeRD combines learning-based recognition and geometry-based reconstruction to detect symmetry. We use a coarse-to-ﬁne strategy to enumerate symmetry planes and select the best ones using 3D cost volumes. Our method outperforms direct CNN regression on both synthetic and real datasets. Additionally, we show that the detected symmetry improves the performance of tasks like pose estimation and depth map regression significantly. The code for NeRD is publicly available at https://github.com/zhou13/nerd.
