This paper introduces a novel method for pose recognition using cascade Transformers. Existing approaches in this domain can be categorized into heatmap-based and regression-based methods. Heatmap-based methods achieve higher accuracy but often rely on heuristic designs, while regression-based methods have lower accuracy but fewer non-differentiable steps. In this study, we propose an encoder-decoder structure in Transformers for regression-based person and keypoint detection, which requires less heuristic design compared to existing approaches. We also demonstrate the recursive self-attention mechanism in Transformers through the keypoint hypothesis refinement process. Experimental results show competitive performance in pose recognition compared to other regression-based methods.
