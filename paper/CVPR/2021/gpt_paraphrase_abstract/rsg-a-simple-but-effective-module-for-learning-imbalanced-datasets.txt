We propose a solution to the challenge of imbalanced datasets in training deep neural models. Our approach, called the rare-class sample generator (RSG), generates new samples for rare classes during training. RSG offers several advantages: it is easy to use and adaptable to different neural network architectures and loss functions. Importantly, RSG is only used during training, avoiding any additional burden on deep neural networks during testing. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RSG. Leveraging RSG, we achieve competitive results on Imbalanced CIFAR and set new state-of-the-art results on Places-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018.
