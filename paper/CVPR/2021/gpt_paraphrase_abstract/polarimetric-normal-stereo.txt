We present a new approach for extracting per-pixel surface normals using a pair of polarization cameras. Unlike previous methods that utilize polarimetric observations as auxiliary features for matching correspondences, we incorporate them directly into the construction and filtering of a cost volume to directly recover per-pixel surface normals, rather than as byproducts of disparity recovery. Our main idea involves creating a polarimetric cost volume based on the distance defined by the polarimetric observations and the polarization state derived from the surface normal. We employ a belief propagation algorithm to filter this cost volume. This filtering algorithm simultaneously estimates the disparities and surface normals separately while effectively reducing noise in the original polarimetric observations captured by a quad-Bayer polarization camera. Additionally, unlike previous approaches, we account for the polarimetric light reflection caused by mesoscopic surface roughness, which is crucial for accurately capturing its illumination-dependency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on various complex real objects. Our approach provides a straightforward and detailed 3D sensing capability for complex surfaces that do not adhere to Lambertian reflectance.
