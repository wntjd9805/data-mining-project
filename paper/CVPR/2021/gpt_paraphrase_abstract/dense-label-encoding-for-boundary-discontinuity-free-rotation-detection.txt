This paper proposes a classification-based methodology for rotation detection in visual applications such as aerial images, scene text, and faces. Unlike regression-based approaches, the proposed method aims to overcome the boundary discontinuity issue by using classification. Two new techniques are introduced: a new encoding mechanism called Densely Coded Labels (DCL) for angle classification, which improves training speed and detection accuracy, and a loss re-weighting technique called Angle Distance and Aspect Ratio Sensitive Weighting (ADARSW), which enhances detection accuracy for square-like objects. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on large-scale public datasets, and the source code is made available.
