We present a novel approach to address the challenging task of few-shot class-incremental learning, which aims to recognize new classes while not forgetting the old ones. This task requires optimizing the representation and reorganizing prototypes with minimal supervision. Our proposed method includes a random episode selection strategy to adapt the feature representation to different incremental episodes, thereby enhancing its extensibility. Additionally, we introduce a self-promoted prototype refinement mechanism that considers the dependencies among different classes to improve the expression ability of the new classes. To achieve this, we propose a dynamic relation projection module that calculates the relation matrix in a shared embedding space and utilizes it to bootstrap the update of prototypes. Through extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, our method demonstrates superior incremental performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by margins of 13%, 17%, and 11% respectively.
