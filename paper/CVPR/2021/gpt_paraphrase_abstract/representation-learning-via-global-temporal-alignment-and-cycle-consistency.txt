We present a method for representation learning using weak supervision and alignment of temporal sequences. Our approach involves aligning sequences of the same process, such as human actions, by utilizing the global temporal ordering of latent correspondences. We propose a loss function based on scoring the optimal sequence alignment, which is trained on an embedding network. Our loss function incorporates a novel probabilistic path finding perspective of dynamic time warping (DTW) that has three important features: (i) differentiable and contrastive local path routing decisions, (ii) contrastive probabilities for pairwise distances, and (iii) a global cycle-consistency loss to verify correspondences. We evaluate our method on tasks such as fine-grained action classification, few-shot learning, and video synchronization, and observe significant performance improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our temporal alignment framework in 3D pose reconstruction and fine-grained audio/visual retrieval.
