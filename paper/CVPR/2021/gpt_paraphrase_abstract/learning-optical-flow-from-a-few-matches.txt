State-of-the-art neural network models for optical flow estimation currently rely on dense correlation volumes that capture per-pixel displacement. However, the computational and memory requirements associated with these dense correlation volumes limit the efficiency of training and deployment. This study challenges the notion that the dense correlation volume representation is necessary for accurate flow estimation and proposes an alternative approach called Sparse Correlation Volume. The Sparse Correlation Volume is constructed by computing the k closest matches in one feature map for each feature vector in the other feature map and stored in a sparse data structure. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly reduces computational cost and memory usage while maintaining high accuracy compared to previous methods using dense correlation volumes.
