Machine learning models are susceptible to adversarial attacks, which involve making imperceptible changes to the data in order to cause incorrect predictions. While universal attacks have been demonstrated for images, there has been a lack of research on universal attacks for geometric data such as graphs, meshes, and point clouds. This is due to the absence of a common domain where universal perturbations can be defined. However, this paper presents a new perspective by showcasing the existence of universal attacks for geometric data, specifically shapes. The authors propose a computational procedure that operates in the spectral domain, utilizing small perturbations to short eigenvalue sequences. The resulting geometry is synthesized using shape-from-spectrum recovery. These attacks are universal in that they can transfer across different shapes, representations (meshes and point clouds), and can be applied to previously unseen data.
