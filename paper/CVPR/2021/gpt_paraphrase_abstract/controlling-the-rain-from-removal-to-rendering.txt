Current methods for editing rain images typically focus on either removing rain from images or adding rain to rain-free images. This paper presents a novel approach that allows for the bidirectional control of rain intensity, ranging from clear rain-free images to heavy downpour, using only a single rain image as input. Importantly, this method preserves the specific characteristics of the scene, such as the direction, appearance, and distribution of rain. The proposed Rain Intensity Controlling Network (RIC-Net) consists of three sub-networks: a background extraction network, a high-frequency rain-streak elimination network, and a main controlling network. These sub-networks enable continuous interpolation in the deep feature space, thereby allowing for the control of rain intensity across a range of levels. To enhance consistency in orientation and suppress repetitive rain streaks, the authors introduce the HOG loss and autocorrelation loss. Additionally, a decremental learning strategy is proposed, which involves training the network sequentially from heavy downpour to light drizzle images. This strategy improves performance and accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments conducted on both rain datasets and real rain images validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
