Instance shadow detection aims to identify shadow instances along with the objects that cast the shadows. Previous approaches have typically employed a two-stage framework, where the first stage predicts shadow instances, object instances, and associations between shadows and objects using region proposals. A post-processing step is then used to match these predictions and generate the final shadow-object pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel single-stage fully-convolutional network architecture that incorporates a bidirectional relation learning module. This architecture enables us to directly learn the relationships between shadow and object instances in an end-to-end manner. Unlike previous methods, our approach actively explores the internal relationship between shadows and objects, leading to improved pairing between them and overall performance in instance shadow detection. We evaluate our method on a benchmark dataset for instance shadow detection, both quantitatively and visually. The experimental results clearly demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art approach. The provided figure showcases the results of instance shadow detection generated by our method compared to a previous approach called LISA. It is evident that LISA incorrectly matches a large shadow with another horse, whereas our method learns the paired locations more accurately for a better shadow-object pairing.
