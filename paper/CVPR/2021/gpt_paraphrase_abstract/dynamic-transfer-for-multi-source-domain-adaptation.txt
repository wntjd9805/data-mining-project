Recent research in multi-source domain adaptation has focused on developing domain-agnostic models with static parameters. However, this approach faces challenges in handling conflicts across multiple domains and leads to performance degradation in both source and target domains. In this study, we propose a dynamic transfer method to address domain conflicts by adapting model parameters to individual samples. Our key insight is that adapting models across domains can be achieved by adapting models across samples, thereby breaking down source domain barriers and transforming multi-source domains into a single-source domain. This approach simplifies the alignment between source and target domains as it only requires the target domain to align with any part of the union of source domains. Additionally, we discover that dynamic transfer can be effectively modeled by aggregating residual matrices and a static convolution matrix. Experimental results on the DomainNet dataset, a large multi-source domain adaptation dataset, demonstrate that our dynamic transfer method outperforms the current state-of-the-art approach by over 3% without the need for domain labels.
