In this study, the authors introduce a deep learning approach called deep lesion tracker (DLT) for monitoring treatment response in longitudinal studies. The accurate identification of lesions in serial imaging follow-up is crucial for this monitoring procedure, but manual matching of lesions is labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, the authors propose DLT, which uses both appearance- and anatomical-based signals.To incorporate anatomical constraints, the authors propose an anatomical signal encoder, which prevents lesions from being matched with visually similar but incorrect regions. Additionally, the authors present a new formulation for Siamese networks that reduces the computational load of 3D cross-correlation. To increase the variety of images for training, a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy is proposed to train trackers with unpaired images, overcoming data collection barriers.To evaluate the performance of DLT, the authors introduce a lesion tracking benchmark consisting of 3891 lesion pairs from the DeepLesion database. DLT achieves a mean error distance of 7mm in locating lesion centers, which is 5% better than a leading registration algorithm and runs 14 times faster on whole CT volumes. DLT also demonstrates superior performance compared to detector or similarity-learning alternatives. Furthermore, DLT generalizes well on an external clinical test set of 100 longitudinal studies, achieving 88% accuracy.Finally, the authors integrate DLT into an automatic tumor monitoring workflow, where it achieves an accuracy of 85% in assessing lesion treatment responses. This accuracy is only 0.46% lower than that of manual inputs. Overall, the findings suggest that DLT is a promising tool for monitoring treatment response in longitudinal studies, providing accurate lesion identification and efficient processing.
