We introduce a novel approach called METRO (MEsh TRansfOrmer) for reconstructing 3D human pose and mesh vertices from a single image. Unlike existing methods that rely on parametric mesh models, METRO utilizes a transformer encoder to model interactions between vertices and joints, enabling simultaneous output of 3D joint coordinates and mesh vertices. By relaxing mesh topology and allowing the transformer to freely attend between any two vertices, METRO can learn non-local relationships among mesh vertices and joints. Additionally, our method incorporates masked vertex modeling, enhancing its robustness in handling challenging scenarios like partial occlusions. METRO achieves state-of-the-art results for human mesh reconstruction on the Human3.6M and 3DPW datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effectiveness in 3D hand reconstruction by outperforming existing methods on the FreiHAND dataset.
