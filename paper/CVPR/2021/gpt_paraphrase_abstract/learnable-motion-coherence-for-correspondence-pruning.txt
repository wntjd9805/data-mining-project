Motion coherence is a crucial factor in distinguishing between true and false correspondences. However, modeling motion coherence on sparse putative correspondences is challenging due to their uneven distribution. Existing methods for motion coherence are sensitive to parameter settings and struggle with complex motion patterns. To address these limitations, we propose a network called Laplacian Motion Coherence Network (LMCNet) that learns the motion coherence property for correspondence pruning. Our approach involves fitting coherent motions with a smooth function on a graph of correspondences, which allows for a closed-form solution using graph Laplacian. This closed-form solution enables the design of a differentiable layer in a learning framework to capture global motion coherence from putative correspondences. Additionally, we combine the global motion coherence with local coherence, extracted by another local layer, to robustly detect inlier correspondences. Experimental results demonstrate that LMCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in relative camera pose estimation and correspondences pruning of dynamic scenes.
