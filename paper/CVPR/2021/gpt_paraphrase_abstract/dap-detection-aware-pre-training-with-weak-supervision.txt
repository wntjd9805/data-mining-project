This paper introduces a new approach called detection-aware pre-training (DAP) that is designed specifically for object detection tasks. Unlike the commonly used image classification-based pre-training, DAP utilizes weakly-labeled datasets for pre-classification but focuses on improving object detection. By transforming a classification dataset into a detection dataset using a weakly supervised object localization method, DAP directly pre-trains a detector that is capable of predicting bounding boxes. Experimental results on VOC and COCO datasets demonstrate that DAP outperforms traditional classification pre-training in terms of both sample efficiency and convergence speed, especially when there are limited examples in the downstream detection task.
