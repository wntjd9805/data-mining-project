We propose a pseudo 3D auto-correlation network (P3AN) for efficient contextual information capture in image denoising. P3AN utilizes fast 1D convolution for criss-cross interaction, reducing computational resources required. It also maintains feature size and allows easy expansion. By combining 1D convolutions and a lightweight 2D structure, P3AN constructs a pseudo 3D auto-correlation attention block for more discriminative features. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real noisy datasets demonstrate that P3AN outperforms state-of-the-art image denoising methods in terms of quantitative metrics and visual quality evaluation.
