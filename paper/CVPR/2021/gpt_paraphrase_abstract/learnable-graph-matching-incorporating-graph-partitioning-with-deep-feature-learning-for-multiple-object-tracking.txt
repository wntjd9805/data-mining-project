The core of the Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) task lies in data association across frames. This is typically solved using graph-based optimization or deep learning. However, there are several issues with the current paradigm. Firstly, existing methods often neglect the context information between tracklets and intra-frame detections, making it difficult for trackers to handle challenging scenarios like severe occlusion. Secondly, end-to-end association methods solely rely on the data fitting capability of deep neural networks and do not take advantage of optimization-based assignment methods. Lastly, graph-based optimization methods often use a separate neural network for feature extraction, leading to inconsistency between training and inference. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel learnable graph matching method. The relationships between tracklets and intra-frame detections are modeled as a general undirected graph, transforming the association problem into a graph matching between the tracklet graph and detection graph. To ensure end-to-end differentiability, the original graph matching is relaxed into continuous quadratic programming and incorporated into a deep graph network using the implicit function theorem. The proposed method, GM-Tracker, achieves state-of-the-art performance on several standard MOT datasets. The code for GM-Tracker is available at https://github.com/jiaweihe1996/GMTracker.
