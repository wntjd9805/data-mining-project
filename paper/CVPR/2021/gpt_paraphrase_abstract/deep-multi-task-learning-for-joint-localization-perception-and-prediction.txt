In recent years, significant advancements have been made in various aspects of autonomous driving, such as perception, motion forecasting, and motion planning. However, these advancements often rely on the assumption that the car is accurately localized using a high-definition map. This paper challenges this assumption and explores the challenges that arise when localization errors occur in state-of-the-art autonomous systems. Based on our findings, we develop a system that integrates perception, prediction, and localization tasks, allowing for efficient correction of localization errors. Through experiments conducted on a large-scale autonomy dataset, we demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed approach.
