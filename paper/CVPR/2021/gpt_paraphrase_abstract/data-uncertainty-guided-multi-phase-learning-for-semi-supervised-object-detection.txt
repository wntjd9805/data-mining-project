This paper focuses on semi-supervised object detection, which aims to improve upon fully-supervised object detection by utilizing unlabeled images. Existing semi-supervised methods that use pseudo labels suffer from noise and tend to overfit to these noisy labels, resulting in poor learning of different unlabeled knowledge. To address this problem, we propose a multi-phase learning method for semi-supervised object detection that is guided by data uncertainty. We consider different types of unlabeled images based on their difficulty levels and use them in different phases. We combine models from different phases to generate the final results. Our approach involves image uncertainty-guided data selection and region uncertainty-guided RoI re-weighting, which help the detector focus on more reliable knowledge. Experimental results on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches, achieving improvements of more than 3% on VOC and 2% on COCO.
