We introduce Magic Layouts, a technique for analyzing screen-shots or hand-drawn sketches of user interface (UI) layouts. Our main contribution is enhancing existing detectors with a learned structural prior for UI designs, allowing for accurate detection of UI components such as buttons and text boxes. Specifically, we develop a prior for mobile UI layouts that captures common spatial relationships between different UI components. By incorporating this prior into region proposals, we achieve improved performance in parsing UI layouts for both hand-drawn UIs and app screen-shots. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the context of an interactive application used for quickly generating digital prototypes of user experience (UX) designs.
