Over the past few years, there has been significant progress in object tracking. However, the current state-of-the-art trackers are becoming increasingly heavy and expensive, making them less suitable for resource-constrained applications. To address this issue, we propose LightTrack, a new approach that utilizes neural architecture search (NAS) to develop lightweight and efficient object trackers. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that LightTrack is effective in finding trackers that outperform handcrafted state-of-the-art trackers like SiamRPN++ and Ocean, while using significantly fewer model Flops and parameters. Additionally, when deployed on mobile chipsets with limited resources, the discovered trackers run much faster. For instance, on Snapdragon 845 Adreno GPU, LightTrack runs 12 times faster than Ocean, using 13 times fewer parameters and 38 times fewer Flops. These improvements have the potential to bridge the gap between academic models and industrial deployments in object tracking tasks. LightTrack is publicly available for use.
