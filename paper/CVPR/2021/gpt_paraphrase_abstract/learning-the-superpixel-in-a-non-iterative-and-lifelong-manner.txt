We propose a new method called LNS-Net for superpixel segmentation, which aims to overcome the limitations of existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approaches. These approaches rely on manual labels and require excessive computation resources, making them less flexible compared to traditional unsupervised segmentation methods. LNS-Net redefines CNN-based superpixel segmentation as a lifelong clustering task and eliminates the need for manual labels. It achieves this by using a lightweight feature embedder that efficiently generates cluster-friendly features. These features are used to automatically assign seed nodes to cluster pixels in a non-iterative manner. LNS-Net also incorporates sequential lifelong learning by adjusting the gradient of weight based on both channel and spatial context, preventing overfitting. Experimental results demonstrate that LNS-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on three benchmark datasets, while having nearly ten times lower complexity.
