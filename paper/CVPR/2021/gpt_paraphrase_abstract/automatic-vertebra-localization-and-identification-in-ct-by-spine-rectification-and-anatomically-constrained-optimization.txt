Accurate localization and identification of vertebrae are crucial in diagnosing spine disorders and planning surgeries. However, this task is challenging due to varying pathologies and imaging conditions. In this study, a robust and accurate method is proposed that utilizes anatomical knowledge of the spine to improve vertebral localization and identification. A model is trained to produce activation maps of vertebral centers, which are then resampled along the spine centerline to create spine-rectified activation maps. These maps are aggregated into 1-D activation signals. An optimization module is introduced to search for optimal vertebra centers, considering the distance between vertebrae and the consecutive vertebral indices. The proposed method achieves a state-of-the-art identification rate of 97.4% on a benchmark dataset of highly pathological CT images. It outperforms the best competing method by reducing the relative identification error rate by half.
