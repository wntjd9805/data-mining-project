We present a new technique for efficiently capturing the shape and varying reflectance of 3D objects using polarization cues. Unlike previous methods that relied on polarization to estimate material or object appearance under specific constraints, our approach combines polarization imaging with deep learning to accurately estimate the shape (surface normals and depth) and spatially varying bidirectional reflectance distribution function (SVBRDF) of 3D objects using a single-view polarization image captured under frontal flash illumination. In addition to the polarization images, our deep network is provided with additional cues related to shape and reflectance, including a normalized Stokes map and an estimate of diffuse color. We also propose modifications to the network architecture and training loss to further improve the quality of the results. Our approach outperforms recent works that use deep learning with flash illumination, as demonstrated in our experiments.
