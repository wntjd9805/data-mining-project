Monocular 3D prediction is a key problem in 3D vision. Recent advancements in deep learning have made significant progress in this area. However, current approaches mainly focus on predicting depth and normals, neglecting the potential of leveraging the underlying geometric structures of the 3D environment. This study presents StruMonoNet, a novel approach that enhances pixel-wise predictions by detecting and enforcing a planar structure. StruMonoNet introduces a hybrid representation that combines visual features with a surfel representation for plane prediction. This unique formulation allows for the incorporation of both visual feature learning and geometric representations, enabling the detection of various relationships between planes such as adjacency, perpendicularity, and parallelism. These relationships greatly contribute to accurate dense 3D prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that StruMonoNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets such as NYUv2 and ScanNet. This highlights the effectiveness of incorporating geometric relations in monocular 3D prediction tasks.
