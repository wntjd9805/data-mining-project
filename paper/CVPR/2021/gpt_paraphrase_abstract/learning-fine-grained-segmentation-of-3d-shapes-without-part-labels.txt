Learning-based 3D shape segmentation is often approached as a semantic labeling problem, assuming that all parts of training shapes are labeled with specific tags. However, this assumption is not practical for achieving fine-grained segmentation. While most pre-existing CAD models consist of detailed parts, they lack semantic tags, making the labeling process for these fine-grained parts extremely laborious. In order to address this challenge, we propose a deep clustering approach that learns part priors from a shape dataset containing fine-grained segmentation but no part labels. Our method involves modeling the clustering priors of points using a similarity matrix and minimizing a novel low rank loss to achieve part segmentation for point sampled 3D shapes. To handle densely sampled point sets, we employ a divide-and-conquer strategy by partitioning the large point set into blocks and segmenting each block using a deep-clustering-based part prior network trained in a category-agnostic manner. We then train a graph convolution network to merge the segments of all blocks and generate the final segmentation result. Our approach is evaluated using a challenging benchmark for fine-grained segmentation and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance.
