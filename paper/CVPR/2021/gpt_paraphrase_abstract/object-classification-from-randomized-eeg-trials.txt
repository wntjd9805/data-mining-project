Recent findings indicate that the feasibility of classifying objects based on human brain activity measured through EEG is highly limited. Previous studies were flawed due to a confounding factor between stimulus class and duration of the experiment. An attempt to address this confound through randomized trials failed to achieve statistically significant results when compared to the original experiments. In this study, we employ various state-of-the-art methods to classify objects from EEG data, using a dataset that is 20 times larger than previous studies. The dataset consists of 1,000 stimulus presentations from each of forty classes, collected from a single subject. To our knowledge, this is the largest EEG data collection effort from a single subject and represents the limits of what is feasible. Our results show a classification accuracy slightly above chance, which is statistically significant. Additionally, we investigate how the choice of classifier, amount of training data, and number of classes affect the accuracy. The fact that we reached the limits of data collection with only slightly above-chance performance suggests that previous literature has greatly overestimated the feasibility of object classification from EEG.
