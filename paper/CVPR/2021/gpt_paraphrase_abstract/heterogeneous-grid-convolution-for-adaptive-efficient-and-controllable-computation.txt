This paper introduces a new method for convolutions on a heterogeneous grid, which creates a graph-based representation of images. This approach takes advantage of the diversity in image content to enable adaptive, efficient, and controllable computations within a convolutional architecture. The method involves constructing a data-adaptive graph structure from a convolutional layer using a differentiable clustering technique. It then pools the features onto the graph, performs a unique direction-aware graph convolution, and unpool the features back to the convolutional layer. By incorporating this module, the paper proposes heterogeneous grid convolutional networks that are both highly efficient and a significant extension of existing architectures. The proposed approach is evaluated on four image understanding tasks: semantic segmentation, object localization, road extraction, and salient object detection. The results show that the method is effective for three of the tasks, with semantic segmentation achieving more than 90% reduction in floating-point operations compared to a strong baseline, and road extraction achieving state-of-the-art performance. The authors plan to provide their code, model, and data for further research.
