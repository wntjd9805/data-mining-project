Image and video descriptors play a crucial role in computer vision and related fields such as mobile robotics. These descriptors, both hand-crafted and learned, are typically numerical vectors with a potentially large number of dimensions. However, practical considerations like memory usage and time for comparisons necessitate the development of compact representations. In this study, we propose the use of hyperdimensional computing (HDC) as a method to combine information from multiple vectors into a single vector of the same dimensionality. HDC is a well-known technique that enables symbolic processing with distributed representations in high-dimensional vectors. We present an HDC implementation specifically designed for processing the output of existing and future image descriptors, including those based on deep learning. Our approach allows for the efficient processing of descriptors along with additional knowledge through simple and fast vector operations. As a concrete result, we introduce a novel HDC-based approach to aggregating a set of local image descriptors along with their corresponding image positions into a single holistic descriptor. Through a series of standard place recognition experiments in mobile robotics, we compare our approach to available holistic descriptors and aggregation methods. The results show an average performance improvement of 20% and a more than two-fold improvement in worst-case performance compared to the runner-up method.
