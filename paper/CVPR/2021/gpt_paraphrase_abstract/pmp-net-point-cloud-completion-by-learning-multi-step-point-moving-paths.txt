This paper addresses the problem of point cloud completion, which involves predicting the missing part of an incomplete 3D shape. Existing approaches generate a complete point cloud from the incomplete one, but struggle to capture the detailed topology and structure of discrete points due to the unordered nature of point clouds. To overcome this limitation, the authors propose a new perspective by formulating the completion task as a point cloud deformation process. They introduce a neural network called PMP-Net, inspired by the behavior of an earth mover, which moves each point of the incomplete input to complete the point cloud while minimizing the total distance of point moving paths (PMP). By predicting a unique point moving path for each point based on the constraint of total point moving distances, PMP-Net establishes a strict and unique correspondence on the point-level, enhancing the quality of the predicted complete shape. The authors conduct comprehensive experiments on Completion3D and PCN datasets, demonstrating the superiority of their approach over existing point cloud completion methods.
