Given a 3D object, kinematic motion prediction aims to identify the mobile parts as well as the corresponding mo-tion parameters. Due to the large variations in both topo-logical structure and geometric details of 3D objects, this remains a challenging task and the lack of large scale la-beled data also constrain the performance of deep learning based approaches. In this paper, we tackle the task of object kinematic motion prediction problem in a semi-weakly su-pervised manner. Our key observations are two-fold. First, although 3D dataset with fully annotated motion labels is limited, there are existing datasets and methods for object part semantic segmentation at large scale. Second, seman-tic part segmentation and mobile part segmentation is not always consistent but it is possible to detect the mobile parts from the underlying 3D structure. Towards this end, we pro-pose a graph neural network to learn the map between hier-archical part-level segmentation and mobile parts parame-ters, which are further refined based on geometric align-ment. This network can be first trained on PartNet-Mobility dataset with fully labeled mobility information and then ap-plied on PartNet dataset with fine-grained and hierarchical part-level segmentation. The network predictions yield a large scale of 3D objects with pseudo labeled mobility in-formation and can further be used for weakly-supervised learning with pre-existing segmentation. Our experiments show there are significant performance boosts with the aug-mented data for previous method designed for kinematic motion prediction on 3D partial scans.
