However, conven-tional optics-based motion capture systems are not suited for simultaneously capturing human movements and com-plex scenes. The lack of rich contextual 3D human motion datasets presents a roadblock to creating high-quality gen-erative human motion models. We propose a novel motion acquisition system in which the actor perceives and oper-ates in a highly contextual virtual world while being mo-tion captured in the real world. Our system enables rapid collection of high-quality human motion in highly diverse scenes, without the concern of occlusion or the need for physical scene construction in the real world. We presentCIRCLE, a dataset containing 10 hours of full-body reach-ing motion from 5 subjects across nine scenes, paired with ego-centric information of the environment represented in various forms, such as RGBD videos. We use this dataset to train a model that generates human motion conditioned on scene information. Leveraging our dataset, the model learns to use ego-centric scene information to achieve non-trivial reaching tasks in the context of complex 3D scenes.
