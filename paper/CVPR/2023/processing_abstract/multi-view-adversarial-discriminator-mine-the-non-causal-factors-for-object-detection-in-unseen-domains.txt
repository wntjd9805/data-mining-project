Domain shift degrades the performance of object de-tection models in practical applications. To alleviate the influence of domain shift, plenty of previous work try to decouple and learn the domain-invariant (common) fea-tures from source domains via domain adversarial learn-ing (DAL). However, inspired by causal mechanisms, we find that previous methods ignore the implicit insignificant non-causal factors hidden in the common features. This is mainly due to the single-view nature of DAL. In this work, we present an idea to remove non-causal factors from com-mon features by multi-view adversarial training on source domains, because we observe that such insignificant non-causal factors may still be significant in other latent spaces (views) due to the multi-mode structure of data. To sum-marize, we propose a Multi-view Adversarial Discriminator (MAD) based domain generalization model, consisting of aSpurious Correlations Generator (SCG) that increases the diversity of source domain by random augmentation and aMulti-View Domain Classifier (MVDC) that maps features to multiple latent spaces, such that the non-causal factors are removed and the domain-invariant features are purified.Extensive experiments on six benchmarks show our MAD obtains state-of-the-art performance.
