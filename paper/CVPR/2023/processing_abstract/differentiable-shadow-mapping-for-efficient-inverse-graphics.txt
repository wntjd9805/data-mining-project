We show how shadows can be efficiently generated in differentiable rendering of triangle meshes. Our central ob-servation is that pre-filtered shadow mapping, a technique for approximating shadows based on rendering from the perspective of a light, can be combined with existing dif-ferentiable rasterizers to yield differentiable visibility infor-mation. We demonstrate at several inverse graphics prob-lems that differentiable shadow maps are orders of mag-nitude faster than differentiable light transport simulation with similar accuracy â€“ while differentiable rasterization without shadows often fails to converge.
