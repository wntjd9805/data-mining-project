High-fidelity radiance recovery plays a crucial role in scene information reconstruction and understanding. Con-ventional cameras suffer from limited sensitivity in dynamic range, bit depth, and spectral response, etc. In this paper, we propose to use event cameras with bio-inspired silicon sensors, which are sensitive to radiance changes, to re-cover precise radiance values. We reveal that, under active lighting conditions, the transient frequency of event signals triggering linearly reflects the radiance value. We propose an innovative method to convert the high temporal reso-lution of event signals into precise radiance values. The precise radiance values yields several capabilities in image analysis. We demonstrate the feasibility of recovering radi-ance values solely from the transient event frequency (TEF) through multiple experiments.
