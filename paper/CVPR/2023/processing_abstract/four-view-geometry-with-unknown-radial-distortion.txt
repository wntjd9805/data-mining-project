We present novel solutions to previously unsolved prob-lems of relative pose estimation from images whose calibra-tion parameters, namely focal lengths and radial distortion, are unknown. Our approach enables metric reconstruction without modeling these parameters. The minimal case for reconstruction requires 13 points in 4 views for both the calibrated and uncalibrated cameras. We describe and im-plement the first solution to these minimal problems. In the calibrated case, this may be modeled as a polynomial sys-tem of equations with 3584 solutions. Despite the apparent intractability, the problem decomposes spectacularly. Each solution falls into a Euclidean symmetry class of size 16, and we can estimate 224 class representatives by solving a sequence of three subproblems with 28, 2, and 4 solutions.We highlight the relationship between internal constraints on the radial quadrifocal tensor and the relations among the principal minors of a 4 Ã— 4 matrix. We also address the case of 4 upright cameras, where 7 points are minimal. Fi-nally, we evaluate our approach on simulated and real data and benchmark against previous calibration-free solutions, and show that our method provides an efficient startup for an SfM pipeline with radial cameras.*Supported by EU RDF IMPACT No. CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/15 003/0000468 and EU H2020 No. 871245 SPRING projects.
