Relighting an outdoor scene is challenging due to theIntrinsic diverse illuminations and salient cast shadows. image decomposition on outdoor photo collections could partly solve this problem by weakly supervised labels with albedo and normal consistency from multi-view stereo. With neural radiance fields (NeRF), editing the appearance code could produce more realistic results without interpreting the outdoor scene image formation explicitly. This paper proposes to complement the intrinsic estimation from vol-ume rendering using NeRF and from inversing the photo-metric image formation model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The former produces richer and more reliable pseudo labels (cast shadows and sky appearances in addition to albedo and normal) for training the latter to predict interpretable and editable lighting parameters via a single-image prediction pipeline. We demonstrate the ad-vantages of our method for both intrinsic image decompo-sition and relighting for various real outdoor scenes.
