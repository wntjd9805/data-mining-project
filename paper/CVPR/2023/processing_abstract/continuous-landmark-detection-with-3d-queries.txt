Neural networks for facial landmark detection are noto-riously limited to a ﬁxed set of landmarks in a dedicated layout, which must be speciﬁed at training time. Dedi-cated datasets must also be hand-annotated with the cor-responding landmark conﬁguration for training. We pro-pose the ﬁrst facial landmark detection network that can predict continuous, unlimited landmarks, allowing to spec-ify the number and location of the desired landmarks at in-ference time. Our method combines a simple image feature extractor with a queried landmark predictor, and the user can specify any continuous query points relative to a 3D template face mesh as input. As it is not tied to a ﬁxed set of landmarks, our method is able to leverage all pre-existing 2D landmark datasets for training, even if they have incon-sistent landmark conﬁgurations. As a result, we present a very powerful facial landmark detector that can be trained once, and can be used readily for numerous applications like 3D face reconstruction, arbitrary face segmentation, and is even compatible with helmeted mounted cameras, and therefore could vastly simplify face tracking workﬂows for media and entertainment applications.
