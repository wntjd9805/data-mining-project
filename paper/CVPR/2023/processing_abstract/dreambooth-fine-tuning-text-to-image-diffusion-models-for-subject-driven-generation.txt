Large text-to-image models achieved a remarkable leap in the evolution of AI, enabling high-quality and diverse synthesis of images from a given text prompt. However, these models lack the ability to mimic the appearance of subjects in a given reference set and synthesize novel rendi-tions of them in different contexts. In this work, we present a new approach for “personalization” of text-to-image dif-fusion models. Given as input just a few images of a sub-ject, we fine-tune a pretrained text-to-image model such that it learns to bind a unique identifier with that specific sub-ject. Once the subject is embedded in the output domain of the model, the unique identifier can be used to synthesize novel photorealistic images of the subject contextualized in different scenes. By leveraging the semantic prior embed-ded in the model with a new autogenous class-specific prior preservation loss, our technique enables synthesizing the subject in diverse scenes, poses, views and lighting condi-tions that do not appear in the reference images. We ap-ply our technique to several previously-unassailable tasks, including subject recontextualization, text-guided view syn-thesis, and artistic rendering, all while preserving the sub-ject’s key features. We also provide a new dataset and eval-uation protocol for this new task of subject-driven genera-tion.
