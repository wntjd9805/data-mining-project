Rolling shutter correction (RSC) is becoming increas-ingly popular for RS cameras that are widely used in com-mercial and industrial applications. Despite the promis-ing performance, existing RSC methods typically employ a two-stage network structure that ignores intrinsic infor-mation interactions and hinders fast inference. In this pa-per, we propose a single-stage encoder-decoder-based net-work, named JAMNet, for efﬁcient RSC. It ﬁrst extracts pyramid features from consecutive RS inputs, and then si-multaneously reﬁnes the two complementary information (i.e., global shutter appearance and undistortion motionﬁeld) to achieve mutual promotion in a joint learning de-coder. To inject sufﬁcient motion cues for guiding joint learning, we introduce a transformer-based motion embed-ding module and propose to pass hidden states across pyra-mid levels. Moreover, we present a new data augmenta-tion strategy “vertical ﬂip + inverse order” to release the potential of the RSC datasets. Experiments on various benchmarks show that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, especially with a 4.7 dB PSNR leap on real-world RSC.
