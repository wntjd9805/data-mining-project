The causality relation modeling remains a challenging task for group activity recognition. The causality relations describe the influence on the centric actor (effect actor) from its correlative actors (cause actors). Most existing graph models focus on learning the actor relation with syn-chronous temporal features, which is insufficient to deal with the causality relation with asynchronous temporal fea-tures. In this paper, we propose an Actor-Centric Causal-ity Graph Model, which learns the asynchronous temporal causality relation with three modules, i.e., an asynchronous temporal causality relation detection module, a causality feature fusion module, and a causality relation graph infer-ence module. First, given a centric actor and its correlative actor, we analyze their influences to detect causality rela-tion. We estimate the self influence of the centric actor with self regression. We estimate the correlative influence from the correlative actor to the centric actor with correlative regression, which uses asynchronous features at different timestamps. Second, we synchronize the two action features by estimating the temporal delay between the cause action and the effect action. The synchronized features are used to enhance the feature of the effect action with a channel-wise fusion. Third, we describe the nodes (actors) with causal-ity features and learn the edges by fusing the causality re-lation with the appearance relation and distance relation.The causality relation graph inference provides crucial fea-tures of effect action, which are complementary to the base model using synchronous relation inference. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Volleyball dataset and Collective Activity dataset.
