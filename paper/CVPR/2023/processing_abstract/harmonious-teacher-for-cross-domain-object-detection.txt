Self-training approaches recently achieved promising re-sults in cross-domain object detection, where people it-eratively generate pseudo labels for unlabeled target do-main samples with a model, and select high-confidence samples to refine the model. In this work, we reveal that the consistency of classification and localization predic-tions are crucial to measure the quality of pseudo labels, and propose a new Harmonious Teacher approach to im-prove the self-training for cross-domain object detection.In particular, we first propose to enhance the quality of pseudo labels by regularizing the consistency of the clas-sification and localization scores when training the detec-tion model. The consistency losses are defined for both labeled source samples and the unlabeled target samples.Then, we further remold the traditional sample selection method by a sample reweighing strategy based on the con-sistency of classification and localization scores to improve the ranking of predictions. This allows us to fully ex-ploit all instance predictions from the target domain with-out abandoning valuable hard examples. Without bells and whistles, our method shows superior performance in various cross-domain scenarios compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, which validates the effectiveness of our Harmonious Teacher.
