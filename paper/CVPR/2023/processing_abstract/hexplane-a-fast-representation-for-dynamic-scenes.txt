Modeling and re-rendering dynamic 3D scenes is a chal-lenging task in 3D vision. Prior approaches build on NeRF and rely on implicit representations. This is slow since it re-quires many MLP evaluations, constraining real-world ap-plications. We show that dynamic 3D scenes can be ex-plicitly represented by six planes of learned features, lead-ing to an elegant solution we call HexPlane. A HexPlane computes features for points in spacetime by fusing vec-tors extracted from each plane, which is highly efficient.Pairing a HexPlane with a tiny MLP to regress output col-ors and training via volume rendering gives impressive re-sults for novel view synthesis on dynamic scenes, match-ing the image quality of prior work but reducing training time by more than 100Ã—. Extensive ablations confirm ourHexPlane design and show that it is robust to different fea-ture fusion mechanisms, coordinate systems, and decoding mechanisms. HexPlane is a simple and effective solution for representing 4D volumes, and we hope they can broadly contribute to modeling spacetime for dynamic 3D scenes.1
