Learnable prompt:  “? ? ? ? [class_name]”Semi-supervised class-conditional image synthesis is typically performed by inferring and injecting class labels into a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).The supervision in the form of class identity may be inade-quate to model classes with diverse visual appearances. In this paper, we propose a Learnable Cluster Prompt-basedGAN (LCP-GAN) to capture class-wise characteristics and intra-class variation factors with a broader source of su-pervision. To exploit partially labeled data, we perform soft partitioning on each class, and explore the possibility of as-sociating intra-class clusters with learnable visual concepts in the feature space of a pre-trained language-vision model, e.g., CLIP. For class-conditional image generation, we de-sign a cluster-conditional generator by injecting a combi-nation of intra-class cluster label embeddings, and further incorporate a real-fake classiﬁcation head on top of CLIP to distinguish real instances from the synthesized ones, con-ditioned on the learnable cluster prompts. This signiﬁcant-ly strengthens the generator with more semantic language supervision. LCP-GAN not only possesses superior gen-eration capability but also matches the performance of the fully supervised version of the base models: BigGAN andStyleGAN2-ADA, on multiple standard benchmarks.
