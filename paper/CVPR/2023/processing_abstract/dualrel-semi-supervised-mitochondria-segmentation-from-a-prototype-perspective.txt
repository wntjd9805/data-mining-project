Automatic mitochondria segmentation enjoys great pop-ularity with the development of deep learning. However, existing methods rely heavily on the labor-intensive manual gathering by experienced domain experts. And naively ap-plying semi-supervised segmentation methods in the natural image field to mitigate the labeling cost is undesirable. In this work, we analyze the gap between mitochondrial im-ages and natural images and rethink how to achieve effec-tive semi-supervised mitochondria segmentation, from the perspective of reliable prototype-level supervision. We pro-pose a novel end-to-end dual-reliable (DualRel) network, including a reliable pixel aggregation module and a reliable prototype selection module. The proposed DualRel enjoys several merits. First, to learn the prototypes well without any explicit supervision, we carefully design the referential correlation to rectify the direct pairwise correlation. Sec-ond, the reliable prototype selection module is responsible for further evaluating the reliability of prototypes in con-structing prototype-level consistency regularization. Exten-sive experimental results on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation methods. Im-portantly, with extremely few samples used for training, Du-alRel is also on par with current state-of-the-art fully super-vised methods.
