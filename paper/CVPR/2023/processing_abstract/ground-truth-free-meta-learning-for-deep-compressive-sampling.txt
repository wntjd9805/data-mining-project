needs to solve an under-determined system:Compressive sampling (CS) is an efﬁcient technique for imaging. This paper proposes a ground-truth (GT) free meta-learning method for CS, which leverages both ex-ternal and internal deep learning for unsupervised high-quality image reconstruction. The proposed method ﬁrst trains a deep neural network (NN) via external meta-learning using only CS measurements, and then efﬁciently adapts the trained model to a test sample for exploit-ing sample-speciﬁc internal characteristic for performance gain. The meta-learning and model adaptation are built on an improved Stein’s unbiased risk estimator (iSURE) that provides efﬁcient computation and effective guidance for accurate prediction in the range space of the adjoint of the measurement matrix. To improve the learning and adap-tion on the null space of the measurement matrix, a modi-ﬁed model-agnostic meta-learning scheme and a null-space consistency loss are proposed. In addition, a bias tuning scheme for unrolling NNs is introduced for further acceler-ation of model adaption. Experimental results have demon-strated that the proposed GT-free method performs well and can even compete with supervised methods.
