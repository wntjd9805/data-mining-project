Densely annotating LiDAR point clouds is costly, which often restrains the scalability of fully-supervised learning methods. In this work, we study the underexplored semi-supervised learning (SSL) in LiDAR semantic segmenta-tion. Our core idea is to leverage the strong spatial cues of LiDAR point clouds to better exploit unlabeled data. We propose LaserMix to mix laser beams from different Li-DAR scans and then encourage the model to make con-sistent and confident predictions before and after mixing.Our framework has three appealing properties. 1) Generic:LaserMix is agnostic to LiDAR representations (e.g., range view and voxel), and hence our SSL framework can be uni-versally applied. 2) Statistically grounded: We provide a detailed analysis to theoretically explain the applicabil-ity of the proposed framework. 3) Effective: Comprehen-sive experimental analysis on popular LiDAR segmentation (∗) Lingdong and Jiawei contributed equally to this work.

Notably, we achieve competitive results over fully-supervised coun-terparts with 2× to 5× fewer labels and improve the supervised-only baseline significantly by relatively 10.8%.We hope this concise yet high-performing framework could facilitate future research in semi-supervised LiDAR seg-mentation.
