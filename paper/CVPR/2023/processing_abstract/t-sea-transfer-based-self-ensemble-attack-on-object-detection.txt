Compared to query-based black-box attacks, transfer-based black-box attacks do not require any information of the attacked models, which ensures their secrecy. However, most existing transfer-based approaches rely on ensembling multiple models to boost the attack transferability, which is time- and resource-intensive, not to mention the difficulty of obtaining diverse models on the same task. To address this limitation, in this work, we focus on the single-model transfer-based black-box attack on object detection, utiliz-ing only one model to achieve a high-transferability ad-versarial attack on multiple black-box detectors. Specifi-cally, we first make observations on the patch optimization process of the existing method and propose an enhanced attack framework by slightly adjusting its training strate-gies. Then, we analogize patch optimization with regular model optimization, proposing a series of self-ensemble ap-proaches on the input data, the attacked model, and the ad-versarial patch to efficiently make use of the limited infor-mation and prevent the patch from overfitting. The experi-mental results show that the proposed framework can be ap-plied with multiple classical base attack methods (e.g., PGD and MIM) to greatly improve the black-box transferability of the well-optimized patch on multiple mainstream detec-tors, meanwhile boosting white-box performance.
