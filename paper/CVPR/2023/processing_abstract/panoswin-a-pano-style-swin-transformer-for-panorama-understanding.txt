In panorama understanding, the widely used equirectan-gular projection (ERP) entails boundary discontinuity and spatial distortion. It severely deteriorates the conventionalCNNs and vision Transformers on panoramas. In this pa-per, we propose a simple yet effective architecture namedPanoSwin to learn panorama representations with ERP. To deal with the challenges brought by equirectangular projec-tion, we explore a pano-style shift windowing scheme and novel pitch attention to address the boundary discontinu-ity and the spatial distortion, respectively. Besides, based on spherical distance and Cartesian coordinates, we adapt absolute positional embeddings and relative positional bi-ases for panoramas to enhance panoramic geometry infor-mation. Realizing that planar image understanding might share some common knowledge with panorama understand-ing, we devise a novel two-stage learning framework to facilitate knowledge transfer from the planar images to panoramas. We conduct experiments against the state-of-the-art on various panoramic tasks, i.e., panoramic object detection, panoramic classification, and panoramic layout estimation. The experimental results demonstrate the effec-tiveness of PanoSwin in panorama understanding.
