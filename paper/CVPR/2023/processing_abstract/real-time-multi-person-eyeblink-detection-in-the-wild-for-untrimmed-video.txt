termed MPEblink thatReal-time eyeblink detection in the wild can widely serve for fatigue detection, face anti-spoofing, emotion analysis, etc. The existing research efforts generally focus on single-person cases towards trimmed video. However, multi-person scenario within untrimmed videos is also impor-tant for practical applications, which has not been well concerned yet. To address this, we shed light on this re-search field for the first time with essential contributions on dataset, theory, and practices. In particular, a large-scale dataset involves 686 untrimmed videos with 8748 eyeblink events is proposed under multi-person conditions. The samples are captured from uncon-strained films to reveal “in the wild” characteristics. Mean-while, a real-time multi-person eyeblink detection method is also proposed. Being different from the existing counter-parts, our proposition runs in a one-stage spatio-temporal way with end-to-end learning capacity. Specifically, it si-multaneously addresses the sub-tasks of face detection, face tracking, and human instance-level eyeblink detection. This paradigm holds 2 main advantages: (1) eyeblink features can be facilitated via the face’s global context (e.g., head pose and illumination condition) with joint optimization and interaction, and (2) addressing these sub-tasks in par-allel instead of sequential manner can save time remarkably to meet the real-time running requirement. Experiments onMPEblink verify the essential challenges of real-time multi-person eyeblink detection in the wild for untrimmed video.Our method also outperforms existing approaches by large margins and with a high inference speed.†Yang Xiao is corresponding author (Yang Xiao@hust.edu.cn).Figure 1.
