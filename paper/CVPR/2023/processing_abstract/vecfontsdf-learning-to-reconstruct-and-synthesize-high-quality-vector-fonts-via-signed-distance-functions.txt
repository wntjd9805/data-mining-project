Font design is of vital importance in the digital con-tent design and modern printing industry. Developing al-gorithms capable of automatically synthesizing vector fonts can significantly facilitate the font design process. How-ever, existing methods mainly concentrate on raster image generation, and only a few approaches can directly syn-thesize vector fonts. This paper proposes an end-to-end trainable method, VecFontSDF, to reconstruct and synthe-size high-quality vector fonts using signed distance func-tions (SDFs). Specifically, based on the proposed SDF-based implicit shape representation, VecFontSDF learns to model each glyph as shape primitives enclosed by sev-eral parabolic curves, which can be precisely converted to quadratic BÂ´ezier curves that are widely used in vec-tor font products. In this manner, most image generation methods can be easily extended to synthesize vector fonts.Qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on a publicly-available dataset demonstrate that our method ob-tains high-quality results on several tasks, including vector font reconstruction, interpolation, and few-shot vector font synthesis, markedly outperforming the state of the art.
