Federated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) recon-struction enables multiple hospitals to collaborate dis-tributedly without aggregating local data, thereby protect-ing patient privacy. However, the data heterogeneity caused by different MRI protocols, insufficient local training data, and limited communication bandwidth inevitably impair global model convergence and updating. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, FedPR, to learn federated vi-sual prompts in the null space of global prompt for MRI reconstruction. FedPR is a new federated paradigm that adopts a powerful pre-trained model while only learning and communicating the prompts with few learnable param-eters, thereby significantly reducing communication costs and achieving competitive performance on limited local data. Moreover, to deal with catastrophic forgetting caused by data heterogeneity, FedPR also updates efficient feder-ated visual prompts that project the local prompts into an approximate null space of the global prompt, thereby sup-pressing the interference of gradients on the server perfor-mance. Extensive experiments on federated MRI show thatFedPR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art FL algo-rithms with < 6% of communication costs when given the limited amount of local training data.
