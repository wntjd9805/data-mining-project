PoseBobcutSmileColorWe present a novel image inversion framework and a training pipeline to achieve high-fidelity image inversionInverting real images with high-quality attribute editing. into StyleGANâ€™s latent space is an extensively studied prob-lem, yet the trade-off between the image reconstruction fi-delity and image editing quality remains an open challenge.The low-rate latent spaces are limited in their expressive-ness power for high-fidelity reconstruction. On the other hand, high-rate latent spaces result in degradation in edit-ing quality. In this work, to achieve high-fidelity inversion, we learn residual features in higher latent codes that lower latent codes were not able to encode. This enables preserv-ing image details in reconstruction. To achieve high-quality editing, we learn how to transform the residual features for adapting to manipulations in latent codes. We train the framework to extract residual features and transform them via a novel architecture pipeline and cycle consistency losses. We run extensive experiments and compare our method with state-of-the-art inversion methods. Qualitative metrics and visual comparisons show significant improve-ments.
