Recently, tampered text detection in document image has attracted increasingly attention due to its essential role on information security. However, detecting visually consis-tent tampered text in photographed document images is still a main challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel frame-work to capture more fine-grained clues in complex scenar-ios for tampered text detection, termed as Document Tam-pering Detector (DTD), which consists of a Frequency Per-ception Head (FPH) to compensate the deficiencies caused by the inconspicuous visual features, and a Multi-view It-erative Decoder (MID) for fully utilizing the information of features in different scales.In addition, we design a new training paradigm, termed as Curriculum Learning forTampering Detection (CLTD), which can address the con-fusion during the training procedure and thus to improve the robustness for image compression and the ability to generalize. To further facilitate the tampered text detec-tion in document images, we construct a large-scale docu-ment image dataset, termed as DocTamper, which contains 170,000 document images of various types. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed DTD outperforms previous state-of-the-art by 9.2%, 26.3% and 12.3% in terms ofF-measure on the DocTamper testing set, and the cross-domain testing sets of DocTamper-FCD and DocTamper-SCD, respectively. Codes and dataset will be available at https://github.com/qcf-568/DocTamper.
