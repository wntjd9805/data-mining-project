Predicting the future motion of road agents is a criti-cal task in an autonomous driving pipeline. In this work, we address the problem of generating a set of scene-level, or joint, future trajectory predictions in multi-agent driv-ing scenarios. To this end, we propose FJMP, a FactorizedJoint Motion Prediction framework for multi-agent interac-tive driving scenarios. FJMP models the future scene in-teraction dynamics as a sparse directed interaction graph, where edges denote explicit interactions between agents.We then prune the graph into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and decompose the joint prediction task into a se-quence of marginal and conditional predictions according to the partial ordering of the DAG, where joint future tra-jectories are decoded using a directed acyclic graph neural network (DAGNN). We conduct experiments on the INTER-ACTION and Argoverse 2 datasets and demonstrate thatFJMP produces more accurate and scene-consistent joint trajectory predictions than non-factorized approaches, es-pecially on the most interactive and kinematically interest-ing agents. FJMP ranks 1st on the multi-agent test leader-board of the INTERACTION dataset.
