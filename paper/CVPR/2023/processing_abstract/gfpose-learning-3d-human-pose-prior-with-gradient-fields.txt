Learning 3D human pose prior is essential to human-centered AI. Here, we present GFPose, a versatile frame-work to model plausible 3D human poses for various appli-cations. At the core of GFPose is a time-dependent score network, which estimates the gradient on each body joint and progressively denoises the perturbed 3D human pose to match a given task specification. During the denois-ing process, GFPose implicitly incorporates pose priors in gradients and unifies various discriminative and genera-tive tasks in an elegant framework. Despite the simplic-ity, GFPose demonstrates great potential in several down-stream tasks. Our experiments empirically show that 1) as a multi-hypothesis pose estimator, GFPose outperforms exist-ing SOTAs by 20% on Human3.6M dataset. 2) as a single-hypothesis pose estimator, GFPose achieves comparable re-sults to deterministic SOTAs, even with a vanilla backbone. 3) GFPose is able to produce diverse and realistic samples in pose denoising, completion and generation tasks.1
