Semi-supervised video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical task in the intelligent surveillance system. How-ever, an essential type of anomaly in VAD named scene-dependent anomaly has not received the attention of re-searchers. Moreover, there is no research investigating anomaly anticipation, a more significant task for preventing the occurrence of anomalous events. To this end, we pro-pose a new comprehensive dataset, NWPU Campus, con-taining 43 scenes, 28 classes of abnormal events, and 16 hours of videos. At present, it is the largest semi-supervisedVAD dataset with the largest number of scenes and classes of anomalies, the longest duration, and the only one con-sidering the scene-dependent anomaly. Meanwhile, it is also the first dataset proposed for video anomaly antici-pation. We further propose a novel model capable of de-tecting and anticipating anomalous events simultaneously.Compared with 7 outstanding VAD algorithms in recent years, our method can cope with scene-dependent anomaly detection and anomaly anticipation both well, achieving state-of-the-art performance on ShanghaiTech, CUHK Av-enue, IITB Corridor and the newly proposed NWPU Cam-pus datasets consistently.
