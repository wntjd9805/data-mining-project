Foreground regionMulti-camera 3D object detection blossoms in recent years and most of state-of-the-art methods are built up on the bird’s-eye-view (BEV) representations. Albeit remark-able performance, these works suffer from low efﬁciency.Typically, knowledge distillation can be used for model compression. However, due to unclear 3D geometry reason-ing, expert features usually contain some noisy and confus-ing areas. In this work, we investigate on how to distill the knowledge from an imperfect expert. We propose FD3D, aFocal Distiller for 3D object detection. Speciﬁcally, a set of queries are leveraged to locate the instance-level areas for masked feature generation, to intensify feature representa-tion ability in these areas. Moreover, these queries search out the representative ﬁne-grained positions for reﬁned dis-tillation. We verify the effectiveness of our method by ap-plying it to two popular detection models, BEVFormer andDETR3D. The results demonstrate that our method achieves improvements of 4.07 and 3.17 points respectively in terms of NDS metric on nuScenes benchmark.
