Micro-expressions are spontaneous, rapid and subtle fa-cial movements that can neither be forged nor suppressed.They are very important nonverbal communication clues, but are transient and of low intensity thus difficult to rec-ognize. Recently deep learning based methods have been developed for micro-expression (ME) recognition using fea-ture extraction and fusion techniques, however, targeted feature learning and efficient feature fusion still lack fur-ther study according to the ME characteristics. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework Feature Repre-sentation Learning with adaptive Displacement Generation and Transformer fusion (FRL-DGT), in which a convolu-tional Displacement Generation Module (DGM) with self-supervised learning is used to extract dynamic features from onset/apex frames targeted to the subsequent ME recogni-tion task, and a well-designed Transformer Fusion mecha-nism composed of three Transformer-based fusion modules (local, global fusions based on AU regions and full-face fu-sion) is applied to extract the multi-level informative fea-tures after DGM for the final ME prediction. The extensive experiments with solid leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) eval-uation results have demonstrated the superiority of our pro-posed FRL-DGT to state-of-the-art methods.
