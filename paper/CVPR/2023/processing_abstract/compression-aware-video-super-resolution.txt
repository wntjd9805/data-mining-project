Videos stored on mobile devices or delivered on the In-ternet are usually in compressed format and are of various unknown compression parameters, but most video super-resolution (VSR) methods often assume ideal inputs result-ing in large performance gap between experimental set-tings and real-world applications.In spite of a few pio-neering works being proposed recently to super-resolve the compressed videos, they are not specially designed to deal with videos of various levels of compression.In this pa-per, we propose a novel and practical compression-aware video super-resolution model, which could adapt its video enhancement process to the estimated compression level.A compression encoder is designed to model compression levels of input frames, and a base VSR model is then condi-tioned on the implicitly computed representation by insert-ing compression-aware modules. In addition, we propose to further strengthen the VSR model by taking full advan-tage of meta data that is embedded naturally in compressed video streams in the procedure of information fusion. Ex-tensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the ef-fectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method on com-pressed VSR benchmarks.
