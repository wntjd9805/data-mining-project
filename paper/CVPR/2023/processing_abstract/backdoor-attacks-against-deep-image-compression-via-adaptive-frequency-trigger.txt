Recent deep-learning-based compression methods have achieved superior performance compared with traditional approaches. However, deep learning models have proven to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where some specific trig-ger patterns added to the input can lead to malicious behav-ior of the models. In this paper, we present a novel backdoor attack with multiple triggers against learned image com-pression models. Motivated by the widely used discrete co-sine transform (DCT) in existing compression systems and standards, we propose a frequency-based trigger injection model that adds triggers in the DCT domain. In particu-lar, we design several attack objectives for various attack-ing scenarios, including: 1) attacking compression quality in terms of bit-rate and reconstruction quality; 2) attacking task-driven measures, such as down-stream face recogni-tion and semantic segmentation. Moreover, a novel simple dynamic loss is designed to balance the influence of differ-ent loss terms adaptively, which helps achieve more efficient training. Extensive experiments show that with our trained trigger injection models and simple modification of encoder parameters (of the compression model), the proposed attack can successfully inject several backdoors with correspond-ing triggers in a single image compression model.
