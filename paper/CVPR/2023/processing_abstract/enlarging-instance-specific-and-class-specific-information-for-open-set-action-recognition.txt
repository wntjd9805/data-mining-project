Open-set action recognition is to reject unknown human action cases which are out of the distribution of the training set. Existing methods mainly focus on learning better un-certainty scores but dismiss the importance of feature rep-resentations. We find that features with richer semantic di-versity can significantly improve the open-set performance under the same uncertainty scores. In this paper, we begin with analyzing the feature representation behavior in the open-set action recognition (OSAR) problem based on the information bottleneck (IB) theory, and propose to enlarge the instance-specific (IS) and class-specific (CS) informa-tion contained in the feature for better performance. To this end, a novel Prototypical Similarity Learning (PSL) frame-work is proposed to keep the instance variance within the same class to retain more IS information. Besides, we no-tice that unknown samples sharing similar appearances to known samples are easily misclassified as known classes.To alleviate this issue, video shuffling is further introduced in our PSL to learn distinct temporal information between original and shuffled samples, which we find enlarges theCS information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed PSL can significantly boost both the open-set and closed-set performance and achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.
