In the ﬁeld of human pose estimation, regression-based methods have been dominated in terms of speed, while heatmap-based methods are far ahead in terms of per-formance. How to take advantage of both schemes re-In this paper, we propose mains a challenging problem. a novel human pose estimation framework termed Distil-Pose, which bridges the gaps between heatmap-based and regression-based methods. Speciﬁcally, DistilPose maxi-mizes the transfer of knowledge from the teacher model (heatmap-based) to the student model (regression-based) through Token-distilling Encoder (TDE) and SimulatedHeatmaps. TDE aligns the feature spaces of heatmap-based and regression-based models by introducing tok-enization, while Simulated Heatmaps transfer explicit guid-ance (distribution and conﬁdence) from teacher heatmaps into student models. Extensive experiments show that the proposed DistilPose can signiﬁcantly improve the perfor-mance of the regression-based models while maintaining ef-ﬁciency. Speciﬁcally, on the MSCOCO validation dataset,DistilPose-S obtains 71.6% mAP with 5.36M parameters, 2.38 GFLOPs, and 40.2 FPS, which saves 12.95×, 7.16× computational cost and is 4.9× faster than its teacher model with only 0.9 points performance drop. Furthermore,DistilPose-L obtains 74.4% mAP on MSCOCO validation dataset, achieving a new state-of-the-art among predomi-nant regression-based models.
