Recent years have witnessed the tremendous progress of 3D GANs for generating view-consistent radiance fields with photo-realism. Yet, high-quality generation of hu-man radiance fields remains challenging, partially due to the limited human-related priors adopted in existing meth-ods. We present HumanGen, a novel 3D human generation scheme with detailed geometry and 360◦ realistic free-view rendering. It explicitly marries the 3D human generation with various priors from the 2D generator and 3D recon-structor of humans through the design of “anchor image”.We introduce a hybrid feature representation using the an-chor image to bridge the latent space of HumanGen with the existing 2D generator. We then adopt a pronged de-sign to disentangle the generation of geometry and appear-ance. With the aid of the anchor image, we adapt a 3D re-constructor for fine-grained details synthesis and propose a two-stage blending scheme to boost appearance genera-tion. Extensive experiments demonstrate our effectiveness for state-of-the-art 3D human generation regarding geome-try details, texture quality, and free-view performance. No-tably, HumanGen can also incorporate various off-the-shelf 2D latent editing methods, seamlessly lifting them into 3D.
