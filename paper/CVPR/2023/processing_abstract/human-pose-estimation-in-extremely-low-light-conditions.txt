We study human pose estimation in extremely low-light images. This task is challenging due to the difficulty of collecting real low-light images with accurate labels, and severely corrupted inputs that degrade prediction quality significantly. To address the first issue, we develop a ded-icated camera system and build a new dataset of real low-light images with accurate pose labels. Thanks to our cam-era system, each low-light image in our dataset is coupled with an aligned well-lit image, which enables accurate pose labeling and is used as privileged information during train-ing. We also propose a new model and a new training strat-egy that fully exploit the privileged information to learn rep-resentation insensitive to lighting conditions. Our method demonstrates outstanding performance on real extremely low-light images, and extensive analyses validate that both of our model and dataset contribute to the success.
