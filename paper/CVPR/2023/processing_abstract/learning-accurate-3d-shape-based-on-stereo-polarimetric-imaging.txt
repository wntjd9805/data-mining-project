Shape from Polarization (SfP) aims to recover surface normal using the polarization cues of light. The accuracy of existing SfP methods is affected by two main problems.First, the ambiguity of polarization cues partially results in false normal estimation. Second, the widely-used assump-tion about orthographic projection is too ideal. To solve these problems, we propose the first approach that com-bines deep learning and stereo polarization information to recover not only normal but also disparity. Specifically, for the ambiguity problem, we design a Shape Consistency-based Mask Prediction (SCMP) module. It exploits the in-herent consistency between normal and disparity to iden-tify the areas with false normal estimation. We replace the unreliable features enclosed by these areas with new fea-tures extracted by global attention mechanism. As to the orthographic projection problem, we propose a novel View-ing Direction-aided Positional Encoding (VDPE) strategy.This strategy is based on the unique pixel-viewing direction encoding, and thus enables our neural network to handle the non-orthographic projection. In addition, we establish a real-world stereo SfP dataset that contains various ob-ject categories and illumination conditions. Experiments showed that compared with existing SfP methods, our ap-proach is more accurate. Moreover, our approach shows higher robustness to light variation.
