Face forgery detection becomes increasingly crucial due to the serious security issues caused by face manipula-tion techniques. Recent studies in deepfake detection have yielded promising results when the training and testing face forgeries are from the same domain. However, the problem remains challenging when one tries to generalize the de-tector to forgeries created by unseen methods during train-ing. Observing that face manipulation may alter the re-lation between different facial action units (AU), we pro-pose the Action-Units Relation Learning framework to im-prove the generality of forgery detection. In specific, it con-sists of the Action Units Relation Transformer (ART) and the Tampered AU Prediction (TAP). The ART constructs the relation between different AUs with AU-agnostic Branch and AU-specific Branch, which complement each other and work together to exploit forgery clues.In the TamperedAU Prediction, we tamper AU-related regions at the image level and develop challenging pseudo samples at the feature level. The model is then trained to predict the tamperedAU regions with the generated location-specific supervi-sion. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance in both the in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations.
