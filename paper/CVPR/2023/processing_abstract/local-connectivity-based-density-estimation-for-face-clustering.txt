Recent graph-based face clustering methods predict the connectivity of enormous edges, including false positive edges that link nodes with different classes. However, those false positive edges, which connect negative node pairs, have the risk of integration of different clusters when their connectivity is incorrectly estimated. This paper proposes a novel face clustering method to address this problem. The proposed clustering method employs density-based cluster-ing, which maintains edges that have higher density. For this purpose, we propose a reliable density estimation algo-rithm based on local connectivity between K nearest neigh-bors (KNN). We effectively exclude negative pairs from theKNN graph based on the reliable density while maintaining sufficient positive pairs. Furthermore, we develop a pair-wise connectivity estimation network to predict the connec-tivity of the selected edges. Experimental results demon-strate that the proposed clustering method significantly out-performs the state-of-the-art clustering methods on large-scale face clustering datasets and fashion image clustering datasets.
