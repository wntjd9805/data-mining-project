LiDAR-based perception is a central component of au-tonomous driving, playing a key role in tasks such as ve-hicle localization and obstacle detection. Since the safety of LiDAR-based perceptual pipelines is critical to safe au-tonomous driving, a number of past efforts have investi-gated its vulnerability under adversarial perturbations of raw point cloud inputs. However, most such efforts have fo-cused on investigating the impact of such perturbations on predictions (integrity), and little has been done to under-stand the impact on latency (availability), a critical con-cern for real-time cyber-physical systems. We present the first systematic investigation of the availability of LiDAR detection pipelines, and SlowLiDAR, an adversarial per-turbation attack that maximizes LiDAR detection runtime.The attack overcomes the technical challenges posed by the non-differentiable parts of the LiDAR detection pipelines by using differentiable proxies and uses a novel loss function that effectively captures the impact of adversarial perturba-tions on the execution time of the pipeline. Extensive ex-perimental results show that SlowLiDAR can significantly increase the latency of the six most popular LiDAR detec-tion pipelines while maintaining imperceptibility 1.
