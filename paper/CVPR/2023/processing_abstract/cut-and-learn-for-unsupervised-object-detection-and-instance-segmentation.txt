We propose Cut-and-LEaRn (CutLER), a simple ap-proach for training unsupervised object detection and seg-mentation models. We leverage the property of self-supervised models to ‘discover’ objects without supervision and amplify it to train a state-of-the-art localization model without any human labels. CutLER first uses our proposedMaskCut approach to generate coarse masks for multiple objects in an image, and then learns a detector on these masks using our robust loss function. We further improve performance by self-training the model on its predictions.Compared to prior work, CutLER is simpler, compatible with different detection architectures, and detects multiple objects. CutLER is also a zero-shot unsupervised detec-tor and improves detection performance AP50 by over 2.7× on 11 benchmarks across domains like video frames, paint-ings, sketches, etc. With finetuning, CutLER serves as a low-shot detector surpassing MoCo-v2 by 7.3% APbox and 6.6%APmask on COCO when training with 5% labels.
