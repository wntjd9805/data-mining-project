Few-Shot Learning (FSL) has been rapidly developed in recent years, potentially eliminating the requirement for signiﬁcant data acquisition. Few-shot ﬁne-tuning has been demonstrated to be practically efﬁcient and helpful, espe-cially for out-of-distribution datum [7, 13, 17, 29]. In this work, we ﬁrst observe that the few-shot ﬁne-tuned meth-ods are learned with the imbalanced class marginal distri-bution, leading to imbalanced per-class testing accuracy.This observation further motivates us to propose the Trans-ductive Fine-tuning with Margin-based uncertainty weight-ing and Probability regularization (TF-MP), which learns a more balanced class marginal distribution as shown inFig. 1. We ﬁrst conduct sample weighting on unlabeled testing data with margin-based uncertainty scores and fur-ther regularize each test sample’s categorical probability.TF-MP achieves state-of-the-art performance on in- / out-of-distribution evaluations of Meta-Dataset [31] and sur-passes previous transductive methods by a large margin.
