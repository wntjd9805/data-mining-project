Training Generative adversarial networks (GANs) stably is a challenging task. The generator in GANs transform noise vectors, typically Gaussian distributed, into realistic data such as images. In this paper, we propose a novel ap-proach for training GANs with images as inputs, but without enforcing any pairwise constraints. The intuition is that images are more structured than noise, which the generator can leverage to learn a more robust transformation. The process can be made efﬁcient by identifying closely related datasets, or a “friendly neighborhood” of the target distribu-tion, inspiring the moniker, Spider GAN. To deﬁne friendly neighborhoods leveraging proximity between datasets, we propose a new measure called the signed inception distance (SID), inspired by the polyharmonic kernel. We show that the Spider GAN formulation results in faster convergence, as the generator can discover correspondence even between seemingly unrelated datasets, for instance, between Tiny-ImageNet and CelebA faces. Further, we demonstrate cas-cading Spider GAN, where the output distribution from a pre-trained GAN generator is used as the input to the subse-quent network. Effectively, transporting one distribution to another in a cascaded fashion until the target is learnt – a new ﬂavor of transfer learning. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the Spider approach on DCGAN, conditional GAN, PG-GAN, StyleGAN2 and StyleGAN3. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art Fréchet inception distance (FID) values, with one-ﬁfth of the training iterations, in compari-son to their baseline counterparts on high-resolution small datasets such as MetFaces, Ukiyo-E Faces and AFHQ-Cats.
