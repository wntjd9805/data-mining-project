Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have received consider-able attention recently, due to its impressive capability in photo-realistic 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, given a set of posed camera images. Earlier work usually assumes the input images are of good quality. However, im-age degradation (e.g. image motion blur in low-light con-ditions) can easily happen in real-world scenarios, which would further affect the rendering quality of NeRF. In this paper, we present a novel bundle adjusted deblur NeuralRadiance Fields (BAD-NeRF), which can be robust to se-vere motion blurred images and inaccurate camera poses.Our approach models the physical image formation process of a motion blurred image, and jointly learns the parameters of NeRF and recovers the camera motion trajectories dur-ing exposure time. In experiments, we show that by directly modeling the real physical image formation process, BAD-NeRF achieves superior performance over prior works on both synthetic and real datasets.
