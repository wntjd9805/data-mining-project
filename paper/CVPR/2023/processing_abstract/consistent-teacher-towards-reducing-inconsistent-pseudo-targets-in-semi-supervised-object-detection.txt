In this study, we dive deep into the inconsistency of pseudo targets in semi-supervised object detection (SSOD).Our core observation is that the oscillating pseudo-targets undermine the training of an accurate detector. It injects noise into the studentâ€™s training, leading to severe overfit-ting problems. Therefore, we propose a systematic solu-tion, termed Consistent-Teacher , to reduce the in-consistency. First, adaptive anchor assignment (ASA) sub-stitutes the static IoU-based strategy, which enables the student network to be resistant to noisy pseudo-bounding boxes. Then we calibrate the subtask predictions by de-signing a 3D feature alignment module (FAM-3D). It allows each classification feature to adaptively query the optimal feature vector for the regression task at arbitrary scales and locations. Lastly, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) dynamically revises the score threshold of pseudo-bboxes, which stabilizes the number of ground truths at an early stage and remedies the unreliable supervision signal dur-ing training. Consistent-Teacher provides strong re-sults on a large range of SSOD evaluations.It achieves 40.0 mAP with ResNet-50 backbone given only 10% of an-notated MS-COCO data, which surpasses previous base-lines using pseudo labels by around 3 mAP. When trained on fully annotated MS-COCO with additional unlabeled data, the performance further increases to 47.7 mAP. Our code is available at https://github.com/Adamdad/ConsistentTeacher.
