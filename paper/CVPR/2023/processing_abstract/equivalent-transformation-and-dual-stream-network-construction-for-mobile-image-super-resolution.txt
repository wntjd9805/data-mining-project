In recent years, there has been an increasing demand for real-time super-resolution networks on mobile devices.To address this issue, many lightweight super-resolution models have been proposed. However, these models still contain time-consuming components that increase infer-ence latency, limiting their real-world applications on mo-bile devices. In this paper, we propose a novel model for single-image super-resolution based on Equivalent Trans-formation and Dual Stream network construction (ETDS).ET method is proposed to transform time-consuming op-erators into time-friendly operations, such as convolution and ReLU, on mobile devices. Then, a dual stream net-work is designed to alleviate redundant parameters result-ing from the use of ET and enhance the feature extraction ability. Taking full advantage of the advance of ET and the dual stream network structure, we develop the efficientSR model ETDS for mobile devices. The experimental re-sults demonstrate that our ETDS achieves superior infer-ence speed and reconstruction quality compared to previ-ous lightweight SR methods on mobile devices.
