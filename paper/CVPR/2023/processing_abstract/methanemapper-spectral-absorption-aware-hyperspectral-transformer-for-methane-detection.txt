Methane (CH4) is the chief contributor to global cli-mate change. Recent Airborne Visible-Infrared ImagingSpectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) has been very useful in quantitative mapping of methane emissions. Ex-isting methods for analyzing this data are sensitive to local terrain conditions, often require manual inspection from do-main experts, prone to significant error and hence are not scalable. To address these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end spectral absorption wavelength aware trans-former network, MethaneMapper, to detect and quantify the emissions. MethaneMapper introduces two novel modules that help to locate the most relevant methane plume regions in the spectral domain and uses them to localize these ac-curately. Thorough evaluation shows that MethaneMapper achieves 0.63 mAP in detection and reduces the model size (by 5Ã—) compared to the current state of the art.In ad-dition, we also introduce a large-scale dataset of methane plume segmentation mask for over 1200 AVIRIS-NG flight lines from 2015-2022. It contains over 4000 methane plume sites. Our dataset will provide researchers the opportunity to develop and advance new methods for tackling this chal-lenging green-house gas detection problem with significant broader social impact.
