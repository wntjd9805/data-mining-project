A self-driving vehicle (SDV) must be able to perceive its surroundings and predict the future behavior of other traf-fic participants. Existing works either perform object de-tection followed by trajectory forecasting of the detected objects, or predict dense occupancy and flow grids for the whole scene. The former poses a safety concern as the num-ber of detections needs to be kept low for efficiency rea-sons, sacrificing object recall. The latter is computation-ally expensive due to the high-dimensionality of the out-put grid, and suffers from the limited receptive field inher-ent to fully convolutional networks. Furthermore, both ap-proaches employ many computational resources predicting areas or objects that might never be queried by the motion planner. This motivates our unified approach to percep-tion and future prediction that implicitly represents occu-pancy and flow over time with a single neural network. Our method avoids unnecessary computation, as it can be di-rectly queried by the motion planner at continuous spatio-temporal locations. Moreover, we design an architecture that overcomes the limited receptive field of previous ex-plicit occupancy prediction methods by adding an efficient yet effective global attention mechanism. Through exten-sive experiments in both urban and highway settings, we demonstrate that our implicit model outperforms the cur-rent state-of-the-art.
