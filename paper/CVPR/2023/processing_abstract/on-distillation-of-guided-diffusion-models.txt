Classiﬁer-free guided diffusion models have recently been shown to be highly effective at high-resolution image genera-tion, and they have been widely used in large-scale diffusion*Work partially done during an internship at Google frameworks including DALLE 2, Stable Diffusion and Ima-· gen. However, a downside of classiﬁer-free guided diffusion models is that they are computationally expensive at infer-ence time since they require evaluating two diffusion models, a class-conditional model and an unconditional model, tens to hundreds of times. To deal with this limitation, we pro-pose an approach to distilling classiﬁer-free guided diffusion models into models that are fast to sample from: Given a pre-trained classiﬁer-free guided model, we ﬁrst learn a sin-gle model to match the output of the combined conditional and unconditional models, and then we progressively distill that model to a diffusion model that requires much fewer sampling steps. For standard diffusion models trained on the pixel-space, our approach is able to generate images visually comparable to that of the original model using as few as 4 sampling steps on ImageNet 64x64 and CIFAR-10, achievingFID/IS scores comparable to that of the original model while being up to 256 times faster to sample from. For diffusion models trained on the latent-space (e.g., Stable Diffusion), our approach is able to generate high-ﬁdelity images using as few as 1 to 4 denoising steps, accelerating inference by at least 10-fold compared to existing methods on ImageNet 256x256 and LAION datasets. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on text-guided image editing and inpainting, where our distilled model is able to generate high-quality results using as few as 2-4 denoising steps.
