Naked eye recognition of age is usually based on com-parison with the age of others. However, this idea is ignored by computer tasks because it is difficult to obtain represen-tative contrast images of each age. Inspired by the transfer learning, we designed the Delta Age AdaIN (DAA) opera-tion to obtain the feature difference with each age, which obtains the style map of each age through the learned val-ues representing the mean and standard deviation. We let the input of transfer learning as the binary code of age natural number to obtain continuous age feature informa-tion. The learned two groups of values in Binary code mapping are corresponding to the mean and standard de-viation of the comparison ages. In summary, our method consists of four parts: FaceEncoder, DAA operation, Bi-nary code mapping, and AgeDecoder modules. After get-ting the delta age via AgeDecoder, we take the average value of all comparison ages and delta ages as the predicted age. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves better performance with fewer parameters on mul-tiple facial age datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/redcping/Delta_Age_AdaIN
