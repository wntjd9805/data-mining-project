Optical ﬂow estimation is a fundamental functionality in computer vision. An event-based camera, which asyn-chronously detects sparse intensity changes, is an ideal device for realizing low-latency estimation of the opticalﬂow owing to its low-latency sensing mechanism. An existing method using local plane ﬁtting of events could utilize the sparsity to realize incremental updates for low-latency estimation; however, its output is merely a normal component of the full optical ﬂow. An alterna-tive approach using a frame-based deep neural network could estimate the full ﬂow; however, its intensive non-incremental dense operation prohibits the low-latency estimation. We propose tangentially elongated Gaussian (TEG) belief propagation (BP) that realizes incremental full-ﬂow estimation. We model the probability of full ﬂow as the joint distribution of TEGs from the normal ﬂow measurements, such that the marginal of this distribution with correct prior equals the full ﬂow. We formulate the marginalization using a message-passing based on theBP to realize efﬁcient incremental updates using sparse measurements. In addition to the theoretical justiﬁcation, we evaluate the effectiveness of the TEGBP in real-world datasets; it outperforms SOTA incremental quasi-full ﬂow method by a large margin.
