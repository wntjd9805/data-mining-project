3D semantic scene graphs are a powerful holistic rep-resentation as they describe the individual objects and de-pict the relation between them. They are compact high-level graphs that enable many tasks requiring scene reasoning.In real-world settings, existing 3D estimation methods pro-duce robust predictions that mostly rely on dense inputs.In this work, we propose a real-time framework that incre-mentally builds a consistent 3D semantic scene graph of a scene given an RGB image sequence. Our method con-sists of a novel incremental entity estimation pipeline and a scene graph prediction network. The proposed pipeline simultaneously reconstructs a sparse point map and fuses entity estimation from the input images. The proposed net-work estimates 3D semantic scene graphs with iterative message passing using multi-view and geometric features extracted from the scene entities. Extensive experiments on the 3RScan dataset show the effectiveness of the pro-posed method in this challenging task, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.
