Radiography imaging protocols focus on particular body therefore producing images of great similarity regions, and yielding recurrent anatomical structures across pa-tients. To exploit this structured information, we propose the use of Space-aware Memory Queues for In-painting andDetecting anomalies from radiography images (abbreviated as SQUID). We show that SQUID can taxonomize the in-grained anatomical structures into recurrent patterns; and in the inference, it can identify anomalies (unseen/modiÔ¨Åed patterns) in the image. SQUID surpasses 13 state-of-the-art methods in unsupervised anomaly detection by at least 5 points on two chest X-ray benchmark datasets measured by the Area Under the Curve (AUC). Additionally, we have cre-ated a new dataset (DigitAnatomy), which synthesizes the spatial correlation and consistent shape in chest anatomy.We hope DigitAnatomy can prompt the development, eval-uation, and interpretability of anomaly detection methods.
