Weakly supervised video anomaly detection aims to iden-tify abnormal events in videos using only video-level labels.Recently, two-stage self-training methods have achieved significant improvements by self-generating pseudo labels and self-refining anomaly scores with these labels. As the pseudo labels play a crucial role, we propose an enhance-ment framework by exploiting completeness and uncertainty properties for effective self-training. Specifically, we first design a multi-head classification module (each head serves as a classifier) with a diversity loss to maximize the distri-bution differences of predicted pseudo labels across heads.This encourages the generated pseudo labels to cover as many abnormal events as possible. We then devise an it-erative uncertainty pseudo label refinement strategy, which improves not only the initial pseudo labels but also the up-dated ones obtained by the desired classifier in the sec-ond stage. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the proposed method performs favorably against state-of-the-art approaches on the UCF-Crime, TAD, and XD-Violence benchmark datasets.Figure 1. Illustration of the completeness: (a) represents a video that contains multiple abnormal clips (ground truth anomalies are in the orange area). Existing methods tend to focus on the most anomalous clip as shown in (b). We propose to use the multi-head classification module together with a diversity loss to encourage pseudo labels to cover the complete abnormal events as depicted in (c).
