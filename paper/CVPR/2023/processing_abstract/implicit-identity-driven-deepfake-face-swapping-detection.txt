In this paper, we consider the face swapping detection from the perspective of face identity. Face swapping aims to replace the target face with the source face and gener-ate the fake face that the human cannot distinguish between real and fake. We argue that the fake face contains the ex-plicit identity and implicit identity, which respectively cor-responds to the identity of the source face and target face during face swapping. Note that the explicit identities of faces can be extracted by regular face recognizers. Partic-ularly, the implicit identity of real face is consistent with the its explicit identity. Thus the difference between explicit and implicit identity of face facilitates face swapping detec-tion. Following this idea, we propose a novel implicit iden-tity driven framework for face swapping detection. Specifi-cally, we design an explicit identity contrast (EIC) loss and an implicit identity exploration (IIE) loss, which supervises a CNN backbone to embed face images into the implicit identity space. Under the guidance of EIC, real samples are pulled closer to their explicit identities, while fake sam-ples are pushed away from their explicit identities. More-over, IIE is derived from the margin-based classification loss function, which encourages the fake faces with known target identities to enjoy intra-class compactness and inter-class diversity. Extensive experiments and visualizations on several datasets demonstrate the generalization of our method against the state-of-the-art counterparts.
