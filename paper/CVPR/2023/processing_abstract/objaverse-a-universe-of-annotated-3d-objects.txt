Massive data corpora like WebText, Wikipedia, Concep-tual Captions, WebImageText, and LAION have propelled recent dramatic progress in AI. Large neural models trained on such datasets produce impressive results and top many of todayâ€™s benchmarks. A notable omiss1ion within this fam-ily of large-scale datasets is 3D data. Despite considerable interest and potential applications in 3D vision, datasets of high-fidelity 3D models continue to be mid-sized with limited diversity of object categories. Addressing this gap, we present Objaverse 1.0, a large dataset of objects with 800K+ (and growing) 3D models with descriptive captions, tags, and animations. Objaverse improves upon present day 3D repositories in terms of scale, number of categories, and in the visual diversity of instances within a category.We demonstrate the large potential of Objaverse via four diverse applications: training generative 3D models, im-Correspondence to <mattd@allenai.org>. proving tail category segmentation on the LVIS benchmark, training open-vocabulary object-navigation models for Em-bodied AI, and creating a new benchmark for robustness analysis of vision models. Objaverse can open new direc-tions for research and enable new applications across the field of AI.
