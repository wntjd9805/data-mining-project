Visual place recognition (VPR) is usually considered as a specific image retrieval problem. Limited by existing training frameworks, most deep learning-based works can-not extract sufficiently stable global features from RGB im-ages and rely on a time-consuming re-ranking step to ex-ploit spatial structural information for better performance.In this paper, we propose StructVPR, a novel training archi-tecture for VPR, to enhance structural knowledge in RGB global features and thus improve feature stability in a con-stantly changing environment. Specifically, StructVPR uses segmentation images as a more definitive source of struc-tural knowledge input into a CNN network and applies knowledge distillation to avoid online segmentation and in-ference of seg-branch in testing. Considering that not all samples contain high-quality and helpful knowledge, and some even hurt the performance of distillation, we partition samples and weigh each sampleâ€™s distillation loss to en-hance the expected knowledge precisely. Finally, StructVPR achieves impressive performance on several benchmarks using only global retrieval and even outperforms many two-stage approaches by a large margin. After adding ad-ditional re-ranking, ours achieves state-of-the-art perfor-mance while maintaining a low computational cost.
