We present a learning-based approach to relight a sin-gle image of Lambertian and low-frequency specular ob-jects. Our method enables inserting objects from pho-tographs into new scenes and relighting them under the new environment lighting, which is essential for AR appli-cations. To relight the object, we solve both inverse ren-dering and re-rendering. To resolve the ill-posed inverse rendering, we propose a weakly-supervised method by a low-rank constraint. To facilitate the weakly-supervised training, we contribute Relit, a large-scale (750K images) dataset of videos with aligned objects under changing il-luminations. For re-rendering, we propose a differen-tiable specular rendering layer to render low-frequency non-Lambertian materials under various illuminations of spherical harmonics. The whole pipeline is end-to-end and efficient, allowing for a mobile app implementation of AR object insertion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Project page: https://renjiaoyi.github.io/relighting/.
