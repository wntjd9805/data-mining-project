Considering the ill-posed nature, contrastive regular-ization has been developed for single image dehazing, introducing the information from negative images as a lower bound. However, the contrastive samples are non-consensual, as the negatives are usually represented dis-tantly from the clear (i.e., positive) image, leaving the so-lution space still under-constricted. Moreover, the inter-pretability of deep dehazing models is underexplored to-wards the physics of the hazing process. In this paper, we propose a novel curricular contrastive regularization tar-geted at a consensual contrastive space as opposed to a non-consensual one. Our negatives, which provide better lower-bound constraints, can be assembled from 1) the hazy image, and 2) corresponding restorations by other existing methods. Further, due to the different similarities between the embeddings of the clear image and negatives, the learn-ing difﬁculty of the multiple components is intrinsically im-balanced. To tackle this issue, we customize a curriculum learning strategy to reweight the importance of different negatives.In addition, to improve the interpretability in the feature space, we build a physics-aware dual-branch unit according to the atmospheric scattering model. With the unit, as well as curricular contrastive regularization, we establish our dehazing network, named C2PNet. Ex-tensive experiments demonstrate that our C2PNet signiﬁ-cantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with extremePSNR boosts of 3.94dB and 1.50dB, respectively, on SOTS-indoor and SOTS-outdoor datasets.
