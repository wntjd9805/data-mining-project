This paper proposes NeuralEditor that enables neural radiance fields (NeRFs) natively editable for general shape editing tasks. Despite their impressive results on novel-view synthesis, it remains a fundamental challenge for NeRFs to edit the shape of the scene. Our key insight is to exploit the explicit point cloud representation as the underlying struc-ture to construct NeRFs, inspired by the intuitive interpreta-tion of NeRF rendering as a process that projects or “plots” the associated 3D point cloud to a 2D image plane. To this end, NeuralEditor introduces a novel rendering scheme based on deterministic integration within K-D tree-guided density-adaptive voxels, which produces both high-quality rendering results and precise point clouds through opti-mization. NeuralEditor then performs shape editing via mapping associated points between point clouds. Exten-sive evaluation shows that NeuralEditor achieves state-of-the-art performance in both shape deformation and scene morphing tasks. Notably, NeuralEditor supports both zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning over the edited scene.Our code, benchmark, and demo video are available at im-mortalco.github.io/NeuralEditor.
