We propose a novel visual-inertial odometry (VIO) ini-tialization method, which decouples rotation and transla-tion estimation, and achieves higher efficiency and bet-ter robustness. Existing loosely-coupled VIO-initialization methods suffer from poor stability of visual structure-from-motion (SfM), whereas those tightly-coupled methods of-ten ignore the gyroscope bias in the closed-form solution, resulting in limited accuracy. Moreover, the aforemen-tioned two classes of methods are computationally expen-sive, because 3D point clouds need to be reconstructed si-multaneously. In contrast, our new method fully combines inertial and visual measurements for both rotational and translational initialization. First, a rotation-only solution is designed for gyroscope bias estimation, which tightly couples the gyroscope and camera observations. Second, the initial velocity and gravity vector are solved with lin-ear translation constraints in a globally optimal fashion and without reconstructing 3D point clouds. Extensive ex-periments have demonstrated that our method is 8 âˆ¼ 72 times faster (w.r.t. a 10-frame set) than the state-of-the-art methods, and also presents significantly higher robustness and accuracy.
