By integrating certain optimization solvers with deep neural networks, deep unfolding network (DUN) with good interpretability and high performance has attracted grow-ing attention in compressive sensing (CS). However, exist-ing DUNs often improve the visual quality at the price of a large number of parameters and have the problem of fea-In this paper, we ture information loss during iteration. propose an Optimization-inspired Cross-attention Trans-former (OCT) module as an iterative process, leading to a lightweight OCT-based Unfolding Framework (OCTUF) for image CS. SpeciÔ¨Åcally, we design a novel Dual Cross At-tention (Dual-CA) sub-module, which consists of an Inertia-Supplied Cross Attention (ISCA) block and a Projection-Guided Cross Attention (PGCA) block. ISCA block intro-duces multi-channel inertia forces and increases the mem-ory effect by a cross attention mechanism between adja-cent iterations. And, PGCA block achieves an enhanced information interaction, which introduces the inertia force into the gradient descent step through a cross attention block. Extensive CS experiments manifest that our OCTUF achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while training lower complexity.
