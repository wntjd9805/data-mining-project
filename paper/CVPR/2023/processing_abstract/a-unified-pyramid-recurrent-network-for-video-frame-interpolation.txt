Flow-guided synthesis provides a common framework for frame interpolation, where optical flow is estimated to guide the synthesis of intermediate frames between consec-In this paper, we present UPR-Net, a novel utive inputs.Unified Pyramid Recurrent Network for frame interpola-tion. Cast in a flexible pyramid framework, UPR-Net ex-ploits lightweight recurrent modules for both bi-directional flow estimation and intermediate frame synthesis. At each pyramid level, it leverages estimated bi-directional flow to generate forward-warped representations for frame synthe-sis; across pyramid levels, it enables iterative refinement for both optical flow and intermediate frame. In particular, we show that our iterative synthesis strategy can significantly improve the robustness of frame interpolation on large mo-tion cases. Despite being extremely lightweight (1.7M pa-rameters), our base version of UPR-Net achieves excel-lent performance on a large range of benchmarks.
