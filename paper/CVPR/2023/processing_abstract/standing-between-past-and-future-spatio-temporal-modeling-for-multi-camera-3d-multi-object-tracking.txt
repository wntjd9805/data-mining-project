This work proposes an end-to-end multi-camera 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) framework.It emphasizes spatio-temporal continuity and integrates both past and fu-ture reasoning for tracked objects. Thus, we name it “Past-and-Future reasoning for Tracking” (PF-Track). Specifi-cally, our method adopts the “tracking by attention” frame-work and represents tracked instances coherently over time with object queries. To explicitly use historical cues, our“Past Reasoning” module learns to refine the tracks and enhance the object features by cross-attending to queries from previous frames and other objects. The “Future Rea-soning” module digests historical information and predicts robust future trajectories. In the case of long-term occlu-sions, our method maintains the object positions and en-ables re-association by integrating motion predictions. On the nuScenes dataset, our method improves AMOTA by a large margin and remarkably reduces ID-Switches by 90% compared to prior approaches, which is an order of mag-nitude less. The code and models are made available at https://github.com/TRI-ML/PF-Track.
