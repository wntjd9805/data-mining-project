Convenient 4D modeling of human-object interactions is essential for numerous applications. However, monoc-ular tracking and rendering of complex interaction scenar-ios remain challenging. In this paper, we propose Instant-NVR, a neural approach for instant volumetric human-object tracking and rendering using a single RGBD cam-era. It bridges traditional non-rigid tracking with recent in-stant radiance ﬁeld techniques via a multi-thread tracking-rendering mechanism. In the tracking front-end, we adopt a robust human-object capture scheme to provide sufﬁ-cient motion priors. We further introduce a separated in-stant neural representation with a novel hybrid deforma-tion module for the interacting scene. We also provide an on-the-ﬂy reconstruction scheme of the dynamic/static ra-diance ﬁelds via efﬁcient motion-prior searching. More-over, we introduce an online key frame selection scheme and a rendering-aware reﬁnement strategy to signiﬁcantly improve the appearance details for online novel-view syn-thesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effective-ness and efﬁciency of our approach for the instant gen-eration of human-object radiance ﬁelds on the ﬂy, no-tably achieving real-time photo-realistic novel view synthe-sis under complex human-object interactions.
