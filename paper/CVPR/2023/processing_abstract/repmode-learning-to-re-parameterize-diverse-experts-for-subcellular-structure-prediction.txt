In biological research, fluorescence staining is a key technique to reveal the locations and morphology of subcel-lular structures. However, it is slow, expensive, and harm-ful to cells. In this paper, we model it as a deep learning task termed subcellular structure prediction (SSP), aiming to predict the 3D fluorescent images of multiple subcellu-lar structures from a 3D transmitted-light image. Unfortu-nately, due to the limitations of current biotechnology, each image is partially labeled in SSP. Besides, naturally, sub-cellular structures vary considerably in size, which causes the multi-scale issue of SSP. To overcome these challenges, we propose Re-parameterizing Mixture-of-Diverse-Experts (RepMode), a network that dynamically organizes its pa-rameters with task-aware priors to handle specified single-label prediction tasks. In RepMode, the Mixture-of-Diverse-Experts (MoDE) block is designed to learn the generalized parameters for all tasks, and gating re-parameterization (GatRep) is performed to generate the specialized param-eters for each task, by which RepMode can maintain a com-pact practical topology exactly like a plain network, and meanwhile achieves a powerful theoretical topology. Com-prehensive experiments show that RepMode can achieve state-of-the-art overall performance in SSP.
