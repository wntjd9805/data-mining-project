Exposure correction task aims to correct the underex-posure and its adverse overexposure images to the normal exposure in a single network. As well recognized, the opti-mization ï¬‚ow is the opposite. Despite great advancement, existing exposure correction methods are usually trained with a mini-batch of both underexposure and overexposure mixed samples and have not explored the relationship be-tween them to solve the optimization inconsistency.In this paper, we introduce a new perspective to con-junct their optimization processes by correlating and con-straining the relationship of correction procedure in a mini-batch. The core designs of our framework consist of two steps: 1) formulating the exposure relationship of samples across the batch dimension via a context-irrelevant pre-text task. 2) delivering the above sample relationship de-sign as the regularization term within the loss function to promote optimization consistency. The proposed sample relationship design as a general term can be easily inte-grated into existing exposure correction methods without any computational burden in inference time. Extensive ex-periments over multiple representative exposure correction benchmarks demonstrate consistent performance gains by introducing our sample relationship design.
