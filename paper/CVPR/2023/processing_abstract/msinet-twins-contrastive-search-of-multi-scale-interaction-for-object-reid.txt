Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been increasingly appealing to the society of object Re-Identiﬁcation (ReID), for that task-speciﬁc architectures signiﬁcantly improve the retrieval performance. Previous works explore new opti-mizing targets and search spaces for NAS ReID, yet they neglect the difference of training schemes between image classiﬁcation and ReID. In this work, we propose a novelTwins Contrastive Mechanism (TCM) to provide more ap-propriate supervision for ReID architecture search. TCM reduces the category overlaps between the training and val-idation data, and assists NAS in simulating real-world ReID training schemes. We then design a Multi-Scale Interac-tion (MSI) search space to search for rational interaction operations between multi-scale features.In addition, we introduce a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM) to further enhance the attention consistency confronted with images from different sources. Under the proposed NAS scheme, a speciﬁc architecture is automatically searched, named as MSINet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art ReID methods on both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios. Source code available in https://github.com/vimar-gu/MSINet.
