Recent studies on semi-supervised semantic segmenta-tion (SSS) have seen fast progress. Despite their promising performance, current state-of-the-art methods tend to in-creasingly complex designs at the cost of introducing more network components and additional training procedures.Differently, in this work, we follow a standard teacher-student framework and propose AugSeg, a simple and clean approach that focuses mainly on data perturbations to boost the SSS performance. We argue that various data aug-mentations should be adjusted to better adapt to the semi-supervised scenarios instead of directly applying these tech-niques from supervised learning. Specifically, we adopt a simplified intensity-based augmentation that selects a ran-dom number of data transformations with uniformly sam-pling distortion strengths from a continuous space. Based on the estimated confidence of the model on different un-labeled samples, we also randomly inject labelled infor-mation to augment the unlabeled samples in an adaptive manner. Without bells and whistles, our simple AugSeg can readily achieve new state-of-the-art performance on SSS benchmarks under different partition protocols1.
