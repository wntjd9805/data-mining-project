Zero-shot instance segmentation aims to detect and pre-cisely segment objects of unseen categories without anySince the model is trained on seen training samples. categories, there is a strong bias that the model tends to classify all the objects into seen categories. Besides, there is a natural confusion between background and novelThese objects that have never shown up in training. two challenges make novel objects hard to be raised in the final instance segmentation results.It is desired to rescue novel objects from background and dominated seen categories. To this end, we propose D2Zero with Semantic-Promoted Debiasing and Background Disambiguation to enhance the performance of Zero-shot instance segmenta-tion. Semantic-promoted debiasing utilizes inter-class se-mantic relationships to involve unseen categories in visual feature training and learns an input-conditional classifier to conduct dynamical classification based on the input im-age. Background disambiguation produces image-adaptive background representation to avoid mistaking novel objects for background. Extensive experiments show that we sig-nificantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, e.g., 16.86% improvement on COCO.
