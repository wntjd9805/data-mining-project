Radiance Fields (RF) are popular to represent casually-captured scenes for new view synthesis and several ap-plications beyond it. Mixed reality on personal spaces needs understanding and manipulating scenes represented as RFs, with semantic segmentation of objects as an im-portant step. Prior segmentation efforts show promise but donâ€™t scale to complex objects with diverse appearance.We present the ISRF method to interactively segment ob-jects with fine structure and appearance. Nearest neighbor feature matching using distilled semantic features identifies high-confidence seed regions. Bilateral search in a joint spatio-semantic space grows the region to recover accu-rate segmentation. We show state-of-the-art results of seg-menting objects from RFs and compositing them to another scene, changing appearance, etc., and an interactive seg-mentation tool that others can use.
