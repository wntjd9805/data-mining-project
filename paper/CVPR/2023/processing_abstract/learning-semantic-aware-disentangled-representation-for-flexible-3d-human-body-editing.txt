3D human body representation learning has received in-creasing attention in recent years. However, existing works cannot flexibly, controllably and accurately represent hu-man bodies, limited by coarse semantics and unsatisfac-tory representation capability, particularly in the absence of supervised data.In this paper, we propose a human body representation with fine-grained semantics and high reconstruction-accuracy in an unsupervised setting. Specif-ically, we establish a correspondence between latent vectors and geometric measures of body parts by designing a part-aware skeleton-separated decoupling strategy, which facili-tates controllable editing of human bodies by modifying the corresponding latent codes. With the help of a bone-guided auto-encoder and an orientation-adaptive weighting strat-egy, our representation can be trained in an unsupervised manner. With the geometrically meaningful latent space, it can be applied to a wide range of applications, from human body editing to latent code interpolation and shape style transfer. Experimental results on public datasets demon-strate the accurate reconstruction and flexible editing abil-ities of the proposed method.
