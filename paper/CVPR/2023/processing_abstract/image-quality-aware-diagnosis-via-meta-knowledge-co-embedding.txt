Medical images usually suffer from image degradation in clinical practice, leading to decreased performance of deep learning-based models. To resolve this problem, most previous works have focused on filtering out degradation-causing low-quality images while ignoring their potential value for models. Through effectively learning and leverag-ing the knowledge of degradations, models can better resistIn this pa-their adverse effects and avoid misdiagnosis. per, we raise the problem of image quality-aware diagnosis, which aims to take advantage of low-quality images and im-age quality labels to achieve a more accurate and robust di-agnosis. However, the diversity of degradations and super-ficially unrelated targets between image quality assessment and disease diagnosis makes it still quite challenging to ef-fectively leverage quality labels to assist diagnosis. Thus, to tackle these issues, we propose a novel meta-knowledge co-embedding network, consisting of two subnets: Task Net and Meta Learner. Task Net constructs an explicit quality information utilization mechanism to enhance diagnosis via knowledge co-embedding features, while Meta Learner en-sures the effectiveness and constrains the semantics of these features via meta-learning and joint-encoding masking. Su-perior performance on five datasets with four widely-used medical imaging modalities demonstrates the effectiveness and generalizability of our method.
