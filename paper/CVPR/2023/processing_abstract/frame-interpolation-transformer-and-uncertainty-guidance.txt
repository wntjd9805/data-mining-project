Video frame interpolation has seen important progress in recent years, thanks to developments in several direc-Some works leverage better optical ﬂow meth-tions. ods with improved splatting strategies or additional cues from depth, while others have investigated alternative ap-proaches through direct predictions or transformers. Still, the problem remains unsolved in more challenging condi-tions such as complex lighting or large motion.In this work, we are bridging the gap towards video pro-duction with a novel transformer-based interpolation net-work architecture capable of estimating the expected er-ror together with the interpolated frame. This offers sev-*Work done during an internship at DisneyResearch|Studios eral advantages that are of key importance for frame inter-polation usage: First, we obtained improved visual qual-ity over several datasets. The improvement in terms of quality is also clearly demonstrated through a user study.Second, our method estimates error maps for the interpo-lated frame, which are essential for real-life applications on longer video sequences where problematic frames need to be ﬂagged. Finally, for rendered content a partial render-ing pass of the intermediate frame, guided by the predicted error, can be utilized during the interpolation to generate a new frame of superior quality. Through this error estima-tion, our method can produce even higher-quality interme-diate frames using only a fraction of the time compared to a full rendering.
