Autoregressive transformers have shown remarkable success in video generation. However, the transformers are prohibited from directly learning the long-term dependency in videos due to the quadratic complexity of self-attention, and inherently suffering from slow inference time and er-ror propagation due to the autoregressive process. In this paper, we propose Memory-efficient Bidirectional Trans-former (MeBT) for end-to-end learning of long-term depen-dency in videos and fast inference. Based on recent ad-vances in bidirectional transformers, our method learns to decode the entire spatio-temporal volume of a video in par-allel from partially observed patches. The proposed trans-former achieves a linear time complexity in both encoding and decoding, by projecting observable context tokens into a fixed number of latent tokens and conditioning them to decode the masked tokens through the cross-attention. Em-powered by linear complexity and bidirectional modeling, our method demonstrates significant improvement over the autoregressive transformers for generating moderately long videos in both quality and speed.
