Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have attracted significant attention due to their ability to synthesize novel scene views with great accuracy. However, inherent to their underly-ing formulation, the sampling of points along a ray with zero width may result in ambiguous representations that lead to further rendering artifacts such as aliasing in the final scene. To address this issue, the recent variant mip-NeRF proposes an Integrated Positional Encoding (IPE) based on a conical view frustum. Although this is expressed with an integral formulation, mip-NeRF instead approxi-mates this integral as the expected value of a multivariateGaussian distribution. This approximation is reliable for short frustums but degrades with highly elongated regions, which arises when dealing with distant scene objects un-In this paper, we explore the der a larger depth of field. use of an exact approach for calculating the IPE by using a pyramid-based integral formulation instead of an approx-imated conical-based one. We denote this formulation asExact-NeRF and contribute the first approach to offer a pre-cise analytical solution to the IPE within the NeRF domain.Our exploratory work illustrates that such an exact formula-tion (Exact-NeRF) matches the accuracy of mip-NeRF and furthermore provides a natural extension to more challeng-ing scenarios without further modification, such as in the case of unbounded scenes. Our contribution aims to both address the hitherto unexplored issues of frustum approx-imation in earlier NeRF work and additionally provide in-sight into the potential future consideration of analytical so-lutions in future NeRF extensions.
