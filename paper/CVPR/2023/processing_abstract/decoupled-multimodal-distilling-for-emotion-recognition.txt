Human multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to perceive human emotions via language, visual and acous-tic modalities. Despite the impressive performance of pre-vious MER approaches, the inherent multimodal hetero-geneities still haunt and the contribution of different modal-ities varies signiﬁcantly. In this work, we mitigate this issue by proposing a decoupled multimodal distillation (DMD) approach that facilitates ﬂexible and adaptive crossmodal knowledge distillation, aiming to enhance the discrimina-tive features of each modality. Specially, the representation of each modality is decoupled into two parts, i.e., modality-irrelevant/-exclusive spaces, in a self-regression manner.DMD utilizes a graph distillation unit (GD-Unit) for each decoupled part so that each GD can be performed in a more specialized and effective manner. A GD-Unit consists of a dynamic graph where each vertice represents a modality and each edge indicates a dynamic knowledge distillation.Such GD paradigm provides a ﬂexible knowledge trans-fer manner where the distillation weights can be automati-cally learned, thus enabling diverse crossmodal knowledge transfer patterns. Experimental results show DMD con-sistently obtains superior performance than state-of-the-artMER methods. Visualization results show the graph edges in DMD exhibit meaningful distributional patterns w.r.t. the modality-irrelevant/-exclusive feature spaces.

(c) shows our proposed decoupled multimodal distillation (DMD) method. DMD consists of two graph distillation (GD) units: homogeneous GD and hetero-geneous GD. The decoupled GD paradigm decreases the burden of absorbing knowledge from the heterogeneous data and allows eachGD to be performed in a more specialized and effective manner.
