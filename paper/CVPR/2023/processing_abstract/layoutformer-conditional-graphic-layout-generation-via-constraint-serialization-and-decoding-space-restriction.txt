Conditional graphic layout generation, which generates realistic layouts according to user constraints, is a chal-lenging task that has not been well-studied yet. First, there is limited discussion about how to handle diverse user con-straints flexibly and uniformly. Second, to make the lay-outs conform to user constraints, existing work often sac-In this work, we rifices generation quality significantly. propose LayoutFormer++ to tackle the above problems.First, to flexibly handle diverse constraints, we propose a constraint serialization scheme, which represents different user constraints as sequences of tokens with a predefined format. Then, we formulate conditional layout generation as a sequence-to-sequence transformation, and leverage encoder-decoder framework with Transformer as the ba-sic architecture. Furthermore, to make the layout better meet user requirements without harming quality, we pro-pose a decoding space restriction strategy. Specifically, we prune the predicted distribution by ignoring the options that definitely violate user constraints and likely result in low-quality layouts, and make the model samples from the re-stricted distribution. Experiments demonstrate that Lay-outFormer++ outperforms existing approaches on all the tasks in terms of both better generation quality and less con-straint violation.
