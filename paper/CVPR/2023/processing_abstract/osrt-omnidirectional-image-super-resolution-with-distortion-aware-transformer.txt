Omnidirectional images (ODIs) have obtained lots of re-search interest for immersive experiences. Although ODIs require extremely high resolution to capture details of the entire scene, the resolutions of most ODIs are insufﬁcient.Previous methods attempt to solve this issue by image super-resolution (SR) on equirectangular projection (ERP) images. However, they omit geometric properties of ERP in the degradation process, and their models can hardly gener-alize to real ERP images. In this paper, we propose Fisheye downsampling, which mimics the real-world imaging pro-cess and synthesizes more realistic low-resolution samples.Then we design a distortion-aware Transformer (OSRT) to modulate ERP distortions continuously and self-adaptively.Without a cumbersome process, OSRT outperforms previ-ous methods by about 0.2dB on PSNR. Moreover, we pro-pose a convenient data augmentation strategy, which syn-thesizes pseudo ERP images from plain images. This simple strategy can alleviate the over-ﬁtting problem of large net-works and signiﬁcantly boost the performance of ODISR.Extensive experiments have demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of our OSRT.
