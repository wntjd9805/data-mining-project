Robust principal component analysis (RPCA) is widely studied in computer vision. Recently an adaptive rank es-timate based RPCA has achieved top performance in low-level vision tasks without the prior rank, but both the rank estimate and RPCA optimization algorithm involve singular value decomposition, which requires extremely huge com-putational resource for large-scale matrices. To address these issues, an efficient RPCA (eRPCA) algorithm is pro-posed based on block Krylov iteration and CUR decomposi-tion in this paper. Specifically, the Krylov iteration method is employed to approximate the eigenvalue decomposition in the rank estimation, which requires O(ndrq + n(rq)2) for an (n Ã— d) input matrix, in which q is a parameter with a small value, r is the target rank. Based on the estimated rank, CUR decomposition is adopted to replace SVD in up-dating low-rank matrix component, whose complexity re-duces from O(rnd) to O(r2n) per iteration. Experimen-tal results verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the pro-posed eRPCA over the state-of-the-art methods in various low-level vision applications.
