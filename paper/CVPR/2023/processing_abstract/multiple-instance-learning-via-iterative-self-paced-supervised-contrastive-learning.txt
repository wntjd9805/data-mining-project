Learning representations for individual instances when only bag-level labels are available is a fundamental challenge in multiple instance learning (MIL). Recent works have shown promising results using contrastive self-supervised learning (CSSL), which learns to push apart representations corresponding to two different randomly-selected instances. Unfortunately, in real-world applica-tions such as medical image classiÔ¨Åcation, there is often class imbalance, so randomly-selected instances mostly be-long to the same majority class, which precludes CSSL from learning inter-class differences. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, Iterative Self-paced SupervisedContrastive Learning for MIL Representations (ItS2CLR), which improves the learned representation by exploiting instance-level pseudo labels derived from the bag-level la-bels. The framework employs a novel self-paced sampling strategy to ensure the accuracy of pseudo labels. We evalu-ate ItS2CLR on three medical datasets, showing that it im-proves the quality of instance-level pseudo labels and repre-sentations, and outperforms existing MIL methods in terms of both bag and instance level accuracy. 1
