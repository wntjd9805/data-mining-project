Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved photo-realistic novel views synthesis; however, the requirement of accurate camera poses limits its application. Despite analysis-by-synthesis extensions for jointly learning neu-ral 3D representations and registering camera frames exist, they are susceptible to suboptimal solutions if poorly initial-ized. We propose L2G-NeRF, a Local-to-Global registra-tion method for bundle-adjusting Neural Radiance Fields:ﬁrst, a pixel-wise ﬂexible alignment, followed by a frame-wise constrained parametric alignment. Pixel-wise local alignment is learned in an unsupervised way via a deep network which optimizes photometric reconstruction errors.Frame-wise global alignment is performed using differen-tiable parameter estimation solvers on the pixel-wise corre-spondences to ﬁnd a global transformation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that our method outper-forms the current state-of-the-art in terms of high-ﬁdelity reconstruction and resolving large camera pose misalign-ment. Our module is an easy-to-use plugin that can be applied to NeRF variants and other neural ﬁeld applica-tions.
