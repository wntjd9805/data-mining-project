Face anti-spoofing (FAS) based on domain generaliza-tion (DG) has been recently studied to improve the gener-alization on unseen scenarios. Previous methods typically rely on domain labels to align the distribution of each do-main for learning domain-invariant representations. How-ever, artificial domain labels are coarse-grained and sub-jective, which cannot reflect real domain distributions ac-curately. Besides, such domain-aware methods focus on domain-level alignment, which is not fine-grained enough to ensure that learned representations are insensitive to do-main styles. To address these issues, we propose a novel perspective for DG FAS that aligns features on the instanceSpecifically, level without the need for domain labels.Instance-Aware Domain Generalization framework is pro-posed to learn the generalizable feature by weakening the featuresâ€™ sensitivity to instance-specific styles. Concretely, we propose Asymmetric Instance Adaptive Whitening to adaptively eliminate the style-sensitive feature correlation, boosting the generalization. Moreover, Dynamic KernelGenerator and Categorical Style Assembly are proposed to first extract the instance-specific features and then generate the style-diversified features with large style shifts, respec-tively, further facilitating the learning of style-insensitive features. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art competi-tors. Code will be publicly available at this link.
