Implicit neural representation (INR) characterizes the attributes of a signal as a function of corresponding coor-dinates which emerges as a sharp weapon for solving in-verse problems. However, the capacity of INR is limited by the spectral bias in the network training. In this paper, weﬁnd that such a frequency-related problem could be largely solved by re-arranging the coordinates of the input signal, for which we propose the disorder-invariant implicit neu-ral representation (DINER) by augmenting a hash-table to a traditional INR backbone. Given discrete signals sharing the same histogram of attributes and different arrangement orders, the hash-table could project the coordinates into the same distribution for which the mapped signal can be better modeled using the subsequent INR network, leading to sig-niﬁcantly alleviated spectral bias. Experiments not only re-veal the generalization of the DINER for different INR back-bones (MLP vs. SIREN) and various tasks (image/video representation, phase retrieval, and refractive index recov-ery) but also show the superiority over the state-of-the-art algorithms both in quality and speed.
