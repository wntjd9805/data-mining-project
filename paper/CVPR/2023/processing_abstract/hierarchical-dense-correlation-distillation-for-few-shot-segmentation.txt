Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to form class-agnostic models segmenting unseen classes with only a handful of annotations. Previous methods limited to the semantic feature and prototype representation suffer from coarse segmentation granularity and train-set overfitting.In this work, we design Hierarchically Decoupled Match-ing Network (HDMNet) mining pixel-level support corre-lation based on the transformer architecture. The self-attention modules are used to assist in establishing hierar-chical dense features, as a means to accomplish the cascade matching between query and support features. Moreover, we propose a matching module to reduce train-set over-fitting and introduce correlation distillation leveraging se-mantic correspondence from coarse resolution to boost fine-grained segmentation. Our method performs decently in ex-periments. We achieve 50.0% mIoU on COCO-20i dataset one-shot setting and 56.0% on five-shot segmentation, re-spectively. The code is available on the project website1.
