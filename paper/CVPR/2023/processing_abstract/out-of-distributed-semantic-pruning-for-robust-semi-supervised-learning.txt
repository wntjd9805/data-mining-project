(a)Predict: BeetlesRecent advances in robust semi-supervised learning (SSL) typically ﬁlter out-of-distribution (OOD) information at the sample level. We argue that an overlooked problem of robust SSL is its corrupted information on semantic level, practically limiting the development of the ﬁeld. In this pa-per, we take an initial step to explore and propose a uniﬁed framework termed OOD Semantic Pruning (OSP), which aims at pruning OOD semantics out from in-distribution (ID) features. Speciﬁcally, (i) we propose an aliasing OOD matching module to pair each ID sample with an OOD sam-ple with semantic overlap. (ii) We design a soft orthogonal-ity regularization, which ﬁrst transforms each ID feature by suppressing its semantic component that is collinear with paired OOD sample. It then forces the predictions before and after soft orthogonality decomposition to be consistent.Being practically simple, our method shows a strong per-formance in OOD detection and ID classiﬁcation on chal-lenging benchmarks. In particular, OSP surpasses the pre-vious state-of-the-art by 13.7% on accuracy for ID classiﬁ-cation and 5.9% on AUROC for OOD detection on TinyIm-ageNet dataset.
