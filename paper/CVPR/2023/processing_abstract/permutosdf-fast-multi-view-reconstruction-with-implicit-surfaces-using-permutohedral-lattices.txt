Train 30 minNeural radiance-density ﬁeld methods have become in-creasingly popular for the task of novel-view rendering.Their recent extension to hash-based positional encoding ensures fast training and inference with visually pleasing results. However, density-based methods struggle with re-covering accurate surface geometry. Hybrid methods alle-viate this issue by optimizing the density based on an un-derlying SDF. However, current SDF methods are overly smooth and miss ﬁne geometric details. In this work, we combine the strengths of these two lines of work in a novel hash-based implicit surface representation. We propose im-provements to the two areas by replacing the voxel hash en-coding with a permutohedral lattice which optimizes faster, especially for higher dimensions. We additionally propose a regularization scheme which is crucial for recovering high-frequency geometric detail. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets and show that we can recover geo-metric detail at the level of pores and wrinkles while us-ing only RGB images for supervision. Furthermore, us-ing sphere tracing we can render novel views at 30 fps on an RTX 3090. Code is publicly available at https://radualexandru.github.io/permuto_sdf
