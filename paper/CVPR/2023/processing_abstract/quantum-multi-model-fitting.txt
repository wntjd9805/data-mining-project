Geometric model fitting is a challenging but fundamen-tal computer vision problem. Recently, quantum optimiza-tion has been shown to enhance robust fitting for the case of a single model, while leaving the question of multi-model fitting open. In response to this challenge, this paper shows that the latter case can significantly benefit from quantum hardware and proposes the first quantum approach to multi-model fitting (MMF). We formulate MMF as a problem that can be efficiently sampled by modern adiabatic quan-tum computers without the relaxation of the objective func-tion. We also propose an iterative and decomposed ver-sion of our method, which supports real-world-sized prob-lems. The experimental evaluation demonstrates promising results on a variety of datasets.
