Person re-identification (re-ID) via 3D skeleton data is an emerging topic with prominent advantages. Existing methods usually design skeleton descriptors with raw body joints or perform skeleton sequence representation learn-ing. However, they typically cannot concurrently model dif-ferent body-component relations, and rarely explore useful semantics from fine-grained representations of body joints.In this paper, we propose a generic Transformer-basedSkeleton Graph prototype contrastive learning (TranSG) approach with structure-trajectory prompted reconstruc-tion to fully capture skeletal relations and valuable spatial-temporal semantics from skeleton graphs for person re-ID.Specifically, we first devise the Skeleton Graph Transformer (SGT) to simultaneously learn body and motion relations within skeleton graphs, so as to aggregate key correlative node features into graph representations. Then, we propose the Graph Prototype Contrastive learning (GPC) to mine the most typical graph features (graph prototypes) of each identity, and contrast the inherent similarity between graph representations and different prototypes from both skeleton and sequence levels to learn discriminative graph repre-sentations. Last, a graph Structure-Trajectory PromptedReconstruction (STPR) mechanism is proposed to exploit the spatial and temporal contexts of graph nodes to prompt skeleton graph reconstruction, which facilitates capturing more valuable patterns and graph semantics for person re-ID. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that TranSG signif-icantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. We further show its generality under different graph model-ing, RGB-estimated skeletons, and unsupervised scenar-ios.
