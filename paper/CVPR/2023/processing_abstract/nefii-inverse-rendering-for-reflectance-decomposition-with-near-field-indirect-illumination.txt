Inverse rendering methods aim to estimate geometry, materials and illumination from multi-view RGB images. In order to achieve better decomposition, recent approaches attempt to model indirect illuminations reflected from dif-ferent materials via Spherical Gaussians (SG), which, how-ever, tends to blur the high-frequency reflection details. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end inverse rendering pipeline that decomposes materials and illumination from multi-view images, while considering near-field indirect il-In a nutshell, we introduce the Monte Carlo lumination. sampling based path tracing and cache the indirect illumi-nation as neural radiance, enabling a physics-faithful and easy-to-optimize inverse rendering method. To enhance ef-ficiency and practicality, we leverage SG to represent the smooth environment illuminations and apply importance sampling techniques. To supervise indirect illuminations from unobserved directions, we develop a novel radiance consistency constraint between implicit neural radiance and path tracing results of unobserved rays along with the joint optimization of materials and illuminations, thus sig-nificantly improving the decomposition performance. Ex-tensive experiments demonstrate that our method outper-forms the state-of-the-art on multiple synthetic and real datasets, especially in terms of inter-reflection decomposi-tion.
