Image recognition on expert domains is usually fine-grained and requires expert labeling, which is costly. This limits dataset sizes and the accuracy of learning systems.To address this challenge, we consider annotating expert data with crowdsourcing. This is denoted as PrOfeSsional lEvel cRowd (POSER) annotation. A new approach, based on semi-supervised learning (SSL) and denoted as SSL withIt is a human-in-human filtering (SSL-HF) is proposed. the-loop SSL method, where crowd-source workers act as filters of pseudo-labels, replacing the unreliable confidence thresholding used by state-of-the-art SSL methods. To en-able annotation by non-experts, classes are specified im-plicitly, via positive and negative sets of examples and aug-mented with deliberative explanations, which highlight re-gions of class ambiguity. In this way, SSL-HF leverages the strong low-shot learning and confidence estimation ability of humans to create an intuitive but effective labeling ex-perience. Experiments show that SSL-HF significantly out-performs various alternative approaches in several bench-marks.
