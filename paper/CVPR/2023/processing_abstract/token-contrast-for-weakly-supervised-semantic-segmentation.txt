Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) us-ing image-level labels typically utilizes Class ActivationMap (CAM) to generate the pseudo labels. Limited by the local structure perception of CNN, CAM usually cannot identify the integral object regions. Though the recent Vi-sion Transformer (ViT) can remedy this flaw, we observe it also brings the over-smoothing issue, i.e., the final patch to-kens incline to be uniform. In this work, we propose TokenContrast (ToCo) to address this issue and further explore the virtue of ViT for WSSS. Firstly, motivated by the obser-vation that intermediate layers in ViT can still retain se-mantic diversity, we designed a Patch Token Contrast mod-ule (PTC). PTC supervises the final patch tokens with the pseudo token relations derived from intermediate layers, al-lowing them to align the semantic regions and thus yield more accurate CAM. Secondly, to further differentiate the low-confidence regions in CAM, we devised a Class TokenContrast module (CTC) inspired by the fact that class tokens in ViT can capture high-level semantics. CTC facilitates the representation consistency between uncertain local regions and global objects by contrasting their class tokens. Exper-iments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets show the proposed ToCo can remarkably surpass other single-stage competitors and achieve comparable performance with state-of-the-art multi-stage methods.
