This work focuses on a practical knowledge transfer task defined as Source-Free Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFUDA), where only a well-trained source model and un-labeled target data are available. To fully utilize source knowledge, we propose to transfer the class relationship, which is domain-invariant but still under-explored in previ-ous works. To this end, we first regard the classifier weights of the source model as class prototypes to compute class re-lationship, and then propose a novel probability-based sim-ilarity between target-domain samples by embedding the source-domain class relationship, resulting in Class Rela-tionship embedded Similarity (CRS). Here the inter-class term is particularly considered in order to more accurately represent the similarity between two samples, in which the source prior of class relationship is utilized by weighting.Finally, we propose to embed CRS into contrastive learn-ing in a unified form. Here both class-aware and instance discrimination contrastive losses are employed, which are complementary to each other. We combine the proposed method with existing representative methods to evaluate its efficacy in multiple SFUDA settings. Extensive experimen-tal results reveal that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance due to the transfer of domain-invariant class relationship. 1
