We address efficient and structure-aware 3D scene rep-resentation from images. Nerflets are our key contributionâ€“ a set of local neural radiance fields that together represent a scene. Each nerflet maintains its own spatial position, ori-entation, and extent, within which it contributes to panop-tic, density, and radiance reconstructions. By leveraging only photometric and inferred panoptic image supervision, we can directly and jointly optimize the parameters of a set of nerflets so as to form a decomposed representation of the scene, where each object instance is represented by a group of nerflets. During experiments with indoor and outdoor en-vironments, we find that nerflets: (1) fit and approximate the scene more efficiently than traditional global NeRFs, (2) al-low the extraction of panoptic and photometric renderings from arbitrary views, and (3) enable tasks rare for NeRFs, such as 3D panoptic segmentation and interactive editing.Our project page.
