Stochastic filtering is widely used to deal with nonlin-ear optimization problems such as 3-D and visual track-ing in various computer vision and augmented reality ap-plications. Many current methods suffer from an imbal-ance between exploration and exploitation due to their par-ticle degeneracy and impoverishment, resulting in local op-timums. To address this imbalance, this work proposes a new constrained evolutionary diffusion filter for nonlinear optimization. Specifically, this filter develops spatial state constraints and adaptive history-recall differential evolu-tion embedded evolutionary stochastic diffusion instead of sequential resampling to resolve the degeneracy and im-poverishment problem. With application to monocular en-doscope 3-D tracking, the experimental results show that the proposed filtering significantly improves the balance be-tween exploration and exploitation and certainly works bet-ter than recent 3-D tracking methods. Particularly, the sur-gical tracking error was reduced from 4.03 mm to 2.59 mm.
