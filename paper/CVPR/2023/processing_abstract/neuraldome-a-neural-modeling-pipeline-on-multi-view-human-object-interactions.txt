Humans constantly interact with objects in daily life tasks. Capturing such processes and subsequently conduct-ing visual inferences from a fixed viewpoint suffers from occlusions, shape and texture ambiguities, motions, etc.To mitigate the problem, it is essential to build a train-ing dataset that captures free-viewpoint interactions. We construct a dense multi-view dome to acquire a complex human object interaction dataset, named HODome, that consists of ∼71M frames on 10 subjects interacting with 23 objects. To process the HODome dataset, we developNeuralDome, a layer-wise neural processing pipeline tai-* These authors contributed equally.†Corresponding author. lored for multi-view video inputs to conduct accurate track-ing, geometry reconstruction and free-view rendering, for both human subjects and objects. Extensive experiments on the HODome dataset demonstrate the effectiveness ofNeuralDome on a variety of inference, modeling, and ren-dering tasks. Both the dataset and the NeuralDome tools will be disseminated to the community for further devel-opment, which can be found at https://juzezhang. github.io/NeuralDome
