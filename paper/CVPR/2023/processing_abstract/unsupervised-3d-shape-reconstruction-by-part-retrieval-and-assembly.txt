Representing a 3D shape with a set of primitives can aid perception of structure, improve robotic object manipula-tion, and enable editing, stylization, and compression of 3D shapes. Existing methods either use simple paramet-ric primitives or learn a generative shape space of parts.Both have limitations: parametric primitives lead to coarse approximations, while learned parts offer too little control over the decomposition. We instead propose to decompose shapes using a library of 3D parts provided by the user, giving full control over the choice of parts. The library can contain parts with high-quality geometry that are suit-able for a given category, resulting in meaningful decom-positions with clean geometry. The type of decomposition can also be controlled through the choice of parts in the li-brary. Our method works via a unsupervised approach that iteratively retrieves parts from the library and refines their placements. We show that this approach gives higher recon-struction accuracy and more desirable decompositions than existing approaches. Additionally, we show how the decom-position can be controlled through the part library by using different part libraries to reconstruct the same shapes.
