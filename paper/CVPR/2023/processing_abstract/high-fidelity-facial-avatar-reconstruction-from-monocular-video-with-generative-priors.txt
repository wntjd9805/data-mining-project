High-fidelity facial avatar reconstruction from a monoc-ular video is a significant research problem in computer graphics and computer vision. Recently, Neural RadianceField (NeRF) has shown impressive novel view rendering results and has been considered for facial avatar recon-struction. However, the complex facial dynamics and miss-ing 3D information in monocular videos raise significant challenges for faithful facial reconstruction. In this work, we propose a new method for NeRF-based facial avatar re-construction that utilizes 3D-aware generative prior.

We propose an efficient method to construct the personalized generative prior based on a small set of fa-cial images of a given individual. After learning, it allows for photo-realistic rendering with novel views, and the face reenactment can be realized by performing navigation in the latent space. Our proposed method is applicable for different driven signals, including RGB images, 3DMM co-efficients, and audio. Compared with existing works, we obtain superior novel view synthesis results and faithfully face reenactment performance. The code is available herehttps://github.com/bbaaii/HFA-GP.
