Digital image authenticity has promoted research on im-age forgery localization. Although deep learning-based methods achieve remarkable progress, most of them usu-ally suffer from severe feature coupling between the forged and authentic regions. In this work, we propose a two-stepEdge-aware Regional Message Passing Controlling strat-egy to address the above issue. Specifically, the first step is to account for fully exploiting the edge information. It consists of two core designs: context-enhanced graph con-struction and threshold-adaptive differentiable binarization edge algorithm. The former assembles the global semantic information to distinguish the features between the forged and authentic regions, while the latter stands on the output of the former to provide the learnable edges. In the sec-ond step, guided by the learnable edges, a region message passing controller is devised to weaken the message passing between the forged and authentic regions. In this way, ourERMPC is capable of explicitly modeling the inconsistency between the forged and authentic regions and enabling it to perform well on refined forged images. Extensive exper-iments on several challenging benchmarks show that our method is superior to state-of-the-art image forgery local-ization methods qualitatively and quantitatively.
