Generalized few-shot object detection aims to achieve precise detection on both base classes with abundant an-notations and novel classes with limited training data. Ex-isting approaches enhance few-shot generalization with the sacriﬁce of base-class performance, or maintain high pre-cision in base-class detection with limited improvement in novel-class adaptation. In this paper, we point out the rea-son is insufﬁcient Discriminative feature learning for all of the classes. As such, we propose a new training frame-work, DiGeo, to learn Geometry-aware features of inter-class separation and intra-class compactness. To guide the separation of feature clusters, we derive an ofﬂine sim-plex equiangular tight frame (ETF) classiﬁer whose weights serve as class centers and are maximally and equally sep-arated. To tighten the cluster for each class, we include adaptive class-speciﬁc margins into the classiﬁcation loss and encourage the features close to the class centers. Ex-perimental studies on two few-shot benchmark datasets (VOC, COCO) and one long-tail dataset (LVIS) demon-strate that, with a single model, our method can effectively improve generalization on novel classes without hurting the detection of base classes.
