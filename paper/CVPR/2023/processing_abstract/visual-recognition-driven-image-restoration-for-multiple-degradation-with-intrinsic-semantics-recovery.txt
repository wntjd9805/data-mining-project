Deep image recognition models suffer a signiﬁcant per-formance drop when applied to low-quality images since they are trained on high-quality images. Although many studies have investigated to solve the issue through image restoration or domain adaptation, the former focuses on vi-sual quality rather than recognition quality, while the lat-ter requires semantic annotations for task-speciﬁc training.In this paper, to address more practical scenarios, we pro-pose a Visual Recognition-Driven Image Restoration net-work for multiple degradation, dubbed VRD-IR, to recover high-quality images from various unknown corruption types from the perspective of visual recognition within one model.Concretely, we harmonize the semantic representations of diverse degraded images into a uniﬁed space in a dynamic manner, and then optimize them towards intrinsic semantics recovery. Moreover, a prior-ascribing optimization strat-egy is introduced to encourage VRD-IR to couple with var-ious downstream recognition tasks better. Our VRD-IR is corruption- and recognition-agnostic, and can be inserted into various recognition tasks directly as an image enhance-ment module. Extensive experiments on multiple image dis-tortions demonstrate that our VRD-IR surpasses existing image restoration methods and show superior performance on diverse high-level tasks, including classiﬁcation, detec-tion, and person re-identiﬁcation.
