This paper presents a DETR-based method for cross-domain weakly supervised object detection (CDWSOD), aiming at adapting the detector from source to target do-main through weak supervision. We think DETR has strong potential for CDWSOD due to an insight: the encoder and the decoder in DETR are both based on the attention mech-anism and are thus capable of aggregating semantics across the entire image. The aggregation results, i.e., image-level predictions, can naturally exploit the weak supervi-sion for domain alignment. Such motivated, we proposeDETR with additional Global Aggregation (DETR-GA), aCDWSOD detector that simultaneously makes “instance-level + image-level” predictions and utilizes “strong + weak“ supervisions. The key point of DETR-GA is very simple: for the encoder / decoder, we respectively add mul-tiple class queries / a foreground query to aggregate the semantics into image-level predictions. Our query-based aggregation has two advantages. First, in the encoder, the weakly-supervised class queries are capable of roughly lo-cating the corresponding positions and excluding the dis-traction from non-relevant regions. Second, through our design, the object queries and the foreground query in the decoder share consensus on the class semantics, therefore making the strong and weak supervision mutually benefit each other for domain alignment. Extensive experiments on four popular cross-domain benchmarks show that DETR-GA significantly improves cross-domain detection accuracy (e.g., 29.0% → 79.4% mAP on PASCAL VOC → Clipartall dataset) and advances the states of the art.
