Despite the remarkable progress in deep generative models, synthesizing high-resolution and temporally co-herent videos still remains a challenge due to their high-dimensionality and complex temporal dynamics along with large spatial variations. Recent works on diffusion models have shown their potential to solve this challenge, yet they suffer from severe computation- and memory-inefficiency that limit the scalability. To handle this issue, we propose a novel generative model for videos, coined projected la-tent video diffusion model (PVDM), a probabilistic dif-fusion model which learns a video distribution in a low-dimensional latent space and thus can be efficiently trained with high-resolution videos under limited resources. Specifi-cally, PVDM is composed of two components: (a) an autoen-coder that projects a given video as 2D-shaped latent vectors that factorize the complex cubic structure of video pixels and (b) a diffusion model architecture specialized for our new fac-torized latent space and the training/sampling procedure to synthesize videos of arbitrary length with a single model. Ex-periments on popular video generation datasets demonstrate the superiority of PVDM compared with previous video syn-thesis methods; e.g., PVDM obtains the FVD score of 639.7 on the UCF-101 long video (128 frames) generation bench-mark, which improves 1773.4 of the prior state-of-the-art.
