In this paper we present a new method for deformableNeRF that can directly use optical flow as supervision. We overcome the major challenge with respect to the compu-tationally inefficiency of enforcing the flow constraints to the backward deformation field, used by deformable NeRFs.Specifically, we show that inverting the backward deforma-tion function is actually not needed for computing scene flows between frames. This insight dramatically simplifies the problem, as one is no longer constrained to deformation functions that can be analytically inverted. Instead, thanks to the weak assumptions required by our derivation based on the inverse function theorem, our approach can be ex-tended to a broad class of commonly used backward defor-mation field. We present results on monocular novel view synthesis with rapid object motion, and demonstrate signifi-cant improvements over baselines without flow supervision.
