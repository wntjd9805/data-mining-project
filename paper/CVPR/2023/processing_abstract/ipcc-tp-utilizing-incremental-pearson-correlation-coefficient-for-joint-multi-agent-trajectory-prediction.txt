Reliable multi-agent trajectory prediction is crucial for the safe planning and control of autonomous systems. Com-pared with single-agent cases, the major challenge in si-multaneously processing multiple agents lies in modeling complex social interactions caused by various driving in-tentions and road conditions. Previous methods typically leverage graph-based message propagation or attention mechanism to encapsulate such interactions in the format of marginal probabilistic distributions. However, it is in-herently sub-optimal.In this paper, we propose IPCC-TP, a novel relevance-aware module based on IncrementalPearson Correlation Coefficient to improve multi-agent in-teraction modeling. IPCC-TP learns pairwise joint Gaus-sian Distributions through the tightly-coupled estimation of the means and covariances according to interactive incre-mental movements. Our module can be conveniently em-bedded into existing multi-agent prediction methods to ex-tend original motion distribution decoders. Extensive ex-periments on nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets demon-strate that IPCC-TP improves the performance of baselines by a large margin.
