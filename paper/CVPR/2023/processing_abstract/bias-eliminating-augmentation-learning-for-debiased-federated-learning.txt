Learning models trained on biased datasets tend to ob-serve correlations between categorical and undesirable fea-tures, which result in degraded performances. Most exist-ing debiased learning models are designed for centralized machine learning, which cannot be directly applied to dis-tributed settings like federated learning (FL), which col-lects data at distinct clients with privacy preserved. To tackle the challenging task of debiased federated learn-ing, we present a novel FL framework of Bias-EliminatingAugmentation Learning (FedBEAL), which learns to de-ploy Bias-Eliminating Augmenters (BEA) for producing client-specific bias-conflicting samples at each client. Since the bias types or attributes are not known in advance, a unique learning strategy is presented to jointly train BEA with the proposed FL framework. Extensive image clas-sification experiments on datasets with various bias types confirm the effectiveness and applicability of our FedBEAL, which performs favorably against state-of-the-art debiasing and FL methods for debiased FL.
