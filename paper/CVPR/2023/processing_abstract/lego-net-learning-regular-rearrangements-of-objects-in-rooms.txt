Humans universally dislike the task of cleaning up a messy room.If machines were to help us with this task, they must understand human criteria for regular arrange-ments, such as several types of symmetry, co-linearity or co-circularity, spacing uniformity in linear or circu-lar patterns, and further inter-object relationships that re-late to style and functionality. Previous approaches for this task relied on human input to explicitly specify goal state, or synthesized scenes from scratch – but such meth-ods do not address the rearrangement of existing messy scenes without providing a goal state.In this paper, we present LEGO-Net, a data-driven transformer-based it-erative method for LEarning reGular rearrangement ofObjects in messy rooms. LEGO-Net is partly inspired by diffusion models – it starts with an initial messy state and iteratively “de-noises” the position and orientation of ob-jects to a regular state while reducing distance traveled.Given randomly perturbed object positions and orientations∗Core contribution. in an existing dataset of professionally-arranged scenes, our method is trained to recover a regular re-arrangement.Results demonstrate that our method is able to reliably re-arrange room scenes and outperform other methods. We additionally propose a metric for evaluating regularity in room arrangements using number-theoretic machinery.
