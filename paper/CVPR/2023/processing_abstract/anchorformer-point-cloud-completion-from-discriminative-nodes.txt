Point cloud completion aims to recover the completed 3D shape of an object from its partial observation. A common strategy is to encode the observed points to a global fea-ture vector and then predict the complete points through a generative process on this vector. Nevertheless, the results may suffer from the high-quality shape generation problem due to the fact that a global feature vector cannot sufficient-ly characterize diverse patterns in one object. In this pa-per, we present a new shape completion architecture, name-ly AnchorFormer, that innovatively leverages pattern-aware discriminative nodes, i.e., anchors, to dynamically capture regional information of objects. Technically, AnchorFormer models the regional discrimination by learning a set of an-chors based on the point features of the input partial ob-servation. Such anchors are scattered to both observed and unobserved locations through estimating particular offset-s, and form sparse points together with the down-sampled points of the input observation. To reconstruct the fine-grained object patterns, AnchorFormer further employs a modulation scheme to morph a canonical 2D grid at in-dividual locations of the sparse points into a detailed 3D structure. Extensive experiments on the PCN, ShapeNet-55/34 and KITTI datasets quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate the efficacy of AnchorFormer over the state-of-the-art point cloud completion approaches.
