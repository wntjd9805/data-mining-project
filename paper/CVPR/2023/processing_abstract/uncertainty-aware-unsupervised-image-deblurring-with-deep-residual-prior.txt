Non-blind deblurring methods achieve decent perfor-mance under the accurate blur kernel assumption. Since the kernel uncertainty (i.e. kernel error) is inevitable in practice, semi-blind deblurring is suggested to handle it by introducing the prior of the kernel (or induced) error. How-ever, how to design a suitable prior for the kernel (or in-duced) error remains challenging. Hand-crafted prior, in-corporating domain knowledge, generally performs well but may lead to poor performance when kernel (or induced) er-ror is complex. Data-driven prior, which excessively de-pends on the diversity and abundance of training data, is vulnerable to out-of-distribution blurs and images. To ad-dress this challenge, we suggest a dataset-free deep resid-ual prior for the kernel induced error (termed as residual) expressed by a customized untrained deep neural network, which allows us to ﬂexibly adapt to different blurs and im-ages in real scenarios. By organically integrating the re-spective strengths of deep priors and hand-crafted priors, we propose an unsupervised semi-blind deblurring model which recovers the clear image from the blurry image and inaccurate blur kernel. To tackle the formulated model, an efﬁcient alternating minimization algorithm is developed.Extensive experiments demonstrate the favorable perfor-mance of the proposed method as compared to model-driven and data-driven methods in terms of image quality and the robustness to different types of kernel error.
