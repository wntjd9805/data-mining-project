We present FFCV, a library for easy and fast machine learning model training. FFCV speeds up model training by eliminating (often subtle) data bottlenecks from the training process. In particular, we combine techniques such as an ef-ﬁcient ﬁle storage format, caching, data pre-loading, asyn-chronous data transfer, and just-in-time compilation to (a) make data loading and transfer signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient, ensuring that GPUs can reach full utilization; and (b) of-ﬂoad as much data processing as possible to the CPU asyn-chronously, freeing GPU cycles for training. Using FFCV, we train ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 on the ImageNet dataset with a state-of-the-art tradeoff between accuracy and train-ing time. For example, across the range of ResNet-50 mod-els we test, we obtain the same accuracy as the best base-lines in half the time. We demonstrate FFCV’s performance, ease-of-use, extensibility, and ability to adapt to resource constraints through several case studies. Detailed installa-tion instructions, documentation, and Slack support chan-nel are available at https://ffcv.io/.
