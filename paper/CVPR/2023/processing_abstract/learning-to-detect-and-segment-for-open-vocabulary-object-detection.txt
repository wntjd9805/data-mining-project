Open vocabulary object detection has been greatly ad-vanced by the recent development of vision-language pre-trained model, which helps recognize novel objects with only semantic categories. The prior works mainly focus on knowledge transferring to the object proposal classification and employ class-agnostic box and mask prediction. In this work, we propose CondHead, a principled dynamic network design to better generalize the box regression and mask seg-mentation for open vocabulary setting. The core idea is to conditionally parameterize the network heads on semantic embedding and thus the model is guided with class-specific knowledge to better detect novel categories. Specifically,CondHead is composed of two streams of network heads, the dynamically aggregated head and dynamically gener-ated head. The former is instantiated with a set of static heads that are conditionally aggregated, these heads are optimized as experts and are expected to learn sophisticated prediction. The latter is instantiated with dynamically gen-erated parameters and encodes general class-specific infor-mation. With such a conditional design, the detection model is bridged by the semantic embedding to offer strongly gen-eralizable class-wise box and mask prediction. Our method brings significant improvement to the state-of-the-art open vocabulary object detection methods with very minor over-head, e.g., it surpasses a RegionClip model by 3.0 detectionAP on novel categories, with only 1.1% more computation.
