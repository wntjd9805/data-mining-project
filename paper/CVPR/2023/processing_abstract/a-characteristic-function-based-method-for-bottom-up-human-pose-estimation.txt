Most recent methods formulate the task of human pose estimation as a heatmap estimation problem, and use the overall L2 loss computed from the entire heatmap to opti-mize the heatmap prediction. In this paper, we show that in bottom-up human pose estimation where each heatmap often contains multiple body joints, using the overall L2 loss to optimize the heatmap prediction may not be the op-timal choice. This is because, minimizing the overall L2 loss cannot always lead the model to locate all the body joints across different sub-regions of the heatmap more ac-curately. To cope with this problem, from a novel perspec-tive, we propose a new bottom-up human pose estimation method that optimizes the heatmap prediction via minimiz-ing the distance between two characteristic functions re-spectively constructed from the predicted heatmap and the groundtruth heatmap. Our analysis presented in this pa-per indicates that the distance between these two charac-teristic functions is essentially the upper bound of the L2 losses w.r.t. sub-regions of the predicted heatmap. There-fore, via minimizing the distance between the two character-istic functions, we can optimize the model to provide a more accurate localization result for the body joints in different sub-regions of the predicted heatmap. We show the effec-tiveness of our proposed method through extensive exper-iments on the COCO dataset and the CrowdPose dataset.
