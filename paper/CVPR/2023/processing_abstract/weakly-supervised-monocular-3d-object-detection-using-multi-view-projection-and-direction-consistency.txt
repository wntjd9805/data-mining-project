Monocular 3D object detection has become a main-stream approach in automatic driving for its easy applica-tion. A prominent advantage is that it does not need Li-DAR point clouds during the inference. However, most cur-rent methods still rely on 3D point cloud data for labeling the ground truths used in the training phase. This incon-sistency between the training and inference makes it hard to utilize the large-scale feedback data and increases the data collection expenses. To bridge this gap, we propose a new weakly supervised monocular 3D objection detec-tion method, which can train the model with only 2D labels marked on images. To be specific, we explore three types of consistency in this task, i.e. the projection, multi-view and direction consistency, and design a weakly-supervised architecture based on these consistencies. Moreover, we propose a new 2D direction labeling method in this task to guide the model for accurate rotation direction predic-tion. Experiments show that our weakly-supervised method achieves comparable performance with some fully super-vised methods. When used as a pre-training method, our model can significantly outperform the corresponding fully-supervised baseline with only 1/3 3D labels.
