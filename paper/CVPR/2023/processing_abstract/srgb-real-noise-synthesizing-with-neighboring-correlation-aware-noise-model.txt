Modeling and synthesizing real noise in the standardRGB (sRGB) domain is challenging due to the complicated noise distribution. While most of the deep noise generators proposed to synthesize sRGB real noise using an end-to-end trained model, the lack of explicit noise modeling degrades the quality of their synthesized noise. In this work, we pro-pose to model the real noise as not only dependent on the underlying clean image pixel intensity, but also highly cor-related to its neighboring noise realization within the local region. Correspondingly, we propose a novel noise synthe-sizing framework by explicitly learning its neighboring cor-relation on top of the signal dependency. With the proposed noise model, our framework greatly bridges the distribution gap between synthetic noise and real noise. We show that our generated “real” sRGB noisy images can be used for training supervised deep denoisers, thus to improve their real denoising results with a large margin, comparing to the popular classic denoisers or the deep denoisers that are trained on other sRGB noise generators.
