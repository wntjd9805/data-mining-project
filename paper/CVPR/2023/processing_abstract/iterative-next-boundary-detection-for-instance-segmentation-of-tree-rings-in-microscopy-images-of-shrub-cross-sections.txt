We address the problem of detecting tree rings in mi-croscopy images of shrub cross sections. This can be re-garded as a special case of the instance segmentation task with several unique challenges such as the concentric cir-cular ring shape of the objects and high precision require-ments that result in inadequate performance of existing methods.We propose a new iterative method which we term Itera-tive Next Boundary Detection (INBD). It intuitively models the natural growth direction, starting from the center of the shrub cross section and detecting the next ring boundary in each iteration step. In our experiments, INBD shows supe-rior performance to generic instance segmentation methods and is the only one with a built-in notion of chronological order.Our dataset and source code are available at http://github.com/alexander-g/INBD .
