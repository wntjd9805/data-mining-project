We propose an approach to estimate the number of sam-ples required for a model to reach a target performance.We ﬁnd that the power law, the de facto principle to esti-mate model performance, leads to a large error when using a small dataset (e.g., 5 samples per class) for extrapola-tion. This is because the log-performance error against the log-dataset size follows a nonlinear progression in the few-shot regime followed by a linear progression in the high-shot regime. We introduce a novel piecewise power law (PPL) that handles the two data regimes differently. To estimate the parameters of the PPL, we introduce a ran-dom forest regressor trained via meta learning that general-izes across classiﬁcation/detection tasks, ResNet/ViT based architectures, and random/pre-trained initializations. ThePPL improves the performance estimation on average by 37% across 16 classiﬁcation and 33% across 10 detection datasets, compared to the power law. We further extend thePPL to provide a conﬁdence bound and use it to limit the prediction horizon that reduces over-estimation of data by 76% on classiﬁcation and 91% on detection datasets.
