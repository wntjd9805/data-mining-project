Performance comparison on VOC12The existing weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods pay much attention to generating accu-rate and complete class activation maps (CAMs) as pseudo-labels, while ignoring the importance of training the seg-mentation networks. In this work, we observe that there is an inconsistency between the quality of the pseudo-labels in CAMs and the performance of the ﬁnal segmentation model, and the mislabeled pixels mainly lie on the bound-ary areas.Inspired by these ﬁndings, we argue that the focus of WSSS should be shifted to robust learning given the noisy pseudo-labels, and further propose a boundary-enhanced co-training (BECO) method for training the seg-mentation model. To be speciﬁc, we ﬁrst propose to use a co-training paradigm with two interactive networks to im-prove the learning of uncertain pixels. Then we propose a boundary-enhanced strategy to boost the prediction of dif-ﬁcult boundary areas, which utilizes reliable predictions to construct artiﬁcial boundaries. Beneﬁting from the design of co-training and boundary enhancement, our method can achieve promising segmentation performance for differentCAMs. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 andMS COCO 2014 validate the superiority of our BECO over other state-of-the-art methods. 1
