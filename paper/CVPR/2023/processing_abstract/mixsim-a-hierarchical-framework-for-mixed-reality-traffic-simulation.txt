The prevailing way to test a self-driving vehicle (SDV) in simulation involves non-reactive open-loop replay of real world scenarios. However, in order to safely deploy SDVs to the real world, we need to evaluate them in closed-loop.Towards this goal, we propose to leverage the wealth of interesting scenarios captured in the real world and make them reactive and controllable to enable closed-loop SDV evaluation in what-if situations. In particular, we presentMIXSIM, a hierarchical framework for mixed reality traf-ﬁc simulation. MIXSIM explicitly models agent goals as routes along the road network and learns a reactive route-conditional policy. By inferring each agent’s route from the original scenario, MIXSIM can reactively re-simulate the scenario and enable testing different autonomy sys-tems under the same conditions. Furthermore, by vary-ing each agent’s route, we can expand the scope of test-ing to what-if situations with realistic variations in agent behaviors or even safety critical interactions. Our exper-iments show that MIXSIM can serve as a realistic, reac-tive, and controllable digital twin of real world scenar-ios.
