Multi-view clustering has hitherto been studied due to their effectiveness in dealing with heterogeneous data. De-spite the empirical success made by recent works, there still exists several severe challenges. Particularly, previous multi-view clustering algorithms seldom consider the topo-logical structure in data, which is essential for clustering data on manifold. Moreover, existing methods cannot fully explore the consistency of local structures between different views as they uncover the clustering structure in a intra-view way instead of a inter-view manner. In this paper, we propose to exploit the implied data manifold by learning the topological structure of data. Besides, considering that the consistency of multiple views is manifested in the gen-erally similar local structure while the inconsistent struc-tures are the minority, we further explore the intersections of multiple views in the sample level such that the cross-view consistency can be better maintained. We model the above concerns in a unified framework and design an efficient al-gorithm to solve the corresponding optimization problem.Experimental results on various multi-view datasets certifi-cate the effectiveness of the proposed method and verify its superiority over other SOTA approaches.
