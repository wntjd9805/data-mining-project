The mechanism of existing style transfer algorithms is by minimizing a hybrid loss function to push the generated image toward high similarities in both content and style.However, this type of approach cannot guarantee visual fi-delity, i.e., the generated artworks should be indistinguish-able from real ones. In this paper, we devise a new style transfer framework called QuantArt for high visual-fidelity stylization. QuantArt pushes the latent representation of the generated artwork toward the centroids of the real artwork distribution with vector quantization. By fusing the quan-tized and continuous latent representations, QuantArt al-lows flexible control over the generated artworks in terms of content preservation, style similarity, and visual fidelity.Experiments on various style transfer settings show that ourQuantArt framework achieves significantly higher visual fi-delity compared with the existing style transfer methods.
