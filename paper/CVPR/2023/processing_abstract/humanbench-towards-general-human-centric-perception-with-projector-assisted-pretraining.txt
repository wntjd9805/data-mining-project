Human-centric perceptions include a variety of vision tasks, which have widespread industrial applications, in-cluding surveillance, autonomous driving, and the meta-It is desirable to have a general pretrain model verse. for versatile human-centric downstream tasks. This pa-per forges ahead along this path from the aspects of both benchmark and pretraining methods. Specifically, we pro-pose a HumanBench based on existing datasets to com-prehensively evaluate on the common ground the gener-alization abilities of different pretraining methods on 19 datasets from 6 diverse downstream tasks, including personReID, pose estimation, human parsing, pedestrian attribute recognition, pedestrian detection, and crowd counting. To learn both coarse-grained and fine-grained knowledge in human bodies, we further propose a Projector AssisTedHierarchical pretraining method (PATH) to learn diverse knowledge at different granularity levels. Comprehensive evaluations on HumanBench show that our PATH achieves new state-of-the-art results on 17 downstream datasets and on-par results on the other 2 datasets. The code will be publicly at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/HumanBench.
