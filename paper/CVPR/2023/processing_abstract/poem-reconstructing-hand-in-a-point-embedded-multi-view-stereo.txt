Enable neural networks to capture 3D geometrical-aware features is essential in multi-view based vision tasks.Previous methods usually encode the 3D information ofIn contrast, we multi-view stereo into the 2D features. present a novel method, named POEM, that directly oper-ates on the 3D POints Embedded in the Multi-view stereo for reconstructing hand mesh in it. Point is a natural form of 3D information and an ideal medium for fusing fea-tures across views, as it has different projections on dif-ferent views. Our method is thus in light of a simple yet effective idea, that a complex 3D hand mesh can be rep-resented by a set of 3D points that 1) are embedded in the multi-view stereo, 2) carry features from the multi-view images, and 3) encircle the hand. To leverage the power of points, we design two operations: point-based feature fusion and cross-set point attention mechanism. Evalua-tion on three challenging multi-view datasets shows thatPOEM outperforms the state-of-the-art in hand mesh re-construction. Code and models are available for research at github.com/lixiny/POEM
