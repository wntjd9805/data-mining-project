LiDAR-based 3D point cloud recognition has benefited various applications. Without specially considering the Li-DAR point distribution, most current methods suffer from information disconnection and limited receptive field, es-In this work, we pecially for the sparse distant points. study the varying-sparsity distribution of LiDAR points and present SphereFormer to directly aggregate information from dense close points to the sparse distant ones. We de-sign radial window self-attention that partitions the space into multiple non-overlapping narrow and long windows.It overcomes the disconnection issue and enlarges the re-ceptive field smoothly and dramatically, which significantly boosts the performance of sparse distant points. Moreover, to fit the narrow and long windows, we propose exponen-tial splitting to yield fine-grained position encoding and dynamic feature selection to increase model representation ability. Notably, our method ranks 1st on both nuScenes andSemanticKITTI semantic segmentation benchmarks with 81.9% and 74.8% mIoU, respectively. Also, we achieve the 3rd place on nuScenes object detection benchmark with 72.8% NDS and 68.5% mAP. Code is available at https:// github.com/ dvlab-research/ SphereFormer.git.
