Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation aims at improving the model performance on the unlabeled target domain by leveraging a labeled source domain. Existing approaches have achieved im-pressive progress by utilizing pseudo-labels on the unla-beled target-domain images. Yet the low-quality pseudo-labels, arising from the domain discrepancy, inevitably hin-der the adaptation. This calls for effective and accurate ap-proaches to estimating the reliability of the pseudo-labels, in order to rectify them. In this paper, we propose to esti-mate the rectiﬁcation values of the predicted pseudo-labels with implicit neural representations. We view the rectiﬁ-cation value as a signal deﬁned over the continuous spa-tial domain. Taking an image coordinate and the nearby deep features as inputs, the rectiﬁcation value at a given coordinate is predicted as an output. This allows us to achieve high-resolution and detailed rectiﬁcation values es-timation, important for accurate pseudo-label generation at mask boundaries in particular. The rectiﬁed pseudo-labels are then leveraged in our rectiﬁcation-aware mixture model (RMM) to be learned end-to-end and help the adap-tation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on different UDA benchmarks, including synthetic-to-real and day-to-night. Our approach achieves superior results com-pared to state-of-the-art.
