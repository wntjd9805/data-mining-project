Recent trends in semi-supervised learning have signifi-cantly boosted the performance of 3D semi-supervised med-ical image segmentation. Compared with 2D images, 3D medical volumes involve information from different direc-tions, e.g., transverse, sagittal, and coronal planes, so as to naturally provide complementary views. These com-plementary views and the intrinsic similarity among ad-jacent 3D slices inspire us to develop a novel annotation way and its corresponding semi-supervised model for effec-tive segmentation. Specifically, we firstly propose the or-thogonal annotation by only labeling two orthogonal slices in a labeled volume, which significantly relieves the bur-den of annotation. Then, we perform registration to ob-tain the initial pseudo labels for sparsely labeled volumes.Subsequently, by introducing unlabeled volumes, we pro-pose a dual-network paradigm named Dense-Sparse Co-training (DeSCO) that exploits dense pseudo labels in early stage and sparse labels in later stage and meanwhile forces consistent output of two networks. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets validated our effectiveness in performance and efficiency in annotation. For example, with only 10 annotated slices, our method reaches a Dice up to 86.93% on KiTS19 dataset. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/HengCai-NJU/DeSCO.
