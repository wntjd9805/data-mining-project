Optical ﬂow has achieved great success under clean scenes, but suffers from restricted performance under foggy scenes. To bridge the clean-to-foggy domain gap, the ex-isting methods typically adopt the domain adaptation to transfer the motion knowledge from clean to synthetic foggy domain. However, these methods unexpectedly neglect the synthetic-to-real domain gap, and thus are erroneous when applied to real-world scenes. To handle the practical opticalﬂow under real foggy scenes, in this work, we propose a novel unsupervised cumulative domain adaptation opticalﬂow (UCDA-Flow) framework: depth-association motion adaptation and correlation-alignment motion adaptation.Speciﬁcally, we discover that depth is a key ingredient to in-ﬂuence the optical ﬂow: the deeper depth, the inferior opticalﬂow, which motivates us to design a depth-association mo-tion adaptation module to bridge the clean-to-foggy domain gap. Moreover, we ﬁgure out that the cost volume correlation shares similar distribution of the synthetic and real foggy im-ages, which enlightens us to devise a correlation-alignment motion adaptation module to distill motion knowledge of the synthetic foggy domain to the real foggy domain. Note that synthetic fog is designed as the intermediate domain. Under this uniﬁed framework, the proposed cumulative adaptation progressively transfers knowledge from clean scenes to real foggy scenes. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the superiority of the proposed method.
