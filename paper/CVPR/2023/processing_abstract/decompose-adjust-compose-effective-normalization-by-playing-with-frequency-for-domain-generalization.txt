Domain generalization (DG) is a principal task to eval-uate the robustness of computer vision models. Many previ-ous studies have used normalization for DG. In normaliza-tion, statistics and normalized features are regarded as style and content, respectively. However, it has a content vari-ation problem when removing style because the boundary between content and style is unclear. This study addresses this problem from the frequency domain perspective, where amplitude and phase are considered as style and content, respectively. First, we verify the quantitative phase varia-tion of normalization through the mathematical derivation of the Fourier transform formula. Then, based on this, we propose a novel normalization method, P CN orm, which eliminates style only as the preserving content through spec-tral decomposition. Furthermore, we propose advancedP CN orm variants, CCN orm and SCN orm, which ad-just the degrees of variations in content and style, respec-tively. Thus, they can learn domain-agnostic representa-tions for DG. With the normalization methods, we proposeResNet-variant models, DAC-P and DAC-SC, which are ro-bust to the domain gap. The proposed models outperform other recent DG methods. The DAC-SC achieves an aver-age state-of-the-art performance of 65.6% on five datasets:PACS, VLCS, Office-Home, DomainNet, and TerraIncog-nita.
