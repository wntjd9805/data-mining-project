A hard challenge in developing practical face recogni-tion (FR) attacks is due to the black-box nature of the targetFR model, i.e., inaccessible gradient and parameter infor-mation to attackers. While recent research took an impor-tant step towards attacking black-box FR models through leveraging transferability, their performance is still limited, especially against online commercial FR systems that can be pessimistic (e.g., a less than 50% ASRâ€“attack success rate on average). Motivated by this, we present Sibling-Attack, a new FR attack technique for the first time explores a novel multi-task perspective (i.e., leveraging extra infor-mation from multi-correlated tasks to boost attacking trans-ferability). Intuitively, Sibling-Attack selects a set of tasks correlated with FR and picks the Attribute Recognition (AR) task as the task used in Sibling-Attack based on theoret-ical and quantitative analysis. Sibling-Attack then devel-ops an optimization framework that fuses adversarial gra-dient information through (1) constraining the cross-task features to be under the same space, (2) a joint-task meta optimization framework that enhances the gradient com-patibility among tasks, and (3) a cross-task gradient stabi-lization method which mitigates the oscillation effect during attacking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Sibling-Attack outperforms state-of-the-art FR attack techniques by a non-trivial margin, boosting ASR by 12.61% and 55.77% on average on state-of-the-art pre-trained FR models and two well-known, widely used commercial FR systems.
