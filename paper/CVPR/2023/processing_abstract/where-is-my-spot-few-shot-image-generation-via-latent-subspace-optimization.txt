Image generation relies on massive training data that can hardly produce diverse images of an unseen category according to a few examples.In this paper, we address this dilemma by projecting sparse few-shot samples into a continuous latent space that can potentially generate in-finite unseen samples. The rationale behind is that we aim to locate a centroid latent position in a conditionalStyleGAN, where the corresponding output image on that centroid can maximize the similarity with the given sam-ples. Although the given samples are unseen for the con-ditional StyleGAN, we assume the neighboring latent sub-space around the centroid belongs to the novel category, and therefore introduce two latent subspace optimization objectives. In the first one we use few-shot samples as pos-itive anchors of the novel class, and adjust the StyleGAN to produce the corresponding results with the new class label condition. The second objective is to govern the genera-tion process from the other way around, by altering the cen-*Equal Contributions.â€ Corresponding authors. troid and its surrounding latent subspace for a more pre-cise generation of the novel class. These reciprocal opti-mization objectives inject a novel class into the StyleGAN latent subspace, and therefore new unseen samples can be easily produced by sampling images from it. Extensive ex-periments demonstrate superior few-shot generation perfor-mances compared with state-of-the-art methods, especially in terms of diversity and generation quality.
