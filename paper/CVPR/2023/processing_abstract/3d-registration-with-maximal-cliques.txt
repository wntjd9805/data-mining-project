As a fundamental problem in computer vision, 3D point cloud registration (PCR) aims to seek the optimal pose to align a point cloud pair. In this paper, we present a 3D reg-istration method with maximal cliques (MAC). The key in-sight is to loosen the previous maximum clique constraint, and mine more local consensus information in a graph for accurate pose hypotheses generation: 1) A compatibility graph is constructed to render the affinity relationship be-tween initial correspondences. 2) We search for maximal cliques in the graph, each of which represents a consensus set. We perform node-guided clique selection then, where each node corresponds to the maximal clique with the great-est graph weight. 3) Transformation hypotheses are com-puted for the selected cliques by the SVD algorithm and the best hypothesis is used to perform registration. Ex-tensive experiments on U3M, 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch andKITTI demonstrate that MAC effectively increases registra-tion accuracy, outperforms various state-of-the-art meth-ods and boosts the performance of deep-learned methods.MAC combined with deep-learned methods achieves state-of-the-art registration recall of 95.7% / 78.9% on 3DMatch/ 3DLoMatch.
