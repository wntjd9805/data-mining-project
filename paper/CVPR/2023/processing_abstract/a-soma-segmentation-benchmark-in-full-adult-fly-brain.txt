Neuron reconstruction in a full adult fly brain from high-resolution electron microscopy (EM) data is regarded as a cornerstone for neuroscientists to explore how neurons in-spire intelligence. As the central part of neurons, somas in the full brain indicate the origin of neurogenesis and neu-ral functions. However, due to the absence of EM datasets specifically annotated for somas, existing deep learning-based neuron reconstruction methods cannot directly pro-vide accurate soma distribution and morphology. More-over, full brain neuron reconstruction remains extremely time-consuming due to the unprecedentedly large size ofEM data. In this paper, we develop an efficient soma re-construction method for obtaining accurate soma distribu-tion and morphology information in a full adult fly brain.To this end, we first make a high-resolution EM dataset with fine-grained 3D manual annotations on somas. Re-lying on this dataset, we propose an efficient, two-stage deep learning algorithm for predicting accurate locations and boundaries of 3D soma instances. Further, we deploy a parallelized, high-throughput data processing pipeline for executing the above algorithm on the full brain. Finally, we provide quantitative and qualitative benchmark compar-isons on the testset to validate the superiority of the pro-posed method, as well as preliminary statistics of the re-constructed somas in the full adult fly brain from the bi-ological perspective. We release our code and dataset at https://github.com/liuxy1103/EMADS.
