It is vital to infer signed distance functions (SDFs) from 3D point clouds. The latest methods rely on generalizing the priors learned from large scale supervision. Howev-er, the learned priors do not generalize well to various ge-ometric variations that are unseen during training, espe-cially for extremely sparse point clouds. To resolve this issue, we present a neural network to directly infer SDFs from single sparse point clouds without using signed dis-tance supervision, learned priors or even normals. Our in-sight here is to learn surface parameterization and SDFs inference in an end-to-end manner. To make up the spar-sity, we leverage parameterized surfaces as a coarse sur-face sampler to provide many coarse surface estimations in training iterations, according to which we mine super-vision and our thin plate splines (TPS) based network in-fers SDFs as smooth functions in a statistical way. Our method signiÔ¨Åcantly improves the generalization ability and accuracy in unseen point clouds. Our experimental result-s show our advantages over the state-of-the-art method-s in surface reconstruction for sparse point clouds under synthetic datasets and real scans.The code is available at https://github.com/chenchao15/NeuralTPS.
