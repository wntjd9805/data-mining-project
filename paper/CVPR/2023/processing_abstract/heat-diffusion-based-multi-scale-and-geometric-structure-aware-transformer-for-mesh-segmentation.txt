Triangle mesh segmentation is an important task in 3D shape analysis, especially in applications such as digi-tal humans and AR/VR. Transformer model is inherently permutation-invariant to input, which makes it a suitable candidate model for 3D mesh processing. However, two main challenges involved in adapting Transformer from nat-ural languages to 3D mesh are yet to be solved, such as i) extracting the multi-scale information of mesh data in an adaptive manner; ii) capturing geometric structures of mesh data as the discriminative characteristics of the shape.Current point based Transformer models fail to tackle such challenges and thus provide inferior performance for dis-cretized surface segmentation. In this work, heat diffusion based method is exploited to tackle these problems. A novelTransformer model called MeshFormer is proposed, which i) integrates Heat Diffusion method into Multi-head Self-Attention operation (HDMSA) to adaptively capture the fea-tures from local neighborhood to global contexts; ii) ap-plies a novel Heat Kernel Signature based Structure Encod-ing (HKSSE) to embed the intrinsic geometric structures of mesh instances into Transformer for structure-aware processing. Extensive experiments on triangle mesh seg-mentation validate the effectiveness of the proposed Mesh-Former model and show signiÔ¨Åcant improvements over cur-rent state-of-the-art methods.
