We propose a novel teacher-student model for semi-supervised multi-organ segmentation.In teacher-student model, data augmentation is usually adopted on unlabeled data to regularize the consistent training between teacher and student. We start from a key perspective that fixed rela-tive locations and variable sizes of different organs can pro-vide distribution information where a multi-organ CT scan is drawn. Thus, we treat the prior anatomy as a strong tool to guide the data augmentation and reduce the mismatch between labeled and unlabeled images for semi-supervised learning. More specifically, we propose a data augmen-tation strategy based on partition-and-recovery N3 cubes cross- and within- labeled and unlabeled images. Our strat-egy encourages unlabeled images to learn organ semantics in relative locations from the labeled images (cross-branch) and enhances the learning ability for small organs (within-branch). For within-branch, we further propose to refine the quality of pseudo labels by blending the learned representa-tions from small cubes to incorporate local attributes. Our method is termed as MagicNet, since it treats the CT vol-ume as a magic-cube and N3-cube partition-and-recovery process matches with the rule of playing a magic-cube. Ex-tensive experiments on two public CT multi-organ datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MagicNet, and noticeably outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised medical im-age segmentation approaches, with +7% DSC improve-ment on MACT dataset with 10% labeled images.
