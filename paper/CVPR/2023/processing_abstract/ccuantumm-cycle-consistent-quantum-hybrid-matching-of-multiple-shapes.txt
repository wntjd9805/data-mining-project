Jointly matching multiple, non-rigidly deformed 3D shapes is a challenging, N P-hard problem. A perfect matching is necessarily cycle-consistent: Following the pairwise point correspondences along several shapes must end up at the starting vertex of the original shape. Unfor-tunately, existing quantum shape-matching methods do not support multiple shapes and even less cycle consistency.This paper addresses the open challenges and introduces the first quantum-hybrid approach for 3D shape multi-matching; in addition, it is also cycle-consistent. Its itera-tive formulation is admissible to modern adiabatic quantum hardware and scales linearly with the total number of input shapes. Both these characteristics are achieved by reduc-ing the N -shape case to a sequence of three-shape match-ings, the derivation of which is our main technical contribu-tion. Thanks to quantum annealing, high-quality solutions with low energy are retrieved for the intermediate N P-hard objectives. On benchmark datasets, the proposed ap-proach significantly outperforms extensions to multi-shape matching of a previous quantum-hybrid two-shape match-ing method and is on-par with classical multi-matching methods.
