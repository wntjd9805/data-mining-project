In this paper, a novel virtual try-on algorithm, dubbedSAL-VTON, is proposed, which links the garment with the person via semantically associated landmarks to alleviate misalignment. The semantically associated landmarks are a series of landmark pairs with the same local seman-tics on the in-shop garment image and the try-on image.Based on the semantically associated landmarks, SAL-VTON effectively models the local semantic association between garment and person, making up for the misalign-ment in the overall deformation of the garment.The outcome is achieved with a three-stage framework: 1) the semantically associated landmarks are estimated using the landmark localization model; 2) taking the landmarks as input, the warping model explicitly associates the corre-sponding parts of the garment and person for obtaining the local flow, thus refining the alignment in the global flow; 3) finally, a generator consumes the landmarks to better capture local semantics and control the try-on results. Moreover, we propose a new landmark dataset with a unified labelling rule of landmarks for diverseExtensive experimental results on styles of garments.*Co-first authors contributed equally, â€  Corresponding author. popular datasets demonstrate that SAL-VTON can handle misalignment and outperform state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.
