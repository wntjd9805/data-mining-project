Weakly-Supervised Video Grounding (WSVG) aims to localize events of interest in untrimmed videos with only video-level annotations. To date, most of the state-of-the-artWSVG methods follow a two-stage pipeline, i.e., firstly gen-erating potential temporal proposals and then grounding with these proposal candidates. Despite the recent progress, existing proposal generation methods suffer from two draw-backs: 1) lack of explicit correspondence modeling; and 2) partial coverage of complex events. To this end, we propose a novel IteRative prOposal refiNement network (dubbed asIRON) to gradually distill the prior knowledge into each proposal and encourage proposals with more complete cov-erage. Specifically, we set up two lightweight distillation branches to uncover the cross-modal correspondence on both the semantic and conceptual levels. Then, an itera-tive Label Propagation (LP) strategy is devised to prevent the network from focusing excessively on the most discrim-inative events instead of the whole sentence content. Pre-cisely, during each iteration, the proposal with the minimal distillation loss and its adjacent ones are regarded as the positive samples, which refines proposal confidence scores in a cascaded manner. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on two challenging WSVG datasets have attested to the effectiveness of our IRON. The code will be available at https://github.com/mengcaopku/IRON.
