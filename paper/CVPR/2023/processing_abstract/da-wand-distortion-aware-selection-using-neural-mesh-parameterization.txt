We present a neural technique for learning to select a local sub-region around a point which can be used for mesh parameterization. The motivation for our framework is driven by interactive workflows used for decaling, tex-turing, or painting on surfaces. Our key idea is to incor-porate segmentation probabilities as weights of a classi-cal parameterization method, implemented as a novel dif-ferentiable parameterization layer within a neural network framework. We train a segmentation network to select 3D regions that are parameterized into 2D and penalized by the resulting distortion, giving rise to segmentations which are distortion-aware. Following training, a user can use our system to interactively select a point on the mesh and ob-tain a large, meaningful region around the selection which induces a low-distortion parameterization. Our code1 and project2 are publicly available.
