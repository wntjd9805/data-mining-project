In this paper, we present a new MTL framework that searches for structures optimized for multiple tasks with di-verse graph topologies and shares features among tasks.We design a restricted DAG-based central network with read-in/read-out layers to build topologically diverse task-adaptive structures while limiting search space and time.We search for a single optimized network that serves as multiple task adaptive sub-networks using our three-stage training process. To make the network compact and dis-cretized, we propose a ï¬‚ow-based reduction algorithm and a squeeze loss used in the training process. We evaluate our optimized network on various public MTL datasets and show ours achieves state-of-the-art performance. An exten-sive ablation study experimentally validates the effective-ness of the sub-module and schemes in our framework.
