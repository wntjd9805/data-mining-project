Differences in forgery attributes of images generated inCNN-synthesized and image-editing domains are large, and such differences make a unified image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) challenging. To this end, we present a hierarchical fine-grained formulation for IFDL represen-tation learning. Specifically, we first represent forgery at-tributes of a manipulated image with multiple labels at different levels. Then we perform fine-grained classifica-tion at these levels using the hierarchical dependency be-tween them. As a result, the algorithm is encouraged to learn both comprehensive features and inherent hierarchi-cal nature of different forgery attributes, thereby improving the IFDL representation. Our proposed IFDL framework contains three components: multi-branch feature extrac-tor, localization and classification modules. Each branch of the feature extractor learns to classify forgery attributes at one level, while localization and classification modules segment the pixel-level forgery region and detect image-level forgery, respectively. Lastly, we construct a hier-archical fine-grained dataset to facilitate our study. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on 7 different benchmarks, for both tasks of IFDL and forgery attribute classification.
