Unlike most previous HOI methods that focus on learn-ing better human-object features, we propose a novel and complementary approach called category query learning.Such queries are explicitly associated to interaction cat-egories, converted to image specific category representa-tion via a transformer decoder, and learnt via an auxil-iary image-level classification task. This idea is motivated by an earlier multi-label image classification method, but is for the first time applied for the challenging human-object interaction classification task. Our method is sim-It is validated on three rep-ple, general and effective. resentative HOI baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks.
