Recently, semi-supervised semantic segmentation has achieved promising performance with a small fraction of labeled data. However, most existing studies treat all unla-beled data equally and barely consider the differences and training difficulties among unlabeled instances. Differen-tiating unlabeled instances can promote instance-specific supervision to adapt to the model’s evolution dynamically. instanceIn this paper, we emphasize the cruciality of differences and propose an instance-specific and model-adaptive supervision for semi-supervised semantic segmen-tation, named iMAS. Relying on the model’s performance, iMAS employs a class-weighted symmetric intersection-over-union to evaluate quantitative hardness of each un-labeled instance and supervises the training on unlabeled data in a model-adaptive manner. Specifically, iMAS learns from unlabeled instances progressively by weighing their corresponding consistency losses based on the evaluated hardness. Besides, iMAS dynamically adjusts the augmen-tation for each instance such that the distortion degree of augmented instances is adapted to the model’s generaliza-tion capability across the training course. Not integrating additional losses and training procedures, iMAS can obtain remarkable performance gains against current state-of-the-art approaches on segmentation benchmarks under different semi-supervised partition protocols1.
