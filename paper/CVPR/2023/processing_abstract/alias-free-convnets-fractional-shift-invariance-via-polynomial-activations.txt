Although CNNs are believed to be invariant to transla-tions, recent works have shown this is not the case due to aliasing effects that stem from down-sampling layers. The existing architectural solutions to prevent the aliasing ef-fects are partial since they do not solve those effects that originate in non-linearities. We propose an extended anti-aliasing method that tackles both down-sampling and non-linear layers, thus creating truly alias-free, shift-invariantCNNs1. We show that the presented model is invariant to integer as well as fractional (i.e., sub-pixel) translations, thus outperforming other shift-invariant methods in terms of robustness to adversarial translations.
