Discriminating known from unknown objects is an im-portant essential ability for human beings. To simulate this ability, a task of unsupervised out-of-distribution object de-tection (OOD-OD) is proposed to detect the objects that are never-seen-before during model training, which is ben-eficial for promoting the safe deployment of object detec-tors. Due to lacking unknown data for supervision, for this task, the main challenge lies in how to leverage the known in-distribution (ID) data to improve the detectorâ€™s discrim-ination ability.In this paper, we first propose a method of Structure-Enhanced Recurrent Variational AutoEncoder (SR-VAE), which mainly consists of two dedicated recurrentVAE branches. Specifically, to boost the performance of ob-ject localization, we explore utilizing the classical Lapla-cian of Gaussian (LoG) operator to enhance the structure information in the extracted low-level features. Meanwhile, we design a VAE branch that recurrently generates the aug-mentation of the classification features to strengthen the dis-crimination ability of the object classifier. Finally, to alle-viate the impact of lacking unknown data, another cycle-consistent conditional VAE branch is proposed to synthesize virtual OOD features that deviate from the distribution ofID features, which improves the capability of distinguishingOOD objects. In the experiments, our method is evaluated on OOD-OD, open-vocabulary detection, and incremental object detection. The significant performance gains over baselines show the superiorities of our method. The code will be released at https://github.com/AmingWu/SR-VAE.
