Recent efforts in Neural Rendering Fields (NeRF) have shown impressive results on novel view synthesis by utiliz-ing implicit neural representation to represent 3D scenes.Due to the process of volumetric rendering, the inference speed for NeRF is extremely slow, limiting the application scenarios of utilizing NeRF on resource-constrained hard-ware, such as mobile devices. Many works have been con-ducted to reduce the latency of running NeRF models. How-ever, most of them still require high-end GPU for accel-eration or extra storage memory, which is all unavailable on mobile devices. Another emerging direction utilizes the neural light ﬁeld (NeLF) for speedup, as only one forward pass is performed on a ray to predict the pixel color. Nev-ertheless, to reach a similar rendering quality as NeRF, the network in NeLF is designed with intensive computation, which is not mobile-friendly. In this work, we propose an efﬁcient network that runs in real-time on mobile devices for neural rendering. We follow the setting of NeLF to train our network. Unlike existing works, we introduce a novel network architecture that runs efﬁciently on mobile devices with low latency and small size, i.e., saving 15⇥ storage compared with MobileNeRF. Our model achieves high-resolution generation while maintaining real-time in-ference for both synthetic and real-world scenes on mo-bile devices, e.g., 18.04ms (iPhone 13) for rendering one 1008 756 image of real 3D scenes. Additionally, we achieve similar image quality as NeRF and better quality than MobileNeRF (PSNR 26.15 vs. 25.91 on the real-world forward-facing dataset)1.⇥ ⇠ 24⇥
