Flash is an essential tool as it often serves as the sole controllable light source in everyday photography. How-ever, the use of flash is a binary decision at the time a photograph is captured with limited control over its char-acteristics such as strength or color. In this work, we study the computational control of the flash light in photographs taken with or without flash. We present a physically moti-vated intrinsic formulation for flash photograph formation and develop flash decomposition and generation methods for flash and no-flash photographs, respectively. We demon-strate that our intrinsic formulation outperforms alterna-tives in the literature and allows us to computationally con-trol flash in in-the-wild images.
