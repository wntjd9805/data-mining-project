While raw images exhibit advantages over sRGB images (e.g., linearity and fine-grained quantization level), they are not widely used by common users due to the large stor-age requirements. Very recent works propose to compress raw images by designing the sampling masks in the raw image pixel space, leading to suboptimal image represen-tations and redundant metadata. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to learn a compact representation in the latent space serving as the metadata in an end-to-end man-ner. Furthermore, we propose a novel sRGB-guided con-text model with the improved entropy estimation strategies, which leads to better reconstruction quality, smaller size of metadata, and faster speed. We illustrate how the pro-posed raw image compression scheme can adaptively al-locate more bits to image regions that are important from a global perspective. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve superior raw image re-construction results using a smaller size of the metadata on both uncompressed sRGB images and JPEG images.The code will be released at https://github.com/ wyf0912/R2LCM .
