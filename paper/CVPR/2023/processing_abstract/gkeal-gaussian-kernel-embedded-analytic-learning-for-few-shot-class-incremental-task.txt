Few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to address catastrophic forgetting during class incremental learning in a few-shot learning setting. In this paper, we approach the FSCIL by adopting analytic learning, a tech-nique that converts network training into linear problems.This is inspired by the fact that the recursive implemen-tation (batch-by-batch learning) of analytic learning gives identical weights to that produced by training on the en-tire dataset at once. The recursive implementation and the weight-identical property highly resemble the FSCIL setting (phase-by-phase learning) and its goal of avoiding catas-trophic forgetting. By bridging the FSCIL with the ana-lytic learning, we propose a Gaussian kernel embedded an-alytic learning (GKEAL) for FSCIL. The key components of GKEAL include the kernel analytic module which allows the GKEAL to conduct FSCIL in a recursive manner, and the augmented feature concatenation module that balances the preference between old and new tasks especially effec-tively under the few-shot setting. Our experiments show that the GKEAL gives state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.
