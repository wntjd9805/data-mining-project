Recently, there has been a significant advancement in image generation technology, known as GAN. It can easily generate realistic fake images, leading to an increased risk of abuse. However, most image detectors suffer from sharp performance drops in unseen domains. The key of fake im-age detection is to develop a generalized representation to describe the artifacts produced by generation models. In this work, we introduce a novel detection framework, namedLearning on Gradients (LGrad), designed for identifyingGAN-generated images, with the aim of constructing a gen-eralized detector with cross-model and cross-data. Specif-ically, a pretrained CNN model is employed as a trans-formation model to convert images into gradients. Sub-sequently, we leverage these gradients to present the gen-eralized artifacts, which are fed into the classifier to as-certain the authenticity of the images. In our framework, we turn the data-dependent problem into a transformation-model-dependent problem. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize gradients as the representa-tion of artifacts in GAN-generated images. Extensive ex-periments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of gradients as generalized artifact representations. Our de-tector achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a remarkable gain of 11.4%. The code is released at https://github.com/chuangchuangtan/LGrad.
