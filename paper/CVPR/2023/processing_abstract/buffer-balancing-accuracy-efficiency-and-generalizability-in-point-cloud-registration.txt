An ideal point cloud registration framework should have superior accuracy, acceptable efficiency, and strong gener-alizability. However, this is highly challenging since exist-ing registration techniques are either not accurate enough, far from efficient, or generalized poorly. It remains an open question that how to achieve a satisfying balance between this three key elements. In this paper, we propose BUFFER, a point cloud registration method for balancing accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability. The key to our approach is to take advantage of both point-wise and patch-wise tech-niques, while overcoming the inherent drawbacks simulta-neously. Different from a simple combination of existing methods, each component of our network has been carefully crafted to tackle specific issues. Specifically, a Point-wiseLearner is first introduced to enhance computational effi-ciency by predicting keypoints and improving the represen-tation capacity of features by estimating point orientations, a Patch-wise Embedder which leverages a lightweight lo-cal feature learner is then deployed to extract efficient and general patch features. Additionally, an Inliers Generator which combines simple neural layers and general features is presented to search inlier correspondences. Extensive experiments on real-world scenarios demonstrate that our method achieves the best of both worlds in accuracy, effi-ciency, and generalization. In particular, our method not only reaches the highest success rate on unseen domains, but also is almost 30 times faster than the strong base-lines specializing in generalization.
