Single image defocus deblurring (SIDD) refers to recov-ering an all-in-focus image from a defocused blurry one. It is a challenging recovery task due to the spatially-varying defocus blurring effects with signiﬁcant size variation. Mo-tivated by the strong correlation among defocus kernels of different sizes and the blob-type structure of defocus ker-nels, we propose a learnable recursive kernel representa-tion (RKR) for defocus kernels that expresses a defocus ker-nel by a linear combination of recursive, separable and pos-itive atom kernels, leading to a compact yet effective and physics-encoded parametrization of the spatially-varying defocus blurring process. Afterwards, a physics-driven and efﬁcient deep model with a cross-scale fusion structure is presented for SIDD, with inspirations from the truncatedNeumann series for approximating the matrix inversion of the RKR-based blurring operator. In addition, a reblurring loss is proposed to regularize the RKR learning. Extensive experiments show that, our proposed approach signiﬁcantly outperforms existing ones, with a model size comparable to that of the top methods.
