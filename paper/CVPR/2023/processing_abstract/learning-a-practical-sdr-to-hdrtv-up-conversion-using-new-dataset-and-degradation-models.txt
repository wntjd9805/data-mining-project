at: https://github.com/AndreGuo/HDRTVDM .In media industry, the demand of SDR-to-HDRTV up-conversion arises when users possess HDR-WCG (high dy-namic range-wide color gamut) TVs while most off-the-shelf footage is still in SDR (standard dynamic range). The re-search community has started tackling this low-level vision task by learning-based approaches. When applied to realSDR, yet, current methods tend to produce dim and desat-urated result, making nearly no improvement on viewing experience. Different from other network-oriented meth-ods, we attribute such deficiency to training set (HDR-SDR pair). Consequently, we propose new HDRTV dataset (dubbed HDRTV4K) and new HDR-to-SDR degradation models. Then, itâ€™s used to train a luminance-segmented network (LSN) consisting of a global mapping trunk, and two Transformer branches on bright and dark luminance range. We also update assessment criteria by tailored met-rics and subjective experiment. Finally, ablation studies are conducted to prove the effectiveness. Our work is available
