Masked signal modeling has greatly advanced self-supervised pre-training for language and 2D images. How-ever, it is still not fully explored in 3D scene understand-ing. Thus, this paper introduces Masked Shape Prediction (MSP), a new framework to conduct masked signal model-ing in 3D scenes. MSP uses the essential 3D semantic cue, i.e., geometric shape, as the prediction target for masked points. The context-enhanced shape target consisting of ex-plicit shape context and implicit deep shape feature is pro-posed to facilitate exploiting contextual cues in shape pre-diction. Meanwhile, the pre-training architecture in MSP is carefully designed to alleviate the masked shape leakage from point coordinates. Experiments on multiple 3D under-standing tasks on both indoor and outdoor datasets demon-strate the effectiveness of MSP in learning good feature rep-resentations to consistently boost downstream performance.
