The detector-free feature matching approaches are cur-rently attracting great attention thanks to their excellent performance. However, these methods still struggle at large-scale and viewpoint variations, due to the geomet-the ric inconsistency resulting from the application of mutual nearest neighbour criterion (i.e., one-to-one as-signment) in patch-level matching. Accordingly, we in-troduce AdaMatcher, which first accomplishes the fea-ture correlation and co-visible area estimation through an elaborate feature interaction module, then performs adaptive assignment on patch-level matching while es-timating the scales between images, and finally refines the co-visible matches through scale alignment and sub-pixel regression module.Extensive experiments show that AdaMatcher outperforms solid baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results on many downstream tasks. Ad-ditionally, the adaptive assignment and sub-pixel refine-ment module can be used as a refinement network for other matching methods, such as SuperGlue, to boost their per-formance further. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/AbyssGaze/AdaMatcher.
