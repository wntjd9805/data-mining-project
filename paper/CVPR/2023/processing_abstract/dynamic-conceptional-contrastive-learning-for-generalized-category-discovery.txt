Generalized category discovery (GCD) is a recently pro-posed open-world problem, which aims to automatically cluster partially labeled data. The main challenge is that the unlabeled data contain instances that are not only from known categories of the labeled data but also from novel categories. This leads traditional novel category discov-ery (NCD) methods to be incapacitated for GCD, due to their assumption of unlabeled data are only from novel categories. One effective way for GCD is applying self-supervised learning to learn discriminate representation for unlabeled data. However, this manner largely ignores un-derlying relationships between instances of the same con-cepts (e.g., class, super-class, and sub-class), which re-In this paper, sults in inferior representation learning. we propose a Dynamic Conceptional Contrastive Learn-ing (DCCL) framework, which can effectively improve clus-tering accuracy by alternately estimating underlying vi-sual conceptions and learning conceptional representation.In addition, we design a dynamic conception generation and update mechanism, which is able to ensure consis-tent conception learning and thus further facilitate the opti-mization of DCCL. Extensive experiments show that DCCL achieves new state-of-the-art performances on six generic and fine-grained visual recognition datasets, especially on fine-grained ones. For example, our method significantly surpasses the best competitor by 16.2% on the new classes for the CUB-200 dataset. Code is available at https://github.com/TPCD/DCCL
