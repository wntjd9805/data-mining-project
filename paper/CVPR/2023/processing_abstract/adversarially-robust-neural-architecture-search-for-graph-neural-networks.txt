Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) obtain tremendous suc-cess in modeling relational data. Still, they are prone to adversarial attacks, which are massive threats to applyingGNNs to risk-sensitive domains. Existing defensive meth-ods neither guarantee performance facing new data/tasks or adversarial attacks nor provide insights to understandGNN robustness from an architectural perspective. NeuralArchitecture Search (NAS) has the potential to solve this problem by automating GNN architecture designs. Never-theless, current graph NAS approaches lack robust design and are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Robust Neural Architecture search framework for GNNs (G-RNA). Specifically, we de-sign a robust search space for the message-passing mech-anism by adding graph structure mask operations into the search space, which comprises various defensive operation candidates and allows us to search for defensive GNNs. Fur-thermore, we define a robustness metric to guide the search procedure, which helps to filter robust architectures. In this way, G-RNA helps understand GNN robustness from an ar-chitectural perspective and effectively searches for optimal adversarial robust GNNs. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets show that G-RNA significantly outper-forms manually designed robust GNNs and vanilla graphNAS baselines by 12.1% to 23.4% under adversarial attacks.
