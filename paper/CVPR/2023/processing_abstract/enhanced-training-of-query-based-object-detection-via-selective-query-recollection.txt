This paper investigates a phenomenon where query-based object detectors mispredict at the last decoding stage while predicting correctly at an intermediate stage. We review the training process and attribute the overlooked phenomenon to two limitations: lack of training emphasis and cascading errors from decoding sequence. We design and present Selective Query Recollection (SQR), a simple and effective training strategy for query-based object detec-tors. It cumulatively collects intermediate queries as decod-ing stages go deeper and selectively forwards the queries to the downstream stages aside from the sequential struc-ture. Such-wise, SQR places training emphasis on later stages and allows later stages to work with intermediate queries from earlier stages directly. SQR can be easily plugged into various query-based object detectors and sig-nificantly enhances their performance while leaving the in-ference pipeline unchanged. As a result, we apply SQR onAdamixer, DAB-DETR, and Deformable-DETR across var-ious settings (backbone, number of queries, schedule) and consistently brings 1.4 âˆ¼ 2.8 AP improvement.
