We introduce a method that can learn to predict scene-level implicit functions for 3D reconstruction from posedRGBD data. At test time, our system maps a previously unseen RGB image to a 3D reconstruction of a scene via implicit functions. While implicit functions for 3D recon-struction have often been tied to meshes, we show that we can train one using only a set of posed RGBD images. This setting may help 3D reconstruction unlock the sea of ac-celerometer+RGBD data that is coming with new phones.Our system, D2-DRDF, can match and sometimes outper-form current methods that use mesh supervision and shows better robustness to sparse data.
