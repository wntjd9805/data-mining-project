In this paper, we delve into semi-supervised 2D human pose estimation. The previous method ignored two prob-lems: (i) When conducting interactive training between large model and lightweight model, the pseudo label of lightweight model will be used to guide large models. (ii)The negative impact of noise pseudo labels on training.Moreover, the labels used for 2D human pose estimation are relatively complex: keypoint category and keypoint po-sition. To solve the problems mentioned above, we pro-pose a semi-supervised 2D human pose estimation frame-work driven by a position inconsistency pseudo label cor-rection module (SSPCM). We introduce an additional auxil-iary teacher and use the pseudo labels generated by the two teacher model in different periods to calculate the inconsis-tency score and remove outliers. Then, the two teacher mod-els are updated through interactive training, and the student model is updated using the pseudo labels generated by two teachers. To further improve the performance of the student model, we use the semi-supervised Cut-Occlude based on pseudo keypoint perception to generate more hard and ef-fective samples. In addition, we also proposed a new indoor overhead fisheye human keypoint dataset WEPDTOF-Pose.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outper-forms the previous best semi-supervised 2D human pose es-timation method. We will release the code and dataset at https://github.com/hlz0606/SSPCM.*This work was done when the authors were visiting Beike as interns.â€ Corresponding author.Figure 1. Performance comparison between our method SSPCM and SOTA method (DataDistill [33], DUAL [46]) on COCO [28] dataset. On the COCO dataset, using 1000, 5000, and 10000 labeled person instances, our method has increased 2.3mAP, 1.9mAP, and 1.1mAP compared with the previous method.
