2D-based Industrial Anomaly Detection has been widely discussed, however, multimodal industrial anomaly detec-tion based on 3D point clouds and RGB images still has many untouched fields. Existing multimodal industrial anomaly detection methods directly concatenate the mul-timodal features, which leads to a strong disturbance be-tween features and harms the detection performance. In this paper, we propose Multi-3D-Memory (M3DM), a novel multimodal anomaly detection method with hybrid fusion scheme: firstly, we design an unsupervised feature fusion with patch-wise contrastive learning to encourage the in-teraction of different modal features; secondly, we use a decision layer fusion with multiple memory banks to avoid loss of information and additional novelty classifiers to make the final decision. We further propose a point fea-ture alignment operation to better align the point cloud andRGB features. Extensive experiments show that our multi-modal industrial anomaly detection model outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both detection and seg-mentation precision on MVTec-3D AD dataset.
