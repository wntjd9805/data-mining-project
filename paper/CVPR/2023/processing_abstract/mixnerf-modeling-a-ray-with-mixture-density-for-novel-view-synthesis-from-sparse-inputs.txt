Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) has broken new ground in the novel view synthesis due to its simple concept and state-of-the-art quality. However, it suffers from severe per-formance degradation unless trained with a dense set of im-ages with different camera poses, which hinders its prac-tical applications. Although previous methods addressing this problem achieved promising results, they relied heav-ily on the additional training resources, which goes against the philosophy of sparse-input novel-view synthesis pursu-ing the training efficiency. In this work, we propose MixN-eRF, an effective training strategy for novel view synthe-sis from sparse inputs by modeling a ray with a mixture density model. Our MixNeRF estimates the joint distribu-tion of RGB colors along the ray samples by modeling it with mixture of distributions. We also propose a new task of ray depth estimation as a useful training objective, which is highly correlated with 3D scene geometry. Moreover, we re-model the colors with regenerated blending weights based on the estimated ray depth and further improves the robust-ness for colors and viewpoints. Our MixNeRF outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in various standard bench-marks with superior efficiency of training and inference.
