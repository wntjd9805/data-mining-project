This paper explores the potential of curriculum learn-ing in LiDAR-based 3D object detection by proposing a curricular object manipulation (COM) framework. The framework embeds the curricular training strategy into both the loss design and the augmentation process. For the loss design, we propose the COMLoss to dynamically pre-dict object-level difficulties and emphasize objects of dif-ferent difficulties based on training stages. On top of the widely-used augmentation technique called GT-Aug in Li-DAR detection tasks, we propose a novel COMAug strategy which first clusters objects in ground-truth database based on well-designed heuristics. Group-level difficulties rather than individual ones are then predicted and updated during training for stable results. Model performance and general-ization capabilities can be improved by sampling and aug-menting progressively more difficult objects into the train-ing samples. Extensive experiments and ablation studies re-veal the superior and generality of the proposed framework.The code is available at https://github.com/ZZY816/COM.
