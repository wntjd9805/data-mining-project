In this paper, we propose binary sparse convolutional networks called BSC-Net for efﬁcient point cloud analysis.We empirically observe that sparse convolution operation causes larger quantization errors than standard convolu-tion. However, conventional network quantization methods directly binarize the weights and activations in sparse con-volution, resulting in performance drop due to the signif-icant quantization loss. On the contrary, we search the optimal subset of convolution operation that activates the sparse convolution at various locations for quantization error alleviation, and the performance gap between real-valued and binary sparse convolutional networks is closed without complexity overhead. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst present the shifted sparse convolution that fuses the information in the receptive ﬁeld for the active sites that match the pre-deﬁned positions. Then we employ the differentiable search strategies to discover the optimal opsitions for active site matching in the shifted sparse convolution, and the quanti-zation errors are signiﬁcantly alleviated for efﬁcient point cloud analysis. For fair evaluation of the proposed method, we empirically select the recently advances that are bene-ﬁcial for sparse convolution network binarization to con-struct a strong baseline. The experimental results on Scan-Net and NYU Depth v2 show that our BSC-Net achieves sig-niﬁcant improvement upon our srtong baseline and outper-forms the state-of-the-art network binarization methods by a remarkable margin without additional computation over-head for binarizing sparse convolutional networks.
