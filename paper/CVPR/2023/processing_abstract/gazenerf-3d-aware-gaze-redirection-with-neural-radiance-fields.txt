We propose GazeNeRF, a 3D-aware method for the task of gaze redirection. Existing gaze redirection meth-ods operate on 2D images and struggle to generate 3D consistent results. Instead, we build on the intu-ition that the face region and eyeballs are separate 3D structures that move in a coordinated yet independent fashion. Our method leverages recent advancements in conditional image-based neural radiance fields and pro-poses a two-stream architecture that predicts volumetric features for the face and eye regions separately. Rigidly transforming the eye features via a 3D rotation matrix provides fine-grained control over the desired gaze an-gle. The final, redirected image is then attained via dif-ferentiable volume compositing. Our experiments show that this architecture outperforms na¨ıvely conditionedNeRF baselines as well as previous state-of-the-art 2D gaze redirection methods in terms of redirection accu-racy and identity preservation. Code and models will be released for research purposes.
