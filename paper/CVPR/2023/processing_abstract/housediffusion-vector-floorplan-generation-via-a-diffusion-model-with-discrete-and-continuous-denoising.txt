The paper presents a novel approach for vector-floorplan generation via a diffusion model, which denoises 2D coordinates of room/door corners with two inference ob-jectives: 1) a single-step noise as the continuous quantity to precisely invert the continuous forward process; and 2) the final 2D coordinate as the discrete quantity to establish ge-ometric incident relationships such as parallelism, orthog-onality, and corner-sharing. Our task is graph-conditioned floorplan generation, a common workflow in floorplan de-sign. We represent a floorplan as 1D polygonal loops, each of which corresponds to a room or a door. Our dif-fusion model employs a Transformer architecture at the core, which controls the attention masks based on the in-put graph-constraint and directly generates vector-graphics floorplans via a discrete and continuous denoising pro-cess. We have evaluated our approach on RPLAN dataset.The proposed approach makes significant improvements in all the metrics against the state-of-the-art with significant margins, while being capable of generating non-Manhattan structures and controlling the exact number of corners per room.
