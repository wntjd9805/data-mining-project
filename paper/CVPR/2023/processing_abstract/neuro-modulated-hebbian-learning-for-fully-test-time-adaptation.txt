Fully test-time adaptation aims to adapt the network model based on sequential analysis of input samples dur-ing the inference stage to address the cross-domain per-formance degradation problem of deep neural networks.We take inspiration from the biological plausibility learn-ing where the neuron responses are tuned based on a lo-cal synapse-change procedure and activated by competi-tive lateral inhibition rules. Based on these feed-forward learning rules, we design a soft Hebbian learning process which provides an unsupervised and effective mechanism for online adaptation. We observe that the performance of this feed-forward Hebbian learning for fully test-time adaptation can be significantly improved by incorporating a feedback neuro-modulation layer. It is able to fine-tune the neuron responses based on the external feedback gener-ated by the error back-propagation from the top inference layers. This leads to our proposed neuro-modulated Heb-bian learning (NHL) method for fully test-time adaptation.With the unsupervised feed-forward soft Hebbian learning being combined with a learned neuro-modulator to capture feedback from external responses, the source model can be effectively adapted during the testing process. Experimen-tal results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our pro-posed method can significantly improve the adaptation per-formance of network models and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.
