LiDAR relocalization plays a crucial role in many fields, including robotics, autonomous driving, and computer vi-sion. LiDAR-based retrieval from a database typically incurs high computation storage costs and can lead to globally inaccurate pose estimations if the database is too sparse.On the other hand, pose regression methods take images or point clouds as inputs and directly regress global poses in an end-to-end manner. They do not perform database matching and are more computationally efficient than re-trieval techniques. We propose HypLiLoc, a new model for LiDAR pose regression. We use two branched back-bones to extract 3D features and 2D projection features, respectively. We consider multi-modal feature fusion in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces to obtain more ef-fective feature representations. Experimental results indi-cate that HypLiLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both outdoor and indoor datasets. We also conduct ex-tensive ablation studies on the framework design, which demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-modal feature extrac-tion and multi-space embedding.
