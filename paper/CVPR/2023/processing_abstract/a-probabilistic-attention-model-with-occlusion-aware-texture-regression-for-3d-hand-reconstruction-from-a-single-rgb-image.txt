Recently, deep learning based approaches have shown promising results in 3D hand reconstruction from a singleRGB image. These approaches can be roughly divided into model-based approaches, which are heavily dependent on the model’s parameter space, and model-free approaches, which require large numbers of 3D ground truths to reduce depth ambiguity and struggle in weakly-supervised scenar-ios. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel proba-bilistic model to achieve the robustness of model-based ap-proaches and reduced dependence on the model’s param-eter space of model-free approaches. The proposed prob-abilistic model incorporates a model-based network as a prior-net to estimate the prior probability distribution of joints and vertices. An Attention-based Mesh Vertices Un-certainty Regression (AMVUR) model is proposed to cap-ture dependencies among vertices and the correlation be-tween joints and mesh vertices to improve their feature rep-resentation. We further propose a learning based occlusion-aware Hand Texture Regression model to achieve high-fidelity texture reconstruction. We demonstrate the flexibil-ity of the proposed probabilistic model to be trained in both supervised and weakly-supervised scenarios. The experi-mental results demonstrate our probabilistic model’s state-of-the-art accuracy in 3D hand and texture reconstruction from a single image in both training schemes, including in the presence of severe occlusions.
