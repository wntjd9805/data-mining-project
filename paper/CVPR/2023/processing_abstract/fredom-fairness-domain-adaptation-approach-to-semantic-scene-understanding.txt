Although Domain Adaptation in Semantic Scene Seg-mentation has shown impressive improvement in recent years, the fairness concerns in the domain adaptation have yet to be well defined and addressed. In addition, fairness is one of the most critical aspects when deploying the segmen-tation models into human-related real-world applications, e.g., autonomous driving, as any unfair predictions could influence human safety. In this paper, we propose a novelFairness Domain Adaptation (FREDOM) approach to se-mantic scene segmentation. In particular, from the proposed formulated fairness objective, a new adaptation framework will be introduced based on the fair treatment of class distri-butions. Moreover, to generally model the context of struc-tural dependency, a new conditional structural constraint is introduced to impose the consistency of predicted segmen-tation. Thanks to the proposed Conditional Structure Net-work, the self-attention mechanism has sufficiently modeled the structural information of segmentation. Through the ab-lation studies, the proposed method has shown the perfor-mance improvement of the segmentation models and pro-moted fairness in the model predictions. The experimental results on the two standard benchmarks, i.e., SYNTHIA →Cityscapes and GTA5 → Cityscapes, have shown that our method achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance1.
