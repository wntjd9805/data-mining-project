We propose PAniC-3D, a system to reconstruct stylized 3D character heads directly from illustrated (p)ortraits of (ani)me (c)haracters. Our anime-style domain poses unique challenges to single-view reconstruction; compared to nat-ural images of human heads, character portrait illustra-tions have hair and accessories with more complex and diverse geometry, and are shaded with non-photorealistic contour lines. In addition, there is a lack of both 3D model and portrait illustration data suitable to train and evaluate this ambiguous stylized reconstruction task. Facing these challenges, our proposed PAniC-3D architecture crosses the illustration-to-3D domain gap with a line-filling model, and represents sophisticated geometries with a volumetric radiance field. We train our system with two large new datasets (11.2k Vroid 3D models, 1k Vtuber portrait illus-trations), and evaluate on a novel AnimeRecon benchmark of illustration-to-3D pairs. PAniC-3D significantly outper-forms baseline methods, and provides data to establish the task of stylized reconstruction from portrait illustrations. struct a stylized 3D character head directly from illustrated (p)ortraits of (ani)me (c)haracters. We formulate our prob-lem in two parts: 1) implicit single-view head reconstruc-tion, 2) from across an illustration-3D domain gap. To sum-marize our contributions:• PAniC-3D: a system to reconstruct the 3D radiance field of a stylized character head from a single line-based portrait illustration.• The Vroid 3D dataset of 11.2k character models and renders, the first such dataset in the anime-style do-main to provide 3D assets with multiview renders.• The Vtuber dataset of 1.0k reconstruction-friendly portraits (aligned, front-facing, neutral-expression) that bridges the illustration-render domain gap through the novel task of line removal from drawings.• The AnimeRecon benchmark with 68 pairs of aligned 3D models and corresponding illustrations, en-abling quantitative evaluation of both image and geom-etry metrics for stylized reconstruction.
