Eyeglasses play an important role in the perception of identity. Authentic virtual representations of faces can ben-eﬁt greatly from their inclusion. However, modeling the geometric and appearance interactions of glasses and the face of virtual representations of humans is challenging.Glasses and faces affect each other’s geometry at their con-tact points, and also induce appearance changes due to light transport. Most existing approaches do not capture these physical interactions since they model eyeglasses and faces independently. Others attempt to resolve interactions as a 2D image synthesis problem and suffer from view and temporal inconsistencies. In this work, we propose a 3D compositional morphable model of eyeglasses that accu-rately incorporates high-ﬁdelity geometric and photometric interaction effects. To support the large variation in eye-glass topology efﬁciently, we employ a hybrid representa-tion that combines surface geometry and a volumetric rep-resentation. Unlike volumetric approaches, our model natu-rally retains correspondences across glasses, and hence ex-plicit modiﬁcation of geometry, such as lens insertion and frame deformation, is greatly simpliﬁed. In addition, our model is relightable under point lights and natural illumi-nation, supporting high-ﬁdelity rendering of various frame materials, including translucent plastic and metal within a* Work done while Junxuan Li was an intern at Reality Labs Research. single morphable model. Importantly, our approach mod-els global light transport effects, such as casting shadows between faces and glasses. Our morphable model for eye-glasses can also be ﬁt to novel glasses via inverse rendering.We compare our approach to state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate signiﬁcant quality improvements.
