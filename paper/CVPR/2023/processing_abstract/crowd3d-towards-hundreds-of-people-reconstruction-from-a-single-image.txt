Image-based multi-person reconstruction in wide-field large scenes is critical for crowd analysis and security alert.However, existing methods cannot deal with large scenes containing hundreds of people, which encounter the chal-lenges of large number of people, large variations in hu-man scale, and complex spatial distribution. In this paper, we propose Crowd3D, the first framework to reconstruct the 3D poses, shapes and locations of hundreds of people with global consistency from a single large-scene image. The core of our approach is to convert the problem of complex crowd localization into pixel localization with the help of our newly defined concept, Human-scene Virtual Interac-tion Point (HVIP). To reconstruct the crowd with global consistency, we propose a progressive reconstruction net-work based on HVIP by pre-estimating a scene-level cam-era and a ground plane. To deal with a large number of per-sons and various human sizes, we also design an adaptive human-centric cropping scheme. Besides, we contribute a benchmark dataset, LargeCrowd, for crowd reconstruc-tion in a large scene. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
