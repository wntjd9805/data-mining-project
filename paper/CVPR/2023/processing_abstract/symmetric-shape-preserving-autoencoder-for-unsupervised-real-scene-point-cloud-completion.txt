Unsupervised completion of real scene objects is of vi-tal importance but still remains extremely challenging in preserving input shapes, predicting accurate results, and adapting to multi-category data.To solve these prob-lems, we propose in this paper an Unsupervised SymmetricShape-Preserving Autoencoding Network, termed USSPA, to predict complete point clouds of objects from real scenes.One of our main observations is that many natural and man-made objects exhibit significant symmetries. To ac-commodate this, we devise a symmetry learning module to learn from those objects and to preserve structural sym-metries. Starting from an initial coarse predictor, our au-toencoder refines the complete shape with a carefully de-signed upsampling refinement module. Besides the discrim-inative process on the latent space, the discriminators of our USSPA also take predicted point clouds as direct guid-ance, enabling more detailed shape prediction. Clearly different from previous methods which train each category separately, our USSPA can be adapted to the training of multi-category data in one pass through a classifier-guided discriminator, with consistent performance on single cate-gory. For more accurate evaluation, we contribute to the community a real scene dataset with paired CAD models as ground truth. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate our superiority and generalization and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on unsupervised completion of real scene objects.
