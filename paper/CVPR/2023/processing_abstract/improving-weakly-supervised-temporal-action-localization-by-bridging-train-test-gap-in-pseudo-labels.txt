com/zhou745/GauFuse_WSTAL.git.The task of weakly supervised temporal action localiza-tion targets at generating temporal boundaries for actions of interest, meanwhile the action category should also be classified. Pseudo-label-based methods, which serve as an effective solution, have been widely studied recently.However, existing methods generate pseudo labels during training and make predictions during testing under differ-ent pipelines or settings, resulting in a gap between train-ing and testing.In this paper, we propose to generate high-quality pseudo labels from the predicted action bound-aries. Nevertheless, we note that existing post-processing, like NMS, would lead to information loss, which is insuf-ficient to generate high-quality action boundaries. More importantly, transforming action boundaries into pseudo labels is quite challenging, since the predicted action in-stances are generally overlapped and have different confi-dence scores. Besides, the generated pseudo-labels can be fluctuating and inaccurate at the early stage of training. It might repeatedly strengthen the false predictions if there is no mechanism to conduct self-correction. To tackle these issues, we come up with an effective pipeline for learn-ing better pseudo labels. Firstly, we propose a Gaussian weighted fusion module to preserve information of action instances and obtain high-quality action boundaries. Sec-ond, we formulate the pseudo-label generation as an opti-mization problem under the constraints in terms of the con-fidence scores of action instances. Finally, we introduce the idea of âˆ† pseudo labels, which enables the model with the ability of self-correction. Our method achieves supe-rior performance to existing methods on two benchmarks,THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3, achieving gains of 1.9% on THUMOS14 and 3.7% on ActivityNet1.3 in terms of av-erage mAP.
