Recent advances in modeling 3D objects mostly rely on synthetic datasets due to the lack of large-scale real-scanned 3D databases. To facilitate the development of 3D perception, reconstruction, and generation in the real world, we propose OmniObject3D, a large vocabulary 3D object dataset with massive high-quality real-scanned 3D objects. OmniObject3D has several appealing properties: 1) Large Vocabulary: It comprises 6,000 scanned objects in 190 daily categories, sharing common classes with pop-ular 2D datasets (e.g., ImageNet and LVIS), benefiting the pursuit of generalizable 3D representations. 2) Rich An-notations: Each 3D object is captured with both 2D and (cid:66)Corresponding authors. https://omniobject3d.github.io/ 3D sensors, providing textured meshes, point clouds, multi-view rendered images, and multiple real-captured videos. 3)Realistic Scans: The professional scanners support high-quality object scans with precise shapes and realistic ap-pearances. With the vast exploration space offered by Om-niObject3D, we carefully set up four evaluation tracks: a) robust 3D perception, b) novel-view synthesis, c) neural sur-face reconstruction, and d) 3D object generation. Extensive studies are performed on these four benchmarks, revealing new observations, challenges, and opportunities for future research in realistic 3D vision.
