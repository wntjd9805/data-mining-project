LiDAR mapping is important yet challenging in self-driving and mobile robotics. To tackle such a global point cloud registration problem, DeepMapping [1] converts the complex map estimation into a self-supervised training of simple deep networks. Despite its broad convergence range on small datasets, DeepMapping still cannot produce sat-isfactory results on large-scale datasets with thousands of frames. This is due to the lack of loop closures and ex-act cross-frame point correspondences, and the slow con-vergence of its global localization network. We proposeDeepMapping2 by adding two novel techniques to address these issues: (1) organization of training batch based on map topology from loop closing, and (2) self-supervised*Equal contributionâ€ The corresponding author is Chen Feng cfeng@nyu.edu local-to-global point consistency loss leveraging pairwise registration. Our experiments and ablation studies on pub-lic datasets such as KITTI, NCLT, and Nebula demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.
