Recently, numerous end-to-end optimized image com-pression neural networks have been developed and proved themselves as leaders in rate-distortion performance. The main strength of these learnt compression methods is in powerful nonlinear analysis and synthesis transforms that can be facilitated by deep neural networks. However, out of operational expediency, most of these end-to-end methods adopt uniform scalar quantizers rather than vector quantiz-ers, which are information-theoretically optimal. In this pa-per, we present a novel Lattice Vector Quantization scheme coupled with a spatially Adaptive Companding (LVQAC) mapping. LVQ can better exploit the inter-feature depen-dencies than scalar uniform quantization while being com-putationally almost as simple as the latter. Moreover, to improve the adaptability of LVQ to source statistics, we couple a spatially adaptive companding (AC) mapping withLVQ. The resulting LVQAC design can be easily embedded into any end-to-end optimized image compression system.Extensive experiments demonstrate that for any end-to-endCNN image compression models, replacing uniform quan-tizer by LVQAC achieves better rate-distortion performance without significantly increasing the model complexity.
