Gait recognition is one of the most critical long-distance identification technologies and increasingly gains popular-ity in both research and industry communities. Despite the significant progress made in indoor datasets, much evidence shows that gait recognition techniques perform poorly in the wild. More importantly, we also find that some con-clusions drawn from indoor datasets cannot be generalized to real applications. Therefore, the primary goal of this paper is to present a comprehensive benchmark study for better practicality rather than only a particular model for better performance. To this end, we first develop a flexible and efficient gait recognition codebase named OpenGait.Based on OpenGait, we deeply revisit the recent develop-ment of gait recognition by re-conducting the ablative ex-periments. Encouragingly,we detect some unperfect parts of certain prior woks, as well as new insights. Inspired by these discoveries, we develop a structurally simple, empiri-cally powerful, and practically robust baseline model, Gait-Base. Experimentally, we comprehensively compare Gait-Base with many current gait recognition methods on mul-tiple public datasets, and the results reflect that GaitBase achieves significantly strong performance in most cases re-gardless of indoor or outdoor situations.
