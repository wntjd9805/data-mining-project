Correct predictionsCorrect predictionsAs scientiﬁc and technological advancements result from human intellectual labor and computational costs, protect-ing model intellectual property (IP) has become increas-ingly important to encourage model creators and owners.Model IP protection involves preventing the use of well-trained models on unauthorized domains. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called Compact Un-Transferable Isolation Domain (CUTI-domain), which acts as a barrier to block illegal transfers from authorized to unauthorized domains. Speciﬁcally, CUTI-domain blocks cross-domain transfers by highlighting the private style fea-tures of the authorized domain, leading to recognition fail-ure on unauthorized domains with irrelevant private style features. Moreover, we provide two solutions for usingCUTI-domain depending on whether the unauthorized do-main is known or not: target-speciﬁed CUTI-domain and target-free CUTI-domain. Our comprehensive experimen-tal results on four digit datasets, CIFAR10 & STL10, andVisDA-2017 dataset demonstrate that CUTI-domain can be easily implemented as a plug-and-play module with differ-ent backbones, providing an efﬁcient solution for model IP protection.
