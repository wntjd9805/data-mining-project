Cameras and image-editing software often process im-ages in the wide-gamut ProPhoto color space, encompass-ing 90% of all visible colors. However, when images are encoded for sharing, this color-rich representation is trans-formed and clipped to ﬁt within the small-gamut standardRGB (sRGB) color space, representing only 30% of visi-ble colors. Recovering the lost color information is chal-Inspired by neu-lenging due to the clipping procedure. ral implicit representations for 2D images, we propose a method that optimizes a lightweight multi-layer-perceptron (MLP) model during the gamut reduction step to predict the clipped values. GamutMLP takes approximately 2 sec-onds to optimize and requires only 23 KB of storage. The small memory footprint allows our GamutMLP model to be saved as metadata in the sRGB image—the model can be extracted when needed to restore wide-gamut color values.We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for color recovery and compare it with alternative strategies, includ-ing pre-trained DNN-based gamut expansion networks and other implicit neural representation methods. As part of this effort, we introduce a new color gamut dataset of 2200 wide-gamut/small-gamut images for training and testing.
