Recent advances in 3D-aware generative models (3D-aware GANs) combined with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved impressive results. However no prior works investigate 3D-aware GANs for 3D consistent multi-class image-to-image (3D-aware I2I) translation. Naively using 2D-I2I translation methods suffers from unrealistic shape/identity change. To perform 3D-aware multi-classI2I translation, we decouple this learning process into a multi-class 3D-aware GAN step and a 3D-aware I2I trans-*The corresponding author. lation step.In the first step, we propose two novel tech-niques: a new conditional architecture and an effective training strategy.In the second step, based on the well-trained multi-class 3D-aware GAN architecture, that pre-serves view-consistency, we construct a 3D-aware I2I trans-lation system. To further reduce the view-consistency prob-lems, we propose several new techniques, including a U-net-like adaptor network design, a hierarchical representa-tion constrain and a relative regularization loss. In exten-sive experiments on two datasets, quantitative and qualita-tive results demonstrate that we successfully perform 3D-aware I2I translation with multi-view consistency. Code isavailable in 3DI2I.
