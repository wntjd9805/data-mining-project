Recently, self-attention networks achieve impressive per-formance in point cloud segmentation due to their superior-ity in modeling long-range dependencies. However, com-pared to self-attention mechanism, we find graph convolu-tions show a stronger ability in capturing local geometry information with less computational cost. In this paper, we employ a hybrid architecture design to construct our GraphConvolution Network with Attentive Filtering (AF-GCN), which takes advantage of both graph convolution and self-attention mechanism. We adopt graph convolutions to ag-gregate local features in the shallow encoder stages, while in the deeper stages, we propose a self-attention-like mod-ule named Graph Attentive Filter (GAF) to better model long-range contexts from distant neighbors. Besides, to fur-ther improve graph representation for point cloud segmen-tation, we employ a Spatial Feature Projection (SFP) mod-ule for graph convolutions which helps to handle spatial variations of unstructured point clouds. Finally, a graph-shared down-sampling and up-sampling strategy is intro-duced to make full use of the graph structures in point cloud processing. We conduct extensive experiments on multi-ple datasets including S3DIS, ScanNetV2, Toronto-3D, andShapeNetPart. Experimental results show our AF-GCN ob-tains competitive performance.
