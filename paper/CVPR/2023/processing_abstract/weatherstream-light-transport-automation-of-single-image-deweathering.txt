Today single image deweathering is arguably more sen-sitive to the dataset type, rather than the model. We intro-duce WeatherStream, an automatic pipeline capturing all real-world weather effects (rain, snow, and rain fog degra-dations), along with their clean image pairs. Previous state-of-the-art methods that have attempted the all-weather re-moval task train on synthetic pairs, and are thus limited by the Sim2Real domain gap. Recent work has attempted to manually collect time multiplexed pairs, but the use of hu-man labor limits the scale of such a dataset. We introduce a pipeline that uses the power of light-transport physics and a model trained on a small, initial seed dataset to re-ject approximately 99.6% of unwanted scenes. The pipeline is able to generalize to new scenes and degradations that can, in turn, be used to train existing models just like fully human-labeled data. Training on a dataset collected through this procedure leads to significant improvements on multiple existing weather removal methods on a care-fully human-collected test set of real-world weather effects.The dataset and code can be found in the following website: http://visual.ee.ucla.edu/wstream.htm/.
