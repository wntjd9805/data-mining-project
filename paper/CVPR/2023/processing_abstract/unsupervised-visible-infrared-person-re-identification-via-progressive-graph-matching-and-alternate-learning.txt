Unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identiÔ¨Åcation is a challenging task due to the large modality gap and the unavailability of cross-modality correspondences. Cross-modality correspondences are very crucial to bridge theSome existing works try to mine cross-modality gap. modality correspondences, but they focus only on local in-formation. They do not fully exploit the global relationship across identities, thus limiting the quality of the mined cor-respondences. Worse still, the number of clusters of the two modalities is often inconsistent, exacerbating the unrelia-bility of the generated correspondences.In response, we devise a Progressive Graph Matching method to globally mine cross-modality correspondences under cluster imbal-ance scenarios. PGM formulates correspondence mining as a graph matching process and considers the global infor-mation by minimizing the global matching cost, where the matching cost measures the dissimilarity of clusters. Be-sides, PGM adopts a progressive strategy to address the imbalance issue with multiple dynamic matching processes.Based on PGM, we design an Alternate Cross ContrastiveLearning (ACCL) module to reduce the modality gap with the mined cross-modality correspondences, while mitigat-ing the effect of noise in correspondences through an alter-nate scheme. Extensive experiments demonstrate the reli-ability of the generated correspondences and the effective-ness of our method.
