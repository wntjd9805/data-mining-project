Document layout analysis is a crucial prerequisite for document understanding, including document retrieval and conversion. Most public datasets currently contain onlyPDF documents and lack realistic documents. Mod-els trained on these datasets may not generalize well to real-world scenarios. Therefore, this paper introduces a large and diverse document layout analysis dataset calledM 6Doc. The M 6 designation represents six properties: (1) Multi-Format (including scanned, photographed, andPDF documents); (2) Multi-Type (such as scientific arti-cles, textbooks, books, test papers, magazines, newspa-pers, and notes); (3) Multi-Layout (rectangular, Manhattan, non-Manhattan, and multi-column Manhattan); (4) Multi-Language (Chinese and English); (5) Multi-AnnotationCategory (74 types of annotation labels with 237,116 an-notation instances in 9,080 manually annotated pages); and (6) Modern documents. Additionally, we propose a transformer-based document layout analysis method calledTransDLANet, which leverages an adaptive element match-ing mechanism that enables query embedding to better match ground truth to improve recall, and constructs a segmentation branch for more precise document image in-stance segmentation. We conduct a comprehensive evalua-tion of M 6Doc with various layout analysis methods and demonstrate its effectiveness. TransDLANet achieves state-of-the-art performance on M 6Doc with 64.5% mAP.
