InputOutputWe present a efficient multi-view inverse rendering method for large-scale real-world indoor scenes that re-constructs global illumination and physically-reasonableSVBRDFs. Unlike previous representations, where the global illumination of large scenes is simplified as multiple environment maps, we propose a compact representation called Texture-based Lighting (TBL). It consists of 3D mesh and HDR textures, and efficiently models direct and infinite-bounce indirect lighting of the entire large scene. Based onTBL, we further propose a hybrid lighting representation with precomputed irradiance, which significantly improves the efficiency and alleviates the rendering noise in the ma-terial optimization. To physically disentangle the ambiguity between materials, we propose a three-stage material opti-mization strategy based on the priors of semantic segmen-tation and room segmentation. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art quantitatively and qualitatively, and enables physically-reasonable mixed-reality applications such as material editing, editable novel view synthesis and relighting.
