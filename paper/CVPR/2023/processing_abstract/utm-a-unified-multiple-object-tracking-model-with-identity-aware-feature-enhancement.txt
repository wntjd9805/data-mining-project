Recently, Multiple Object Tracking has achieved great success, which consists of object detection, feature embed-ding, and identity association. Existing methods apply the three-step or two-step paradigm to generate robust trajec-tories, where identity association is independent of other components. However, the independent identity associa-tion results in the identity-aware knowledge contained in the tracklet not be used to boost the detection and embed-ding modules. To overcome the limitations of existing meth-ods, we introduce a novel Unified Tracking Model (UTM) to bridge those three components for generating a positive feedback loop with mutual benefits. The key insight of UTM is the Identity-Aware Feature Enhancement (IAFE), which is applied to bridge and benefit these three components by utilizing the identity-aware knowledge to boost detec-tion and embedding. Formally, IAFE contains the Identity-Aware Boosting Attention (IABA) and the Identity-AwareErasing Attention (IAEA), where IABA enhances the consis-tent regions between the current frame feature and identity-aware knowledge, and IAEA suppresses the distracted re-gions in the current frame feature. With better detections and embeddings, higher-quality tracklets can also be gener-ated. Extensive experiments of public and private detections on three benchmarks demonstrate the robustness of UTM.
