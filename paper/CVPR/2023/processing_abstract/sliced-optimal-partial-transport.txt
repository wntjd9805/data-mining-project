Optimal transport (OT) has become exceedingly popu-lar in machine learning, data science, and computer vision.The core assumption in the OT problem is the equal to-tal amount of mass in source and target measures, which limits its application. Optimal Partial Transport (OPT) is a recently proposed solution to this limitation. Similar to the OT problem, the computation of OPT relies on solving a linear programming problem (often in high dimensions), which can become computationally prohibitive. In this pa-per, we propose an efﬁcient algorithm for calculating theOPT problem between two non-negative measures in one dimension. Next, following the idea of sliced OT distances, we utilize slicing to deﬁne the Sliced OPT distance. Finally, we demonstrate the computational and accuracy beneﬁts of the Sliced OPT-based method in various numerical exper-iments. In particular, we show an application of our pro-posed Sliced OPT problem in noisy point cloud registration and color adaptation. Our code is available at Github Link.
