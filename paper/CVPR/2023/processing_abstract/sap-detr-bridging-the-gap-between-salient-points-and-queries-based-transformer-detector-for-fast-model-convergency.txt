Recently, the dominant DETR-based approaches apply central-concept spatial prior to accelerating Transformer detector convergency. These methods gradually refine the reference points to the center of target objects and imbue ob-ject queries with the updated central reference information for spatially conditional attention. However, centralizing ref-erence points may severely deteriorate queries’ saliency and confuse detectors due to the indiscriminative spatial prior.To bridge the gap between the reference points of salient queries and Transformer detectors, we propose SAlientPoint-based DETR (SAP-DETR) by treating object detec-tion as a transformation from salient points to instance ob-jects. Concretely, we explicitly initialize a query-specific reference point for each object query, gradually aggregate them into an instance object, and then predict the distance from each side of the bounding box to these points. By rapidly attending to query-specific reference regions and the conditional box edges, SAP-DETR can effectively bridge the gap between the salient point and the query-based Trans-former detector with a significant convergency speed. Exper-imentally, SAP-DETR achieves 1.4× convergency speed with competitive performance and stably promotes the SoTA ap-proaches by ∼1.0 AP. Based on ResNet-DC-101, SAP-DETR achieves 46.9 AP.
