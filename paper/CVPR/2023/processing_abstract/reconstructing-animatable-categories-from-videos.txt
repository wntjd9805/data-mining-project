Building animatable 3D models is challenging due to the need for 3D scans, laborious registration, and rigging. Re-cently, differentiable rendering provides a pathway to ob-tain high-quality 3D models from monocular videos, but these are limited to rigid categories or single instances. We present RAC, a method to build category-level 3D models from monocular videos, disentangling variations over in-stances and motion over time. Three key ideas are intro-duced to solve this problem: (1) specializing a category-level skeleton to instances, (2) a method for latent space regularization that encourages shared structure across a category while maintaining instance details, and (3) us-ing 3D background models to disentangle objects from the background. We build 3D models for humans, cats and dogs given monocular videos. Project page: https://gengshan-y.github.io/rac-www/.
