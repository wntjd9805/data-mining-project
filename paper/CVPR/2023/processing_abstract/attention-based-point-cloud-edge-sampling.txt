Point cloud sampling is a less explored research topic for this data representation. The most commonly used sam-pling methods are still classical random sampling and far-thest point sampling. With the development of neural net-works, various methods have been proposed to sample point clouds in a task-based learning manner. However, these methods are mostly generative-based, rather than selecting points directly using mathematical statistics.Inspired by the Canny edge detection algorithm for images and with the help of the attention mechanism, this paper proposes a non-generative Attention-based Point cloud Edge Sampling method (APES), which captures salient points in the point cloud outline. Both qualitative and quantitative experimen-tal results show the superior performance of our sampling method on common benchmark tasks.
