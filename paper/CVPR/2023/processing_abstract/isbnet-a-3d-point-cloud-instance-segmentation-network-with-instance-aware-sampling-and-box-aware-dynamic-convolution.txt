Existing 3D instance segmentation methods are predomi-nated by the bottom-up design â€“ manually fine-tuned algo-rithm to group points into clusters followed by a refinement network. However, by relying on the quality of the clus-ters, these methods generate susceptible results when (1) nearby objects with the same semantic class are packed together, or (2) large objects with loosely connected re-gions. To address these limitations, we introduce ISBNet, a novel cluster-free method that represents instances as ker-nels and decodes instance masks via dynamic convolution.To efficiently generate high-recall and discriminative ker-nels, we propose a simple strategy named Instance-awareFarthest Point Sampling to sample candidates and lever-age the local aggregation layer inspired by PointNet++ to encode candidate features. Moreover, we show that pre-dicting and leveraging the 3D axis-aligned bounding boxes in the dynamic convolution further boosts performance.Our method set new state-of-the-art results on ScanNetV2 (55.9), S3DIS (60.8), and STPLS3D (49.2) in terms of AP and retains fast inference time (237ms per scene on Scan-NetV2).
