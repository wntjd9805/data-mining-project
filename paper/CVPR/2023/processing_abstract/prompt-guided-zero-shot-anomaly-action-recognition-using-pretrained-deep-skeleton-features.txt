This study investigates unsupervised anomaly action recognition, which identifies video-level abnormal-human-behavior events in an unsupervised manner without abnor-mal samples, and simultaneously addresses three limita-tions in the conventional skeleton-based approaches: target domain-dependent DNN training, robustness against skele-ton errors, and a lack of normal samples. We present a unified, user prompt-guided zero-shot learning framework using a target domain-independent skeleton feature extrac-tor, which is pretrained on a large-scale action recogni-tion dataset. Particularly, during the training phase us-ing normal samples, the method models the distribution of skeleton features of the normal actions while freezing the weights of the DNNs and estimates the anomaly score us-ing this distribution in the inference phase. Additionally, to increase robustness against skeleton errors, we introduce a DNN architecture inspired by a point cloud deep learn-ing paradigm, which sparsely propagates the features be-tween joints. Furthermore, to prevent the unobserved nor-mal actions from being misidentified as abnormal actions, we incorporate a similarity score between the user prompt embeddings and skeleton features aligned in the common space into the anomaly score, which indirectly supplements normal actions. On two publicly available datasets, we con-duct experiments to test the effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to abovementioned limitations.
