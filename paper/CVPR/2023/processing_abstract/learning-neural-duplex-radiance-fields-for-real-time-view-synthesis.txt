Neural radiance fields (NeRFs) enable novel-view synthe-sis with unprecedented visual quality. However, to render photorealistic images, NeRFs require hundreds of deep mul-tilayer perceptron (MLP) evaluations â€“ for each pixel. This is prohibitively expensive and makes real-time rendering infeasible, even on powerful modern GPUs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to distill and bake NeRFs into highly efficient mesh-based neural representations that are fully compatible with the massively parallel graphics render-ing pipeline. We represent scenes as neural radiance features encoded on a two-layer duplex mesh, which effectively over-comes the inherent inaccuracies in 3D surface reconstruc-tion by learning the aggregated radiance information from a reliable interval of ray-surface intersections. To exploit local geometric relationships of nearby pixels, we leverage screen-space convolutions instead of the MLPs used in NeRFs to achieve high-quality appearance. Finally, the performance of the whole framework is further boosted by a novel multi-view distillation optimization strategy. We demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our approach via extensive experiments on a range of standard datasets.
