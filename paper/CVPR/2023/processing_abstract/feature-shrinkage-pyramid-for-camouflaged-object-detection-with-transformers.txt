Vision transformers have recently shown strong global context modeling capabilities in camouflaged object detec-tion. However, they suffer from two major limitations: less effective locality modeling and insufficient feature aggre-gation in decoders, which are not conducive to camou-flaged object detection that explores subtle cues from in-distinguishable backgrounds. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based FeatureShrinkage Pyramid Network (FSPNet), which aims to hi-erarchically decode locality-enhanced neighboring trans-former features through progressive shrinking for camou-flaged object detection. Specifically, we propose a non-local token enhancement module (NL-TEM) that employs the non-local mechanism to interact neighboring tokens and explore graph-based high-order relations within tokens to enhance local representations of transformers. Moreover, we design a feature shrinkage decoder (FSD) with adja-cent interaction modules (AIM), which progressively ag-gregates adjacent transformer features through a layer-by-layer shrinkage pyramid to accumulate imperceptible but effective cues as much as possible for object information decoding. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experi-ments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing 24 competitors on three challeng-ing COD benchmark datasets under six widely-used evalu-ation metrics.
