With the springing up of face synthesis techniques, it is prominent in need to develop powerful face forgery de-tection methods due to security concerns. Some existing methods attempt to employ auxiliary frequency-aware in-formation combined with CNN backbones to discover the forged clues. Due to the inadequate information inter-action with image content, the extracted frequency fea-tures are thus spatially irrelavant, struggling to general-ize well on increasingly realistic counterfeit types. To ad-dress this issue, we propose a Spatial-Frequency DynamicGraph method to exploit the relation-aware features in spa-tial and frequency domains via dynamic graph learning. To this end, we introduce three well-designed components: 1)Content-guided Adaptive Frequency Extraction module to mine the content-adaptive forged frequency clues. 2) Multi-ple Domains Attention Map Learning module to enrich the spatial-frequency contextual features with multiscale atten-tion maps. 3) Dynamic Graph Spatial-Frequency FeatureFusion Network to explore the high-order relation of spa-tial and frequency features. Extensive experiments on sev-eral benchmark show that our proposed method sustainedly exceeds the state-of-the-arts by a considerable margin.
