While today’s high dynamic range (HDR) image fusion algorithms are capable of blending multiple exposures, the acquisition is often controlled so that the dynamic range within one exposure is narrow. For HDR imaging in photon-limited situations, the dynamic range can be enormous and the noise within one exposure is spatially varying. Exist-ing image denoising algorithms and HDR fusion algorithms both fail to handle this situation, leading to severe limita-tions in low-light HDR imaging.This paper presents two contributions. Firstly, we iden-tify the source of the problem. We ﬁnd that the issue is asso-ciated with the co-existence of (1) spatially varying signal-to-noise ratio, especially the excessive noise due to very dark regions, and (2) a wide luminance range within each exposure. We show that while the issue can be handled by a bank of denoisers, the complexity is high. Secondly, we propose a new method called the spatially varying high dy-namic range (SV-HDR) fusion network to simultaneously denoise and fuse images. We introduce a new exposure-shared block within our custom-designed multi-scale trans-former framework. In a variety of testing conditions, the performance of the proposed SV-HDR is better than the ex-isting methods.
