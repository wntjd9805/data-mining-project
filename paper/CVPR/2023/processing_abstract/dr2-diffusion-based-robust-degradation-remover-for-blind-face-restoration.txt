Blind face restoration usually synthesizes degraded low-quality data with a pre-defined degradation model for train-ing, while more complex cases could happen in the real world. This gap between the assumed and actual degra-dation hurts the restoration performance where artifacts are often observed in the output. However, it is expensive and infeasible to include every type of degradation to cover real-world cases in the training data. To tackle this robust-ness issue, we propose Diffusion-based Robust DegradationRemover (DR2) to first transform the degraded image to a coarse but degradation-invariant prediction, then employ an enhancement module to restore the coarse prediction to a high-quality image. By leveraging a well-performing de-noising diffusion probabilistic model, our DR2 diffuses in-put images to a noisy status where various types of degrada-tion give way to Gaussian noise, and then captures semantic information through iterative denoising steps. As a result,DR2 is robust against common degradation (e.g. blur, re-size, noise and compression) and compatible with differentâ€ Corresponding author.*Cooperative Medianet Innovation Center. designs of enhancement modules. Experiments in various settings show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heavily degraded synthetic and real-world datasets.
