Classical adversarial attacks for Face Recognition (FR) models typically generate discrete examples for target iden-tity with a single state image. However, such paradigm of point-wise attack exhibits poor generalization against nu-merous unknown states of identity and can be easily de-fended. In this paper, by rethinking the inherent relationship between the face of target identity and its variants, we in-troduce a new pipeline of Generalized Manifold AdversarialAttack (GMAA)1 to achieve a better attack performance by expanding the attack range. Specifically, this expansion lies on two aspects â€“ GMAA not only expands the target to be attacked from one to many to encourage a good general-ization ability for the generated adversarial examples, but it also expands the latter from discrete points to manifold by leveraging the domain knowledge that face expression change can be continuous, which enhances the attack ef-fect as a data augmentation mechanism did. Moreover, we further design a dual supervision with local and global con-straints as a minor contribution to improve the visual qual-ity of the generated adversarial examples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method based on extensive experi-ments, and reveal that GMAA promises a semantic contin-uous adversarial space with a higher generalization ability and visual quality.
