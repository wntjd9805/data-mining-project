Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated su-perior novel view synthesis performance but are slow at ren-dering. To speed up the volume rendering process, many ac-celeration methods have been proposed at the cost of large memory consumption. To push the frontier of the efficiency-memory trade-off, we explore a new perspective to accel-erate NeRF rendering, leveraging a key fact that the view-point change is usually smooth and continuous in interac-tive viewpoint control. This allows us to leverage the in-formation of preceding viewpoints to reduce the number of rendered pixels as well as the number of sampled pointsIn our pipeline, a along the ray of the remaining pixels. low-resolution feature map is rendered first by volume ren-dering, then a lightweight 2D neural renderer is applied to generate the output image at target resolution leverag-ing the features of preceding and current frames. We show that the proposed method can achieve competitive render-ing quality while reducing the rendering time with little memory overhead, enabling 30FPS at 1080P image reso-lution with a low memory footprint.
