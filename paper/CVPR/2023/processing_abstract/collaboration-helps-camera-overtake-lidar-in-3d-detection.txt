Camera-only 3D detection provides an economical so-lution with a simple configuration for localizing objects in 3D space compared to LiDAR-based detection systems.However, a major challenge lies in precise depth estima-tion due to the lack of direct 3D measurements in the in-put. Many previous methods attempt to improve depth es-timation through network designs, e.g., deformable layers and larger receptive fields. This work proposes an or-thogonal direction, improving the camera-only 3D detec-tion by introducing multi-agent collaborations. Our pro-posed collaborative camera-only 3D detection (CoCa3D) enables agents to share complementary information with each other through communication. Meanwhile, we op-timize communication efficiency by selecting the most in-formative cues. The shared messages from multiple view-points disambiguate the single-agent estimated depth and complement the occluded and long-range regions in the single-agent view. We evaluate CoCa3D in one real-world dataset and two new simulation datasets. Results show that CoCa3D improves previous SOTA performances by 44.21% on DAIR-V2X, 30.60% on OPV2V+, 12.59% onCoPerception-UAVs+ for AP@70. Our preliminary results show a potential that with sufficient collaboration, the cam-era might overtake LiDAR in some practical scenarios. We released the dataset and code.
