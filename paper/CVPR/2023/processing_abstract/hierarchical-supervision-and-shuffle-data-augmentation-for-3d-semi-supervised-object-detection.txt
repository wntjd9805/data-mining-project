State-of-the-art 3D object detectors are usually trained on large-scale datasets with high-quality 3D annotations.However, such 3D annotations are often expensive and time-consuming, which may not be practical for real ap-plications. A natural remedy is to adopt semi-supervised learning (SSL) by leveraging a limited amount of labeled samples and abundant unlabeled samples. Current pseudo-labeling-based SSL object detection methods mainly adopt a teacher-student framework, with a single ﬁxed threshold strategy to generate supervision signals, which inevitably brings confused supervision when guiding the student net-work training. Besides, the data augmentation of the point cloud in the typical teacher-student framework is too weak, and only contains basic down sampling and ﬂip-and-shift (i.e., rotate and scaling), which hinders the effective learn-ing of feature information. Hence, we address these is-sues by introducing a novel approach of Hierarchical Su-pervision and Shufﬂe Data Augmentation (HSSDA), which is a simple yet effective teacher-student framework. The teacher network generates more reasonable supervision for the student network by designing a dynamic dual-threshold strategy. Besides, the shufﬂe data augmentation strategy is designed to strengthen the feature representation ability of the student network. Extensive experiments show thatHSSDA consistently outperforms the recent state-of-the-art methods on different datasets. The code will be released at https://github.com/azhuantou/HSSDA.
