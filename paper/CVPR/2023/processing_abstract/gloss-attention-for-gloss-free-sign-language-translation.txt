Most sign language translation (SLT) methods to date require the use of gloss annotations to provide additional supervision information, however, the acquisition of gloss is not easy. To solve this problem, we first perform an anal-ysis of existing models to confirm how gloss annotations make SLT easier. We find that it can provide two aspects of information for the model, 1) it can help the model im-plicitly learn the location of semantic boundaries in contin-uous sign language videos, 2) it can help the model under-stand the sign language video globally. We then propose gloss attention, which enables the model to keep its atten-tion within video segments that have the same semantics lo-cally, just as gloss helps existing models do. Furthermore, we transfer the knowledge of sentence-to-sentence similar-ity from the natural language model to our gloss atten-tion SLT network (GASLT) to help it understand sign lan-guage videos at the sentence level. Experimental results on multiple large-scale sign language datasets show that our proposed GASLT model significantly outperforms existing methods.
