We propose a method to recommend music for an input video while allowing a user to guide music selection with free-form natural language. A key challenge of this prob-lem setting is that existing music video datasets provide the needed (video, music) training pairs, but lack text descrip-tions of the music. This work addresses this challenge with the following three contributions. First, we propose a text-synthesis approach that relies on an analogy-based prompt-ing procedure to generate natural language music descrip-tions from a large-scale language model (BLOOM-176B) given pre-trained music tagger outputs and a small num-ber of human text descriptions. Second, we use these syn-thesized music descriptions to train a new trimodal model, which fuses text and video input representations to query music samples. For training, we introduce a text dropout regularization mechanism which we show is critical to model performance. Our model design allows for the re-trieved music audio to agree with the two input modalities by matching visual style depicted in the video and musical genre, mood, or instrumentation described in the natural language query. Third, to evaluate our approach, we col-lect a testing dataset for our problem by annotating a subset of 4k clips from the YT8M-MusicVideo dataset with natural language music descriptions which we make publicly avail-able. We show that our approach can match or exceed the performance of prior methods on video-to-music retrieval while significantly improving retrieval accuracy when using text guidance.Figure 1. Language-guided music retrieval. Our ViML model takes a video and text prompt as input to retrieve a suitable music track from a database. The model learns to fuse video and lan-guage representations in order to guide retrieval. Notice how our approach retrieves audio matching both the video and language content. For the same video query (top two rows), we can change the music style to match the language query, and for the sameUpbeat pop query (bottom two rows) we can change the vo-calist to match the video content.
