Commodity ultrahigh definition (UHD) displays are be-coming more affordable which demand imaging in ultrahigh resolution (UHR). This paper proposes SparseMat, a com-putationally efficient approach for UHR image/video mat-ting. Note that it is infeasible to directly process UHR im-ages at full resolution in one shot using existing matting algorithms without running out of memory on consumer-level computational platforms, e.g., Nvidia 1080Ti with 11G memory, while patch-based approaches can introduce un-sightly artifacts due to patch partitioning.Instead, our method resorts to spatial and temporal sparsity for ad-dressing general UHR matting. When processing videos, huge computation redundancy can be reduced by exploit-ing spatial and temporal sparsity. In this paper, we show how to effectively detect spatio-temporal sparsity, which serves as a gate to activate input pixels for the matting model. Under the guidance of such sparsity, our method with sparse high-resolution module (SHM) can avoid patch-based inference while memory efficient for full-resolution matte refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate thatSparseMat can effectively and efficiently generate high-quality alpha matte for UHR images and videos at the orig-inal high resolution in a single pass.
