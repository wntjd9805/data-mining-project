The Multiplane Image (MPI), containing a set of fronto-parallel RGBα layers, is an effective and efficient represen-tation for view synthesis from sparse inputs. Yet, its fixed structure limits the performance, especially for surfaces im-aged at oblique angles. We introduce the Structural MPI (S-MPI), where the plane structure approximates 3D scenes concisely. Conveying RGBα contexts with geometrically-faithful structures, the S-MPI directly bridges view synthe-sis and 3D reconstruction.It can not only overcome the critical limitations of MPI, i.e., discretization artifacts from sloped surfaces and abuse of redundant layers, and can also acquire planar 3D reconstruction. Despite the intu-ition and demand of applying S-MPI, great challenges are introduced, e.g., high-fidelity approximation for both RGBα layers and plane poses, multi-view consistency, non-planar regions modeling, and efficient rendering with intersected planes. Accordingly, we propose a transformer-based net-work based on a segmentation model [4]. It predicts com-pact and expressive S-MPI layers with their corresponding masks, poses, and RGBα contexts. Non-planar regions are inclusively handled as a special case in our unified frame-work. Multi-view consistency is ensured by sharing global proxy embeddings, which encode plane-level features cov-ering the complete 3D scenes with aligned coordinates. In-tensive experiments show that our method outperforms both previous state-of-the-art MPI-based view synthesis methods and planar reconstruction methods.
