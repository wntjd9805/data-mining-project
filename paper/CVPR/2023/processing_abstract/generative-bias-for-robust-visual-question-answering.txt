The task of Visual Question Answering (VQA) is known to be plagued by the issue of VQA models exploiting bi-ases within the dataset to make its final prediction. Various previous ensemble based debiasing methods have been pro-posed where an additional model is purposefully trained to be biased in order to train a robust target model. How-ever, these methods compute the bias for a model simply from the label statistics of the training data or from single modal branches. In this work, in order to better learn the bias a target VQA model suffers from, we propose a gener-ative method to train the bias model directly from the target model, called GenB. In particular, GenB employs a gener-ative network to learn the bias in the target model through a combination of the adversarial objective and knowledge distillation. We then debias our target model with GenB as a bias model, and show through extensive experiments the effects of our method on various VQA bias datasets includ-ing VQA-CP2, VQA-CP1, GQA-OOD, and VQA-CE, and show state-of-the-art results with the LXMERT architecture on VQA-CP2.
