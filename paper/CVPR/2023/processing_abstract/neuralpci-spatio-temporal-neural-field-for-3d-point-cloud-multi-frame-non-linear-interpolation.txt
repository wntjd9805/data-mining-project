In recent years, there has been a significant increase in focus on the interpolation task of computer vision. Despite the tremendous advancement of video interpolation, point cloud interpolation remains insufficiently explored. Mean-while, the existence of numerous nonlinear large motions in real-world scenarios makes the point cloud interpolation task more challenging. In light of these issues, we presentNeuralPCI: an end-to-end 4D spatio-temporal Neural field for 3D Point Cloud Interpolation, which implicitly inte-grates multi-frame information to handle nonlinear large motions for both indoor and outdoor scenarios. Further-more, we construct a new multi-frame point cloud interpo-lation dataset called NL-Drive for large nonlinear motions in autonomous driving scenes to better demonstrate the su-periority of our method. Ultimately, NeuralPCI achieves state-of-the-art performance on both DHB (Dynamic Hu-man Bodies) and NL-Drive datasets. Beyond the interpola-tion task, our method can be naturally extended to point cloud extrapolation, morphing, and auto-labeling, which indicates its substantial potential in other domains.
