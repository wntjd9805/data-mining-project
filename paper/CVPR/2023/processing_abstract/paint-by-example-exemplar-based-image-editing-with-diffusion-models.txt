pretrained models are available at https://github. com/Fantasy-Studio/Paint-by-Example.Language-guided image editing has achieved great suc-cess recently. In this paper, we investigate exemplar-guided image editing for more precise control. We achieve this goal by leveraging self-supervised training to disentangle and re-organize the source image and the exemplar. How-ever, the naive approach will cause obvious fusing artifacts.We carefully analyze it and propose a content bottleneck and strong augmentations to avoid the trivial solution of di-rectly copying and pasting the exemplar image. Meanwhile, to ensure the controllability of the editing process, we de-sign an arbitrary shape mask for the exemplar image and leverage the classiﬁer-free guidance to increase the similar-ity to the exemplar image. The whole framework involves a single forward of the diffusion model without any itera-tive optimization. We demonstrate that our method achieves an impressive performance and enables controllable edit-ing on in-the-wild images with high ﬁdelity. The code and*Work is done during the internship at Microsoft Research Asia.†Corresponding author.
