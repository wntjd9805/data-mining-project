Existing methods mainly handle single weather types.However, the connections of different weather conditions at deep representation level are usually ignored. These con-nections, if used properly, can generate complementary rep-resentations for each other to make up insufficient train-ing data, obtaining positive performance gains and better generalization. In this paper, we focus on the very corre-lated rain and snow to explore their connections at deep representation level. Because sub-optimal connections may cause negative effect, another issue is that if rain and snow are handled in a multi-task learning way, how to find an optimal connection strategy to simultaneously improve de-raining and desnowing performance. To build desired con-nection, we propose a smart knowledge assignment strat-egy, called SmartAssign, to optimally assign the knowledge learned from both tasks to a specific one. In order to fur-ther enhance the accuracy of knowledge assignment, we propose a novel knowledge contrast mechanism, so that the knowledge assigned to different tasks preserves better uniqueness. The inherited inductive biases usually limit the modelling ability of CNNs, we introduce a novel trans-former block to constitute the backbone of our network to ef-fectively combine long-range context dependency and local image details. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets verify that proposed SmartAssign explores effec-tive connection between rain and snow, and improves the performances of both deraining and desnowing apparently.The implementation code will be available at https:// gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/master/ research/cv/SmartAssign.
