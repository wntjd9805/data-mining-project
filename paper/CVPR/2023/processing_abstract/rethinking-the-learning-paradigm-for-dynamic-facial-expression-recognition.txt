Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) is a rapidly developing field that focuses on recognizing facial expressions in video format. Previous research has con-sidered non-target frames as noisy frames, but we pro-pose that it should be treated as a weakly supervised prob-lem. We also identify the imbalance of short- and long-term temporal relationships in DFER. Therefore, we in-troduce the Multi-3D Dynamic Facial Expression Learn-ing (M3DFEL) framework, which utilizes Multi-InstanceLearning (MIL) to handle inexact labels. M3DFEL gen-erates 3D-instances to model the strong short-term tem-poral relationship and utilizes 3DCNNs for feature extrac-tion. The Dynamic Long-term Instance Aggregation Mod-ule (DLIAM) is then utilized to learn the long-term temporal relationships and dynamically aggregate the instances. Our experiments on DFEW and FERV39K datasets show thatM3DFEL outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with a vanilla R3D18 backbone.
