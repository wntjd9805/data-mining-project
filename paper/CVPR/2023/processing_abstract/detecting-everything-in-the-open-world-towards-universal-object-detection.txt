In this paper, we formally address universal object de-tection, which aims to detect every scene and predict ev-ery category. The dependence on human annotations, the limited visual information, and the novel categories in the open world severely restrict the universality of traditional detectors. We propose UniDetector, a universal object de-tector that has the ability to recognize enormous categories in the open world. The critical points for the universal-ity of UniDetector are: 1) it leverages images of multi-ple sources and heterogeneous label spaces for training through the alignment of image and text spaces, which guar-antees sufficient information for universal representations. 2) it generalizes to the open world easily while keeping the balance between seen and unseen classes, thanks to abun-dant information from both vision and language modali-ties. 3) it further promotes the generalization ability to novel categories through our proposed decoupling train-ing manner and probability calibration. These contribu-tions allow UniDetector to detect over 7k categories, the largest measurable category size so far, with only about 500 classes participating in training. Our UniDetector be-haves the strong zero-shot generalization ability on large-vocabulary datasets - it surpasses the traditional supervised baselines by more than 4% on average without seeing any corresponding images. On 13 public detection datasets with various scenes, UniDetector also achieves state-of-the-art performance with only a 3% amount of training data. 1
