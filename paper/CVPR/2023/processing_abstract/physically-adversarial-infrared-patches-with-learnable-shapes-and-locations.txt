Owing to the extensive application of infrared object de-tectors in the safety-critical tasks, it is necessary to evaluate their robustness against adversarial examples in the real world. However, current few physical infrared attacks are complicated to implement in practical application because of their complex transformation from digital world to physi-cal world. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a physically feasible infrared attack method called ”adversar-ial infrared patches”. Considering the imaging mechanism of infrared cameras by capturing objects’ thermal radiation, adversarial infrared patches conduct attacks by attaching a patch of thermal insulation materials on the target object to manipulate its thermal distribution. To enhance adversarial attacks, we present a novel aggregation regularization to guide the simultaneous learning for the patch’ shape and location on the target object. Thus, a simple gradient-based optimization can be adapted to solve for them. We verify adversarial infrared patches in different object detection tasks with various object detectors. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than 90% Attack Suc-cess Rate (ASR) versus the pedestrian detector and vehicle detector in the physical environment, where the objects are captured in different angles, distances, postures, and scenes.More importantly, adversarial infrared patch is easy to im-plement, and it only needs 0.5 hours to be constructed in the physical world, which verifies its effectiveness and efficiency.
