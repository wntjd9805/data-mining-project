For real applications, existing HSI-SR methods are not only limited to unstable performance under unknown sce-narios but also suffer from high computation consumption.In this paper, we develop a new coordination optimiza-tion framework for stable, interpretable, and lightweightHSI-SR. Specifically, we create a positive cycle between fu-sion and degradation estimation under a new probabilis-tic framework. The estimated degradation is applied to fu-sion as guidance for a degradation-aware HSI-SR. Under the framework, we establish an explicit degradation estima-tion method to tackle the indeterminacy and unstable per-formance caused by the black-box simulation in previous methods. Considering the interpretability in fusion, we in-tegrate spectral mixing prior into the fusion process, which can be easily realized by a tiny autoencoder, leading to a dramatic release of the computation burden. Based on the spectral mixing prior, we then develop a partial fine-tune strategy to reduce the computation cost further. Com-prehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method against the state-of-the-arts under synthetic and real datasets. For instance, we achieve a 2.3 dB promo-tion on PSNR with 120× model size reduction and 4300×FLOPs reduction under the CAVE dataset. Code is avail-able in https://github.com/WenjinGuo/DAEM .
