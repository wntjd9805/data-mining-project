Current stack-based inverse tone mapping (ITM) meth-ods can recover high dynamic range (HDR) radiance by predicting a set of multi-exposure images from a single low dynamic range image. However, there are still some limitations. On the one hand, these methods estimate a fixed number of images (e.g., three exposure-up and three exposure-down), which may introduce unnecessary com-putational cost or reconstruct incorrect results. On the other hand, they neglect the connections between the up-exposure and down-exposure models and thus fail to fullyIn this paper, we revisit the excavate effective features. stack-based ITM approaches and propose a novel method to reconstruct HDR radiance from a single image, which only needs to estimate two exposure images. At first, we de-sign the exposure adaptive block that can adaptively adjust the exposure based on the luminance distribution of the in-put image. Secondly, we devise the cross-model attention block to connect the exposure adjustment models. Thirdly, we propose an end-to-end ITM pipeline by incorporating the multi-exposure fusion model. Furthermore, we propose and open a multi-exposure dataset that indicates the opti-mal exposure-up/down levels. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art methods.
