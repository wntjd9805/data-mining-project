With the vigorous development of computer vision, ori-ented object detection has gradually been featured. In this paper, a novel differentiable angle coder named phase-shifting coder (PSC) is proposed to accurately predict the orientation of objects, along with a dual-frequency version (PSCD). By mapping the rotational periodicity of differ-ent cycles into the phase of different frequencies, we pro-vide a unified framework for various periodic fuzzy prob-lems caused by rotational symmetry in oriented object de-tection. Upon such a framework, common problems in oriented object detection such as boundary discontinuity and square-like problems are elegantly solved in a unified form. Visual analysis and experiments on three datasets prove the effectiveness and the potentiality of our approach.When facing scenarios requiring high-quality bounding boxes, the proposed methods are expected to give a com-petitive performance.
