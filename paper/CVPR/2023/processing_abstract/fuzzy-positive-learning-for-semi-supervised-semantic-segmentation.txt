Semi-supervised learning (SSL) essentially pursues class boundary exploration with less dependence on human an-notations. Although typical attempts focus on ameliorat-ing the inevitable error-prone pseudo-labeling, we think differently and resort to exhausting informative semantics from multiple probably correct candidate labels. In this pa-per, we introduce Fuzzy Positive Learning (FPL) for accu-rate SSL semantic segmentation in a plug-and-play fash-ion, targeting adaptively encouraging fuzzy positive pre-dictions and suppressing highly-probable negatives. Be-ing conceptually simple yet practically effective, FPL can remarkably alleviate interference from wrong pseudo la-bels and progressively achieve clear pixel-level semantic discrimination. Concretely, our FPL approach consists of two main components, including fuzzy positive assign-ment (FPA) to provide an adaptive number of labels for each pixel and fuzzy positive regularization (FPR) to re-strict the predictions of fuzzy positive categories to be larger than the rest under different perturbations. Theo-retical analysis and extensive experiments on Cityscapes and VOC 2012 with consistent performance gain justify the superiority of our approach.
