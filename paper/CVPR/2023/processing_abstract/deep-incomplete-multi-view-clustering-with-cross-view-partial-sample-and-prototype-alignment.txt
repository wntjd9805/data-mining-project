The success of existing multi-view clustering relies on the assumption of sample integrity across multiple views.However, in real-world scenarios, samples of multi-view are partially available due to data corruption or sensor failure, which leads to incomplete multi-view clustering study (IMVC). Although several attempts have been pro-posed to address IMVC, they suffer from the following draw-backs: i) Existing methods mainly adopt cross-view con-trastive learning forcing the representations of each sam-ple across views to be exactly the same, which might ig-nore view discrepancy and flexibility in representations; ii)Due to the absence of non-observed samples across mul-tiple views, the obtained prototypes of clusters might be unaligned and biased, leading to incorrect fusion. To ad-dress the above issues, we propose a Cross-view PartialSample and Prototype Alignment Network (CPSPAN) forDeep Incomplete Multi-view Clustering. Firstly, unlike ex-isting contrastive-based methods, we adopt pair-observed data alignment as ’proxy supervised signals’ to guide instance-to-instance correspondence construction among views. Then, regarding of the shifted prototypes in IMVC, we further propose a prototype alignment module to achieve incomplete distribution calibration across views. Exten-sive experimental results showcase the effectiveness of our proposed modules, attaining noteworthy performance im-provements when compared to existing IMVC competitors on benchmark datasets.
