Before sharing a NeRF, though, it might be desir-able to remove personal information or unsightly objects.Such removal is not easily achieved with the current NeRF editing frameworks. We propose a framework to remove objects from a NeRF representation created from an RGB-D sequence. Our NeRF inpainting method leverages re-cent work in 2D image inpainting and is guided by a user-provided mask. Our algorithm is underpinned by a confi-dence based view selection procedure. It chooses which of the individual 2D inpainted images to use in the creation of the NeRF, so that the resulting inpainted NeRF is 3D consis-tent. We show that our method for NeRF editing is effective for synthesizing plausible inpaintings in a multi-view co-herent manner, outperforming competing methods. We vali-date our approach by proposing a new and still-challenging dataset for the task of NeRF inpainting.
