We introduce an interferometric technique for passive time-of-ﬂight imaging and depth sensing at micrometer ax-ial resolutions. Our technique uses a full-ﬁeld Michelson interferometer, modiﬁed to use sunlight as the only light source. The large spectral bandwidth of sunlight makes it possible to acquire micrometer-resolution time-resolved scene responses, through a simple axial scanning opera-tion. Additionally, the angular bandwidth of sunlight makes it possible to capture time-of-ﬂight measurements insensi-tive to indirect illumination effects, such as interreﬂections and subsurface scattering. We build an experimental pro-totype that we operate outdoors, under direct sunlight, and in adverse environment conditions such as machine vibra-tions and vehicle trafﬁc. We use this prototype to demon-strate, for the ﬁrst time, passive imaging capabilities such as micrometer-scale depth sensing robust to indirect illumi-nation, direct-only imaging, and imaging through diffusers.
