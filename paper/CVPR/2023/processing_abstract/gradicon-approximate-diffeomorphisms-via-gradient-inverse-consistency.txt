We present an approach to learning regular spatial trans-formations between image pairs in the context of medical image registration. Contrary to optimization-based registra-tion techniques and many modern learning-based methods, we do not directly penalize transformation irregularities but instead promote transformation regularity via an inverse consistency penalty. We use a neural network to predict a map between a source and a target image as well as the map when swapping the source and target images. Different from existing approaches, we compose these two resulting maps and regularize deviations of the Jacobian of this composi-tion from the identity matrix. This regularizer – GradICON – results in much better convergence when training registra-tion models compared to promoting inverse consistency of the composition of maps directly while retaining the desir-able implicit regularization effects of the latter. We achieve state-of-the-art registration performance on a variety of real-world medical image datasets using a single set of hyperpa-rameters and a single non-dataset-specific training protocol.Code is available at https://github.com/uncbiag/ICON.
