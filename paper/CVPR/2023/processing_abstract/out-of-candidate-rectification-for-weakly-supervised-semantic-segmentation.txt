Weakly supervised semantic segmentation is typically in-spired by class activation maps, which serve as pseudo masks with class-discriminative regions highlighted. Al-though tremendous efforts have been made to recall precise and complete locations for each class, existing methods still commonly suffer from the unsolicited Out-of-Candidate (OC) error predictions that do not belong to the label can-didates, which could be avoidable since the contradiction with image-level class tags is easy to be detected. In this paper, we develop a group ranking-based Out-of-CandidateRectification (OCR) mechanism in a plug-and-play fashion.Firstly, we adaptively split the semantic categories into In-Candidate (IC) and OC groups for each OC pixel according to their prior annotation correlation and posterior predic-tion correlation. Then, we derive a differentiable rectifica-In-tion loss to force OC pixels to shift to the IC group. corporating OCR with seminal baselines (e.g., AffinityNet,SEAM, MCTformer), we can achieve remarkable perfor-mance gains on both Pascal VOC (+3.2%, +3.3%, +0.8% mIoU) and MS COCO (+1.0%, +1.3%, +0.5% mIoU) datasets with negligible extra training overhead, which jus-tifies the effectiveness and generality of OCR. â€
