Table structure recognition aims to extract the logical and physical structure of unstructured table images into a machine-readable format. The latest end-to-end image-to-text approaches simultaneously predict the two struc-tures by two decoders, where the prediction of the physi-cal structure (the bounding boxes of the cells) is based on the representation of the logical structure. However, the previous methods struggle with imprecise bounding boxes as the logical representation lacks local visual informa-tion. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end se-quential modeling framework for table structure recogni-tion called VAST. It contains a novel coordinate sequence decoder triggered by the representation of the non-empty cell from the logical structure decoder. In the coordinate se-quence decoder, we model the bounding box coordinates as a language sequence, where the left, top, right and bottom coordinates are decoded sequentially to leverage the inter-coordinate dependency. Furthermore, we propose an auxil-iary visual-alignment loss to enforce the logical representa-tion of the non-empty cells to contain more local visual de-tails, which helps produce better cell bounding boxes. Ex-tensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve state-of-the-art results in both logical and phys-ical structure recognition. The ablation study also vali-dates that the proposed coordinate sequence decoder and the visual-alignment loss are the keys to the success of our method.
