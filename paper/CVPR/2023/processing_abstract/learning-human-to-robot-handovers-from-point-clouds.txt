We propose the first framework to learn control policies for vision-based human-to-robot handovers, a critical task for human-robot interaction. While research in EmbodiedAI has made significant progress in training robot agents in simulated environments, interacting with humans remains challenging due to the difficulties of simulating humans.Fortunately, recent research has developed realistic simu-lated environments for human-to-robot handovers. Lever-aging this result, we introduce a method that is trained with a human-in-the-loop via a two-stage teacher-student frame-work that uses motion and grasp planning, reinforcement learning, and self-supervision. We show significant per-formance gains over baselines on a simulation benchmark, sim-to-sim transfer and sim-to-real transfer. Video and code are available at https://handover-sim2real.github.io.
