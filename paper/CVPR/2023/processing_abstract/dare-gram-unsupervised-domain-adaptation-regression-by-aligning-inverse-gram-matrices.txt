Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Regression (DAR) aims to bridge the domain gap between a labeled source dataset and an unlabelled target dataset for regression problems. Recent works mostly focus on learning a deep feature encoder by minimizing the discrepancy between source and target features. In this work, we present a dif-ferent perspective for the DAR problem by analyzing the closed-form ordinary least square (OLS) solution to the linear regressor in the deep domain adaptation context.Rather than aligning the original feature embedding space, we propose to align the inverse Gram matrix of the fea-tures, which is motivated by its presence in the OLS solu-tion and the Gram matrixâ€™s ability to capture the feature correlations. Specifically, we propose a simple yet effec-tive DAR method which leverages the pseudo-inverse low-rank property to align the scale and angle in a selected sub-space generated by the pseudo-inverse Gram matrix of the two domains. We evaluate our method on three domain adaptation regression benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art per-formance.
