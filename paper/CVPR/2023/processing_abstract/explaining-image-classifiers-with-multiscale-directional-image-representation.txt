Image classiﬁers are known to be difﬁcult to interpret and therefore require explanation methods to understand their decisions. We present ShearletX, a novel mask ex-planation method for image classiﬁers based on the shear-let transform – a multiscale directional image representa-tion. Current mask explanation methods are regularized by smoothness constraints that protect against undesirableﬁne-grained explanation artifacts. However, the smooth-ness of a mask limits its ability to separate ﬁne-detail pat-terns, that are relevant for the classiﬁer, from nearby nui-sance patterns, that do not affect the classiﬁer. ShearletX solves this problem by avoiding smoothness regularization all together, replacing it by shearlet sparsity constraints.The resulting explanations consist of a few edges, textures, and smooth parts of the original image, that are the most relevant for the decision of the classiﬁer. To support our method, we propose a mathematical deﬁnition for explana-tion artifacts and an information theoretic score to evaluate the quality of mask explanations. We demonstrate the supe-riority of ShearletX over previous mask based explanation methods using these new metrics, and present exemplary situations where separating ﬁne-detail patterns allows ex-plaining phenomena that were not explainable before.
