Semi-supervised learning is a promising method for medical image segmentation under limited annotation.However, the model cognitive bias impairs the segmentation performance, especially for edge regions. Furthermore, current mainstream semi-supervised medical image seg-mentation (SSMIS) methods lack designs to handle model bias. The neural network has a strong learning ability, but the cognitive bias will gradually deepen during the training, and it is difﬁcult to correct itself. We propose a novel mutual correction framework (MCF) to explore network bias correction and improve the performance ofSSMIS. Inspired by the plain contrast idea, MCF intro-duces two different subnets to explore and utilize the dis-crepancies between subnets to correct cognitive bias of the model. More concretely, a contrastive difference review (CDR) module is proposed to ﬁnd out inconsistent pre-diction regions and perform a review training. Addition-ally, a dynamic competitive pseudo-label generation (DC-PLG) module is proposed to evaluate the performance of subnets in real-time, dynamically selecting more reliable pseudo-labels. Experimental results on two medical im-age databases with different modalities (CT and MRI) show that our method achieves superior performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods.
