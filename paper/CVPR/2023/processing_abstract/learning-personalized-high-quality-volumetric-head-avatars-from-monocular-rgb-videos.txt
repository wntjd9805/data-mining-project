state-of-the-art approaches.We propose a method to learn a high-quality implicit 3D head avatar from a monocular RGB video captured in the wild. The learnt avatar is driven by a paramet-ric face model to achieve user-controlled facial expressions and head poses. Our hybrid pipeline combines the geom-etry prior and dynamic tracking of a 3DMM with a neural radiance ﬁeld to achieve ﬁne-grained control and photore-alism. To reduce over-smoothing and improve out-of-model expressions synthesis, we propose to predict local features anchored on the 3DMM geometry. These learnt features are driven by 3DMM deformation and interpolated in 3D space to yield the volumetric radiance at a designated query point. We further show that using a Convolutional NeuralNetwork in the UV space is critical in incorporating spatial context and producing representative local features. Exten-sive experiments show that we are able to reconstruct high-quality avatars, with more accurate expression-dependent details, good generalization to out-of-training expressions, and quantitatively superior renderings compared to other
