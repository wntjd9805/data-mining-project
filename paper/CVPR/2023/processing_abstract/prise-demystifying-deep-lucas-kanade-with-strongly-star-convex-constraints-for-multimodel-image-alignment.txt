The Lucas-Kanade (LK) method is a classic iterative ho-mography estimation algorithm for image alignment, but often suffers from poor local optimality especially when im-age pairs have large distortions. To address this challenge, in this paper we propose a novel Deep Star-ConvexifiedLucas-Kanade (PRISE) method for multimodel image align-ment by introducing strongly star-convex constraints into the optimization problem. Our basic idea is to enforce the neural network to approximately learn a star-convex loss landscape around the ground truth give any data to facili-tate the convergence of the LK method to the ground truth through the high dimensional space defined by the network.This leads to a minimax learning problem, with contrastive (hinge) losses due to the definition of strong star-convexity that are appended to the original loss for training. We also provide an efficient sampling based algorithm to leverage the training cost, as well as some analysis on the quality of the solutions from PRISE. We further evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets such as MSCOCO, GoogleEarth, andGoogleMap, and demonstrate state-of-the-art results, espe-cially for small pixel errors.
