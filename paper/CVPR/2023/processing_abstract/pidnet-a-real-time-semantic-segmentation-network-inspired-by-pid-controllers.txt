Two-branch network architecture has shown its effi-ciency and effectiveness in real-time semantic segmentation tasks. However, direct fusion of high-resolution details and low-frequency context has the drawback of detailed features being easily overwhelmed by surrounding contextual infor-mation. This overshoot phenomenon limits the improvement of the segmentation accuracy of existing two-branch mod-els. In this paper, we make a connection between Convolu-tional Neural Networks (CNN) and Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers and reveal that a two-branch network is equivalent to a Proportional-Integral (PI) con-troller, which inherently suffers from similar overshoot is-sues. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel three-branch network architecture: PIDNet, which contains three branches to parse detailed, context and boundary informa-tion, respectively, and employs boundary attention to guide the fusion of detailed and context branches. Our family ofPIDNets achieve the best trade-off between inference speed and accuracy and their accuracy surpasses all the existing models with similar inference speed on the Cityscapes andCamVid datasets. Specifically, PIDNet-S achieves 78.6% mIOU with inference speed of 93.2 FPS on Cityscapes and 80.1% mIOU with speed of 153.7 FPS on CamVid.
