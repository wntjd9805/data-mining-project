Compositionality is one of the fundamental properties of human cognition (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988). Compositional generalization is critical to simulate the compositional ca-pability of humans, and has received much attention in theIt is essential to vision-and-language (V&L) community. understand the effect of the primitives, including words, im-age regions, and video frames, to improve the compositional generalization capability. In this paper, we explore the ef-fect of primitives for compositional generalization in V&L.Specifically, we present a self-supervised learning based framework that equips existing V&L methods with two char-acteristics: semantic equivariance and semantic invari-ance. With the two characteristics, the methods understand primitives by perceiving the effect of primitive changes on sample semantics and ground-truth. Experimental results on two tasks: temporal video grounding and visual question answering, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.
