Recent advances in 3D point cloud analysis bring a di-verse set of network architectures to the field. However, the lack of a unified framework to interpret those networks makes any systematic comparison, contrast, or analysis challenging, and practically limits healthy development of the field. In this paper, we take the initiative to explore and propose a unified framework called PointMeta, to which the popular 3D point cloud analysis approaches could fit.This brings three benefits. First, it allows us to compare different approaches in a fair manner, and use quick ex-periments to verify any empirical observations or assump-tions summarized from the comparison. Second, the big pic-ture brought by PointMeta enables us to think across differ-ent components, and revisit common beliefs and key design decisions made by the popular approaches. Third, based on the learnings from the previous two analyses, by doing simple tweaks on the existing approaches, we are able to derive a basic building block, termed PointMetaBase.It shows very strong performance in efficiency and effective-ness through extensive experiments on challenging bench-marks, and thus verifies the necessity and benefits of high-level interpretation, contrast, and comparison like Point-Meta.In particular, PointMetaBase surpasses the previ-ous state-of-the-art method by 0.7%/1.4/%2.1% mIoU with only 2%/11%/13% of the computation cost on the S3DIS datasets.
