We present a large-scale facial UV-texture dataset that contains over 50,000 high-quality texture UV-maps with even illuminations, neutral expressions, and cleaned facial regions, which are desired characteristics for rendering re-alistic 3D face models under different lighting conditions.The dataset is derived from a large-scale face image dataset namely FFHQ, with the help of our fully automatic and ro-bust UV-texture production pipeline. Our pipeline utilizes the recent advances in StyleGAN-based facial image editing approaches to generate multi-view normalized face images from single-image inputs. An elaborated UV-texture extrac-tion, correction, and completion procedure is then applied to produce high-quality UV-maps from the normalized face images. Compared with existing UV-texture datasets, our dataset has more diverse and higher-quality texture maps.We further train a GAN-based texture decoder as the nonlin-ear texture basis for parametric fitting based 3D face recon-struction. Experiments show that our method improves the*Work done during an internship at Tencent AI Lab.â€ Corresponding author. reconstruction accuracy over state-of-the-art approaches, and more importantly, produces high-quality texture maps that are ready for realistic renderings.
