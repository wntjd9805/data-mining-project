(a) Procedure Knowledge Graph BuildingSupervision (b) Pre-trainingOur goal is to learn a video representation that is useful for downstream procedure understanding tasks in instruc-tional videos. Due to the small amount of available an-notations, a key challenge in procedure understanding is to be able to extract from unlabeled videos the procedu-ral knowledge such as the identity of the task (e.g., ‘make latte’), its steps (e.g., ‘pour milk’), or the potential next steps given partial progress in its execution. Our main in-sight is that instructional videos depict sequences of steps that repeat between instances of the same or different tasks, and that this structure can be well represented by a Proce-dural Knowledge Graph (PKG), where nodes are discrete steps and edges connect steps that occur sequentially in the instructional activities. This graph can then be used to generate pseudo labels to train a video representation that encodes the procedural knowledge in a more accessi-ble form to generalize to multiple procedure understand-ing tasks. We build a PKG by combining information from a text-based procedural knowledge database and an unla-beled instructional video corpus and then use it to gener-ate training pseudo labels with four novel pre-training ob-jectives. We call this PKG-based pre-training procedure and the resulting model Paprika, Procedure-Aware PRe-training for Instructional Knowledge Acquisition. We eval-uate Paprika on COIN and CrossTask for procedure un-derstanding tasks such as task recognition, step recogni-tion, and step forecasting. Paprika yields a video rep-resentation that improves over the state of the art: up to 11.23% gains in accuracy in 12 evaluation settings.
