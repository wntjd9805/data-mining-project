Vector font synthesis is a challenging and ongoing prob-lem in the fields of Computer Vision and Computer Graph-ics. The recently-proposed DeepVecFont [27] achieved state-of-the-art performance by exploiting information of both the image and sequence modalities of vector fonts.However, it has limited capability for handling long se-quence data and heavily relies on an image-guided outline refinement post-processing. Thus, vector glyphs synthesized by DeepVecFont still often contain some distortions and ar-tifacts and cannot rival human-designed results. To address the above problems, this paper proposes an enhanced ver-sion of DeepVecFont mainly by making the following three novel technical contributions. First, we adopt Transform-ers instead of RNNs to process sequential data and design a relaxation representation for vector outlines, markedly im-proving the model’s capability and stability of synthesizing long and complex outlines. Second, we propose to sample auxiliary points in addition to control points to precisely align the generated and target B´ezier curves or lines. Fi-nally, to alleviate error accumulation in the sequential gen-eration process, we develop a context-based self-refinement module based on another Transformer-based decoder to re-move artifacts in the initially synthesized glyphs. Both qual-itative and quantitative results demonstrate that the pro-posed method effectively resolves those intrinsic problems of the original DeepVecFont and outperforms existing ap-proaches in generating English and Chinese vector fonts with complicated structures and diverse styles.*Zhouhui Lian is the corresponding author.This work was supported by National Language Committee of China (Grant No.: ZDI135-130), Project 2020BD020 supported by PKU-BaiduFund, Center For Chinese Font Design and Research, and Key Laboratory of Science, Technology and Standard in Press Industry (Key Laboratory ofIntelligent Press Media Technology).Figure 1.
