To model the indeterminacy of human behaviors, stochas-tic trajectory prediction requires a sophisticated multi-modal distribution of future trajectories. Emerging diffusion models have revealed their tremendous representation capacities in numerous generation tasks, showing potential for stochastic trajectory prediction. However, expensive time consumption prevents diffusion models from real-time prediction, since a large number of denoising steps are required to assure sufficient representation ability. To resolve the dilemma, we present LEapfrog Diffusion model (LED), a novel diffusion-based trajectory prediction model, which provides real-time, precise, and diverse predictions. The core of the proposedLED is to leverage a trainable leapfrog initializer to directly learn an expressive multi-modal distribution of future tra-jectories, which skips a large number of denoising steps, significantly accelerating inference speed. Moreover, the leapfrog initializer is trained to appropriately allocate cor-related samples to provide a diversity of predicted future tra-jectories, significantly improving prediction performances.Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets, includingNBA/NFL/SDD/ETH-UCY, show that LED consistently im-proves performance and achieves 23.7%/21.9% ADE/FDE improvement on NFL. The proposed LED also speeds up the inference 19.3/30.8/24.3/25.1 times compared to the stan-dard diffusion model on NBA/NFL/SDD/ETH-UCY, satisfy-ing real-time inference needs.
