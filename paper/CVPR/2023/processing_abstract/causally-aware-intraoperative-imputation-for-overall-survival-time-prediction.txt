Previous efforts in vision community are mostly made on learning good representations from visual patterns. Beyond this, this paper emphasizes the high-level ability of causal reasoning. We thus present a case study of solving the chal-lenging task of Overall Survival (OS) time in primary liver cancers. Critically, the prediction of OS time at the early stage remains challenging, due to the unobvious image pat-terns of reflecting the OS. To this end, we propose a causal inference system by leveraging the intraoperative attributes and the correlation among them, as an intermediate super-vision to bridge the gap between the images and the finalOS. Particularly, we build a causal graph, and train the im-ages to estimate the intraoperative attributes for final OS prediction. We present a novel Causally-aware Intraop-erative Imputation Model (CAWIM) that can sequentially predict each attribute using its parent nodes in the esti-mated causal graph. To determine the causal directions,*Equal contributionâ€ Corresponding author we propose a splitting-voting mechanism, which votes for the direction for each pair of adjacent nodes among multi-ple predictions obtained via causal discovery from hetero-geneity. The practicability and effectiveness of our method are demonstrated by the promising results on liver cancer dataset of 361 patients with long-term observations.
