Gait is one of the most promising biometrics that aims to identify pedestrians from their walking patterns. However, prevailing methods are susceptible to confounders, result-ing in the networks hardly focusing on the regions that re-flect effective walking patterns. To address this fundamen-tal problem in gait recognition, we propose a GenerativeCounterfactual Intervention framework, dubbed GaitGCI, consisting of Counterfactual Intervention Learning (CIL) and Diversity-Constrained Dynamic Convolution (DCDC).CIL eliminates the impacts of confounders by maximiz-ing the likelihood difference between factual/counterfactual attention while DCDC adaptively generates sample-wise factual/counterfactual attention to efficiently perceive the sample-wise properties. With matrix decomposition and di-versity constraint, DCDC guarantees the model to be effi-cient and effective. Extensive experiments indicate that pro-posed GaitGCI: 1) could effectively focus on the discrimi-native and interpretable regions that reflect gait pattern; 2) is model-agnostic and could be plugged into existing mod-els to improve performance with nearly no extra cost; 3) ef-ficiently achieves state-of-the-art performance on arbitrary scenarios (in-the-lab and in-the-wild).
