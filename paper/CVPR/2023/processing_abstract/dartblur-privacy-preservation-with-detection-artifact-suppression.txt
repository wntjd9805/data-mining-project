Nowadays, privacy issue has become a top priority when training AI algorithms. Machine learning algorithms are expected to benefit our daily life, while personal informa-tion must also be carefully protected from exposure. Fa-cial information is particularly sensitive in this regard.Multiple datasets containing facial information have been taken offline, and the community is actively seeking solu-tions to remedy the privacy issues. Existing methods for privacy preservation can be divided into blur-based and face replacement-based methods. Owing to the advantages of review convenience and good accessibility, blur-based based methods have become a dominant choice in prac-tice. However, blur-based methods would inevitably intro-duce training artifacts harmful to the performance of down-stream tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel De-artifactBlurring (DartBlur) privacy-preserving method, which cap-italizes on a DNN architecture to generate blurred faces.DartBlur can effectively hide facial privacy information while detection artifacts are simultaneously suppressed. We have designed four training objectives that particularly aim to improve review convenience and maximize detec-tion artifact suppression. We associate the algorithm with an adversarial training strategy with a second-order opti-mization pipeline. Experimental results demonstrate thatDartBlur outperforms the existing face-replacement method from both perspectives of review convenience and accessi-bility, and also shows an exclusive advantage in suppress-ing the training artifact compared to traditional blur-based methods.
