Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated amazing ability to synthesize images of 3D scenes from novel views. However, they rely upon specialized volumet-ric rendering algorithms based on ray marching that are mismatched to the capabilities of widely deployed graph-ics hardware. This paper introduces a new NeRF repre-sentation based on textured polygons that can synthesize novel images efficiently with standard rendering pipelines.The NeRF is represented as a set of polygons with textures representing binary opacities and feature vectors. Tradi-tional rendering of the polygons with a z-buffer yields an image with features at every pixel, which are interpreted by a small, view-dependent MLP running in a fragment shader to produce a final pixel color. This approach enablesNeRFs to be rendered with the traditional polygon rasteri-zation pipeline, which provides massive pixel-level paral-lelism, achieving interactive frame rates on a wide range of compute platforms, including mobile phones.Project page: https://mobile-nerf.github.io
