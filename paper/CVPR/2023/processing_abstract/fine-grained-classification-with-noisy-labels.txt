Learning with noisy labels (LNL) aims to ensure model generalization given a label-corrupted training set. In this work, we investigate a rarely studied scenario of LNL on fine-grained datasets (LNL-FG), which is more practical and challenging as large inter-class ambiguities among fine-grained classes cause more noisy labels. We empiri-cally show that existing methods that work well for LNL fail to achieve satisfying performance for LNL-FG, aris-ing the practical need of effective solutions for LNL-FG.To this end, we propose a novel framework called stochas-tic noise-tolerated supervised contrastive learning (SNSCL) that confronts label noise by encouraging distinguishable representation. Specifically, we design a noise-tolerated supervised contrastive learning loss that incorporates a weight-aware mechanism for noisy label correction and se-lectively updating momentum queue lists. By this mecha-nism, we mitigate the effects of noisy anchors and avoid inserting noisy labels into the momentum-updated queue.Besides, to avoid manually-defined augmentation strategies in contrastive learning, we propose an efficient stochas-tic module that samples feature embeddings from a gener-ated distribution, which can also enhance the representa-tion ability of deep models. SNSCL is general and compati-ble with prevailing robust LNL strategies to improve their performance for LNL-FG. Extensive experiments demon-strate the effectiveness of SNSCL.
