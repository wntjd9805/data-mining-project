We consider the problem of solving LP relaxations of MAP-MRF inference problems, and in particular the method proposed recently in [16, 35]. As a key computa-tional subroutine, it uses a variant of the Frank-Wolfe (FW) method to minimize a smooth convex function over a combi-natorial polytope. We propose an efﬁcient implementation of this subroutine based on in-face Frank-Wolfe directions, introduced in [4] in a different context. More generally, we deﬁne an abstract data structure for a combinatorial sub-problem that enables in-face FW directions, and describe its specialization for tree-structured MAP-MRF inference subproblems. Experimental results indicate that the result-ing method is the current state-of-art LP solver for some classes of problems. Our code is available at pub.ist. ac.at/˜vnk/papers/IN-FACE-FW.html.
