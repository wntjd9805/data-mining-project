Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to rec-ognize novel concepts formed by known states and objects during training. Existing methods either learn the combined state-object representation, challenging the generalization of unseen compositions, or design two classifiers to identify state and object separately from image features, ignoring the intrinsic relationship between them. To jointly eliminate the above issues and construct a more robust CZSL system, we propose a novel framework termed Decomposed Fusion with Soft Prompt (DFSP)1, by involving vision-language models (VLMs) for unseen composition recognition. Specif-ically, DFSP constructs a vector combination of learnable soft prompts with state and object to establish the joint rep-resentation of them. In addition, a cross-modal decomposed fusion module is designed between the language and image branches, which decomposes state and object among lan-guage features instead of image features. Notably, being fused with the decomposed features, the image features can be more expressive for learning the relationship with states and objects, respectively, to improve the response of un-seen compositions in the pair space, hence narrowing the domain gap between seen and unseen sets. Experimental results on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by large margins.
