With basic Semi-Supervised Object Detection (SSOD) techniques, one-stage detectors generally obtain limited promotions compared with two-stage clusters. We experi-mentally ﬁnd that the root lies in two kinds of ambiguities: (1) Selection ambiguity that selected pseudo labels are less accurate, since classiﬁcation scores cannot properly rep-resent the localization quality. (2) Assignment ambiguity that samples are matched with improper labels in pseudo-label assignment, as the strategy is misguided by missed objects and inaccurate pseudo boxes. To tackle these prob-lems, we propose a Ambiguity-Resistant Semi-supervisedLearning (ARSL) for one-stage detectors. Speciﬁcally, to alleviate the selection ambiguity, Joint-Conﬁdence Estima-tion (JCE) is proposed to jointly quantiﬁes the classiﬁcation and localization quality of pseudo labels. As for the as-signment ambiguity, Task-Separation Assignment (TSA) is introduced to assign labels based on pixel-level predictions rather than unreliable pseudo boxes. It employs a ’divide-and-conquer’ strategy and separately exploits positives for the classiﬁcation and localization task, which is more ro-bust to the assignment ambiguity. Comprehensive experi-ments demonstrate that ARSL effectively mitigates the am-biguities and achieves state-of-the-art SSOD performance on MS COCO and PASCAL VOC.
