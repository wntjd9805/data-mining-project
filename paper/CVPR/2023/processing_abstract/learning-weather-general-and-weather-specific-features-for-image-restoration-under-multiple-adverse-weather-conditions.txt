Image restoration under multiple adverse weather con-ditions aims to remove weather-related artifacts by using a single set of network parameters. In this paper, we find that image degradations under different weather conditions con-tain general characteristics as well as their specific charac-teristics. Inspired by this observation, we design an efficient unified framework with a two-stage training strategy to ex-plore the weather-general and weather-specific features.The first training stage aims to learn the weather-general features by taking the images under various weather con-ditions as inputs and outputting the coarsely restored re-sults. The second training stage aims to learn to adaptively expand the specific parameters for each weather type in the deep model, where the requisite positions for expand-ing weather-specific parameters are automatically learned.Hence, we can obtain an efficient and unified model for im-age restoration under multiple adverse weather conditions.Moreover, we build the first real-world benchmark dataset with multiple weather conditions to better deal with real-world weather scenarios. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance on all the syn-thetic and real-world benchmarks. Codes and datasets are available at this repository.
