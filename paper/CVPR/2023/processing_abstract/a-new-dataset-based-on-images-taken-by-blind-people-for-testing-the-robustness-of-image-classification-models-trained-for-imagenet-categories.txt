Our goal is to improve upon the status quo for design-ing image classification models trained in one domain that perform well on images from another domain. Comple-menting existing work in robustness testing, we introduce the first dataset for this purpose which comes from an au-thentic use case where photographers wanted to learn about the content in their images. We built a new test set us-ing 8,900 images taken by people who are blind for which we collected metadata to indicate the presence versus ab-sence of 200 ImageNet object categories. We call this dataset VizWiz-Classification. We characterize this dataset and how it compares to the mainstream datasets for evalu-ating how well ImageNet-trained classification models gen-eralize. Finally, we analyze the performance of 100 Ima-geNet classification models on our new test dataset. Our fine-grained analysis demonstrates that these models strug-gle on images with quality issues. To enable future exten-sions to this work, we share our new dataset with evalua-tion server at: https://vizwiz.org/tasks-and-datasets/image-classification.
