This paper proposes a practical method of microscale 3D shape capturing by a teleidoscopic imaging system. The main challenge in microscale 3D shape reconstruction is to capture the target from multiple viewpoints with a large enough depth-of-ﬁeld. Our idea is to employ a teleidoscopic measurement system consisting of three planar mirrors and monocentric lens. The planar mirrors virtually deﬁne mul-tiple viewpoints by multiple reﬂections, and the monocen-tric lens realizes a high magniﬁcation with less blurry and surround view even in closeup imaging. Our contributions include, a structured ray-pixel camera model which han-dles refractive and reﬂective projection rays efﬁciently, an-alytical evaluations of depth of ﬁeld of our teleidoscopic imaging system, and a practical calibration algorithm of the teleidoscopic imaging system. Evaluations with real im-ages prove the concept of our measurement system.
