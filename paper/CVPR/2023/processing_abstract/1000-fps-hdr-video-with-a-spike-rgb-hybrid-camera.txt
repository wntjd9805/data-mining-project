Capturing high frame rate and high dynamic range (HFR&HDR) color videos in high-speed scenes with con-ventional frame-based cameras is very challenging. The in-creasing frame rate is usually guaranteed by using shorter exposure time so that the captured video is severely inter-fered by noise. Alternating exposures can alleviate the noise issue but sacrifice frame rate due to involving long-exposure frames. The neuromorphic spiking camera records high-speed scenes of high dynamic range without colors using a completely different sensing mechanism and visual repre-sentation. We introduce a hybrid camera system composed of a spiking and an alternating-exposure RGB camera to capture HFR&HDR scenes with high fidelity. Our insight is to bring each cameraâ€™s superiority into full play. The spike frames, with accurate fast motion information encoded, are firstly reconstructed for motion representation, from which the spike-based optical flows guide the recovery of missing temporal information for long-exposure RGB images while retaining their reliable color appearances. With the strong temporal constraint estimated from spike trains, both miss-ing and distorted colors cross RGB frames are recovered to generate time-consistent and HFR color frames. We collect a new Spike-RGB dataset that contains 300 sequences of synthetic data and 20 groups of real-world data to demon-strate 1000 FPS HDR videos outperforming HDR video re-construction methods and commercial high-speed cameras.
