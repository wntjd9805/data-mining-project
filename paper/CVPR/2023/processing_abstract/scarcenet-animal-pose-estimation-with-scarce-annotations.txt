Animal pose estimation is an important but under-explored task due to the lack of labeled data. In this paper, we tackle the task of animal pose estimation with scarce annotations, where only a small set of labeled data and un-labeled images are available. At the core of the solution to this problem setting is the use of the unlabeled data to com-pensate for the lack of well-labeled animal pose data. To this end, we propose the ScarceNet, a pseudo label-based approach to generate artificial labels for the unlabeled im-ages. The pseudo labels, which are generated with a model trained with the small set of labeled images, are generally noisy and can hurt the performance when directly used for training. To solve this problem, we first use a small-loss trick to select reliable pseudo labels. Although effective, the selection process is improvident since numerous high-loss samples are left unused. We further propose to identify reusable samples from the high-loss samples based on an agreement check. Pseudo labels are re-generated to provide supervision for those reusable samples. Lastly, we intro-duce a student-teacher framework to enforce a consistency constraint since there are still samples that are neither re-liable nor reusable. By combining the reliable pseudo la-bel selection with the reusable sample re-labeling and the consistency constraint, we can make full use of the unla-beled data. We evaluate our approach on the challengingAP-10K dataset, where our approach outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches by a large margin. We also test on the TigDog dataset, where our approach can achieve bet-ter performance than domain adaptation based approaches when only very few annotations are available.
