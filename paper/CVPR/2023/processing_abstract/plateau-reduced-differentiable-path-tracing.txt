Current differentiable renderers provide light transport gradients with respect to arbitrary scene parameters. How-ever, the mere existence of these gradients does not guaran-tee useful update steps in an optimization. Instead, inverse rendering might not converge due to inherent plateaus, i.e., regions of zero gradient, in the objective function. We pro-pose to alleviate this by convolving the high-dimensional that maps scene parameters to im-rendering function, ages, with an additional kernel that blurs the parameter space. We describe two Monte Carlo estimators to compute plateau-reduced gradients efficiently, i.e., with low vari-ance, and show that these translate into net-gains in op-timization error and runtime performance. Our approach is a straightforward extension to both black-box and dif-ferentiable renderers and enables optimization of problems with intricate light transport, such as caustics or global illumination, that existing differentiable renderers do not converge on.
