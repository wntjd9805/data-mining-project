Camouflaged Instance Segmentation (CIS) aims at pre-dicting the instance-level masks of camouflaged objects, which are usually the animals in the wild adapting their ap-pearance to match the surroundings. Previous instance seg-mentation methods perform poorly on this task as they are easily disturbed by the deceptive camouflage. To address these challenges, we propose a novel De-camouflaging Net-work (DCNet) including a pixel-level camouflage decou-pling module and an instance-level camouflage suppression module. The proposed DCNet enjoys several merits. First, the pixel-level camouflage decoupling module can extract camouflage characteristics based on the Fourier transfor-mation. Then a difference attention mechanism is proposed to eliminate the camouflage characteristics while reserv-ing target object characteristics in the pixel feature. Sec-ond, the instance-level camouflage suppression module can aggregate rich instance information from pixels by use of instance prototypes. To mitigate the effect of background noise during segmentation, we introduce some reliable ref-erence points to build a more robust similarity measure-ment. With the aid of these two modules, our DCNet can ef-fectively model de-camouflaging and achieve accurate seg-mentation for camouflaged instances. Extensive experimen-tal results on two benchmarks demonstrate that our DCNet performs favorably against state-of-the-art CIS methods, e.g., with more than 5% performance gains on COD10K and NC4K datasets in average precision.
