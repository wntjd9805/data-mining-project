Image-to-image translation is an important and chal-lenging problem in computer vision and image process-ing. Diffusion models (DM) have shown great potentials for high-quality image synthesis, and have gained competi-tive performance on the task of image-to-image translation.However, most of the existing diffusion models treat image-to-image translation as conditional generation processes, and suffer heavily from the gap between distinct domains.In this paper, a novel image-to-image translation method based on the Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) is proposed, which models image-to-image translation as a stochastic Brownian Bridge process, and learns the trans-lation between two domains directly through the bidirec-tional diffusion process rather than a conditional gener-ation process. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work that proposes Brownian Bridge diffusion process for image-to-image translation. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed BBDM model achieves competitive performance through both vi-sual inspection and measurable metrics.
