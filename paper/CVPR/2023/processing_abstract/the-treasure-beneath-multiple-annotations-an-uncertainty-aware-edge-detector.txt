Deep learning-based edge detectors heavily rely on pixel-wise labels which are often provided by multiple an-notators. Existing methods fuse multiple annotations using a simple voting process, ignoring the inherent ambiguity of edges and labeling bias of annotators.In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware edge detector (UAED), which employs uncertainty to investigate the subjectivity and ambiguity of diverse annotations. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst convert the deterministic label space into a learnable Gaus-sian distribution, whose variance measures the degree of ambiguity among different annotations. Then we regard the learned variance as the estimated uncertainty of the pre-dicted edge maps, and pixels with higher uncertainty are likely to be hard samples for edge detection. Therefore we design an adaptive weighting loss to emphasize the learn-ing from those pixels with high uncertainty, which helps the network to gradually concentrate on the important pix-els. UAED can be combined with various encoder-decoder backbones, and the extensive experiments demonstrate thatUAED achieves superior performance consistently across multiple edge detection benchmarks.
