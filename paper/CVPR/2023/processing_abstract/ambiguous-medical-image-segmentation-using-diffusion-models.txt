Collective insights from a group of experts have al-ways proven to outperform an individualâ€™s best diagnostic for clinical tasks. For the task of medical image segmen-tation, existing research on AI-based alternatives focuses more on developing models that can imitate the best indi-vidual rather than harnessing the power of expert groups.In this paper, we introduce a single diffusion model-based approach that produces multiple plausible outputs by learn-ing a distribution over group insights. Our proposed model generates a distribution of segmentation masks by leverag-ing the inherent stochastic sampling process of diffusion us-ing only minimal additional learning. We demonstrate on three different medical image modalities- CT, ultrasound, and MRI that our model is capable of producing several possible variants while capturing the frequencies of their occurrences. Comprehensive results show that our pro-posed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art am-biguous segmentation networks in terms of accuracy while preserving naturally occurring variation. We also propose a new metric to evaluate the diversity as well as the ac-curacy of segmentation predictions that aligns with the in-terest of clinical practice of collective insights.
