Cell instance segmentation in cytology images has sig-nificant importance for biology analysis and cancer screen-ing, while remains challenging due to 1) the extensive over-lapping translucent cell clusters that cause the ambigu-ous boundaries, and 2) the confusion of mimics and de-bris as nuclei. In this work, we proposed a De-overlappingNetwork (DoNet) in a decompose-and-recombined strat-egy. A Dual-path Region Segmentation Module (DRM) ex-plicitly decomposes the cell clusters into intersection and complement regions, followed by a Semantic Consistency-guided Recombination Module (CRM) for integration. To further introduce the containment relationship of the nu-cleus in the cytoplasm, we design a Mask-guided RegionProposal Strategy (MRP) that integrates the cell attention maps for inner-cell instance prediction. We validate the proposed approach on ISBI2014 and CPS datasets. Ex-periments show that our proposed DoNet significantly out-performs other state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell instance seg-mentation methods.
