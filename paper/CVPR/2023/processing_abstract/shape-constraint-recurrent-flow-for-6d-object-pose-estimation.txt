Most recent 6D object pose methods use 2D optical flow to refine their results. However, the general optical flow methods typically do not consider the target’s 3D shape in-formation during matching, making them less effective inIn this work, we propose a 6D object pose estimation. shape-constraint recurrent matching framework for 6D ob-ject pose estimation. We first compute a pose-induced flow based on the displacement of 2D reprojection between the initial pose and the currently estimated pose, which em-beds the target’s 3D shape implicitly. Then we use this pose-induced flow to construct the correlation map for the following matching iterations, which reduces the matching space significantly and is much easier to learn. Further-more, we use networks to learn the object pose based on the current estimated flow, which facilitates the computation of the pose-induced flow for the next iteration and yields an end-to-end system for object pose. Finally, we optimize the optical flow and object pose simultaneously in a recurrent manner. We evaluate our method on three challenging 6D object pose datasets and show that it outperforms the state of the art significantly in both accuracy and efficiency.
