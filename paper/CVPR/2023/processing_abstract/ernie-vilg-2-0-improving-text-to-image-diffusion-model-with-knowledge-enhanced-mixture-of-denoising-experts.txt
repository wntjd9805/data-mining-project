Recent progress in diffusion models has revolutionized the popular technology of text-to-image generation. While exist-* denotes equal contribution. Work done during Fengâ€™s internship at Baidu. ing approaches could produce photorealistic high-resolution images with text conditions, there are still several open prob-lems to be solved, which limits the further improvement ofIn this paper, we pro-image fidelity and text relevancy. pose ERNIE-ViLG 2.0, a large-scale Chinese text-to-imagediffusion model, to progressively upgrade the quality of gen-erated images by: (1) incorporating fine-grained textual and visual knowledge of key elements in the scene, and (2) utiliz-ing different denoising experts at different denoising stages.With the proposed mechanisms, ERNIE-ViLG 2.01 not only achieves a new state-of-the-art on MS-COCO with zero-shotFID-30k score of 6.75, but also significantly outperforms recent models in terms of image fidelity and image-text align-ment, with side-by-side human evaluation on the bilingual prompt set ViLG-300.
