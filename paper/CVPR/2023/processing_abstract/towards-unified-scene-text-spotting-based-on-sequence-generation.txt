Sequence generation models have recently made signif-icant progress in unifying various vision tasks. Although some auto-regressive models have demonstrated promising results in end-to-end text spotting, they use specific detec-tion formats while ignoring various text shapes and are limited in the maximum number of text instances that can be detected. To overcome these limitations, we propose a UNIfied scene Text Spotter, called UNITS. Our model unifies various detection formats, including quadrilater-als and polygons, allowing it to detect text in arbitrary shapes. Additionally, we apply starting-point prompting to enable the model to extract texts from an arbitrary start-ing point, thereby extracting more texts beyond the num-ber of instances it was trained on. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive perfor-mance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Further anal-ysis shows that UNITS can extract a larger number of texts than it was trained on. We provide the code for our method at https://github.com/clovaai/units.
