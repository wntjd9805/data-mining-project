Labeling objects with pixel-wise segmentation requires a huge amount of human labor compared to bounding boxes.Most existing methods for weakly supervised instance seg-mentation focus on designing heuristic losses with priors from bounding boxes. While, we find that box-supervised methods can produce some fine segmentation masks and we wonder whether the detectors could learn from these fine masks while ignoring low-quality masks. To answer this question, we present BoxTeacher, an efficient and end-to-end training framework for high-performance weakly su-pervised instance segmentation, which leverages a sophis-ticated teacher to generate high-quality masks as pseudo labels. Considering the massive noisy masks hurt the train-ing, we present a mask-aware confidence score to esti-mate the quality of pseudo masks, and propose the noise-aware pixel loss and noise-reduced affinity loss to adap-tively optimize the student with pseudo masks. Extensive experiments can demonstrate effectiveness of the proposedBoxTeacher. Without bells and whistles, BoxTeacher re-markably achieves 35.0 mask AP and 36.5 mask AP withResNet-50 and ResNet-101 respectively on the challengingCOCO dataset, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin and bridges the gap between box-supervised and mask-supervised methods.
