Based on the Manhattan World assumption, most exist-ing indoor layout estimation schemes focus on recovering layouts from vertically compressed 1D sequences. However, the compression procedure confuses the semantics of differ-ent planes, yielding inferior performance with ambiguous interpretability.To address this issue, we propose to disentangle this 1D representation by pre-segmenting orthogonal (vertical and horizontal) planes from a complex scene, explicitly captur-ing the geometric cues for indoor layout estimation. Con-sidering the symmetry between the floor boundary and ceil-ing boundary, we also design a soft-flipping fusion strategy to assist the pre-segmentation. Besides, we present a fea-ture assembling mechanism to effectively integrate shallow and deep features with distortion distribution awareness.To compensate for the potential errors in pre-segmentation, we further leverage triple attention to reconstruct the dis-entangled sequences for better performance. Experiments on four popular benchmarks demonstrate our superiority over existing SoTA solutions, especially on the 3DIoU met-ric. The code is available at https://github.com/ zhijieshen-bjtu/DOPNet.
