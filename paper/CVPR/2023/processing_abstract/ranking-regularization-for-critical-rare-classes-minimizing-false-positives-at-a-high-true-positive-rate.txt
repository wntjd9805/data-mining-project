In many real-world settings, the critical class is rare and a missed detection carries a disproportionately high cost.For example, tumors are rare and a false negative diagno-sis could have severe consequences on treatment outcomes; fraudulent banking transactions are rare and an undetected occurrence could result in significant losses or legal penal-ties. In such contexts, systems are often operated at a high true positive rate, which may require tolerating high false positives. In this paper, we present a novel approach to ad-dress the challenge of minimizing false positives for systems that need to operate at a high true positive rate. We propose a ranking-based regularization (RankReg) approach that is easy to implement, and show empirically that it not only ef-fectively reduces false positives, but also complements con-ventional imbalanced learning losses. With this novel tech-nique in hand, we conduct a series of experiments on three broadly explored datasets (CIFAR-10&100 and Melanoma) and show that our approach lifts the previous state-of-the-art performance by notable margins.
