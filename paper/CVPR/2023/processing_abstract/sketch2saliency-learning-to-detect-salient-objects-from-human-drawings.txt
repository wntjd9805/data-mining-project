Human sketch has already proved its worth in various visual understanding tasks (e.g., retrieval, segmentation, image-captioning, etc). In this paper, we reveal a new trait of sketches – that they are also salient. This is intuitive as sketching is a natural attentive process at its core. More specifically, we aim to study how sketches can be used as a weak label to detect salient objects present in an im-age. To this end, we propose a novel method that empha-sises on how “salient object” could be explained by hand-drawn sketches. To accomplish this, we introduce a photo-to-sketch generation model that aims to generate sequential sketch coordinates corresponding to a given visual photo through a 2D attention mechanism. Attention maps accu-mulated across the time steps give rise to salient regions in the process. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experi-ments prove our hypothesis and delineate how our sketch-based saliency detection model gives a competitive perfor-mance compared to the state-of-the-art.
