LiveSpoofDomain 1This work studies the generalization issue of face anti-spooﬁng (FAS) models on domain gaps, such as image res-olution, blurriness and sensor variations. Most prior works regard domain-speciﬁc signals as a negative impact, and apply metric learning or adversarial losses to remove them from feature representation. Though learning a domain-invariant feature space is viable for the training data, we show that the feature shift still exists in an unseen test do-main, which backﬁres on the generalizability of the clas-In this work, instead of constructing a domain-siﬁer. invariant feature space, we encourage domain separabil-ity while aligning the live-to-spoof transition (i.e., the tra-jectory from live to spoof) to be the same for all domains.We formulate this FAS strategy of separability and align-ment (SA-FAS) as a problem of invariant risk minimization (IRM), and learn domain-variant feature representation but domain-invariant classiﬁer. We demonstrate the effective-ness of SA-FAS on challenging cross-domain FAS datasets and establish state-of-the-art performance. Code is avail-able at https://github.com/sunyiyou/SAFAS.
