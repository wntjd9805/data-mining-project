Object-centric learning (OCL) aspires general and com-positional understanding of scenes by representing a scene as a collection of object-centric representations. OCL has also been extended to multi-view image and video datasets to apply various data-driven inductive biases by utilizing geometric or temporal information in the multi-image data.Single-view images carry less information about how to dis-entangle a given scene than videos or multi-view images do. Hence, owing to the difficulty of applying inductive bi-ases, OCL for single-view images remains challenging, re-sulting in inconsistent learning of object-centric represen-tation. To this end, we introduce a novel OCL framework for single-view images, SLot Attention via SHepherding (SLASH), which consists of two simple-yet-effective mod-ules on top of Slot Attention. The new modules, AttentionRefining Kernel (ARK) and Intermediate Point Predictor and Encoder (IPPE), respectively, prevent slots from be-ing distracted by the background noise and indicate loca-tions for slots to focus on to facilitate learning of object-centric representation. We also propose a weak semi-supervision approach for OCL, whilst our proposed frame-work can be used without any assistant annotation during the inference. Experiments show that our proposed method enables consistent learning of object-centric representa-tion and achieves strong performance across four datasets.Code is available at https://github.com/object-understanding/SLASH.Figure 1. Results of training Slot Attention [35] with different seeds, which show inconsistent learning results. In the first trial, object-centric representations fail to grasp each distinct object due to the background noise.In the second, the model succeeds in distinguishing each different object from the background.
