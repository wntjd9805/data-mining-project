Although current deep learning techniques have yielded superior performance on various computer vision tasks, yet they are still vulnerable to adversarial examples. Adversar-ial training and its variants have been shown to be the most effective approaches to defend against adversarial exam-ples. A particular class of these methods regularize the dif-ference between output probabilities for an adversarial and its corresponding natural example. However, it may have a negative impact if a natural example is misclassified. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel adversarial train-ing scheme that encourages the model to produce similar output probabilities for an adversarial example and its “in-verse adversarial” counterpart. Particularly, the counter-part is generated by maximizing the likelihood in the neigh-borhood of the natural example. Extensive experiments on various vision datasets and architectures demonstrate that our training method achieves state-of-the-art robustness as well as natural accuracy among robust models. Further-more, using a universal version of inverse adversarial ex-amples, we improve the performance of single-step adver-sarial training techniques at a low computational cost.
