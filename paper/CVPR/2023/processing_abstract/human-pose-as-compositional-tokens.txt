Human pose is typically represented by a coordinate vec-tor of body joints or their heatmap embeddings. While easy for data processing, unrealistic pose estimates are admit-ted due to the lack of dependency modeling between the body joints. In this paper, we present a structured repre-sentation, named Pose as Compositional Tokens (PCT), to explore the joint dependency. It represents a pose by M dis-crete tokens with each characterizing a sub-structure with several interdependent joints (see Figure 1). The composi-tional design enables it to achieve a small reconstruction error at a low cost. Then we cast pose estimation as a clas-sification task. In particular, we learn a classifier to pre-dict the categories of the M tokens from an image. A pre-learned decoder network is used to recover the pose from the tokens without further post-processing. We show that it achieves better or comparable pose estimation results as the existing methods in general scenarios, yet continues to work well when occlusion occurs, which is ubiquitous in practice. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Gengzigang/PCT.
