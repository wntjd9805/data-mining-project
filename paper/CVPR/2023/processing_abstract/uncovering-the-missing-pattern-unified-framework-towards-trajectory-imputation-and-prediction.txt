Trajectory prediction is a crucial undertaking in under-standing entity movement or human behavior from observed sequences. However, current methods often assume that the observed sequences are complete while ignoring the potential for missing values caused by object occlusion, scope limitation, sensor failure, etc. This limitation in-evitably hinders the accuracy of trajectory prediction. To address this issue, our paper presents a unified framework, the Graph-based Conditional Variational Recurrent NeuralNetwork (GC-VRNN), which can perform trajectory impu-tation and prediction simultaneously. Specifically, we in-troduce a novel Multi-Space Graph Neural Network (MS-GNN) that can extract spatial features from incomplete ob-servations and leverage missing patterns. Additionally, we employ a Conditional VRNN with a specifically designedTemporal Decay (TD) module to capture temporal depen-dencies and temporal missing patterns in incomplete trajec-tories. The inclusion of the TD module allows for valuable information to be conveyed through the temporal flow. We also curate and benchmark three practical datasets for the joint problem of trajectory imputation and prediction. Ex-tensive experiments verify the exceptional performance of our proposed method. As far as we know, this is the first work to address the lack of benchmarks and techniques for trajectory imputation and prediction in a unified manner.
