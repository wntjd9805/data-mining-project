Diffusion model-based inverse problem solvers have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in cases where the forward operator is known (i.e. non-blind). However, the applicability of the method to blind inverse problemsThis work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Ko-rea under Grant NRF-2020R1A2B5B03001980, by the KAIST Key Re-search Institute (Interdisciplinary Research Group) Project, by the Insti-tute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (No. 2021-0-02068,Artificial Intelligence Innovation Hub), and by the IITP grant funded by the Korea government(MSIT) (No. 2022-0-00984, Development of Arti-ficial Intelligence Technology for Personalized Plug-and-Play Explanation and Verification of Explanation). has yet to be explored.In this work, we show that we can indeed solve a family of blind inverse problems by constructing another diffusion prior for the forwardSpecifically, parallel reverse diffusion guided operator. by gradients from the intermediate stages enables joint optimization of both the forward operator parameters as well as the image, such that both are jointly estimated at the end of the parallel reverse diffusion procedure. We show the efficacy of our method on two representative tasks — blind deblurring, and imaging through turbulence — and show that our method yields state-of-the-art performance, while also being flexible to be applicable to general blind inverse problems when we know the functional forms.
