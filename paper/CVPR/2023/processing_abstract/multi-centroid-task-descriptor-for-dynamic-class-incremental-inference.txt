Incremental learning could be roughly divided into two categories, i.e., class- and task-incremental learning. The main difference is whether the task ID is given during eval-uation. In this paper, we show this task information is in-deed a strong prior knowledge, which will bring signiﬁcant improvement over class-incremental learning baseline, e.g.,DER [39]. Based on this observation, we propose a gate network to predict the task ID for class incremental infer-ence. This is challenging as there is no explicit semantic re-lationship between categories in the concept of task. There-fore, we propose a multi-centroid task descriptor by assum-ing the data within a task can form multiple clusters. The cluster centers are optimized by pulling relevant sample-centroid pairs while pushing others away, which ensures that there is at least one centroid close to a given sample.To select relevant pairs, we use class prototypes as prox-ies and solve a bipartite matching problem, making the task descriptor representative yet not degenerate to uni-modal.As a result, our dynamic inference network is trained inde-pendently of baseline and provides a ﬂexible, efﬁcient so-lution to distinguish between tasks. Extensive experiments show our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, e.g., we achieve 72.41% average accuracy on CIFAR100-B0S50, outperforming DER by 3.40%.
