Localization in a pre-built map is a basic technique for robot autonomous navigation. Existing mapping and local-ization methods commonly work well in small-scale envi-ronments. As a map grows larger, however, more mem-ory is required and localization becomes inefficient. To solve these problems, map sparsification becomes a prac-tical necessity to acquire a subset of the original map for localization. Previous map sparsification methods add a quadratic term in mixed-integer programming to enforce a uniform distribution of selected landmarks, which requires high memory capacity and heavy computation. In this pa-per, we formulate map sparsification in an efficient linear form and select uniformly distributed landmarks based on 2D discretized grids. Furthermore, to reduce the influence of different spatial distributions between the mapping and query sequences, which is not considered in previous meth-ods, we also introduce a space constraint term based on 3D discretized grids. The exhaustive experiments in different datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed meth-ods in both efficiency and localization performance.
