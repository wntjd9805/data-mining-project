Correctness of instance segmentation constitutes count-ing the number of objects, correctly localizing all predic-tions and classifying each localized prediction. AveragePrecision is the de-facto metric used to measure all these constituents of segmentation. However, this metric does not penalize duplicate predictions in the high-recall range, and cannot distinguish instances that are localized correctly but categorized incorrectly. This weakness has inadvertently led to network designs that achieve significant gains in AP but also introduce a large number of false positives. We therefore cannot rely on AP to choose a model that provides an optimal tradeoff between false positives and high recall.To resolve this dilemma, we review alternative metrics in the literature and propose two new measures to explicitly measure the amount of both spatial and categorical dupli-cate predictions. We also propose a Semantic Sorting andNMS module to remove these duplicates based on a pixel occupancy matching scheme. Experiments show that mod-ern segmentation networks have significant gains in AP, but also contain a considerable amount of duplicates. Our Se-mantic Sorting and NMS can be added as a plug-and-play module to mitigate hedged predictions and preserve AP.
