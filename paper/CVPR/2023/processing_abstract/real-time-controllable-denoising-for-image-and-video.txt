Controllable image denoising aims to generate clean samples with human perceptual priors and balance sharp-ness and smoothness. In traditional filter-based denoising methods, this can be easily achieved by adjusting the fil-tering strength. However, for NN (Neural Network)-based models, adjusting the final denoising strength requires per-forming network inference each time, making it almost im-possible for real-time user interaction. In this paper, we in-troduce Real-time Controllable Denoising (RCD), the first deep image and video denoising pipeline that provides a fully controllable user interface to edit arbitrary denois-ing levels in real-time with only one-time network inference.Unlike existing controllable denoising methods that require multiple denoisers and training stages, RCD replaces the last output layer (which usually outputs a single noise map) of an existing CNN-based model with a lightweight module that outputs multiple noise maps. We propose a novel NoiseDecorrelation process to enforce the orthogonality of the noise feature maps, allowing arbitrary noise level control through noise map interpolation. This process is network-free and does not require network inference. Our experi-ments show that RCD can enable real-time editable image and video denoising for various existing heavy-weight mod-els without sacrificing their original performance.
