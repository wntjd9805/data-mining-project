mess.Most existing 3D reconstruction methods result in either detail loss or unsatisfying efficiency. However, effective-ness and efficiency are equally crucial in real-world ap-plications, e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality.We argue that this dilemma comes from wasted resources on valueless depth samples. This paper tackles the prob-lem by proposing a novel learning-based 3D reconstruc-tion framework named Dionysus. Our main contribution is to find out the most promising depth candidates from es-timated semantic maps. This strategy simultaneously en-ables high effectiveness and efficiency by attending to the most reliable nominators. Specifically, we distinguish unre-liable depth candidates by checking the cross-view semantic consistency and allow adaptive sampling by redistributing depth nominators among pixels. Experiments on the most popular datasets confirm our proposed frameworkâ€™s effec-tiveness.
