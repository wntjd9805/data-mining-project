We present Tensor4D, an efficient yet effective approach to dynamic scene modeling. The key of our solution is an efficient 4D tensor decomposition method so that the dy-namic scene can be directly represented as a 4D spatio-temporal tensor. To tackle the accompanying memory is-sue, we decompose the 4D tensor hierarchically by pro-jecting it first into three time-aware volumes and then nine compact feature planes.In this way, spatial information over time can be simultaneously captured in a compact and memory-efficient manner. When applying Tensor4D for dy-namic scene reconstruction and rendering, we further fac-torize the 4D fields to different scales in the sense that struc-tural motions and dynamic detailed changes can be learned from coarse to fine. The effectiveness of our method is val-idated on both synthetic and real-world scenes. Extensive experiments show that our method is able to achieve high-quality dynamic reconstruction and rendering from sparse-view camera rigs or even a monocular camera. The code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/DSaurus/Tensor4D.
