There has been a lot of effort in improving the perfor-mance of unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic seg-mentation task, however, there is still a huge gap in perfor-mance when compared with supervised learning.In this work, we propose a common framework to use different weak labels, e.g., image, point and coarse labels from the target domain to reduce this performance gap. Specifically, we propose to learn better prototypes that are representa-tive class features by exploiting these weak labels. We use these improved prototypes for the contrastive alignment of class features. In particular, we perform two different fea-ture alignments: first, we align pixel features with proto-types within each domain and second, we align pixel fea-tures from the source to prototype of target domain in an asymmetric way. This asymmetric alignment is beneficial as it preserves the target features during training, which is essential when weak labels are available from the tar-get domain. Our experiments on various benchmarks show that our framework achieves significant improvement com-pared to existing works and can reduce the performance gap with supervised learning.
