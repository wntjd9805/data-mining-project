With the rapid development of virtual reality, 360◦ im-ages have gained increasing popularity. Their wide field of view necessitates high resolution to ensure image qual-ity. This, however, makes it harder to acquire, store and even process such 360◦ images. To alleviate this issue, we propose the first attempt at 360◦ image rescaling, which refers to downscaling a 360◦ image to a visually valid low-resolution (LR) counterpart and then upscaling to a high-resolution (HR) 360◦ image given the LR variant. Specifi-cally, we first analyze two 360◦ image datasets and observe several findings that characterize how 360◦ images typi-cally change along their latitudes. Inspired by these find-ings, we propose a novel deformable invertible neural net-work (INN), named DINN360, for latitude-aware 360◦ im-age rescaling. In DINN360, a deformable INN is designed to downscale the LR image, and project the high-frequency (HF) component to the latent space by adaptively handling various deformations occurring at different latitude regions.Given the downscaled LR image, the high-quality HR image is then reconstructed in a conditional latitude-aware man-ner by recovering the structure-related HF component from the latent space. Extensive experiments over four public datasets show that our DINN360 method performs consid-erably better than other state-of-the-art methods for 2×, 4× and 8× 360◦ image rescaling.
