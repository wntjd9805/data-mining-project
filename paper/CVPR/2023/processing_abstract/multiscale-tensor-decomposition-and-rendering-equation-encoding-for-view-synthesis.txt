Rendering novel views from captured multi-view images has made considerable progress since the emergence of the neural radiance ﬁeld. This paper aims to further ad-vance the quality of view synthesis by proposing a novel approach dubbed the neural radiance feature ﬁeld (NRFF).We ﬁrst propose a multiscale tensor decomposition scheme to organize learnable features so as to represent scenes from coarse to ﬁne scales. We demonstrate many beneﬁts of the proposed multiscale representation, including more accurate scene shape and appearance reconstruction, and faster convergence compared with the single-scale repre-sentation.Instead of encoding view directions to model view-dependent effects, we further propose to encode the rendering equation in the feature space by employing the anisotropic spherical Gaussian mixture predicted from the proposed multiscale representation. The proposed NRFF improves state-of-the-art rendering results by over 1 dB inPSNR on both the NeRF and NSVF synthetic datasets. A signiﬁcant improvement has also been observed on the real-world Tanks & Temples dataset. Code can be found at https://github.com/imkanghan/nrff.
