This paper presents a framework for efficient 3D clothed avatar reconstruction. By combining the advantages of the high accuracy of optimization-based methods and the ef-ficiency of learning-based methods, we propose a coarse-to-fine way to realize a high-fidelity clothed avatar recon-struction (CAR) from a single image. At the first stage, we use an implicit model to learn the general shape in the canonical space of a person in a learning-based way, and at the second stage, we refine the surface detail by esti-mating the non-rigid deformation in the posed space in an optimization way. A hyper-network is utilized to generate a good initialization so that the convergence o f the opti-mization process is greatly accelerated. Extensive exper-iments on various datasets show that the proposed CAR successfully produces high-fidelity avatars for arbitrarily clothed humans in real scenes. The codes will be released in https://github.com/TingtingLiao/CAR.
