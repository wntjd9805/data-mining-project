Previous works for ObjectNav task attempt to learn the association (e.g. relation graph) between the visual inputs and the goal during training. Such association contains the prior knowledge of navigating in training environments, which is denoted as the experience. The experience per-forms a positive effect on helping the agent infer the likely location of the goal when the layout gap between the un-seen environments of the test and the prior knowledge ob-tained in training is minor. However, when the layout gap is significant, the experience exerts a negative effect on nav-igation. Motivated by keeping the positive effect and re-moving the negative effect of the experience, we propose the layout-based soft Total Direct Effect (L-sTDE) frame-work based on the causal inference to adjust the predic-tion of the navigation policy. In particular, we propose to calculate the layout gap which is defined as the KL diver-gence between the posterior and the prior distribution of the object layout. Then the sTDE is proposed to appropri-ately control the effect of the experience based on the lay-out gap. Experimental results on AI2THOR, RoboTHOR, and Habitat demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.The code is available at https://github.com/sx-zhang/Layout-based-sTDE.git.
