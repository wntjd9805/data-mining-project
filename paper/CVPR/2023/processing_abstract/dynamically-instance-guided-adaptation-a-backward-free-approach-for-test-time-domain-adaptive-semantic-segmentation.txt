In this paper, we study the application of Test-time domain adaptation in semantic segmentation (TTDA-Seg) where both efficiency and effectiveness are crucial. Exist-ing methods either have low efficiency (e.g., backward op-timization) or ignore semantic adaptation (e.g., distribution alignment). Besides, they would suffer from the accumu-lated errors caused by unstable optimization and abnormal distributions. To solve these problems, we propose a novel backward-free approach for TTDA-Seg, called DynamicallyInstance-Guided Adaptation (DIGA). Our principle is uti-lizing each instance to dynamically guide its own adapta-tion in a non-parametric way, which avoids the error ac-cumulation issue and expensive optimizing cost. Specifi-cally, DIGA is composed of a distribution adaptation mod-ule (DAM) and a semantic adaptation module (SAM), en-abling us to jointly adapt the model in two indispensable aspects. DAM mixes the instance and source BN statistics to*Corresponding author encourage the model to capture robust representation. SAM combines the historical prototypes with instance-level pro-totypes to adjust semantic predictions, which can be asso-ciated with the parametric classifier to mutually benefit the final results. Extensive experiments evaluated on five target domains demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Our DIGA establishes new state-of-the-art performance in TTDA-Seg.
