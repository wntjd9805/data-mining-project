Monocular 3D human pose estimation is quite challeng-ing due to the inherent ambiguity and occlusion, which often lead to high uncertainty and indeterminacy. On the other hand, diffusion models have recently emerged as an effec-tive tool for generating high-quality images from noise. In-spired by their capability, we explore a novel pose estima-tion framework (DiffPose) that formulates 3D pose estima-tion as a reverse diffusion process. We incorporate novel de-signs into our DiffPose to facilitate the diffusion process for 3D pose estimation: a pose-specific initialization of pose uncertainty distributions, a Gaussian Mixture Model-based forward diffusion process, and a context-conditioned re-verse diffusion process. Our proposed DiffPose significantly outperforms existing methods on the widely used pose estimation benchmarks Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP.Project page: https://gongjia0208.github.io/Diffpose/.
