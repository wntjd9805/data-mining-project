Current audio-visual separation methods share a stan-dard architecture design where an audio encoder-decoder network is fused with visual encoding features at the en-coder bottleneck. This design confounds the learning of multi-modal feature encoding with robust sound decod-ing for audio separation. To generalize to a new instru-ment, one must fine-tune the entire visual and audio net-work for all musical instruments. We re-formulate the visual-sound separation task and propose Instruments asQueries (iQuery) with a flexible query expansion mech-anism. Our approach ensures cross-modal consistency and cross-instrument disentanglement. We utilize “visually named” queries to initiate the learning of audio queries and use cross-modal attention to remove potential sound source interference at the estimated waveforms. To gen-eralize to a new instrument or event class, drawing inspi-ration from the text-prompt design, we insert additional queries as audio prompts while freezing the attention mech-anism. Experimental results on three benchmarks demon-strate that our iQuery improves audio-visual sound source separation performance. Code is available at https://github.com/JiabenChen/iQuery.
