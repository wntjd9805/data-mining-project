The representative instance segmentation methods mostly segment different object instances with a mask of the ﬁxed resolution, e.g., 28 × 28 grid. However, a low-resolution mask loses rich details, while a high-resolution mask incurs quadratic computation overhead. It is a chal-lenging task to predict the optimal binary mask for each in-stance. In this paper, we propose to dynamically select suit-able masks for different object proposals. First, a dual-levelFeature Pyramid Network (FPN) with adaptive feature ag-gregation is developed to gradually increase the mask grid resolution, ensuring high-quality segmentation of objects.Speciﬁcally, an efﬁcient region-level top-down path (r-FPN) is introduced to incorporate complementary contextual and detailed information from different stages of image-levelFPN (i-FPN). Then, to alleviate the increase of computa-tion and memory costs caused by using large masks, we de-velop a Mask Switch Module (MSM) with negligible compu-tational cost to select the most suitable mask resolution for each instance, achieving high efﬁciency while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Without bells and whistles, the proposed method, namely DynaMask, brings consistent and noticeable performance improvements over other state-of-the-arts at a moderate computation overhead.
