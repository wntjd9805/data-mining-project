Computer vision applications have heavily relied on the linear combination of Lambertian diffuse and microfacet specular reflection models for representing reflected radi-ance, which turns out to be physically incompatible andIn this paper, we derive a novel limited in applicability. analytical reflectance model, which we refer to as FresnelMicrofacet BRDF model, that is physically accurate and generalizes to various real-world surfaces. Our key idea is to model the Fresnel reflection and transmission of the surface microgeometry with a collection of oriented mirror facets, both for body and surface reflections. We carefully derive the Fresnel reflection and transmission for each mi-crofacet as well as the light transport between them in the subsurface. This physically-grounded modeling also allows us to express the polarimetric behavior of reflected light in addition to its radiometric behavior. That is, FMBRDF uni-fies not only body and surface reflections but also light re-flection in radiometry and polarization and represents them in a single model. Experimental results demonstrate its ef-fectiveness in accuracy, expressive power, image-based es-timation, and geometry recovery.
