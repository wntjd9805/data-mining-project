A signed distance function (SDF) parametrized by anMLP is a common ingredient of neural surface reconstruc-tion. We build on the successful recent method NeuS to ex-tend it by three new components. The first component is to borrow the tri-plane representation from EG3D and rep-resent signed distance fields as a mixture of tri-planes andMLPs instead of representing it with MLPs only. Using tri-planes leads to a more expressive data structure but will also introduce noise in the reconstructed surface. The sec-ond component is to use a new type of positional encoding with learnable weights to combat noise in the reconstruc-tion process. We divide the features in the tri-plane into multiple frequency scales and modulate them with sin and cos functions of different frequencies. The third component is to use learnable convolution operations on the tri-plane features using self-attention convolution to produce features with different frequency bands. The experiments show thatPET-NeuS achieves high-fidelity surface reconstruction on standard datasets. Following previous work and using theChamfer metric as the most important way to measure sur-face reconstruction quality, we are able to improve upon theNeuS baseline by 57% on Nerf-synthetic (0.84 compared to 1.97) and by 15.5% on DTU (0.71 compared to 0.84). The qualitative evaluation reveals how our method can better control the interference of high-frequency noise.
