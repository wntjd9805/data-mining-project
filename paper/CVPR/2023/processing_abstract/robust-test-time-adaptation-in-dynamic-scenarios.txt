Test-time adaptation (TTA) intends to adapt the pre-trained model to test distributions with only unlabeled test data streams. Most of the previous TTA methods have achieved great success on simple test data streams such as independently sampled data from single or multiple distri-butions. However, these attempts may fail in dynamic sce-narios of real-world applications like autonomous driving, where the environments gradually change and the test data is sampled correlatively over time.In this work, we ex-plore such practical test data streams to deploy the model on the fly, namely practical test-time adaptation (PTTA).To do so, we elaborate a Robust Test-Time Adaptation (RoTTA) method against the complex data stream in PTTA.More specifically, we present a robust batch normalization scheme to estimate the normalization statistics. Meanwhile, a memory bank is utilized to sample category-balanced data with consideration of timeliness and uncertainty. Further, to stabilize the training procedure, we develop a time-aware reweighting strategy with a teacher-student model. Exten-sive experiments prove that RoTTA enables continual test-time adaptation on the correlatively sampled data streams.Our method is easy to implement, making it a good choice for rapid deployment.
