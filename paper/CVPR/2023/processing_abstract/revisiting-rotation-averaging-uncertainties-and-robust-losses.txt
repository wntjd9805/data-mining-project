In this paper, we revisit the rotation averaging problem applied in global Structure-from-Motion pipelines. We ar-gue that the main problem of current methods is the mini-mized cost function that is only weakly connected with the input data via the estimated epipolar geometries. We pro-pose to better model the underlying noise distributions by directly propagating the uncertainty from the point corre-spondences into the rotation averaging. Such uncertain-ties are obtained for free by considering the Jacobians of two-view refinements. Moreover, we explore integrat-ing a variant of the MAGSAC loss into the rotation av-eraging problem, instead of using classical robust losses employed in current frameworks. The proposed method leads to results superior to baselines, in terms of accu-racy, on large-scale public benchmarks. The code is public. https://github.com/zhangganlin/GlobalSfMpy
