Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology has drawn increasing attention in recent years. It can extractBlood Volume Pulse (BVP) from facial videos, making many applications like health monitoring and emotional analysis more accessible. However, as the BVP signal is easily af-fected by environmental changes, existing methods struggle to generalize well for unseen domains. In this paper, we sys-tematically address the domain shift problem in the rPPG measurement task. We show that most domain generaliza-tion methods do not work well in this problem, as domain la-bels are ambiguous in complicated environmental changes.In light of this, we propose a domain-label-free approach called NEuron STructure modeling (NEST). NEST improves the generalization capacity by maximizing the coverage of feature space during training, which reduces the chance for under-optimized feature activation during inference. Be-sides, NEST can also enrich and enhance domain invari-ant features across multi-domain. We create and bench-mark a large-scale domain generalization protocol for the rPPG measurement task. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on both cross-dataset and intra-dataset settings. The codes are available at https://github.com/LuPaoPao/NEST.
