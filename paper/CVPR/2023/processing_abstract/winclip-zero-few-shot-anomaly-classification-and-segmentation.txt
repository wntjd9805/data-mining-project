Visual anomaly classification and segmentation are vi-tal for automating industrial quality inspection. The fo-cus of prior research in the field has been on training custom models for each quality inspection task, which re-quires task-specific images and annotation. In this paper we move away from this regime, addressing zero-shot and few-normal-shot anomaly classification and segmentation.Recently CLIP, a vision-language model, has shown rev-olutionary generality with competitive zero-/few-shot per-formance in comparison to full-supervision. But CLIP falls short on anomaly classification and segmentation tasks. Hence, we propose window-based CLIP (WinCLIP) with (1) a compositional ensemble on state words and prompt templates and (2) efficient extraction and aggre-gation of window/patch/image-level features aligned with text. We also propose its few-normal-shot extension Win-CLIP+, which uses complementary information from nor-mal images. In MVTec-AD (and VisA), without further tun-ing, WinCLIP achieves 91.8%/85.1% (78.1%/79.6%) AU-ROC in zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation while WinCLIP+ does 93.1%/95.2% (83.8%/96.4%) in 1-normal-shot, surpassing state-of-the-art by large margins.
