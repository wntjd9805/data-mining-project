We introduce Equivariant Neural Field ExpectationMaximization (EFEM), a simple, effective, and robust ge-ometric algorithm that can segment objects in 3D scenes without annotations or training on scenes. We achieve such unsupervised segmentation by exploiting single ob-ject shape priors. We make two novel steps in that direc-tion. First, we introduce equivariant shape representations to this problem to eliminate the complexity induced by the variation in object configuration. Second, we propose a novel EM algorithm that can iteratively refine segmenta-tion masks using the equivariant shape prior. We collect a novel real dataset Chairs and Mugs that contains vari-ous object configurations and novel scenes in order to verify the effectiveness and robustness of our method. Experimen-tal results demonstrate that our method achieves consis-tent and robust performance across different scenes where the (weakly) supervised methods may fail.
