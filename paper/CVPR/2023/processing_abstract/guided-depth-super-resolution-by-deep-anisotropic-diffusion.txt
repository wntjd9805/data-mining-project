Performing super-resolution of a depth image using the guidance from an RGB image is a problem that con-cerns several fields, such as robotics, medical imaging, and remote sensing. While deep learning methods have achieved good results in this problem, recent work high-lighted the value of combining modern methods with more formal frameworks. In this work, we propose a novel ap-proach which combines guided anisotropic diffusion with a deep convolutional network and advances the state of the art for guided depth super-resolution. The edge transfer-ring/enhancing properties of the diffusion are boosted by the contextual reasoning capabilities of modern networks, and a strict adjustment step guarantees perfect adherence to the source image. We achieve unprecedented results in three commonly used benchmarks for guided depth super-resolution. The performance gain compared to other meth-ods is the largest at larger scales, such as Ã—32 scaling.Code1 for the proposed method is available to promote re-producibility of our results.
