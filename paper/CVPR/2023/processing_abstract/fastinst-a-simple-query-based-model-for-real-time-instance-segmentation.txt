Recent attention in instance segmentation has focused on query-based models. Despite being non-maximum suppres-sion (NMS)-free and end-to-end, the superiority of these models on high-accuracy real-time benchmarks has not been well demonstrated. In this paper, we show the strong potential of query-based models on efficient instance seg-mentation algorithm designs. We present FastInst, a sim-ple, effective query-based framework for real-time instance segmentation. FastInst can execute at a real-time speed (i.e., 32.5 FPS) while yielding an AP of more than 40 (i.e., 40.5 AP) on COCO test-dev without bells and whis-tles. Specifically, FastInst follows the meta-architecture of recently introduced Mask2Former.Its key designs in-clude instance activation-guided queries, dual-path update strategy, and ground truth mask-guided learning, which en-able us to use lighter pixel decoders, fewer Transformer decoder layers, while achieving better performance. The experiments show that FastInst outperforms most state-of-the-art real-time counterparts, including strong fully con-volutional baselines, in both speed and accuracy.
