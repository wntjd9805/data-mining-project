In this work, we study few-shot domain adaptive ob-ject detection (FSDAOD), where only a few target labeled images are available for training in addition to sufficient source labeled images. Critically, in FSDAOD, the data scarcity in the target domain leads to an extreme data imbalance between the source and target domains, which potentially causes over-adaptation in traditional feature alignment. To address the data imbalance problem, we pro-pose an asymmetric adaptation paradigm, namely AsyFOD, which leverages the source and target instances from differ-ent perspectives. Specifically, by using target distribution estimation, the AsyFOD first identifies the target-similar source instances, which serves to augment the limited tar-get instances. Then, we conduct asynchronous alignment between target-dissimilar source instances and augmented target instances, which is simple yet effective for allevi-ating the over-adaptation. Extensive experiments demon-strate that the proposed AsyFOD outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on four FSDAOD benchmarks with var-ious environmental variances, e.g., 3.1% mAP improve-ment on Cityscapes-to-FoggyCityscapes and 2.9% mAP in-crease on Sim10k-to-Cityscapes.
