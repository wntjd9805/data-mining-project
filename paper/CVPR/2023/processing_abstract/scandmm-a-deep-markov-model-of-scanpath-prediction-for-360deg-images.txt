Scanpath prediction for 360◦ images aims to produce dy-namic gaze behaviors based on the human visual perception mechanism. Most existing scanpath prediction methods for 360◦ images do not give a complete treatment of the time-dependency when predicting human scanpath, resulting in inferior performance and poor generalizability. In this pa-per, we present a scanpath prediction method for 360◦ im-ages by designing a novel Deep Markov Model (DMM) architecture, namely ScanDMM. We propose a semantics-guided transition function to learn the nonlinear dynam-ics of time-dependent attentional landscape. Moreover, a state initialization strategy is proposed by considering the starting point of viewing, enabling the model to learn the dynamics with the correct “launcher”. We further demon-strate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on four 360◦ image databases, and exhibit its generalizabil-ity by presenting two applications of applying scanpath pre-diction models to other visual tasks – saliency detection and image quality assessment, expecting to provide profound in-sights into these fields.
