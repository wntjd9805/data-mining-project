This paper proposes a low latency neural network ar-chitecture for event-based dense prediction tasks. Conven-tional architectures encode entire scene contents at a fixed rate regardless of their temporal characteristics. Instead, the proposed network encodes contents at a proper tem-poral scale depending on its movement speed. We achieve this by constructing temporal hierarchy using stacked latent memories that operate at different rates. Given low latency event steams, the multi-level memories gradually extract dy-namic to static scene contents by propagating information from the fast to the slow memory modules. The architec-ture not only reduces the redundancy of conventional archi-tectures but also exploits long-term dependencies. Further-more, an attention-based event representation efficiently en-codes sparse event streams into the memory cells. We con-duct extensive evaluations on three event-based dense pre-diction tasks, where the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods on accuracy and latency, while demon-strating effective event and image fusion capabilities.
