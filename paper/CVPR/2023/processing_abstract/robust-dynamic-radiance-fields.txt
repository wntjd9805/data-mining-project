Dynamic radiance field reconstruction methods aim to model the time-varying structure and appearance of a dy-namic scene. Existing methods, however, assume that ac-curate camera poses can be reliably estimated by Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms. These methods, thus, are un-reliable as SfM algorithms often fail or produce erroneous poses on challenging videos with highly dynamic objects, poorly textured surfaces, and rotating camera motion. We address this robustness issue by jointly estimating the static and dynamic radiance fields along with the camera param-eters (poses and focal length). We demonstrate the robust-ness of our approach via extensive quantitative and qualita-tive experiments. Our results show favorable performance over the state-of-the-art dynamic view synthesis methods.
