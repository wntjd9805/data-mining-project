Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to train models to recognize novel compositional concepts based on learned concepts such as attribute-object combinations.One of the challenges is to model attributes interacted with different objects, e.g., the attribute “wet” in “wet apple” and “wet cat” is different. As a solution, we provide anal-ysis and argue that attributes are conditioned on the recog-nized object and input image and explore learning condi-tional attribute embeddings by a proposed attribute learn-ing framework containing an attribute hyper learner and an attribute base learner. By encoding conditional at-tributes, our model enables to generate flexible attribute embeddings for generalization from seen to unseen compo-sitions. Experiments on CZSL benchmarks, including the more challenging C-GQA dataset, demonstrate better per-formances compared with other state-of-the-art approaches and validate the importance of learning conditional at-tributes.
