The images captured under improper exposure condi-tions often suffer from contrast degradation and detail dis-tortion. Contrast degradation will destroy the statisti-cal properties of low-frequency components, while detail distortion will disturb the structural properties of high-frequency components, leading to the low-frequency and high-frequency components being mixed and inseparable.This will limit the statistical and structural modeling ca-pacity for exposure correction. To address this issue, this paper proposes to decouple the contrast enhancement andIt is detail restoration within each convolution process. based on the observation that, in the local regions covered by convolution kernels, the feature response of low-/high-frequency can be decoupled by addition/difference opera-tion. To this end, we inject the addition/difference operation into the convolution process and devise a Contrast Aware (CA) unit and a Detail Aware (DA) unit to facilitate the statistical and structural regularities modeling. The pro-posed CA and DA can be plugged into existing CNN-based exposure correction networks to substitute the TraditionalConvolution (TConv) to improve the performance. Fur-thermore, to maintain the computational costs of the net-work without changing, we aggregate two units into a singleTConv kernel using structural re-parameterization. Evalu-ations of nine methods and five benchmark datasets demon-strate that our proposed method can comprehensively im-prove the performance of existing methods without intro-ducing extra computational costs compared with the origi-nal networks. The codes will be publicly available.
