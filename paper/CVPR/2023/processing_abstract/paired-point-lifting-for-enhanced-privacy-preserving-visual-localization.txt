Visual localization refers to the process of recovering camera pose from input image relative to a known scene, forming a cornerstone of numerous vision and robotics sys-tems. While many algorithms utilize sparse 3D point cloud of the scene obtained via structure-from-motion (SfM) for localization, recent studies have raised privacy concerns by successfully revealing high-fidelity appearance of the scene from such sparse 3D representation. One prominent ap-proach for bypassing this attack was to lift 3D points to randomly oriented 3D lines thereby hiding scene geome-try, but latest work have shown such random line cloud has a critical statistical flaw that can be exploited to break through protection. In this work, we present an alternative lightweight strategy called Paired-Point Lifting (PPL) for constructing 3D line clouds. Instead of drawing one ran-domly oriented line per 3D point, PPL splits 3D points into pairs and joins each pair to form 3D lines. This seemingly simple strategy yields 3 benefits, i) new ambiguity in fea-ture selection, ii) increased line cloud sparsity and iii) non-trivial distribution of 3D lines, all of which contributes to enhanced protection against privacy attacks. Extensive ex-perimental results demonstrate the strength of PPL in con-cealing scene details without compromising localization ac-curacy, unlocking the true potential of 3D line clouds.
