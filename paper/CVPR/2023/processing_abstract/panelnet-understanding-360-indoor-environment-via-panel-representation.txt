Indoor 360 panoramas have two essential properties. (1)The panoramas are continuous and seamless in the hori-zontal direction. (2) Gravity plays an important role in in-door environment design. By leveraging these properties, we present PanelNet, a framework that understands indoor envi-ronments using a novel panel representation of 360 images.We represent an equirectangular projection (ERP) as consec-utive vertical panels with corresponding 3D panel geometry.To reduce the negative impact of panoramic distortion, we in-corporate a panel geometry embedding network that encodes both the local and global geometric features of a panel. To capture the geometric context in room design, we introduceLocal2Global Transformer, which aggregates local informa-tion within a panel and panel-wise global context. It greatly improves the model performance with low training overhead.Our method outperforms existing methods on indoor 360 depth estimation and shows competitive results against state-of-the-art approaches on the task of indoor layout estimation and semantic segmentation.
