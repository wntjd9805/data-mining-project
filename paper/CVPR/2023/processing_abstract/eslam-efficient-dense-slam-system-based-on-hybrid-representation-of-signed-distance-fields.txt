We present ESLAM, an efficient implicit neural represen-tation method for Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). ESLAM reads RGB-D frames with unknown cam-era poses in a sequential manner and incrementally recon-structs the scene representation while estimating the cur-rent camera position in the scene. We incorporate the latest advances in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) into a SLAM system, resulting in an efficient and accurate dense visualSLAM method. Our scene representation consists of multi-scale axis-aligned perpendicular feature planes and shal-low decoders that, for each point in the continuous space, decode the interpolated features into Truncated Signed Dis-tance Field (TSDF) and RGB values. Our extensive exper-iments on three standard datasets, Replica, ScanNet, andTUM RGB-D show that ESLAM improves the accuracy of 3D reconstruction and camera localization of state-of-the-art dense visual SLAM methods by more than 50%, while it runs up to Ã—10 faster and does not require any pre-training.Project page: https://www.idiap.ch/paper/eslam
