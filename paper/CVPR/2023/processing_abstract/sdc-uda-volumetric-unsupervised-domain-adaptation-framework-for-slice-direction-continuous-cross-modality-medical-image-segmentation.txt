Recent advances in deep learning-based medical im-age segmentation studies achieve nearly human-level per-formance in fully supervised manner. However, acquiring pixel-level expert annotations is extremely expensive and laborious in medical imaging fields. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) can alleviate this problem, which makes it possible to use annotated data in one imaging modal-ity to train a network that can successfully perform seg-In mentation on target imaging modality with no labels. this work, we propose SDC-UDA, a simple yet effective volumetric UDA framework for Slice-Direction Continuous cross-modality medical image segmentation which com-bines intra- and inter-slice self-attentive image translation, uncertainty-constrained pseudo-label refinement, and volu-metric self-training. Our method is distinguished from pre-vious methods on UDA for medical image segmentation in that it can obtain continuous segmentation in the slice di-rection, thereby ensuring higher accuracy and potential in clinical practice. We validate SDC-UDA with multiple pub-licly available cross-modality medical image segmentation datasets and achieve state-of-the-art segmentation perfor-mance, not to mention the superior slice-direction continu-ity of prediction compared to previous studies.
