When taking a picture, any camera shake during the shutter time can result in a blurred image. Recovering a sharp image from the one blurred by camera shake is a chal-lenging yet important problem. Most existing deep learning methods use supervised learning to train a deep neural net-work (DNN) on a dataset of many pairs of blurred/latent images. In contrast, this paper presents a dataset-free deep learning method for removing uniform and non-uniform blur effects from images of static scenes. Our method in-volves a DNN-based re-parametrization of the latent image, and we propose a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) approach to train the DNN without requiring any latent images. The Monte Carlo simulation is implemented via Langevin dynamics. Experiments showed that the pro-posed method outperforms existing methods signiÔ¨Åcantly in removing motion blur from images of static scenes.
