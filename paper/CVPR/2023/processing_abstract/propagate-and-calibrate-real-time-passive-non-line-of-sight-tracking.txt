Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) tracking has drawn increasing attention in recent years, due to its ability to detect ob-ject motion out of sight. Most previous works on NLOS tracking rely on active illumination, e.g., laser, and suf-fer from high cost and elaborate experimental conditions.Besides, these techniques are still far from practical appli-cation due to oversimpliﬁed settings. In contrast, we pro-pose a purely passive method to track a person walking in an invisible room by only observing a relay wall, which is more in line with real application scenarios, e.g., security.To excavate imperceptible changes in videos of the relay wall, we introduce difference frames as an essential car-In addition, we rier of temporal-local motion messages. propose PAC-Net, which consists of alternating propaga-tion and calibration, making it capable of leveraging both dynamic and static messages on a frame-level granular-ity. To evaluate the proposed method, we build and publish the ﬁrst dynamic passive NLOS tracking dataset, NLOS-Track, which ﬁlls the vacuum of realistic NLOS datasets.NLOS-Track contains thousands of NLOS video clips and corresponding trajectories. Both real-shot and synthetic data are included. Our codes and dataset are available at https://againstentropy.github.io/NLOS-Track/.
