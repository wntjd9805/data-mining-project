Pansharpening is an essential preprocessing step for re-mote sensing image processing. Although deep learning (DL) approaches performed well on this task, current up-sampling methods used in these approaches only utilize the local information of each pixel in the low-resolution multi-spectral (LRMS) image while neglecting to exploit its global information as well as the cross-modal information of the guiding panchromatic (PAN) image, which limits their per-formance improvement. To address this issue, this paper develops a novel probability-based global cross-modal up-sampling (PGCU) method for pan-sharpening. Precisely, we first formulate the PGCU method from a probabilis-tic perspective and then design an efficient network mod-ule to implement it by fully utilizing the information men-tioned above while simultaneously considering the chan-nel specificity. The PGCU module consists of three blocks, i.e., information extraction (IE), distribution and expecta-tion estimation (DEE), and fine adjustment (FA). Exten-sive experiments verify the superiority of the PGCU method compared with other popular upsampling methods. Addi-tionally, experiments also show that the PGCU module can help improve the performance of existing SOTA deep learn-ing pansharpening methods. The codes are available at https://github.com/Zeyu-Zhu/PGCU .Figure 1. Comparison between local upsampling methods and our proposed PGCU method. The local method has limited receptive field and thus only utilizes the local information of LRMS for up-sampling, while our proposed PGCU method can fully exploit the rich global information of LRMS and the cross-modal global in-formation of PAN.
