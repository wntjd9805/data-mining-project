The non-line-of-sight imaging technique aims to recon-struct targets from multiply reﬂected light. For most exist-ing methods, dense points on the relay surface are raster scanned to obtain high-quality reconstructions, which re-quires a long acquisition time. In this work, we propose a signal-surface collaborative regularization (SSCR) frame-work that provides noise-robust reconstructions with a min-imal number of measurements. Using Bayesian inference, we design joint regularizations of the estimated signal, the 3D voxel-based representation of the objects, and the 2D surface-based description of the targets. To our best knowl-edge, this is the ﬁrst work that combines regularizations in mixed dimensions for hidden targets. Experiments on syn-thetic and experimental datasets illustrated the efﬁciency of the proposed method under both confocal and non-confocal settings. We report the reconstruction of the hidden targets with complex geometric structures with only 5 × 5 confocal measurements from public datasets, indicating an acceler-ation of the conventional measurement process by a factor of 10,000. Besides, the proposed method enjoys low time and memory complexity with sparse measurements. Our approach has great potential in real-time non-line-of-sight imaging applications such as rescue operations and au-tonomous driving.
