We present a novel method, called NeuralUDF, for re-constructing surfaces with arbitrary topologies from 2D im-ages via volume rendering. Recent advances in neural ren-dering based reconstruction have achieved compelling re-sults. However, these methods are limited to objects with closed surfaces since they adopt Signed Distance Function (SDF) as surface representation which requires the target shape to be divided into inside and outside.In this pa-per, we propose to represent surfaces as the Unsigned Dis-tance Function (UDF) and develop a new volume rendering scheme to learn the neural UDF representation. Specifi-cally, a new density function that correlates the property ofUDF with the volume rendering scheme is introduced for robust optimization of the UDF fields. Experiments on theDTU and DeepFashion3D datasets show that our method not only enables high-quality reconstruction of non-closed shapes with complex typologies, but also achieves compa-rable performance to the SDF based methods on the re-construction of closed surfaces.
