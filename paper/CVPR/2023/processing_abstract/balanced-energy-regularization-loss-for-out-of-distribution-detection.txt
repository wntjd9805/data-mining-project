In the field of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, a pre-vious method that use auxiliary data as OOD data has shown promising performance. However, the method pro-vides an equal loss to all auxiliary data to differentiate them from inliers. However, based on our observation, in various tasks, there is a general imbalance in the distribution of the auxiliary OOD data across classes. We propose a balanced energy regularization loss that is simple but generally ef-fective for a variety of tasks. Our balanced energy regular-ization loss utilizes class-wise different prior probabilities for auxiliary data to address the class imbalance in OOD data. The main concept is to regularize auxiliary samples from majority classes, more heavily than those from minor-ity classes. Our approach performs better for OOD detec-tion in semantic segmentation, long-tailed image classifica-tion, and image classification than the prior energy regular-ization loss. Furthermore, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in two tasks: OOD detection in seman-tic segmentation and long-tailed image classification.
