It is difﬁcult to explore class representative features using minimal supervision of weak labels with a single backbone branch. Furthermore, in real-world sce-narios, the boundary between normal and abnormal is am-biguous and varies depending on the situation. For exam-ple, even for the same motion of running person, the ab-normality varies depending on whether the surroundings are a playground or a roadway. Therefore, our aim is to extract discriminative features by widening the relative gap between classes’ features from a single branch. In the proposed Class-Activate Feature Learning (CLAV), the fea-tures are extracted as per the weights that are implicitly activated depending on the class, and the gap is then en-larged through relative distance learning. Furthermore, as the relationship between context and motion is important in order to identify the anomalies in complex and diverse scenes, we propose a Context–Motion Interrelation Mod-ule (CoMo), which models the relationship between the ap-pearance of the surroundings and motion, rather than uti-lizing only temporal dependencies or motion information.The proposed method shows SOTA performance on four benchmarks including large-scale real-world datasets, and we demonstrate the importance of relational information by analyzing the qualitative results and generalization ability.
