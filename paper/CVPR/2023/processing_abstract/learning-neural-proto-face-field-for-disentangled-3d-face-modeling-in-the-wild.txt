Generative models show good potential for recovering 3D faces beyond limited shape assumptions. While plau-sible details and resolutions are achieved, these models easily fail under extreme conditions of pose, shadow or appearance, due to the entangled ﬁtting or lack of multi-view priors. To address this problem, this paper presents a novel Neural Proto-face Field (NPF) for unsupervised robust 3D face modeling.Instead of using constrained images as Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), NPF disentan-gles the common/speciﬁc facial cues, i.e., ID, expression and scene-speciﬁc details from in-the-wild photo collec-tions. Speciﬁcally, NPF learns a face prototype to aggregate 3D-consistent identity via uncertainty modeling, extract-ing multi-image priors from a photo collection. NPF then learns to deform the prototype with the appropriate facial expressions, constrained by a loss of expression consistency and personal idiosyncrasies. Finally, NPF is optimized to ﬁt a target image in the collection, recovering speciﬁc detailsIn this way, the generative of appearance and geometry. model beneﬁts from multi-image priors and meaningful fa-cial structures. Extensive experiments on benchmarks show that NPF recovers superior or competitive facial shapes and textures, compared to state-of-the-art methods.
