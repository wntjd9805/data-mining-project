Dense geometric matching determines the dense pixel-wise correspondence between a source and support image corresponding to the same 3D structure. Prior works em-ploy an encoder of transformer blocks to correlate the two-frame features. However, existing monocular pretraining tasks, e.g., image classification, and masked image model-ing (MIM), can not pretrain the cross-frame module, yield-ing less optimal performance. To resolve this, we reformu-late the MIM from reconstructing a single masked image to reconstructing a pair of masked images, enabling the pre-training of transformer module. Additionally, we incorpo-rate a decoder into pretraining for improved upsampling results. Further, to be robust to the textureless area, we pro-pose a novel cross-frame global matching module (CFGM).Since the most textureless area is planar surfaces, we pro-pose a homography loss to further regularize its learning.Combined together, we achieve the State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance on geometric matching.
