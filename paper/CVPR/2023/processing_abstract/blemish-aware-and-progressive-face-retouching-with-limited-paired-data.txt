Face retouching aims to remove facial blemishes, while at the same time maintaining the textual details of a giv-en input image. The main challenge lies in distinguishing blemishes from the facial characteristics, such as moles.Training an image-to-image translation network with pixel-wise supervision suffers from the problem of expensive paired training data, since professional retouching need-In this s specialized experience and is time-consuming. paper, we propose a Blemish-aware and Progressive FaceRetouching model, which is referred to as BPFRe. Our framework can be partitioned into two manageable stages to perform progressive blemish removal. Speciﬁcally, an encoder-decoder-based module learns to coarsely remove the blemishes at the ﬁrst stage, and the resulting interme-diate features are injected into a generator to enrich lo-cal detail at the second stage. We ﬁnd that explicitly sup-pressing the blemishes can contribute to an effective col-laboration among the components. Toward this end, we incorporate an attention module, which learns to infer a blemish-aware map and further determine the correspond-ing weights, which are then used to reﬁne the intermediate features transferred from the encoder to the decoder, and from the decoder to the generator. Therefore, BPFRe is able to deliver signiﬁcant performance gains on a wide range of face retouching tasks. It is worth noting that we reduce the dependence of BPFRe on paired training samples by impos-ing effective regularization on unpaired ones.
