Approximating radiance fields with discretized volu-metric grids is one of promising directions for improv-ing NeRFs, represented by methods like DVGO, Plenox-els and TensoRF, which achieve super-fast training con-vergence and real-time rendering. However, these meth-ods typically require a tremendous storage overhead, cost-ing up to hundreds of megabytes of disk space and run-time memory for a single scene. We address this issue in this paper by introducing a simple yet effective framework, called vector quantized radiance fields (VQRF), for com-pressing these volume-grid-based radiance fields. We first present a robust and adaptive metric for estimating redun-dancy in grid models and performing voxel pruning by bet-ter exploring intermediate outputs of volumetric rendering.A trainable vector quantization is further proposed to im-prove the compactness of grid models. In combination with an efficient joint tuning strategy and post-processing, our method can achieve a compression ratio of 100Ã— by reduc-ing the overall model size to 1 MB with negligible loss on visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework is capable of achieving unrivaled per-formance and well generalization across multiple methods with distinct volumetric structures, facilitating the wide use of volumetric radiance fields methods in real-world appli-cations.
