Indirect time-of-flight (iToF) imaging allows us to capture dense depth information at a low cost. However, iToF imag-ing often suffers from multipath interference (MPI) arti-facts in the presence of scattering media, resulting in se-vere depth-accuracy degradation. For instance, iToF cam-eras cannot measure depth accurately through fog becauseToF active illumination scatters back to the sensor before reaching the farther target surface. In this work, we pro-pose a polarimetric iToF imaging method that can capture depth information robustly through scattering media. Our observations on the principle of indirect ToF imaging and polarization of light allow us to formulate a novel computa-tional model of scattering-aware polarimetric phase mea-surements that enables us to correct MPI errors. We first devise a scattering-aware polarimetric iToF model that can estimate the phase of unpolarized backscattered light. We then combine the optical filtering of polarization and our computational modeling of unpolarized backscattered light via scattering analysis of phase and amplitude. This allows us to tackle the MPI problem by estimating the scattering energy through the participating media. We validate our method on an experimental setup using a customized off-the-shelf iToF camera. Our method outperforms baseline methods by a significant margin by means of our scattering model and polarimetric phase measurements.
