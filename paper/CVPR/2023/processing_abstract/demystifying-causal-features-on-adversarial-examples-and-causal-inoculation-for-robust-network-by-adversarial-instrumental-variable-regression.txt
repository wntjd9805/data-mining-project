The origin of adversarial examples is still inexplicable in research fields, and it arouses arguments from various view-points, albeit comprehensive investigations. In this paper, we propose a way of delving into the unexpected vulnera-bility in adversarially trained networks from a causal per-spective, namely adversarial instrumental variable (IV) re-gression. By deploying it, we estimate the causal relation of adversarial prediction under an unbiased environment dis-sociated from unknown confounders. Our approach aims to demystify inherent causal features on adversarial exam-ples by leveraging a zero-sum optimization game between a casual feature estimator (i.e., hypothesis model) and worst-case counterfactuals (i.e., test function) disturbing to find causal features. Through extensive analyses, we demon-strate that the estimated causal features are highly related to the correct prediction for adversarial robustness, and the counterfactuals exhibit extreme features significantly devi-ating from the correct prediction. In addition, we present how to effectively inoculate CAusal FEatures (CAFE) into defense networks for improving adversarial robustness.
