mpg.de/projects/MoFusion/.Conventional methods for human motion synthesis have either been deterministic or have had to struggle with the trade-off between motion diversity vs motion quality. In re-sponse to these limitations, we introduce MoFusion, i.e., a new denoising-diffusion-based framework for high-quality conditional human motion synthesis that can synthesise long, temporally plausible, and semantically accurate mo-tions based on a range of conditioning contexts (such as mu-sic and text). We also present ways to introduce well-known kinematic losses for motion plausibility within the motion-diffusion framework through our scheduled weighting strat-egy. The learned latent space can be used for several inter-active motion-editing applications like in-betweening, seed-conditioning, and text-based editing, thus, providing cru-cial abilities for virtual-character animation and robotics.Through comprehensive quantitative evaluations and a per-ceptual user study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Mo-Fusion compared to the state of the art on established benchmarks in the literature.
