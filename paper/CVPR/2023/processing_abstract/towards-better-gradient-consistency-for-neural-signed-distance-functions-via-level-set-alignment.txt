Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) have shown re-markable capability in representing geometry with detail-s. However, without signed distance supervision, it is still a challenge to infer SDFs from point clouds or multi-view images using neural networks. In this paper, we claim that gradient consistency in the ﬁeld, indicated by the parallelis-m of level sets, is the key factor affecting the inference ac-curacy. Hence, we propose a level set alignment loss to evaluate the parallelism of level sets, which can be mini-mized to achieve better gradient consistency. Our novel-ty lies in that we can align all level sets to the zero lev-el set by constraining gradients at queries and their pro-jections on the zero level set in an adaptive way. Our in-sight is to propagate the zero level set to everywhere in theﬁeld through consistent gradients to eliminate uncertainty in the ﬁeld that is caused by the discreteness of 3D point clouds or the lack of observations from multi-view images.Our proposed loss is a general term which can be used up-on different methods to infer SDFs from 3D point clouds and multi-view images. Our numerical and visual compar-isons demonstrate that our loss can signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of SDFs inferred from point clouds or multi-view images under various benchmarks.
