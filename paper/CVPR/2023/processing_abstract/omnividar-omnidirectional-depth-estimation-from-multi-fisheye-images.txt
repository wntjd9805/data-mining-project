Estimating depth from four large ﬁeld of view (FoV) cam-eras has been a difﬁcult and understudied problem. In this paper, we proposed a novel and simple system that can con-vert this difﬁcult problem into easier binocular depth esti-mation. We name this system OmniVidar, as its results are similar to LiDAR, but rely only on vision. OmniVidar con-tains three components: (1) a new camera model to address the shortcomings of existing models, (2) a new multi-ﬁsheye camera based epipolar rectiﬁcation method for solving the image distortion and simplifying the depth estimation prob-lem, (3) an improved binocular depth estimation network, which achieves a better balance between accuracy and efﬁ-ciency. Unlike other omnidirectional stereo vision methods,OmniVidar does not contain any 3D convolution, so it can achieve higher resolution depth estimation at fast speed.Results demonstrate that OmniVidar outperforms all other methods in terms of accuracy and performance.
