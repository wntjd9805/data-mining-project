In this paper, we propose an efficient event-based motion estimation framework for various motion models. Differ-ent from previous works, we design a progressive event-to-map alignment scheme and utilize the spatio-temporal cor-relations to align events. In detail, we progressively align sampled events in an event batch to the time-surface map and obtain the updated motion model by minimizing a novel time-surface loss. In addition, a dynamic batch size strat-egy is applied to adaptively adjust the batch size so that all events in the batch are consistent with the current mo-tion model. Our framework has three advantages: a) the progressive scheme refines motion parameters iteratively, achieving accurate motion estimation; b) within one iter-ation, only a small portion of events are involved in opti-mization, which greatly reduces the total runtime; c) the dynamic batch size strategy ensures that the constant ve-locity assumption always holds. We conduct comprehen-sive experiments to evaluate our framework on challeng-ing high-speed scenes with three motion models: rotational, homography, and 6-DOF models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art estimation accuracy and efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/huangxueyan/PEME.
