Real-world medical image segmentation has tremen-dous long-tailed complexity of objects, among which tail conditions correlate with relatively rare diseases and are clinically significant.A trustworthy medical AI algo-rithm should demonstrate its effectiveness on tail condi-tions to avoid clinically dangerous damage in these out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. In this paper, we adopt the con-cept of object queries in Mask Transformers to formulate semantic segmentation as a soft cluster assignment. The queries fit the feature-level cluster centers of inliers dur-ing training. Therefore, when performing inference on a medical image in real-world scenarios, the similarity be-tween pixels and the queries detects and localizes OOD re-gions. We term this OOD localization as MaxQuery. Fur-thermore, the foregrounds of real-world medical images, whether OOD objects or inliers, are lesions. The differ-ence between them is less than that between the foreground and background, possibly misleading the object queries to focus redundantly on the background. Thus, we propose a query-distribution (QD) loss to enforce clear boundaries between segmentation targets and other regions at the query level, improving the inlier segmentation and OOD indi-cation. Our proposed framework is tested on two real-world segmentation tasks, i.e., segmentation of pancreatic and liver tumors, outperforming previous state-of-the-art algorithms by an average of 7.39% on AUROC, 14.69% onAUPR, and 13.79% on FPR95 for OOD localization. On the other hand, our framework improves the performance of inlier segmentation by an average of 5.27% DSC when compared with the leading baseline nnUNet.
