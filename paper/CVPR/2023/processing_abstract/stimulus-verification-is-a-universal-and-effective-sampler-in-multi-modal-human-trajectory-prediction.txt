To comprehensively cover the uncertainty of the future, the common practice of multi-modal human trajectory pre-diction is to first generate a set/distribution of candidate fu-ture trajectories and then sample required numbers of tra-jectories from them as final predictions. Even though a large number of previous researches develop various strong models to predict candidate trajectories, how to effectively sample the final ones has not received much attention yet.In this paper, we propose stimulus verification, serving as a universal and effective sampling process to improve the multi-modal prediction capability, where stimulus refers to the factor in the observation that may affect the future movements such as social interaction and scene context.Stimulus verification introduces a probabilistic model, de-noted as stimulus verifier, to verify the coherence between a predicted future trajectory and its corresponding stimulus.By highlighting prediction samples with better stimulus-coherence, stimulus verification ensures sampled trajecto-ries plausible from the stimulusâ€™ point of view and there-fore aids in better multi-modal prediction performance. We implement stimulus verification on five representative pre-diction frameworks and conduct exhaustive experiments on three widely-used benchmarks. Superior results demon-strate the effectiveness of our approach.
