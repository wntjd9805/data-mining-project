To be successful, Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents must be able to ground instructions to ac-tions based on their surroundings. In this work, we develop a methodology to study agent behavior on a skill-specific basis â€“ examining how well existing agents ground instruc-tions about stopping, turning, and moving towards speci-fied objects or rooms. Our approach is based on gener-ating skill-specific interventions and measuring changes in agent predictions. We present a detailed case study analyz-ing the behavior of a recent agent and then compare multi-ple agents in terms of skill-specific competency scores. This analysis suggests that biases from training have lasting ef-fects on agent behavior and that existing models are able to ground simple referring expressions. Our comparisons be-tween models show that skill-specific scores correlate with improvements in overall VLN task performance.
