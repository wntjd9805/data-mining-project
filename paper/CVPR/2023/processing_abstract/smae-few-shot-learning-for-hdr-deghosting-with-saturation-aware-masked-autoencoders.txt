Generating a high-quality High Dynamic Range (HDR) image from dynamic scenes has recently been extensively studied by exploiting Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). MostDNNs-based methods require a large amount of train-ing data with ground truth, requiring tedious and time-consuming work. Few-shot HDR imaging aims to generate satisfactory images with limited data. However, it is dif-ficult for modern DNNs to avoid overfitting when trained on only a few images.In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised approach to realize few-shot HDR imag-ing via two stages of training, called SSHDR. Unlikely pre-vious methods, directly recovering content and removing ghosts simultaneously, which is hard to achieve optimum, we first generate content of saturated regions with a self-supervised mechanism and then address ghosts via an itera-tive semi-supervised learning framework. Concretely, con-sidering that saturated regions can be regarded as mask-ing Low Dynamic Range (LDR) input regions, we design aSaturated Mask AutoEncoder (SMAE) to learn a robust fea-ture representation and reconstruct a non-saturated HDR image. We also propose an adaptive pseudo-label selection strategy to pick high-quality HDR pseudo-labels in the sec-ond stage to avoid the effect of mislabeled samples. Ex-periments demonstrate that SSHDR outperforms state-of-the-art methods quantitatively and qualitatively within and across different datasets, achieving appealing HDR visual-ization with few labeled samples.
