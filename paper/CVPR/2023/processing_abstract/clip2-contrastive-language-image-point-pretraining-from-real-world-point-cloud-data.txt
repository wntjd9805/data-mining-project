Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training, benefiting from large-scale unlabeled text-image pairs, has demon-strated great performance in open-world vision understand-ing tasks. However, due to the limited Text-3D data pairs, adapting the success of 2D Vision-Language Models (VLM) to the 3D space remains an open problem. Existing works that leverage VLM for 3D understanding generally resort to constructing intermediate 2D representations for the 3D data, but at the cost of losing 3D geometry information.To take a step toward open-world 3D vision understand-ing, we propose Contrastive Language-Image-Point CloudPretraining (CLIP2) to directly learn the transferable 3D point cloud representation in realistic scenarios with a novel proxy alignment mechanism. Specifically, we exploit naturally-existed correspondences in 2D and 3D scenarios, and build well-aligned and instance-based text-image-point proxies from those complex scenarios. On top of that, we propose a cross-modal contrastive objective to learn se-mantic and instance-level aligned point cloud representa-∗Equal contribution.University of Science and TechnologyKong huawei.com 4Sun Yat-san University 1Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab 2Hong Kong 3The Chinese University of Hong†Corresponding Author: xu.hang@ tion.

Furthermore, we provide analyses of the capability of different representations in real scenarios and present the optional ensemble scheme.
