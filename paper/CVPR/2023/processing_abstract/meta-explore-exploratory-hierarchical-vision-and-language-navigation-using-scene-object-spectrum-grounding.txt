The main challenge in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is how to understand natural-language instructions in an unseen environment. The main limitation of conven-tional VLN algorithms is that if an action is mistaken, the agent fails to follow the instructions or explores unneces-sary regions, leading the agent to an irrecoverable path. To tackle this problem, we propose Meta-Explore, a hierarchi-cal navigation method deploying an exploitation policy to correct misled recent actions. We show that an exploitation policy, which moves the agent toward a well-chosen local goal among unvisited but observable states, outperforms a method which moves the agent to a previously visited state.We also highlight the demand for imagining regretful explo-rations with semantically meaningful clues. The key to our approach is understanding the object placements around the agent in spectral-domain. Speciﬁcally, we present a novel visual representation, called scene object spectrum (SOS), which performs category-wise 2D Fourier transform of de-tected objects. Combining exploitation policy and SOS fea-tures, the agent can correct its path by choosing a promis-ing local goal. We evaluate our method in three VLN bench-marks: R2R, SOON, and REVERIE. Meta-Explore outper-forms other baselines and shows signiﬁcant generalization performance. In addition, local goal search using the pro-posed spectral-domain SOS features signiﬁcantly improves the success rate by 17.1% and SPL by 20.6% against the state-of-the-art method of the SOON benchmark.
