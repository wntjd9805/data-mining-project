In this paper we introduce a rule-based, compositional, and hierarchical modeling of action using Therbligs as ourIntroducing these atoms provides us with a con-atoms. sistent, expressive, contact-centered representation of ac-tion. Over the atoms we introduce a differentiable method of rule-based reasoning to regularize for logical consistency.Our approach is complementary to other approaches in that the Therblig-based representations produced by our archi-tecture augment rather than replace existing architecturesâ€™ representations. We release the first Therblig-centered an-notations over two popular video datasets - EPIC Kitchens 100 and 50-Salads. We also broadly demonstrate bene-fits to adopting Therblig representations through evalua-tion on the following tasks: action segmentation, action anticipation, and action recognition - observing an aver-age 10.5%/7.53%/6.5% relative improvement, respectively, over EPIC Kitchens and an average 8.9%/6.63%/4.8% rel-ative improvement, respectively, over 50 Salads. Code and data will be made publicly available.
