Point cloud classiﬁcation is an essential component in many security-critical applications such as autonomous driving and augmented reality. However, point cloud classi-ﬁers are vulnerable to adversarially perturbed point clouds.Existing certiﬁed defenses against adversarial point clouds suffer from a key limitation: their certiﬁed robustness guar-antees are probabilistic, i.e., they produce an incorrect cer-tiﬁed robustness guarantee with some probability. In this work, we propose a general framework, namely PointCert, that can transform an arbitrary point cloud classiﬁer to be certiﬁably robust against adversarial point clouds with de-terministic guarantees. PointCert certiﬁably predicts the same label for a point cloud when the number of arbitrarily added, deleted, and/or modiﬁed points is less than a thresh-old. Moreover, we propose multiple methods to optimize the certiﬁed robustness guarantees of PointCert in three appli-cation scenarios. We systematically evaluate PointCert onModelNet and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets. Our re-sults show that PointCert substantially outperforms state-of-the-art certiﬁed defenses even though their robustness guarantees are probabilistic.
