Representing visual signals with implicit coordinate-based neural networks, as an effective replacement of the traditional discrete signal representation, has gained con-siderable popularity in computer vision and graphics. In contrast to existing implicit neural representations which focus on modelling the scene only, this paper proposes a novel implicit camera model which represents the physical imaging process of a camera as a deep neural network. We demonstrate the power of this new implicit camera model on two inverse imaging tasks: i) generating all-in-focus pho-*Work was done during an internship at Tencent AI Lab.†Corresponding authors. tos, and ii) HDR imaging. Specifically, we devise an im-plicit blur generator and an implicit tone mapper to model the aperture and exposure of the camera’s imaging process, respectively. Our implicit camera model is jointly learned together with implicit scene models under multi-focus stack and multi-exposure bracket supervision. We have demon-strated the effectiveness of our new model on a large num-ber of test images and videos, producing accurate and visu-ally appealing all-in-focus and high dynamic range images.In principle, our new implicit neural camera model has the potential to benefit a wide array of other inverse imaging tasks.
