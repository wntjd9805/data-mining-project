Weakly supervised instance segmentation using only bounding box annotations has recently attracted much re-search attention. Most of the current efforts leverage low-level image features as extra supervision without explicitly exploiting the high-level semantic information of the ob-jects, which will become ineffective when the foreground ob-jects have similar appearances to the background or other objects nearby. We propose a new box-supervised instance segmentation approach by developing a Semantic-aware In-stance Mask (SIM) generation paradigm. Instead of heav-ily relying on local pair-wise afÔ¨Ånities among neighboring pixels, we construct a group of category-wise feature cen-troids as prototypes to identify foreground objects and as-sign them semantic-level pseudo labels. Considering that the semantic-aware prototypes cannot distinguish differ-ent instances of the same semantics, we propose a self-correction mechanism to rectify the falsely activated regions while enhancing the correct ones. Furthermore, to handle the occlusions between objects, we tailor the Copy-Paste operation for the weakly-supervised instance segmentation task to augment challenging training data. Extensive exper-imental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposedSIM approach over other state-of-the-art methods. The source code: https://github.com/lslrh/SIM .
