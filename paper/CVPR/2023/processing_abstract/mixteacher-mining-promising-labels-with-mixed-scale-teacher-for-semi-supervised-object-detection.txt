Scale variation across object instances remains a key challenge in object detection task. Despite the remarkable progress made by modern detection models, this challenge is particularly evident in the semi-supervised case. While existing semi-supervised object detection methods rely on strict conditions to filter high-quality pseudo labels from network predictions, we observe that objects with extreme scale tend to have low confidence, resulting in a lack of positive supervision for these objects.In this paper, we propose a novel framework that addresses the scale vari-ation problem by introducing a mixed scale teacher to im-prove pseudo label generation and scale-invariant learn-ing. Additionally, we propose mining pseudo labels using score promotion of predictions across scales, which bene-fits from better predictions from mixed scale features. Our extensive experiments on MS COCO and PASCAL VOC benchmarks under various semi-supervised settings demon-strate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art per-formance.
