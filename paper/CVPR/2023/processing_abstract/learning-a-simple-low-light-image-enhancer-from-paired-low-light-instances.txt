Low-light Image Enhancement (LIE) aims at improving contrast and restoring details for images captured in low-light conditions. Most of the previous LIE algorithms ad-just illumination using a single input image with several handcrafted priors. Those solutions, however, often fail in revealing image details due to the limited information in a single image and the poor adaptability of handcrafted priors. To this end, we propose PairLIE, an unsupervised approach that learns adaptive priors from low-light im-age pairs. First, the network is expected to generate the same clean images as the two inputs share the same im-age content. To achieve this, we impose the network with the Retinex theory and make the two reflectance compo-nents consistent. Second, to assist the Retinex decompo-sition, we propose to remove inappropriate features in the raw image with a simple self-supervised mechanism. Ex-tensive experiments on public datasets show that the pro-posed PairLIE achieves comparable performance against the state-of-the-art approaches with a simpler network and fewer handcrafted priors.
