Barlow Twins and VICReg are self-supervised represen-tation learning models that use regularizers to decorrelate features. Although these models are as effective as conven-tional representation learning models, their training can be computationally demanding if the dimension 𝑑 of the pro-jected embeddings is high. As the regularizers are defined in terms of individual elements of a cross-correlation or covariance matrix, computing the loss for 𝑛 samples takes𝑂 (𝑛𝑑2) time. In this paper, we propose a relaxed decorre-lating regularizer that can be computed in 𝑂 (𝑛𝑑 log 𝑑) time by Fast Fourier Transform. We also propose an inexpensive technique to mitigate undesirable local minima that develop with the relaxation. The proposed regularizer exhibits ac-curacy comparable to that of existing regularizers in down-stream tasks, whereas their training requires less memory and is faster for large 𝑑. The source code is available.1
