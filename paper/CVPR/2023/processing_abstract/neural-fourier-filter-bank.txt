We present a novel method to provide efﬁcient and highly detailed reconstructions. Inspired by wavelets, we learn a neural ﬁeld that decompose the signal both spatially and frequency-wise. We follow the recent grid-based paradigm for spatial decomposition, but unlike existing work, encour-age speciﬁc frequencies to be stored in each grid via Fourier features encodings. We then apply a multi-layer perceptron with sine activations, taking these Fourier encoded features in at appropriate layers so that higher-frequency compo-nents are accumulated on top of lower-frequency compo-nents sequentially, which we sum up to form the ﬁnal out-put. We demonstrate that our method outperforms the state of the art regarding model compactness and convergence speed on multiple tasks: 2D image ﬁtting, 3D shape recon-struction, and neural radiance ﬁelds.
