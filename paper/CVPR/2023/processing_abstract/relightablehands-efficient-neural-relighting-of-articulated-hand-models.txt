at real-time speeds. https://sh8.io/#/relightable handsWe present the ﬁrst neural relighting approach for ren-dering high-ﬁdelity personalized hands that can be ani-mated in real-time under novel illumination. Our approach adopts a teacher-student framework, where the teacher learns appearance under a single point light from images captured in a light-stage, allowing us to synthesize hands in arbitrary illuminations but with heavy compute. Using images rendered by the teacher model as training data, an efﬁcient student model directly predicts appearance under natural illuminations in real-time. To achieve generaliza-tion, we condition the student model with physics-inspired illumination features such as visibility, diffuse shading, and specular reﬂections computed on a coarse proxy geometry, maintaining a small computational overhead. Our key in-sight is that these features have strong correlation with sub-sequent global light transport effects, which proves sufﬁ-cient as conditioning data for the neural relighting network.Moreover, in contrast to bottleneck illumination condition-ing, these features are spatially aligned based on underlying geometry, leading to better generalization to unseen illumi-nations and poses. In our experiments, we demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our illumination feature representations, outper-forming baseline approaches. We also show that our ap-proach can photorealistically relight two interacting hands⇤This work was done during an internship at Meta
