Instance segmentation seeks to identify and segment each object from images, which often relies on a large num-ber of dense annotations for model training. To allevi-ate this burden, unsupervised instance segmentation meth-ods have been developed to train class-agnostic instance segmentation models without any annotation.In this pa-per, we propose a novel unsupervised instance segmenta-tion approach, Exemplar-FreeSOLO, to enhance unsuper-vised instance segmentation by exploiting a limited num-ber of unannotated and unsegmented exemplars. The pro-posed framework offers a new perspective on directly per-ceiving top-down information without annotations. Specif-ically, Exemplar-FreeSOLO introduces a novel exemplar-knowledge abstraction module to acquire beneficial top-down guidance knowledge for instances using unsupervised exemplar object extraction. Moreover, a new exemplar em-bedding contrastive module is designed to enhance the dis-criminative capability of the segmentation model by exploit-ing the contrastive exemplar-based guidance knowledge in the embedding space. To evaluate the proposed Exemplar-FreeSOLO, we conduct comprehensive experiments and perform in-depth analyses on three image instance seg-mentation datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
