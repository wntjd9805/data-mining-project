Vector graphics (VG) are ubiquitous in industrial de-signs.In this paper, we address semantic segmentation of a typical VG, i.e., roughcast floorplans with bare wall structures, whose output can be directly used for further applications like interior furnishing and room space mod-eling. Previous semantic segmentation works mostly pro-cess well-decorated floorplans in raster images and usu-ally yield aliased boundaries and outlier fragments in seg-mented rooms, due to pixel-level segmentation that ignores the regular elements (e.g. line segments) in vector floor-plans. To overcome these issues, we propose to fully uti-lize the regular elements in vector floorplans for more in-tegral segmentation. Our pipeline predicts room segmen-tation from vector floorplans by dually classifying line seg-ments as room boundaries, and regions partitioned by line segments as room segments. To fully exploit the structural relationships between lines and regions, we use two-stream graph neural networks to process the line segments and par-titioned regions respectively, and devise a novel modulated graph attention layer to fuse the heterogeneous information from one stream to the other. Extensive experiments show that by directly operating on vector floorplans, we outper-form image-based methods in both mIoU and mAcc. In ad-dition, we propose a new metric that captures room integrity and boundary regularity, which confirms that our method produces much more regular segmentations.
