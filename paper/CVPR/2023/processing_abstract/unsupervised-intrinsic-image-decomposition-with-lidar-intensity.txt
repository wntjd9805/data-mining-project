Intrinsic image decomposition (IID) is the task that de-composes a natural image into albedo and shade. WhileIID is typically solved through supervised learning meth-ods, it is not ideal due to the difficulty in observing ground truth albedo and shade in general scenes. Conversely, un-supervised learning methods are currently underperforming supervised learning methods since there are no criteria for solving the ill-posed problems. Recently, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is widely used due to its ability to make highly precise distance measurements. Thus, we have fo-cused on the utilization of LiDAR, especially LiDAR inten-sity, to address this issue. In this paper, we propose unsu-pervised intrinsic image decomposition with LiDAR inten-sity (IID-LI). Since the conventional unsupervised learning methods consist of image-to-image transformations, sim-ply inputting LiDAR intensity is not an effective approach.Therefore, we design an intensity consistency loss that com-putes the error between LiDAR intensity and gray-scaled albedo to provide a criterion for the ill-posed problem. In addition, LiDAR intensity is difficult to handle due to its sparsity and occlusion, hence, a LiDAR intensity densifica-tion module is proposed. We verified the estimating quality using our own dataset, which include RGB images, LiDAR intensity and human judged annotations. As a result, we achieved an estimation accuracy that outperforms conven-tional unsupervised learning methods.
