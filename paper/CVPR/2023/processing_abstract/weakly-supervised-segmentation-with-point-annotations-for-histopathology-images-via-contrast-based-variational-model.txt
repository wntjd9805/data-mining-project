Image segmentation is a fundamental task in the field of imaging and vision. Supervised deep learning for segmen-tation has achieved unparalleled success when sufficient training data with annotated labels are available. However, annotation is known to be expensive to obtain, especially for histopathology images where the target regions are usu-ally with high morphology variations and irregular shapes.Thus, weakly supervised learning with sparse annotations of points is promising to reduce the annotation workload. In this work, we propose a contrast-based variational model to generate segmentation results, which serve as reliable complementary supervision to train a deep segmentation model for histopathology images. The proposed method considers the common characteristics of target regions in histopathology images and can be trained in an end-to-end manner.It can generate more regionally consistent and smoother boundary segmentation, and is more robust to un-labeled ‘novel’ regions. Experiments on two different his-tology datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency in comparison to previous models.
