When facing changing environments in the real world, the lightweight model on client devices suffers from se-vere performance drops under distribution shifts. The main limitations of the existing device model lie in (1) unable to update due to the computation limit of the device, (2) the limited generalization ability of the lightweight model.Meanwhile, recent large models have shown strong gen-eralization capability on the cloud while they can not be deployed on client devices due to poor computation con-straints. To enable the device model to deal with chang-ing environments, we propose a new learning paradigm ofCloud-Device Collaborative Continual Adaptation, which encourages collaboration between cloud and device and im-proves the generalization of the device model. Based on this paradigm, we further propose an Uncertainty-basedVisual Prompt Adapted (U-VPA) teacher-student model to transfer the generalization capability of the large model on the cloud to the device model. Specifically, we first de-*Equal contributionâ€ Corresponding author sign the Uncertainty Guided Sampling (UGS) to screen out challenging data continuously and transmit the most out-of-distribution samples from the device to the cloud. Then we propose a Visual Prompt Learning Strategy with Uncer-tainty guided updating (VPLU) to specifically deal with the selected samples with more distribution shifts. We trans-mit the visual prompts to the device and concatenate them with the incoming data to pull the device testing distribu-tion closer to the cloud training distribution. We conduct extensive experiments on two object detection datasets with continually changing environments. Our proposed U-VPA teacher-student framework outperforms previous state-of-the-art test time adaptation and device-cloud collaboration methods. The code and datasets will be released.
