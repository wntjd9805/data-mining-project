Current 3D scene stylization methods transfer textures and colors as styles using arbitrary style references, lack-ing meaningful semantic correspondences. We introduceReference-Based Non-Photorealistic Radiance Fields (Ref-NPR) to address this limitation. This controllable method stylizes a 3D scene using radiance fields with a single styl-ized 2D view as a reference. We propose a ray registra-tion process based on the stylized reference view to ob-tain pseudo-ray supervision in novel views. Then we ex-ploit semantic correspondences in content images to fill oc-cluded regions with perceptually similar styles, resulting in non-photorealistic and continuous novel view sequences.Our experimental results demonstrate that Ref-NPR out-performs existing scene and video stylization methods re-garding visual quality and semantic correspondence. The code and data are publicly available on the project page at https://ref-npr.github.io.
