Artificial light sources are often powered by an elec-tric grid, and then their intensities rapidly oscillate in re-sponse to the gridâ€™s alternating current (AC). Interestingly, the flickers of scene radiance values due to AC illumina-tion are useful for extracting rich information on a scene of interest. In this paper, we show that the flickers due toAC illumination is useful for intrinsic image decomposition (IID). Our proposed method conducts the light source sepa-ration (LSS) followed by the IID under AC illumination. In particular, we reveal the ambiguity in the blind LSS via ma-trix factorization and the ambiguity in the IID assuming the diffuse reflection model, and then show why and how those ambiguities can be resolved via a physics-based approach.We experimentally confirmed that our method can recover the colors of the light sources, the diffuse reflectance values, and the diffuse and specular intensities (shadings) under each of the light sources, and that the IID under AC illumi-nation is effective for application to auto white balancing.
