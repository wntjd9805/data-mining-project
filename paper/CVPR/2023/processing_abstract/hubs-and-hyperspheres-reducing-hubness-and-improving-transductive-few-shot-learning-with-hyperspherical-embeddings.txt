Distance-based classification is frequently used in trans-ductive few-shot learning (FSL). However, due to the high-dimensionality of image representations, FSL classifiers are prone to suffer from the hubness problem, where a few points (hubs) occur frequently in multiple nearest neighbour lists of other points. Hubness negatively impacts distance-based classification when hubs from one class appear often among the nearest neighbors of points from another class, degrading the classifier’s performance. To address the hubness prob-lem in FSL, we first prove that hubness can be eliminated by distributing representations uniformly on the hypersphere.We then propose two new approaches to embed representa-tions on the hypersphere, which we prove optimize a tradeoff between uniformity and local similarity preservation – reduc-ing hubness while retaining class structure. Our experiments show that the proposed methods reduce hubness, and signifi-cantly improves transductive FSL accuracy for a wide range of classifiers1.
