Albeit achieving high predictive accuracy across many challenging computer vision problems, recent studies sug-gest that deep neural networks (DNNs) tend to make over-confident predictions, rendering them poorly calibrated.Most of the existing attempts for improving DNN calibra-tion are limited to classification tasks and restricted to cal-Surprisingly, very little ibrating in-domain predictions. to no attempts have been made in studying the calibra-tion of object detection methods, which occupy a pivotal space in vision-based security-sensitive, and safety-criticalIn this paper, we propose a new train-time applications. technique for calibrating modern object detection meth-ods.It is capable of jointly calibrating multiclass confi-dence and box localization by leveraging their predictive uncertainties. We perform extensive experiments on several in-domain and out-of-domain detection benchmarks. Re-sults demonstrate that our proposed train-time calibration method consistently outperforms several baselines in reduc-ing calibration error for both in-domain and out-of-domain predictions.
