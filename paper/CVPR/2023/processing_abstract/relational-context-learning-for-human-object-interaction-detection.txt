Recent state-of-the-art methods for HOI detection typ-ically build on transformer architectures with two decoder branches, one for human-object pair detection and the other for interaction classification. Such disentangled transform-ers, however, may suffer from insufficient context exchange between the branches and lead to a lack of context informa-tion for relational reasoning, which is critical in discover-ing HOI instances. In this work, we propose the multiplex relation network (MUREN) that performs rich context ex-change between three decoder branches using unary, pair-wise, and ternary relations of human, object, and interac-tion tokens. The proposed method learns comprehensive re-lational contexts for discovering HOI instances, achieving state-of-the-art performance on two standard benchmarks for HOI detection, HICO-DET and V-COCO.
