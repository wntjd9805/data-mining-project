Action quality assessment (AQA) has become an emerg-ing topic since it can be extensively applied in numerous scenarios. However, most existing methods and datasets fo-cus on single-person short-sequence scenes, hindering the application of AQA in more complex situations. To address this issue, we construct a new multi-person long-form video dataset for action quality assessment named LOGO. Dis-tinguished in scenario complexity, our dataset contains 200 videos from 26 artistic swimming events with 8 athletes in each sample along with an average duration of 204.2 sec-onds. As for richness in annotations, LOGO includes for-mation labels to depict group information of multiple ath-letes and detailed annotations on action procedures. Fur-thermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to model relations among athletes and reason about the potential* indicates the corresponding author. temporal logic in long-form videos. Specifically, we de-sign a group-aware attention module, which can be eas-ily plugged into existing AQA methods, to enrich the clip-wise representations based on contextual group informa-tion. To benchmark LOGO, we systematically conduct in-vestigations on the performance of several popular meth-ods in AQA and action segmentation. The results reveal the challenges our dataset brings. Extensive experiments also show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art on the LOGO dataset. The dataset and code will be released at https://github.com/shiyi-zh0408/LOGO.
