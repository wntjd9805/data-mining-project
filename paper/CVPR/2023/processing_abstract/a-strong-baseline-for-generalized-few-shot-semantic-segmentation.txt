This paper introduces a generalized few-shot segmenta-tion framework with a straightforward training process and an easy-to-optimize inference phase. In particular, we pro-pose a simple yet effective model based on the well-knownInfoMax principle, where the Mutual Information (MI) be-tween the learned feature representations and their corre-sponding predictions is maximized. In addition, the terms derived from our MI-based formulation are coupled with a knowledge distillation term to retain the knowledge on base classes. With a simple training process, our inference model can be applied on top of any segmentation network trained on base classes. The proposed inference yields sub-stantial improvements on the popular few-shot segmenta-tion benchmarks, PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i. Particularly, for novel classes, the improvement gains range from 7% to 26% (PASCAL-5i) and from 3% to 12% (COCO-20i) in the 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, we propose a more challenging setting, where performance gaps are further exacerbated. Our code is publicly avail-able at https://github.com/sinahmr/DIaM .
