We present ARTrack, an autoregressive framework for visual object tracking. ARTrack tackles tracking as a co-ordinate sequence interpretation task that estimates object trajectories progressively, where the current estimate is in-duced by previous states and in turn affects subsequences.This time-autoregressive approach models the sequential evolution of trajectories to keep tracing the object across frames, making it superior to existing template matching based trackers that only consider the per-frame localiza-tion accuracy. ARTrack is simple and direct, eliminating customized localization heads and post-processings. Despite its simplicity, ARTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on prevailing benchmark datasets.
