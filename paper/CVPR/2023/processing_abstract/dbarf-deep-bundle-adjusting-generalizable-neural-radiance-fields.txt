Recent works such as BARF and GARF can bundle ad-just camera poses with neural radiance fields (NeRF) which is based on coordinate-MLPs. Despite the impressive re-sults, these methods cannot be applied to GeneralizableNeRFs (GeNeRFs) which require image feature extractions that are often based on more complicated 3D CNN or trans-former architectures. In this work, we first analyze the dif-ficulties of jointly optimizing camera poses with GeNeRFs, and then further propose our DBARF to tackle these issues.Our DBARF which bundle adjusts camera poses by tak-ing a cost feature map as an implicit cost function can be jointly trained with GeNeRFs in a self-supervised manner.Unlike BARF and its follow-up works, which can only be applied to per-scene optimized NeRFs and need accurate initial camera poses with the exception of forward-facing scenes, our method can generalize across scenes and does not require any good initialization. Experiments show the effectiveness and generalization ability of our DBARF when evaluated on real-world datasets. Our code is available at https:// aibluefisher.github.io/ dbarf .
