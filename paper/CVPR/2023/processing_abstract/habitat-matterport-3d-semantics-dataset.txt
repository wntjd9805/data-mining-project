We present the Habitat-Matterport 3D Semantics (HM3DSEM) dataset. HM3DSEM is the largest dataset of 3D real-world spaces with densely annotated seman-tics that is currently available to the academic commu-nity.It consists of 142,646 object instance annotations across 216 3D spaces and 3,100 rooms within those spaces.The scale, quality, and diversity of object annotations far exceed those of prior datasets. A key difference setting apart HM3DSEM from other datasets is the use of tex-ture information to annotate pixel-accurate object bound-aries. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HM3DSEM dataset for the Object Goal Navigation task using differ-ent methods. Policies trained using HM3DSEM perform outperform those trained on prior datasets.
