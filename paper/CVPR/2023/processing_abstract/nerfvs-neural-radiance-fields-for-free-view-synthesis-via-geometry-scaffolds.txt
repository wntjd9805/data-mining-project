We present NeRFVS, a novel neural radiance fields (NeRF) based method to enable free navigation in a room.NeRF achieves impressive performance in rendering im-ages for novel views similar to the input views while suffer-ing for novel views that are significantly different from the training views. To address this issue, we utilize the holis-tic priors, including pseudo depth maps and view coverage information, from neural reconstruction to guide the learn-ing of implicit neural representations of 3D indoor scenes.Concretely, an off-the-shelf neural reconstruction method is leveraged to generate a geometry scaffold. Then, two loss functions based on the holistic priors are proposed to im-prove the learning of NeRF: 1) A robust depth loss that can tolerate the error of the pseudo depth map to guide the ge-* Work done during an internship at Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab.†Corresponding Author. ometry learning of NeRF; 2) A variance loss to regularize the variance of implicit neural representations to reduce the geometry and color ambiguity in the learning procedure.These two loss functions are modulated during NeRF op-timization according to the view coverage information to reduce the negative influence brought by the view coverage imbalance. Extensive results demonstrate that our NeRFVS outperforms state-of-the-art view synthesis methods quanti-tatively and qualitatively on indoor scenes, achieving high-fidelity free navigation results.
