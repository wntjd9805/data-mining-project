Most camera lens systems are designed in isolation, sepa-rately from downstream computer vision methods. Recently, joint optimization approaches that design lenses alongside other components of the image acquisition and process-ing pipeline—notably, downstream neural networks—have achieved improved imaging quality or better performance on vision tasks. However, these existing methods optimize only a subset of lens parameters and cannot optimize glass materials given their categorical nature. In this work, we develop a differentiable spherical lens simulation model that accurately captures geometrical aberrations. We propose an optimization strategy to address the challenges of lens design—notorious for non-convex loss function landscapes and many manufacturing constraints—that are exacerbated in joint optimization tasks. Specifically, we introduce quan-tized continuous glass variables to facilitate the optimization and selection of glass materials in an end-to-end design con-text, and couple this with carefully designed constraints to support manufacturability. In automotive object detection, we report improved detection performance over existing de-signs even when simplifying designs to two- or three-element lenses, despite significantly degrading the image quality.
