Local feature matching aims at establishing sparse cor-respondences between a pair of images. Recently, detector-free methods present generally better performance but are not satisfactory in image pairs with large scale differences.In this paper, we propose Patch Area Transportation withSubdivision (PATS) to tackle this issue.Instead of build-ing an expensive image pyramid, we start by splitting the original image pair into equal-sized patches and gradu-ally resizing and subdividing them into smaller patches with the same scale. However, estimating scale differences be-tween these patches is non-trivial since the scale differ-ences are determined by both relative camera poses and scene structures, and thus spatially varying over image pairs. Moreover, it is hard to obtain the ground truth for real scenes. To this end, we propose patch area transporta-tion, which enables learning scale differences in a self-supervised manner. In contrast to bipartite graph match-ing, which only handles one-to-one matching, our patch area transportation can deal with many-to-many relation-ships. PATS improves both matching accuracy and cover-age, and shows superior performance in downstream tasks, such as relative pose estimation, visual localization, and optical flow estimation.
