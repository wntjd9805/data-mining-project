Channel pruning can effectively reduce both compu-tational cost and memory footprint of the original net-work while keeping a comparable accuracy performance.Though great success has been achieved in channel pruning for 2D image-based convolutional networks (CNNs), exist-ing works seldom extend the channel pruning methods to 3D point-based neural networks (PNNs). Directly imple-menting the 2D CNN channel pruning methods to PNNs undermine the performance of PNNs because of the dif-ferent representations of 2D images and 3D point clouds as well as the network architecture disparity.In this pa-per, we proposed CP3, which is a Channel Pruning Plug-in for Point-based network. CP3 is elaborately designed to leverage the characteristics of point clouds and PNNs in order to enable 2D channel pruning methods for PNNs.Specifically, it presents a coordinate-enhanced channel im-portance metric to reflect the correlation between dimen-sional information and individual channel features, and it recycles the discarded points in PNN’s sampling process and reconsiders their potentially-exclusive information to enhance the robustness of channel pruning. Experiments on various PNN architectures show that CP3 constantly improves state-of-the-art 2D CNN pruning approaches on different point cloud tasks. For instance, our compressedPointNeXt-S on ScanObjectNN achieves an accuracy of 88.52% with a pruning rate of 57.8%, outperforming the baseline pruning methods with an accuracy gain of 1.94%.* Equal contributions.
