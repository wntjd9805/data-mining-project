We propose a novel method for high-quality facial tex-ture reconstruction from RGB images using a novel captur-ing routine based on a single smartphone which we equip with an inexpensive polarization foil. Specifically, we turn the flashlight into a polarized light source and add a polar-ization filter on top of the camera. Leveraging this setup, we capture the face of a subject with cross-polarized and parallel-polarized light. For each subject, we record two short sequences in a dark environment under flash illu-mination with different light polarization using the modi-fied smartphone. Based on these observations, we recon-struct an explicit surface mesh of the face using structure from motion. We then exploit the camera and light co-location within a differentiable renderer to optimize the fa-cial textures using an analysis-by-synthesis approach. OurAll data has been captured at the Technical University of Munich. method optimizes for high-resolution normal textures, dif-fuse albedo, and specular albedo using a coarse-to-fine op-timization scheme. We show that the optimized textures can be used in a standard rendering pipeline to synthesize high-quality photo-realistic 3D digital humans in novel environ-ments.
