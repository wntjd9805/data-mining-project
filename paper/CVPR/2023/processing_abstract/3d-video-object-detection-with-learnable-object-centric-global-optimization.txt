We explore long-term temporal visual correspondence-based optimization for 3D video object detection in this work. Visual correspondence refers to one-to-one map-pings for pixels across multiple images. Correspondence-based optimization is the cornerstone for 3D scene recon-struction but is less studied in 3D video object detection, because moving objects violate multi-view geometry con-straints and are treated as outliers during scene recon-struction. We address this issue by treating objects as first-class citizens during correspondence-based optimiza-tion. In this work, we propose BA-Det, an end-to-end op-timizable object detector with object-centric temporal cor-respondence learning and featuremetric object bundle ad-justment. Empirically, we verify the effectiveness and ef-ficiency of BA-Det for multiple baseline 3D detectors un-der various setups. Our BA-Det achieves SOTA perfor-mance on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) with only marginal computation cost. Our code is available at https://github.com/jiaweihe1996/BA-Det.
