Input 3D Point CloudReconstructed FloorplanWe address 2D floorplan reconstruction from 3D scans.Existing approaches typically employ heuristically de-signed multi-stage pipelines. Instead, we formulate floor-plan reconstruction as a single-stage structured predic-tion task: find a variable-size set of polygons, which in turn are variable-length sequences of ordered vertices.To solve it we develop a novel Transformer architec-ture that generates polygons of multiple rooms in paral-lel, in a holistic manner without hand-crafted intermedi-ate stages. The model features two-level queries for poly-gons and corners, and includes polygon matching to make the network end-to-end trainable. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art for two challenging datasets, Struc-tured3D and SceneCAD, along with significantly faster in-ference than previous methods. Moreover, it can read-ily be extended to predict additional information, i.e., se-mantic room types and architectural elements like doors and windows.
