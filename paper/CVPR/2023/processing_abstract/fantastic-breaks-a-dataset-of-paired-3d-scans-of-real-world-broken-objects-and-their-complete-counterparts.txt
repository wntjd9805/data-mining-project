Automated shape repair approaches currently lack ac-cess to datasets that describe real-world damaged geome-try. We present Fantastic Breaks (and Where to Find Them: https://terascale-all-sensing-research-studio.github.io/FantasticBreaks), a dataset containing scanned, waterproofed, and cleaned 3D meshes for 150 broken objects, paired and geometrically aligned with complete counterparts. Fantastic Breaks contains class and material labels, proxy repair parts that join to broken meshes to generate complete meshes, and manually anno-tated fracture boundaries. Through a detailed analysis of fracture geometry, we reveal differences between FantasticBreaks and synthetic fracture datasets generated using ge-ometric and physics-based methods. We show experimental shape repair evaluation with Fantastic Breaks using mul-tiple learning-based approaches pre-trained with synthetic datasets and re-trained with subset of Fantastic Breaks.
