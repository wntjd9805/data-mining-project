Skeleton-based human action recognition is becoming increasingly important in a variety of fields. Most exist-ing works train a CNN or GCN based backbone to extract spatial-temporal features, and use temporal average/max pooling to aggregate the information. However, these pool-ing methods fail to capture high-order dynamics informa-tion. To address the problem, we propose a plug-and-play module called Koopman pooling, which is a param-eterized high-order pooling technique based on Koopman theory. The Koopman operator linearizes a non-linear dy-namics system, thus providing a way to represent the com-plex system through the dynamics matrix, which can be used for classification. We also propose an eigenvalue nor-malization method to encourage the learned dynamics to be non-decaying and stable. Besides, we also show that our Koopman pooling framework can be easily extended to one-shot action recognition when combined with DynamicMode Decomposition. The proposed method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets, namely NTU RGB+D 60, 120 and NW-UCLA. Our experiments clearly demonstrate thatKoopman pooling significantly improves the performance under both full-dataset and one-shot settings.
