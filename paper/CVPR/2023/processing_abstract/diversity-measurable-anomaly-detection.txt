Reconstruction-based anomaly detection models achieve their purpose by suppressing the generalization ability for anomaly. However, diverse normal patterns are conse-quently not well reconstructed as well. Although some ef-forts have been made to alleviate this problem by modeling sample diversity, they suffer from shortcut learning due toIn this undesired transmission of abnormal information. paper, to better handle the tradeoff problem, we proposeDiversity-Measurable Anomaly Detection (DMAD) frame-work to enhance reconstruction diversity while avoid the undesired generalization on anomalies. To this end, we design Pyramid Deformation Module (PDM), which mod-els diverse normals and measures the severity of anomaly by estimating multi-scale deformation fields from recon-structed reference to original input. Integrated with an in-formation compression module, PDM essentially decouples deformation from prototypical embedding and makes the fi-nal anomaly score more reliable. Experimental results on both surveillance videos and industrial images demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In addition, DMAD works equally well in front of contaminated data and anomaly-like normal samples.
