This paper presents a method to reconstruct a complete human geometry and texture from an image of a person with only partial body observed, e.g., a torso. The core challenge arises from the occlusion: there exists no pixel to reconstruct where many existing single-view human reconstruction meth-ods are not designed to handle such invisible parts, leading to missing data in 3D. To address this challenge, we intro-duce a novel coarse-to-fine human reconstruction framework.For coarse reconstruction, explicit volumetric features are learned to generate a complete human geometry with 3D con-volutional neural networks conditioned by a 3D body model and the style features from visible parts. An implicit network combines the learned 3D features with the high-quality sur-face normals enhanced from multiviews to produce fine local details, e.g., high-frequency wrinkles. Finally, we perform progressive texture inpainting to reconstruct a complete ap-pearance of the person in a view-consistent way, which is not possible without the reconstruction of a complete geometry.In experiments, we demonstrate that our method can recon-struct high-quality 3D humans, which is robust to occlusion.
