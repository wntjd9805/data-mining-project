We present a new imaging technique, swept-angle syn-thetic wavelength interferometry, for full-ﬁeld micron-scale 3D sensing. As in conventional synthetic wavelength interfer-ometry, our technique uses light consisting of two narrowly-separated optical wavelengths, resulting in per-pixel inter-ferometric measurements whose phase encodes scene depth.Our technique additionally uses a new type of light source that, by emulating spatially-incoherent illumination, makes interferometric measurements insensitive to aberrations and (sub)surface scattering, effects that corrupt phase measure-ments. The resulting technique combines the robustness to such corruptions of scanning interferometric setups, with the speed of full-ﬁeld interferometric setups. Overall, our technique can recover full-frame depth at a lateral and ax-ial resolution of 5 µm, at frame rates of 5 Hz, even under strong ambient light. We build an experimental prototype, and use it to demonstrate these capabilities by scanning a variety of objects, including objects representative of ap-plications in inspection and fabrication, and objects that contain challenging light scattering effects.
