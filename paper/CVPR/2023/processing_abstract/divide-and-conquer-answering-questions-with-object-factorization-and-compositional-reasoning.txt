Humans have the innate capability to answer diverse questions, which is rooted in the natural ability to corre-late different concepts based on their semantic relationships and decompose difficult problems into sub-tasks. On the contrary, existing visual reasoning methods assume train-ing samples that capture every possible object and reason-ing problem, and rely on black-boxed models that com-monly exploit statistical priors. They have yet to develop the capability to address novel objects or spurious biases in real-world scenarios, and also fall short of interpret-ing the rationales behind their decisions. Inspired by hu-mansâ€™ reasoning of the visual world, we tackle the afore-mentioned challenges from a compositional perspective, and propose an integral framework consisting of a princi-pled object factorization method and a novel neural mod-ule network. Our factorization method decomposes objects based on their key characteristics, and automatically de-rives prototypes that represent a wide range of objects. With these prototypes encoding important semantics, the pro-posed network then correlates objects by measuring their similarity on a common semantic space and makes deci-It is ca-sions with a compositional reasoning process. pable of answering questions with diverse objects regard-less of their availability during training, and overcoming the issues of biased question-answer distributions. In addi-tion to the enhanced generalizability, our framework also provides an interpretable interface for understanding the decision-making process of models.
