Recently, deep neural networks have shown great suc-cess on 3D point cloud classification tasks, which simulta-neously raises the concern of adversarial attacks that cause severe damage to real-world applications. Moreover, de-fending against adversarial examples in point cloud data is extremely difficult due to the emergence of various attack strategies. In this work, with the insight of the fact that the adversarial examples in this task still preserve the same se-mantic and structural information as the original input, we design a novel defense framework for improving the robust-ness of existing classification models, which consists of two main modules: the attention-based pooling and the dynamic contrastive learning. In addition, we also develop an algo-rithm to theoretically certify the robustness of the proposed framework. Extensive empirical results on two datasets and three classification models show the robustness of our ap-proach against various attacks, e.g., the averaged attack success rate of PointNet decreases from 70.2% to 2.7% on the ModelNet40 dataset under 9 common attacks.
