Optical flow estimation is a challenging problem remain-ing unsolved. Recent deep learning based optical flow mod-els have achieved considerable success. However, these models often train networks from the scratch on standard optical flow data, which restricts their ability to robustly and geometrically match image features.In this paper, we propose a rethinking to previous optical flow estima-tion. We particularly leverage Geometric Image Matching (GIM) as a pre-training task for the optical flow estimation (MatchFlow) with better feature representations, as GIM shares some common challenges as optical flow estimation, and with massive labeled real-world data. Thus, match-ing static scenes helps to learn more fundamental feature correlations of objects and scenes with consistent displace-ments. Specifically, the proposed MatchFlow model em-ploys a QuadTree attention-based network pre-trained onMegaDepth to extract coarse features for further flow re-gression. Extensive experiments show that our model has great cross-dataset generalization. Our method achieves 11.5% and 10.1% error reduction from GMA on Sintel clean pass and KITTI test set. At the time of anony-mous submission, our MatchFlow(G) enjoys state-of-the-art performance on Sintel clean and final pass compared to published approaches with comparable computation and memory footprint. Codes and models will be released in https://github.com/DQiaole/MatchFlow.
