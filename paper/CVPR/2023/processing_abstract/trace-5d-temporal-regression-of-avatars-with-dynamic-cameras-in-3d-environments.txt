Although the estimation of 3D human pose and shape (HPS) is rapidly progressing, current methods still can-not reliably estimate moving humans in global coordinates, which is critical for many applications. This is particularly challenging when the camera is also moving, entangling human and camera motion. To address these issues, we adopt a novel 5D representation (space, time, and identity) that enables end-to-end reasoning about people in scenes.Our method, called TRACE, introduces several novel ar-chitectural components. Most importantly, it uses two new“maps” to reason about the 3D trajectory of people over time in camera, and world, coordinates. An additional memory unit enables persistent tracking of people even dur-ing long occlusions. TRACE is the first one-stage method to jointly recover and track 3D humans in global coordinates from dynamic cameras. By training it end-to-end, and us-ing full image information, TRACE achieves state-of-the-art performance on tracking and HPS benchmarks. The code1 and dataset2 are released for research purposes.*This work was done when Yu Sun was an intern at JD.com.†Corresponding author. 1https://www.yusun.work/TRACE/TRACE.html 2https://github.com/Arthur151/DynaCam
