A central challenge in human pose estimation, as well as in many other machine learning and prediction tasks, is the generalization problem. The learned network does not have the capability to characterize the prediction error, gen-erate feedback information from the test sample, and cor-rect the prediction error on the fly for each individual test sample, which results in degraded performance in general-ization. In this work, we introduce a self-correctable and adaptable inference (SCAI) method to address the general-ization challenge of network prediction and use human pose estimation as an example to demonstrate its effectiveness and performance. We learn a correction network to correct the prediction result conditioned by a fitness feedback er-ror. This feedback error is generated by a learned fitness feedback network which maps the prediction result to the original input domain and compares it against the original input. Interestingly, we find that this self-referential feed-back error is highly correlated with the actual prediction error. This strong correlation suggests that we can use this error as feedback to guide the correction process. It can be also used as a loss function to quickly adapt and opti-mize the correction network during the inference process.Our extensive experimental results on human pose estima-tion demonstrate that the proposed SCAI method is able to significantly improve the generalization capability and per-formance of human pose estimation.
