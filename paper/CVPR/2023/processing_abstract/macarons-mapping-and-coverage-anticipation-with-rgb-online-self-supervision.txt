We introduce a method that simultaneously learns to ex-plore new large environments and to reconstruct them in 3D from color images only. This is closely related to the NextBest View problem (NBV), where one has to identify where to move the camera next to improve the coverage of an un-known scene. However, most of the current NBV methods rely on depth sensors, need 3D supervision and/or do not scale to large scenes. Our method requires only a color camera and no 3D supervision. It simultaneously learns in a self-supervised fashion to predict a “volume occupancy field” from color images and, from this field, to predict theNBV. Thanks to this approach, our method performs well on new scenes as it is not biased towards any training 3D data. We demonstrate this on a recent dataset made of vari-ous 3D scenes and show it performs even better than recent methods requiring a depth sensor, which is not a realistic assumption for outdoor scenes captured with a flying drone.
