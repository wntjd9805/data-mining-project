Context-Aware Emotion Recognition (CAER) is a cru-cial and challenging task that aims to perceive the emo-tional states of the target person with contextual informa-tion. Recent approaches invariably focus on designing so-phisticated architectures or mechanisms to extract seem-ingly meaningful representations from subjects and con-texts. However, a long-overlooked issue is that a con-text bias in existing datasets leads to a significantly unbal-anced distribution of emotional states among different con-text scenarios. Concretely, the harmful bias is a confounder that misleads existing models to learn spurious correlations based on conventional likelihood estimation, significantly limiting the modelsâ€™ performance. To tackle the issue, this paper provides a causality-based perspective to disentan-gle the models from the impact of such bias, and formu-late the causalities among variables in the CAER task via a tailored causal graph. Then, we propose a ContextualCausal Intervention Module (CCIM) based on the backdoor adjustment to de-confound the confounder and exploit the true causal effect for model training. CCIM is plug-in and model-agnostic, which improves diverse state-of-the-art ap-proaches by considerable margins. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our CCIM and the significance of causal insight.
