Predicting the future trajectories of the traffic agents is a gordian technique in autonomous driving. However, tra-jectory prediction suffers from data imbalance in the preva-lent datasets, and the tailed data is often more complicated and safety-critical. In this paper, we focus on dealing with the long-tail phenomenon in trajectory prediction. Previ-ous methods dealing with long-tail data did not take into account the variety of motion patterns in the tailed data.In this paper, we put forward a future enhanced contrastive learning framework to recognize tail trajectory patterns and form a feature space with separate pattern clusters. Fur-thermore, a distribution aware hyper predictor is brought up to better utilize the shaped feature space. Our method is a model-agnostic framework and can be plugged into many well-known baselines. Experimental results show that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art long-tail pre-diction method on tailed samples by 9.5% on ADE and 8.5% on FDE, while maintaining or slightly improving the aver-aged performance. Our method also surpasses many long-tail techniques on trajectory prediction task.
