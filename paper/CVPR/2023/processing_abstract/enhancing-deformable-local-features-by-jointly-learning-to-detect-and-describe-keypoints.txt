Local feature extraction is a standard approach in com-puter vision for tackling important tasks such as image matching and retrieval. The core assumption of most meth-ods is that images undergo affine transformations, disregard-ing more complicated effects such as non-rigid deformations.Furthermore, incipient works tailored for non-rigid corre-spondence still rely on keypoint detectors designed for rigid transformations, hindering performance due to the limita-tions of the detector. We propose DALF (Deformation-AwareLocal Features), a novel deformation-aware network for jointly detecting and describing keypoints, to handle the challenging problem of matching deformable surfaces. All network components work cooperatively through a feature fusion approach that enforces the descriptorsâ€™ distinctiveness and invariance. Experiments using real deforming objects showcase the superiority of our method, where it delivers 8% improvement in matching scores compared to the previous best results. Our approach also enhances the performance of two real-world applications: deformable object retrieval and non-rigid 3D surface registration. Code for training, in-ference, and applications are publicly available at verlab. dcc.ufmg.br/descriptors/dalf_cvpr23.
