High-quality 3D ground-truth shapes are critical for 3D object reconstruction evaluation. However, it is difﬁcult to create a replica of an object in reality, and even 3D re-constructions generated by 3D scanners have artefacts that cause biases in evaluation. To address this issue, we in-troduce a novel multi-view RGBD dataset captured using a mobile device, which includes highly precise 3D ground-truth annotations for 153 object models featuring a diverse set of 3D structures. We obtain precise 3D ground-truth shape without relying on high-end 3D scanners by utilisingLEGO models with known geometry as the 3D structures for image capture. The distinct data modality offered by high-resolution RGB images and low-resolution depth maps cap-tured on a mobile device, when combined with precise 3D geometry annotations, presents a unique opportunity for fu-ture research on high-ﬁdelity 3D reconstruction. Further-more, we evaluate a range of 3D reconstruction algorithms on the proposed dataset.
