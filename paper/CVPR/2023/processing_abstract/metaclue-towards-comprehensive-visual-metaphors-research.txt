Creativity is an indispensable part of human cognition and also an inherent part of how we make sense of the world. Metaphorical abstraction is fundamental in commu-nicating creative ideas through nuanced relationships be-tween abstract concepts such as feelings. While computer vision benchmarks and approaches predominantly focus on understanding and generating literal interpretations of im-ages, metaphorical comprehension of images remains rel-atively unexplored. Towards this goal, we introduce Meta-CLUE, a set of vision tasks on visual metaphor. We also collect high-quality and rich metaphor annotations (ab-*Equal Contribution stract objects, concepts, relationships along with their cor-responding object boxes) as there do not exist any datasets that facilitate the evaluation of these tasks. We perform a comprehensive analysis of state-of-the-art models in vi-sion and language based on our annotations, highlight-ing strengths and weaknesses of current approaches in vi-sual metaphor classiÔ¨Åcation, localization, understanding (retrieval, question answering, captioning) and generation (text-to-image synthesis) tasks. We hope this work pro-vides a concrete step towards developing AI systems with human-like creative capabilities. Project page: https://metaclue.github.io
