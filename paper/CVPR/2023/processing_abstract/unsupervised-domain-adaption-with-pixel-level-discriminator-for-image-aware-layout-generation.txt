Layout is essential for graphic design and poster gen-eration. Recently, applying deep learning models to gen-erate layouts has attracted increasing attention. This pa-per focuses on using the GAN-based model conditioned on image contents to generate advertising poster graphic lay-outs, which requires an advertising poster layout dataset with paired product images and graphic layouts. How-ever, the paired images and layouts in the existing dataset are collected by inpainting and annotating posters, respec-tively. There exists a domain gap between inpainted posters (source domain data) and clean product images (target do-main data). Therefore, this paper combines unsupervised domain adaption techniques to design a GAN with a novel pixel-level discriminator (PD), called PDA-GAN, to gen-erate graphic layouts according to image contents. ThePD is connected to the shallow level feature map and com-putes the GAN loss for each input-image pixel. Both quan-titative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that PDA-GAN can achieve state-of-the-art performances and gener-ate high-quality image-aware graphic layouts for advertis-ing posters.
