Despite the great success in 2D editing using user-friendly tools, such as Photoshop, semantic strokes, or even text prompts, similar capabilities in 3D areas are still lim-ited, either relying on 3D modeling skills or allowing edit-ing within only a few categories. In this paper, we present a novel semantic-driven NeRF editing approach, which en-ables users to edit a neural radiance field with a single im-age, and faithfully delivers edited novel views with high fi-delity and multi-view consistency. To achieve this goal, we propose a prior-guided editing field to encode fine-grained geometric and texture editing in 3D space, and develop a series of techniques to aid the editing process, including cyclic constraints with a proxy mesh to facilitate geomet-ric supervision, a color compositing mechanism to stabi-lize semantic-driven texture editing, and a feature-cluster-based regularization to preserve the irrelevant content un-changed. Extensive experiments and editing examples on both real-world and synthetic data demonstrate that our method achieves photo-realistic 3D editing using only a single edited image, pushing the bound of semantic-driven editing in 3D real-world scenes.
