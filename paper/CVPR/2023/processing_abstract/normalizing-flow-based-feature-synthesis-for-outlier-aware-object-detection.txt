Real-world deployment of reliable object detectors is crucial for applications such as autonomous driving. How-ever, general-purpose object detectors like Faster R-CNN are prone to providing overconfident predictions for outlier objects. Recent outlier-aware object detection approaches estimate the density of instance-wide features with class-conditional Gaussians and train on synthesized outlier fea-tures from their low-likelihood regions. However, this strat-egy does not guarantee that the synthesized outlier features will have a low likelihood according to the other class-conditional Gaussians. We propose a novel outlier-aware object detection framework that distinguishes outliers from inlier objects by learning the joint data distribution of all inlier classes with an invertible normalizing flow. The ap-propriate sampling of the flow model ensures that the syn-thesized outliers have a lower likelihood than inliers of all object classes, thereby modeling a better decision bound-ary between inlier and outlier objects. Our approach sig-nificantly outperforms the state-of-the-art for outlier-aware object detection on both image and video datasets.
