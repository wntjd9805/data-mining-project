Timestamp supervised temporal action segmentation (TSTAS) is more cost-effective than fully supervised coun-terparts. However, previous approaches suffer from severe label bias due to over-reliance on sparse timestamp an-notations, resulting in unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose the Debiasing-TSTAS (D-TSTAS) frame-work by exploiting unannotated frames to alleviate this bias from two phases: 1) Initialization. To reduce the depen-dencies on annotated frames, we propose masked times-tamp predictions (MTP) to ensure that initialized model captures more contextual information. 2) Refinement. To overcome the limitation of the expressiveness from sparsely annotated timestamps, we propose a center-oriented times-tamp expansion (CTE) approach to progressively expand pseudo-timestamp groups which contain semantic-rich mo-tion representation of action segments. Then, these pseudo-timestamp groups and the model output are used to iter-atively generate pseudo-labels for refining the model in a fully supervised setup. We further introduce segmental con-fidence loss to enable the model to have high confidence predictions within the pseudo-timestamp groups and more accurate action boundaries. Our D-TSTAS outperforms the state-of-the-art TSTAS method as well as achieves compet-itive results compared with fully supervised approaches on three benchmark datasets.
