This paper presents a method that effectively com-bines two prevalent visual recognition methods, i.e., image classification and contrastive language-image pre-training, dubbed iCLIP. Instead of na¨ıve multi-task learning that use two separate heads for each task, we fuse the two tasks in a deep fashion that adapts the image classification to share the same formula and the same model weights with the language-image pre-training. To further bridge these two tasks, we propose to enhance the category names in image classification tasks using external knowledge, such as their descriptions in dictionaries. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method combines the advantages of two tasks well: the strong discrimination ability in im-age classification tasks due to the clean category labels, and the good zero-shot ability in CLIP tasks ascribed to the richer semantics in the text descriptions.In particu-lar, it reaches 82.9% top-1 accuracy on IN-1K, and mean-while surpasses CLIP by 1.8%, with similar model size, on zero-shot recognition of Kornblith 12-dataset benchmark.The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/weiyx16/iCLIP.
