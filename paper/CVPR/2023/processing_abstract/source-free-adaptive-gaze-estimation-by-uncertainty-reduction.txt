source domain target domain averaged mean error((cid:28733)) (b)ETH-XGaze MPIIEyeDiapGaze estimation across domains has been explored re-cently because the training data are usually collected under controlled conditions while the trained gaze estimators are used in nature and diverse environments. However, due to privacy and efÔ¨Åciency concerns, simultaneous access to an-notated source data and to-be-predicted target data can be challenging.In light of this, we present an unsupervised source-free domain adaptation approach for gaze estima-tion, which adapts a source-trained gaze estimator to unla-beled target domains without source data. We propose theUncertainty Reduction Gaze Adaptation (UnReGA) frame-work, which achieves adaptation by reducing both sample and model uncertainty. Sample uncertainty is mitigated by enhancing image quality and making them gaze-estimation-friendly, whereas model uncertainty is reduced by minimiz-ing prediction variance on the same inputs. Extensive ex-periments are conducted on six cross-domain tasks, demon-strating the effectiveness of UnReGA and its components.Results show that UnReGA outperforms other state-of-the-art cross-domain gaze estimation methods under both pro-tocols, with and without source data.
