Open world object detection (OWOD) has attracted ex-tensive attention due to its practicability in the real world.Previous OWOD works manually designed unknown-discover strategies to select unknown proposals from the background, suffering from uncertainties without appropri-In this paper, we claim the learning of ob-ate priors. ject detection could be seen as an object-level feature-entanglement process, where unknown traits are propa-gated to the known proposals through convolutional opera-tions and could be distilled to benefit unknown recognition without manual selection. Therefore, we propose a simple yet effective Annealing-based Label-Transfer framework, which sufficiently explores the known proposals to allevi-ate the uncertainties. Specifically, a Label-Transfer Learn-ing paradigm is introduced to decouple the known and un-known features, while a Sawtooth Annealing Scheduling strategy is further employed to rebuild the decision bound-aries of the known and unknown classes, thus promoting both known and unknown recognition. Moreover, previ-ous OWOD works neglected the trade-off of known and un-known performance, and we thus introduce a metric calledEquilibrium Index to comprehensively evaluate the effec-tiveness of the OWOD models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first OWOD work without manual unknown selec-tion. Extensive experiments conducted on the common-used benchmark validate that our model achieves superior detec-tion performance (200% unknown mAP improvement with the even higher known detection performance) compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
