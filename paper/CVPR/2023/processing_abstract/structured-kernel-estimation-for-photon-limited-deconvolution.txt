Images taken in a low light condition with the pres-ence of camera shake suffer from motion blur and photon shot noise. While state-of-the-art image restoration net-works show promising results, they are largely limited to well-illuminated scenes and their performance drops sig-nificantly when photon shot noise is strong.In this paper, we propose a new blur estimation tech-nique customized for photon-limited conditions. The pro-posed method employs a gradient-based backpropagation method to estimate the blur kernel. By modeling the blur kernel using a low-dimensional representation with the key points on the motion trajectory, we significantly re-duce the search space and improve the regularity of the kernel estimation problem. When plugged into an iter-ative framework, our novel low-dimensional representa-tion provides improved kernel estimates and hence signifi-cantly better deconvolution performance when compared to end-to-end trained neural networks.
