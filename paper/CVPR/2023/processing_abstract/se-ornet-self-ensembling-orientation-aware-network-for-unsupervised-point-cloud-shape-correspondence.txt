Unsupervised point cloud shape correspondence aims to obtain dense point-to-point correspondences between point clouds without manually annotated pairs. However, hu-mans and some animals have bilateral symmetry and var-ious orientations, which lead to severe mispredictions of symmetrical parts. Besides, point cloud noise disrupts con-sistent representations for point cloud and thus degrades the shape correspondence accuracy. To address the above issues, we propose a Self-Ensembling ORientation-awareNetwork termed SE-ORNet. The key of our approach is to exploit an orientation estimation module with a domain adaptive discriminator to align the orientations of point cloud pairs, which signiÔ¨Åcantly alleviates the mispredic-tions of symmetrical parts. Additionally, we design a self-ensembling framework for unsupervised point cloud shape correspondence.In this framework, the disturbances of point cloud noise are overcome by perturbing the inputs of the student and teacher networks with different data aug-mentations and constraining the consistency of predictions.Extensive experiments on both human and animal datasets show that our SE-ORNet can surpass state-of-the-art unsu-pervised point cloud shape correspondence methods.
