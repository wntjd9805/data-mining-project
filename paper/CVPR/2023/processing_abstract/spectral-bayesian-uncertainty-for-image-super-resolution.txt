Recently deep learning techniques have significantly ad-vanced image super-resolution (SR). Due to the black-box nature, quantifying reconstruction uncertainty is crucial when employing these deep SR networks. Previous ap-proaches for SR uncertainty estimation mostly focus on cap-turing pixel-wise uncertainty in the spatial domain. SR uncertainty in the frequency domain which is highly re-In this paper, we lated to image SR is seldom explored. propose to quantify spectral Bayesian uncertainty in im-age SR. To achieve this, a Dual-Domain Learning (DDL) framework is first proposed. Combined with Bayesian ap-proaches, the DDL model is able to estimate spectral un-certainty accurately, enabling a reliability assessment for high frequencies reasoning from the frequency domain per-spective. Extensive experiments under non-ideal premises are conducted and demonstrate the effectiveness of the pro-posed spectral uncertainty. Furthermore, we propose a novel Spectral Uncertainty based Decoupled Frequency (SUDF) training scheme for perceptual SR. Experimental results show the proposed SUDF can evidently boost per-ceptual quality of SR results without sacrificing much pixel accuracy.
