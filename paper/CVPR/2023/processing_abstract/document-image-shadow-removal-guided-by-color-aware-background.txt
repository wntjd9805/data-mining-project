Existing works on document image shadow removal mostly depend on learning and leveraging a constant back-ground (the color of the paper) from the image. However, the constant background is less representative and frequent-ly ignores other background colors, such as the printed col-ors, resulting in distorted results. In this paper, we present a color-aware background extraction network (CBENet) for extracting a spatially varying background image that ac-curately depicts the background colors of the documen-t. Furthermore, we propose a background-guided docu-ment images shadow removal network (BGShadowNet) us-ing the predicted spatially varying background as auxil-iary information, which consists of two stages. At StageI, a background-constrained decoder is designed to pro-mote a coarse result. Then, the coarse result is reÔ¨Åned with a background-based attention module (BAModule) to maintain a consistent appearance and a detail improvement module (DEModule) to enhance the texture details at StageII. Experiments on two benchmark datasets qualitatively and quantitatively validate the superiority of the proposed approach over state-of-the-arts.
