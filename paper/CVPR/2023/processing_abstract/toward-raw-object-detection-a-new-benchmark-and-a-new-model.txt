In many computer vision applications (e.g., robotics and autonomous driving), high dynamic range (HDR) data is necessary for object detection algorithms to handle a vari-ety of lighting conditions, such as strong glare. In this pa-per, we aim to achieve object detection on RAW sensor data, which naturally saves the HDR information from image sen-sors without extra equipment costs. We build a novel RAW sensor dataset, named ROD, for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)-based object detection algorithms to be applied toHDR data. The ROD dataset contains a large amount of an-notated instances of day and night driving scenes in 24-bit dynamic range. Based on the dataset, we ﬁrst investigate the impact of dynamic range for DNNs-based detectors and demonstrate the importance of dynamic range adjustment for detection on RAW sensor data. Then, we propose a sim-ple and effective adjustment method for object detection onHDR RAW sensor data, which is image adaptive and jointly optimized with the downstream detector in an end-to-end scheme. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the per-formance of detection on RAW sensor data is signiﬁcantly superior to standard dynamic range (SDR) data in different situations. Moreover, we analyze the inﬂuence of texture in-formation and pixel distribution of input data on the perfor-mance of the DNNs-based detector.
