Robust and non-destructive material classification is a challenging but crucial first-step in numerous vision appli-cations. We propose a physics-guided material classifica-tion framework that relies on thermal properties of the ob-ject. Our key observation is that the rate of heating and cooling of an object depends on the unique intrinsic proper-ties of the material, namely the emissivity and diffusivity. We leverage this observation by gently heating the objects in the scene with a low-power laser for a fixed duration and then turning it off, while a thermal camera captures measure-ments during the heating and cooling process. We then take this spatial and temporal “thermal spread function” (TSF) to solve an inverse heat equation using the finite-differences approach, resulting in a spatially varying estimate of dif-fusivity and emissivity. These tuples are then used to train a classifier that produces a fine-grained material label at each spatial pixel. Our approach is extremely simple re-quiring only a small light source (low power laser) and a thermal camera, and produces robust classification results with 86% accuracy over 16 classes1.
