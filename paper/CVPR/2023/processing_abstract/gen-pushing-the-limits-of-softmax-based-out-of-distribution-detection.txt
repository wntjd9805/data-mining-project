Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has been exten-sively studied in order to successfully deploy neural net-works, in particular, for safety-critical applications. More-over, performing OOD detection on large-scale datasets is closer to reality, but is also more challenging. Sev-eral approaches need to either access the training data for score design or expose models to outliers during train-ing. Some post-hoc methods are able to avoid the afore-mentioned constraints, but are less competitive.In this work, we propose Generalized ENtropy score (GEN), a simple but effective entropy-based score function, which can be applied to any pre-trained softmax-based classi-Its performance is demonstrated on the large-scale fier.ImageNet-1k OOD detection benchmark.It consistently improves the average AUROC across six commonly-usedCNN-based and visual transformer classifiers over a num-ber of state-of-the-art post-hoc methods. The average AU-ROC improvement is at least 3.5%. Furthermore, we usedGEN on top of feature-based enhancing methods as well as methods using training statistics to further improve theOOD detection performance.
