Fashion vision-language pre-training models have shown efﬁcacy for a wide range of downstream tasks.However, general vision-language pre-training models pay less attention to ﬁne-grained domain features, while these features are important in distinguishing the speciﬁc do-main tasks from general tasks. We propose a method forﬁne-grained fashion vision-language pre-training based on fashion Symbols and Attributes Prompt (FashionSAP) to model ﬁne-grained multi-modalities fashion attributes and characteristics. Firstly, we propose the fashion symbols, a novel abstract fashion concept layer, to represent differ-ent fashion items and to generalize various kinds of ﬁne-grained fashion features, making modelling ﬁne-grained attributes more effective. Secondly, the attributes prompt method is proposed to make the model learn speciﬁc at-tributes of fashion items explicitly. We design proper prompt templates according to the format of fashion data. Compre-hensive experiments are conducted on two public fashion benchmarks, i.e., FashionGen and FashionIQ, and Fash-ionSAP gets SOTA performances for four popular fashion tasks. The ablation study also shows the proposed abstract fashion symbols, and the attribute prompt method enables the model to acquire ﬁne-grained semantics in the fashion domain effectively. The obvious performance gains fromFashionSAP provide a new baseline for future fashion task research.1
