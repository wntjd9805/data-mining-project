Kalman filter (KF) based methods for multi-object track-ing (MOT) make an assumption that objects move linearly.While this assumption is acceptable for very short peri-ods of occlusion, linear estimates of motion for prolonged time can be highly inaccurate. Moreover, when there is no measurement available to update Kalman filter param-eters, the standard convention is to trust the priori state estimations for posteriori update. This leads to the accu-mulation of errors during a period of occlusion. The er-ror causes significant motion direction variance in prac-tice. In this work, we show that a basic Kalman filter can still obtain state-of-the-art tracking performance if proper care is taken to fix the noise accumulated during occlu-sion.Instead of relying only on the linear state estimate (i.e., estimation-centric approach), we use object observa-tions (i.e., the measurements by object detector) to compute a virtual trajectory over the occlusion period to fix the error accumulation of filter parameters. This allows more time steps to correct errors accumulated during occlusion. We name our method Observation-Centric SORT (OC-SORT).It remains Simple, Online, and Real-Time but improves ro-bustness during occlusion and non-linear motion. Given off-the-shelf detections as input, OC-SORT runs at 700+FPS on a single CPU. It achieves state-of-the-art on multi-ple datasets, including MOT17, MOT20, KITTI, head track-ing, and especially DanceTrack where the object motion is highly non-linear.
