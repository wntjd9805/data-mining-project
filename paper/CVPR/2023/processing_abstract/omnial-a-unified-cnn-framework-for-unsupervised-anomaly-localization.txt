Unsupervised anomaly localization and detection is cru-cial for industrial manufacturing processes due to the lack of anomalous samples. Recent unsupervised advances on industrial anomaly detection achieve high performance by training separate models for many different categories. The model storage and training time cost of this paradigm is high. Moreover, the setting of one-model-N-classes leads to fearful degradation of existing methods.In this pa-per, we propose a uniﬁed CNN framework for unsuper-vised anomaly localization, named OmniAL. This method conquers aforementioned problems by improving anomaly synthesis, reconstruction and localization. To prevent the model learning identical reconstruction, it trains the model with proposed panel-guided synthetic anomaly data rather than directly using normal data. It increases anomaly re-construction error for multi-class distribution by using a network that is equipped with proposed Dilated Channel and Spatial Attention (DCSA) blocks. To better localize the anomaly regions, it employs proposed DiffNeck between reconstruction and localization sub-networks to explore multi-level differences. Experiments on 15-class MVTecAD and 12-class VisA datasets verify the advantage of proposedOmniAL that surpasses the state-of-the-art of uniﬁed mod-els. On 15-class-MVTecAD/12-class-VisA, its single uniﬁed model achieves 97.2/87.8 image-AUROC, 98.3/96.6 pixel-AUROC and 73.4/41.7 pixel-AP for anomaly detection and localization respectively. Besides that, we make the ﬁrst at-tempt to conduct a comprehensive study on the robustness of unsupervised anomaly localization and detection meth-ods against different level adversarial attacks. Experiential results show OmniAL has good application prospects for its superior performance.
