The task of Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) is for an embodied agent to reach the global goal according to the instruction. Essentially, during navigation, a series of sub-goals need to be adaptively set and achieved, which is nat-urally a hierarchical navigation process. However, previ-ous methods leverage a single-step planning scheme, i.e., directly performing navigation action at each step, which is unsuitable for such a hierarchical navigation process.In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Zone-aware Hierar-chical Planner (AZHP) to explicitly divides the navigation process into two heterogeneous phases, i.e., sub-goal set-ting via zone partition/selection (high-level action) and sub-goal executing (low-level action), for hierarchical planning.Specifically, AZHP asynchronously performs two levels of action via the designed State-Switcher Module (SSM). For high-level action, we devise a Scene-aware adaptive ZonePartition (SZP) method to adaptively divide the whole nav-igation area into different zones on-the-fly. Then the Goal-oriented Zone Selection (GZS) method is proposed to select a proper zone for the current sub-goal. For low-level ac-tion, the agent conducts navigation-decision multi-steps in the selected zone. Moreover, we design a Hierarchical RL (HRL) strategy and auxiliary losses with curriculum learn-ing to train the AZHP framework, which provides effective supervision signals for each stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on three VLN bench-marks (REVERIE, SOON, R2R).
