Early action prediction deals with inferring the ongoing action from partially-observed videos, typically at the out-set of the video. We propose a bottleneck-based attention model that captures the evolution of the action, through pro-gressive sampling over fine-to-coarse scales. Our proposedTemporal Progressive (TemPr) model is composed of mul-tiple attention towers, one for each scale. The predicted action label is based on the collective agreement consider-ing confidences of these towers. Extensive experiments over four video datasets showcase state-of-the-art performance on the task of Early Action Prediction across a range of en-coder architectures. We demonstrate the effectiveness and consistency of TemPr through detailed ablations.â€
