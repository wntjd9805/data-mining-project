The goal of correspondence pruning is to recognize cor-rect correspondences (inliers) from initial ones, with appli-cations to various feature matching based tasks. Seeking neighbors in the coordinate and feature spaces is a com-mon strategy in many previous methods. However, it is difficult to ensure that these neighbors are always consis-tent, since the distribution of false correspondences is ex-tremely irregular. For addressing this problem, we propose a novel global-graph space to search for consistent neigh-bors based on a weighted global graph that can explicitly explore long-range dependencies among correspondences.On top of that, we progressively construct three neighbor embeddings according to different neighbor search spaces, and design a Neighbor Consistency block to extract neigh-bor context and explore their interactions sequentially. In the end, we develop a Neighbor Consistency Mining Net-work (NCMNet) for accurately recovering camera poses and identifying inliers. Experimental results indicate that our NCMNet achieves a significant performance advantage over state-of-the-art competitors on challenging outdoor and indoor matching scenes.
