Trit-plane coding enables deep progressive image com-pression, but it cannot use autoregressive context mod-els. In this paper, we propose the context-based trit-plane coding (CTC) algorithm to achieve progressive compres-sion more compactly. First, we develop the context-based rate reduction module to estimate trit probabilities of la-tent elements accurately and thus encode the trit-planes compactly. Second, we develop the context-based distor-tion reduction module to reﬁne partial latent tensors from the trit-planes and improve the reconstructed image qual-ity. Third, we propose a retraining scheme for the de-coder to attain better rate-distortion tradeoffs. Extensive experiments show that CTC outperforms the baseline trit-plane codec signiﬁcantly, e.g. by −14.84% in BD-rate on the Kodak lossless dataset, while increasing the time com-plexity only marginally.
