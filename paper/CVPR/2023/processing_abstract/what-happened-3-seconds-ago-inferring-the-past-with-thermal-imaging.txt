Inferring past human motion from RGB images is chal-lenging due to the inherent uncertainty of the prediction problem. Thermal images, on the other hand, encode traces of past human-object interactions left in the envi-ronment via thermal radiation measurement. Based on this observation, we collect the first RGB-Thermal dataset for human motion analysis, dubbed Thermal-IM. Then we develop a three-stage neural network model for accu-rate past human pose estimation. Comprehensive experi-ments show that thermal cues significantly reduce the am-biguities of this task, and the proposed model achieves is available at remarkable performance. https://github.com/ZitianTang/Thermal-IM.The dataset
