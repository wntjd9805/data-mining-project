We present All-Pairs Multi-Field Transforms (AMT), a new network architecture for video frame interpolation. It is based on two essential designs. First, we build bidirec-tional correlation volumes for all pairs of pixels, and use the predicted bilateral ﬂows to retrieve correlations for up-dating both ﬂows and the interpolated content feature. Sec-ond, we derive multiple groups of ﬁne-grained ﬂow ﬁelds from one pair of updated coarse ﬂows for performing back-ward warping on the input frames separately. Combining these two designs enables us to generate promising task-oriented ﬂows and reduce the difﬁculties in modeling large motions and handling occluded areas during frame interpo-lation. These qualities promote our model to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks with high efﬁciency. Moreover, our convolution-based model com-petes favorably compared to Transformer-based models in terms of accuracy and efﬁciency. Our code is available at https://github.com/MCG-NKU/AMT.
