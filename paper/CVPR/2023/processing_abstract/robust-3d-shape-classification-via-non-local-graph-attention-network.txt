We introduce a non-local graph attention network (NL-GAT), which generates a novel global descriptor through two sub-networks for robust 3D shape classiﬁcation.In the ﬁrst sub-network, we capture the global relationships between points (i.e., point-point features) by designing a global relationship network (GRN). In the second sub-network, we enhance the local features with a geometric shape attention map obtained from a global structure net-work (GSN). To keep rotation invariant and extract more information from sparse point clouds, all sub-networks use the Gram matrices with different dimensions as input for working with robust classiﬁcation. Additionally, GRN ef-fectively preserves the low-frequency features and improves the classiﬁcation results. Experimental results on various datasets exhibit that the classiﬁcation effect of the NLGAT model is better than other state-of-the-art models. Espe-cially, in the case of sparse point clouds (64 points) with noise under arbitrary SO(3) rotation, the classiﬁcation re-sult (85.4%) of NLGAT is improved by 39.4% compared with the best development of other methods.
