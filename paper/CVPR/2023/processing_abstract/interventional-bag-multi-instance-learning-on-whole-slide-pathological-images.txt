Multi-instance learning (MIL) is an effective paradigm for whole-slide pathological images (WSIs) classification to handle the gigapixel resolution and slide-level label. Pre-vailing MIL methods primarily focus on improving the fea-ture extractor and aggregator. However, one deficiency of these methods is that the bag contextual prior may trick the model into capturing spurious correlations between bags and labels. This deficiency is a confounder that limits the performance of existing MIL methods.In this paper, we propose a novel scheme, Interventional Bag Multi-InstanceLearning (IBMIL), to achieve deconfounded bag-level pre-diction. Unlike traditional likelihood-based strategies, the proposed scheme is based on the backdoor adjustment to achieve the interventional training, thus is capable of sup-pressing the bias caused by the bag contextual prior. Note that the principle of IBMIL is orthogonal to existing bagMIL methods. Therefore, IBMIL is able to bring consis-tent performance boosting to existing schemes, achieving new state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/HHHedo/IBMIL.
