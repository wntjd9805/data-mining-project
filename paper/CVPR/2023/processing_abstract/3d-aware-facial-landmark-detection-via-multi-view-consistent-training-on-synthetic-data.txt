in module with extensive comparison against state-of-the-art methods on several real and synthetic datasets.Accurate facial landmark detection on wild images plays an essential role in human-computer interaction, enter-tainment, and medical applications. Existing approaches have limitations in enforcing 3D consistency while detect-ing 3D/2D facial landmarks due to the lack of multi-view in-the-wild training data. Fortunately, with the recent ad-vances in generative visual models and neural rendering, we have witnessed rapid progress towards high quality 3D image synthesis. In this work, we leverage such approaches to construct a synthetic dataset and propose a novel multi-view consistent learning strategy to improve 3D facial land-mark detection accuracy on in-the-wild images. The pro-posed 3D-aware module can be plugged into any learning-based landmark detection algorithm to enhance its accu-racy. We demonstrate the superiority of the proposed plug-*This work was done when Libing Zeng and Wentao Bao were interns at OPPO US Research Center, InnoPeak Technology, Inc.
