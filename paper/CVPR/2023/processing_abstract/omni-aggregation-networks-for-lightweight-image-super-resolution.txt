While lightweight ViT framework has made tremendous progress in image super-resolution, its uni-dimensional self-attention modeling, as well as homogeneous aggre-gation scheme, limit its effective receptive field (ERF) to include more comprehensive interactions from both spa-tial and channel dimensions. To tackle these drawbacks, this work proposes two enhanced components under a new Omni-SR architecture. First, an Omni Self-Attention (OSA) block is proposed based on dense interaction princi-ple, which can simultaneously model pixel-interaction from both spatial and channel dimensions, mining the potential correlations across omni-axis (i.e., spatial and channel).Coupling with mainstream window partitioning strategies,OSA can achieve superior performance with compelling computational budgets. Second, a multi-scale interaction scheme is proposed to mitigate sub-optimal ERF (i.e., pre-mature saturation) in shallow models, which facilitates lo-cal propagation and meso-/global-scale interactions, ren-dering an omni-scale aggregation building block. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Omni-SR achieves record-high performance on lightweight super-resolution bench-marks (e.g., 26.95dB@Urban100 Ã—4 with only 792K pa-rameters).
