In this work, we focus on reducing the annotation cost for video action detection which requires costly frame-wise dense annotations. We study a novel hybrid active learning (AL) strategy which performs efficient labeling using both intra-sample and inter-sample selection. The intra-sample selection leads to labeling of fewer frames in a video as op-posed to inter-sample selection which operates at video level.This hybrid strategy reduces the annotation cost from two dif-ferent aspects leading to significant labeling cost reduction.The proposed approach utilize Clustering-Aware UncertaintyScoring (CLAUS), a novel label acquisition strategy which relies on both informativeness and diversity for sample se-lection. We also propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Weighted (STeW) loss formulation, which helps in model training un-der limited annotations. The proposed approach is evaluated on UCF-101-24 and J-HMDB-21 datasets demonstrating its effectiveness in significantly reducing the annotation cost where it consistently outperforms other baselines.

The plots show scores for (a-b) UCF-101-24 and (c-d) J-HMDB-21 for different annotation amount. The green line represents model performance with 90% annotations.
