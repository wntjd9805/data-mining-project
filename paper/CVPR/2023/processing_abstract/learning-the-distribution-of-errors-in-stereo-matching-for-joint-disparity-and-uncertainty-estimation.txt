We present a new loss function for joint disparity and uncertainty estimation in deep stereo matching. Our work is motivated by the need for precise uncertainty estimates and the observation that multi-task learning often leads to improved performance in all tasks. We show that this can be achieved by requiring the distribution of uncertainty to match the distribution of disparity errors via a KL diver-gence term in the network’s loss function. A differentiable soft-histogramming technique is used to approximate the distributions so that they can be used in the loss. We exper-imentally assess the effectiveness of our approach and ob-serve significant improvements in both disparity and uncer-tainty prediction on large datasets.
