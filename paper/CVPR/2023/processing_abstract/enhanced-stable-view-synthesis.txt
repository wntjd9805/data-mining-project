We introduce an approach to enhance the novel view syn-thesis from images taken from a freely moving camera. The introduced approach focuses on outdoor scenes where re-covering accurate geometric scaffold and camera pose is challenging, leading to inferior results using the state-of-the-art stable view synthesis (SVS) method. SVS and related methods fail for outdoor scenes primarily due to (i) over-relying on the multiview stereo (MVS) for geometric scaf-fold recovery and (ii) assuming COLMAP computed camera poses as the best possible estimates, despite it being well-studied that MVS 3D reconstruction accuracy is limited to scene disparity and camera-pose accuracy is sensitive to key-point correspondence selection. This work proposes a principled way to enhance novel view synthesis solutions drawing inspiration from the basics of multiple view geome-try. By leveraging the complementary behavior of MVS and monocular depth, we arrive at a better scene depth per view for nearby and far points, respectively. Moreover, our ap-proach jointly refines camera poses with image-based ren-dering via multiple rotation averaging graph optimization.The recovered scene depth and the camera-pose help better view-dependent on-surface feature aggregation of the entire scene. Extensive evaluation of our approach on the popu-lar benchmark dataset, such as Tanks and Temples, shows substantial improvement in view synthesis results compared to the prior art. For instance, our method shows 1.5 dB ofPSNR improvement on the Tank and Temples. Similar statis-tics are observed when tested on other benchmark datasets such as FVS, Mip-NeRF 360, and DTU.
