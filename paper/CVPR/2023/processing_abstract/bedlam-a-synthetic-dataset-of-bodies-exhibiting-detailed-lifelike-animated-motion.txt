We show, for the first time, that neural networks trained only on synthetic data achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the problem of 3D human pose and shape (HPS) estima-tion from real images. Previous synthetic datasets have been small, unrealistic, or lacked realistic clothing. Achiev-ing sufficient realism is non-trivial and we show how to do this for full bodies in motion. Specifically, our BED-LAM dataset contains monocular RGB videos with ground-It includes a diver-truth 3D bodies in SMPL-X format. sity of body shapes, motions, skin tones, hair, and cloth-ing. The clothing is realistically simulated on the moving bodies using commercial clothing physics simulation. We render varying numbers of people in realistic scenes with varied lighting and camera motions. We then train vari-ous HPS regressors using BEDLAM and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on real-image benchmarks despite train-ing with synthetic data. We use BEDLAM to gain insights*The authors contributed equally and are listed alphabetically.â€ This work was performed when JL was at MPI-IS. into what model design choices are important for accu-racy. With good synthetic training data, we find that a basic method like HMR approaches the accuracy of the current SOTA method (CLIFF). BEDLAM is useful for a variety of tasks and all images, ground truth bodies, 3D clothing, support code, and more are available for research purposes. Additionally, we provide detailed information about our synthetic data generation pipeline, enabling oth-ers to generate their own datasets. See the project page: https://bedlam.is.tue.mpg.de/.
