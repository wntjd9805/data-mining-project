3D scene ﬂow estimation aims to estimate point-wise motions between two consecutive frames of point clouds.Superpoints, i.e., points with similar geometric features, are usually employed to capture similar motions of local regions in 3D scenes for scene ﬂow estimation. However, in existing methods, superpoints are generated with the ofﬂine clustering methods, which cannot characterize local regions with similar motions for complex 3D scenes well, leading to inaccurate scene ﬂow estimation. To this end, we propose an iterative end-to-end superpoint based sceneﬂow estimation framework, where the superpoints can be dynamically updated to guide the point-level ﬂow predic-tion. Speciﬁcally, our framework consists of a ﬂow guided superpoint generation module and a superpoint guided ﬂow reﬁnement module. In our superpoint generation module, we utilize the bidirectional ﬂow information at the previ-ous iteration to obtain the matching points of points and superpoint centers for soft point-to-superpoint association construction, in which the superpoints are generated for pairwise point clouds. With the generated superpoints, we ﬁrst reconstruct the ﬂow for each point by adaptively aggregating the superpoint-level ﬂow, and then encode the consistency between the reconstructed ﬂow of pairwise point clouds. Finally, we feed the consistency encod-ing along with the reconstructed ﬂow into GRU to reﬁne point-level ﬂow. Extensive experiments on several different datasets show that our method can achieve promising performance. Code is available at https://github. com/supersyq/SPFlowNet.
