Image super-resolution (SR) has attracted increasing atten-tion due to its widespread applications. However, current SR methods generally suffer from over-smoothing and artifacts, and most work only with fixed magnifications. This paper in-troduces an Implicit Diffusion Model (IDM) for high-fidelity continuous image super-resolution.IDM integrates an im-plicit neural representation and a denoising diffusion model in a unified end-to-end framework, where the implicit neu-ral representation is adopted in the decoding process to learn continuous-resolution representation. Furthermore, we design a scale-adaptive conditioning mechanism that consists of a low-resolution (LR) conditioning network and a scaling fac-tor. The scaling factor regulates the resolution and accordingly modulates the proportion of the LR information and generated features in the final output, which enables the model to accom-modate the continuous-resolution requirement. Extensive ex-periments validate the effectiveness of our IDM and demon-strate its superior performance over prior arts. The source code will be available at https://github.com/Ree1s/IDM .
