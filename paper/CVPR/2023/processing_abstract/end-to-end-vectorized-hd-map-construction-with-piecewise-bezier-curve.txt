Vectorized high-definition map (HD-map) construction, which focuses on the perception of centimeter-level environ-mental information, has attracted significant research inter-est in the autonomous driving community. Most existing ap-proaches first obtain rasterized map with the segmentation-based pipeline and then conduct heavy post-processing for downstream-friendly vectorization. In this paper, by delving into parameterization-based methods, we pioneer a concise and elegant scheme that adopts unified piecewise B´ezier curve. In order to vectorize changeful map elements end-to-end, we elaborate a simple yet effective architecture, named Piecewise B´ezier HD-map Network (BeMapNet), which is formulated as a direct set prediction paradigm and postprocessing-free. Concretely, we first introduce a novelIPM-PE Align module to inject 3D geometry prior into BEV features through common position encoding in Transformer.Then a well-designed Piecewise B´ezier Head is proposed to output the details of each map element, including the coor-dinate of control points and the segment number of curves.In addition, based on the progressively restoration of B´ezier curve, we also present an efficient Point-Curve-Region Loss for supervising more robust and precise HD-map modeling.Extensive comparisons show that our method is remarkably superior to other existing SOTAs by 18.0 mAP at least 1.
