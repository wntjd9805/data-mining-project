The recent detection transformer (DETR) simplifies the object detection pipeline by removing hand-crafted designs and hyperparameters as employed in conventional two-stage object detectors. However, how to leverage the sim-ple yet effective DETR architecture in domain adaptive ob-ject detection is largely neglected. Inspired by the uniqueDETR attention mechanisms, we design DA-DETR, a do-main adaptive object detection transformer that introduces information fusion for effective transfer from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. DA-DETR introduces a novel CNN-Transformer Blender (CTBlender) that fuses the CNN features and Transformer features inge-niously for effective feature alignment and knowledge trans-fer across domains. Specifically, CTBlender employs theTransformer features to modulate the CNN features across multiple scales where the high-level semantic information and the low-level spatial information are fused for accu-rate object identification and localization. Extensive experi-ments show that DA-DETR achieves superior detection per-formance consistently across multiple widely adopted do-main adaptation benchmarks.
