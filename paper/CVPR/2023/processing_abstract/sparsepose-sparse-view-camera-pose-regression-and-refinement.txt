Camera pose estimation is a key step in standard 3D re-construction pipelines that operate on a dense set of im-ages of a single object or scene. However, methods for pose estimation often fail when only a few images are avail-able because they rely on the ability to robustly identify and match visual features between image pairs. While these methods can work robustly with dense camera views, cap-turing a large set of images can be time-consuming or im-practical. We propose SparsePose for recovering accu-rate camera poses given a sparse set of wide-baseline im-ages (fewer than 10). The method learns to regress initial camera poses and then iteratively refine them after train-ing on a large-scale dataset of objects (Co3D: CommonObjects in 3D). SparsePose significantly outperforms con-ventional and learning-based baselines in recovering ac-curate camera rotations and translations. We also demon-strate our pipeline for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction using only 5-9 images of an object. Project webpage: https://sparsepose.github.io/
