Interactive image segmentation aims at obtaining a seg-mentation mask for an image using simple user annotations.During each round of interaction, the segmentation result from the previous round serves as feedback to guide the userâ€™s annotation and provides dense prior information for the segmentation model, effectively acting as a bridge be-tween interactions. Existing methods overlook the impor-tance of feedback or simply concatenate it with the orig-inal input, leading to underutilization of feedback and an increase in the number of required annotations. To address this, we propose an approach called Focused and Collabo-rative Feedback Integration (FCFI) to fully exploit the feed-back for click-based interactive image segmentation. FCFI first focuses on a local area around the new click and cor-rects the feedback based on the similarities of high-level features. It then alternately and collaboratively updates the feedback and deep features to integrate the feedback into the features. The efficacy and efficiency of FCFI were validated on four benchmarks, namely GrabCut, Berkeley, SBD, andDAVIS. Experimental results show that FCFI achieved new state-of-the-art performance with less computational over-head than previous methods.
