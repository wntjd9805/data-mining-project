With the progress of 3D human pose and shape estima-tion, state-of-the-art methods can either be robust to oc-clusions or obtain pixel-aligned accuracy in non-occlusion cases. However, they cannot obtain robustness and mesh-image alignment at the same time. In this work, we presentNIKI (Neural Inverse Kinematics with Invertible NeuralNetwork), which models bi-directional errors to improve the robustness to occlusions and obtain pixel-aligned ac-curacy. NIKI can learn from both the forward and inverse processes with invertible networks. In the inverse process, the model separates the error from the plausible 3D pose manifold for a robust 3D human pose estimation.In the forward process, we enforce the zero-error boundary condi-tions to improve the sensitivity to reliable joint positions for better mesh-image alignment. Furthermore, NIKI emulates the analytical inverse kinematics algorithms with the twist-and-swing decomposition for better interpretability. Ex-periments on standard and occlusion-specific benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of NIKI, where we exhibit ro-bust and well-aligned results simultaneously.
