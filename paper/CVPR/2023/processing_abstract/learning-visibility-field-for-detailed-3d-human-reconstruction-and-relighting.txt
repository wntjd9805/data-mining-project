cation [24, 63], movie and gaming industry [7].Detailed 3D reconstruction and photo-realistic relight-ing of digital humans are essential for various applications.To this end, we propose a novel sparse-view 3d human re-construction framework that closely incorporates the oc-cupancy field and albedo field with an additional visibil-ity fieldâ€“it not only resolves occlusion ambiguity in multi-view feature aggregation, but can also be used to evalu-ate light attenuation for self-shadowed relighting. To en-hance its training viability and efficiency, we discretize vis-ibility onto a fixed set of sample directions and supply it with coupled geometric 3D depth feature and local 2D im-age feature. We further propose a novel rendering-inspired loss, namely TransferLoss, to implicitly enforce the align-ment between visibility and occupancy field, enabling end-to-end joint training. Results and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, as it surpasses state-of-the-art in terms of reconstruction ac-curacy while achieving comparably accurate relighting to ray-traced ground truth.
