Recent works have proposed to craft adversarial clothes for evading person detectors, while they are either only ef-fective at limited viewing angles or very conspicuous to hu-mans. We aim to craft adversarial texture for clothes based on 3D modeling, an idea that has been used to craft rigid adversarial objects such as a 3D-printed turtle. Unlike rigid objects, humans and clothes are non-rigid, leading to difﬁ-In order to craft natural-culties in physical realization. looking adversarial clothes that can evade person detectors at multiple viewing angles, we propose adversarial camou-ﬂage textures (AdvCaT) that resemble one kind of the typical textures of daily clothes, camouﬂage textures. We leverage the Voronoi diagram and Gumbel-softmax trick to param-eterize the camouﬂage textures and optimize the parame-ters via 3D modeling. Moreover, we propose an efﬁcient augmentation pipeline on 3D meshes combining topologi-cally plausible projection (TopoProj) and Thin Plate Spline (TPS) to narrow the gap between digital and real-world ob-jects. We printed the developed 3D texture pieces on fabric materials and tailored them into T-shirts and trousers. Ex-periments show high attack success rates of these clothes against multiple detectors.
