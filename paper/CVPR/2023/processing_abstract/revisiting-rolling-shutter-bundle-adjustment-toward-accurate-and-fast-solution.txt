We propose an accurate and fast bundle adjustment (BA) solution that estimates the 6-DoF pose with an independentRS model of the camera and the geometry of the environ-ment based on measurements from a rolling shutter (RS) camera. This tackles the challenges in the existing works, namely, relying on high frame rate video as input, restric-tive assumptions on camera motion and poor efﬁciency. To this end, we ﬁrst verify the positive inﬂuence of the image point normalization to RSBA. Then we present a novel vi-sual residual covariance model to standardize the repro-jection error during RSBA, which consequently improves the overall accuracy. Besides, we demonstrate the com-bination of Normalization and covariance standardizationWeighting in RSBA (NW-RSBA) can avoid common planar degeneracy without the need to constrain the ﬁlming man-ner. Finally, we propose an acceleration strategy for NW-RSBA based on the sparsity of its Jacobian matrix and Schur complement. The extensive synthetic and real data experi-ments verify the effectiveness and efﬁciency of the proposed solution over the state-of-the-art works.
