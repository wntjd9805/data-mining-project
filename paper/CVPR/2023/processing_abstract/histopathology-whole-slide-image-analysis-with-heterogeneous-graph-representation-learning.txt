Graph-based methods have been extensively applied to whole slide histopathology image (WSI) analysis due to the advantage of modeling the spatial relationships among dif-ferent entities. However, most of the existing methods fo-cus on modeling WSIs with homogeneous graphs (e.g., with homogeneous node type). Despite their successes, these works are incapable of mining the complex structural re-lations between biological entities (e.g., the diverse inter-action among different cell types) in the WSI. We propose a novel heterogeneous graph-based framework to lever-age the inter-relationships among different types of nu-clei for WSI analysis. Specifically, we formulate the WSI as a heterogeneous graph with “nucleus-type” attribute to each node and a semantic similarity attribute to each edge.We then present a new heterogeneous-graph edge attribute transformer (HEAT) to take advantage of the edge and node heterogeneity during massage aggregating. Further, we design a new pseudo-label-based semantic-consistent pooling mechanism to obtain graph-level features, which can mitigate the over-parameterization issue of conven-tional cluster-based pooling. Additionally, observing the limitations of existing association-based localization meth-ods, we propose a causal-driven approach attributing the contribution of each node to improve the interpretability of our framework. Extensive experiments on three pub-lic TCGA benchmark datasets demonstrate that our frame-work outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with consid-erable margins on various tasks.
