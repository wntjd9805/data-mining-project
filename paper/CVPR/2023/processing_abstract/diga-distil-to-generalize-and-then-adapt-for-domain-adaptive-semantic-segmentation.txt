Domain adaptive semantic segmentation methods com-monly utilize stage-wise training, consisting of a warm-up and a self-training stage. However, this popular approach still faces several challenges in each stage: for warm-up, the widely adopted adversarial training often results in lim-ited performance gain, due to blind feature alignment; for self-training, finding proper categorical thresholds is very tricky. To alleviate these issues, we first propose to re-place the adversarial training in the warm-up stage by a novel symmetric knowledge distillation module that only ac-cesses the source domain data and makes the model do-main generalizable. Surprisingly, this domain generaliz-able warm-up model brings substantial performance im-provement, which can be further amplified via our pro-posed cross-domain mixture data augmentation technique.Then, for the self-training stage, we propose a threshold-free dynamic pseudo-label selection mechanism to ease the aforementioned threshold problem and make the model bet-ter adapted to the target domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves remarkable and consistent improvements compared to the prior arts on popular benchmarks.
