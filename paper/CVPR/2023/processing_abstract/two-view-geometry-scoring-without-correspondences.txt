Camera pose estimation for two-view geometry tradi-tionally relies on RANSAC. Normally, a multitude of image correspondences leads to a pool of proposed hypotheses, which are then scored to find a winning model. The inlier count is generally regarded as a reliable indicator of “con-sensus”. We examine this scoring heuristic, and find that it favors disappointing models under certain circumstances.As a remedy, we propose the Fundamental Scoring Net-work (FSNet), which infers a score for a pair of overlap-ping images and any proposed fundamental matrix. It does not rely on sparse correspondences, but rather embodies a two-view geometry model through an epipolar attention mechanism that predicts the pose error of the two images.FSNet can be incorporated into traditional RANSAC loops.We evaluate FSNet on fundamental and essential matrix es-timation on indoor and outdoor datasets, and establish thatFSNet can successfully identify good poses for pairs of im-ages with few or unreliable correspondences. Besides, we show that naively combining FSNet with MAGSAC++ scor-ing approach achieves state of the art results.
