In this work, we focus on the challenging problem of La-bel Enhancement (LE), which aims to exactly recover label distributions from logical labels, and present a novel LabelInformation Bottleneck (LIB) method for LE. For the recov-ery process of label distributions, the label irrelevant infor-mation contained in the dataset may lead to unsatisfactory recovery performance. To address this limitation, we make efforts to excavate the essential label relevant information to improve the recovery performance. Our method formu-lates the LE problem as the following two joint processes: 1) learning the representation with the essential label rel-evant information, 2) recovering label distributions based on the learned representation. The label relevant informa-tion can be excavated based on the “bottleneck” formed by the learned representation. Significantly, both the label rel-evant information about the label assignments and the label relevant information about the label gaps can be explored in our method. Evaluation experiments conducted on several benchmark label distribution learning datasets verify the ef-fectiveness and competitiveness of LIB.
