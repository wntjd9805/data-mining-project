A novel 4K video frame interpolator based on bilateral transformer (BiFormer) is proposed in this paper, which performs three steps: global motion estimation, local mo-in global tion reﬁnement, and frame synthesis. First, motion estimation, we predict symmetric bilateral motionﬁelds at a coarse scale. To this end, we propose Bi-Former, the ﬁrst transformer-based bilateral motion esti-mator.Second, we reﬁne the global motion ﬁelds efﬁ-ciently using blockwise bilateral cost volumes (BBCVs).Third, we warp the input frames using the reﬁned motionﬁelds and blend them to synthesize an intermediate frame.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Bi-Former algorithm achieves excellent interpolation perfor-mance on 4K datasets.
