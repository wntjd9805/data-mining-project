DECREE is a novel approach for detecting backdoor attacks in pre-trained image encoders used in self-supervised learning. Backdoor attacks can compromise the integrity of downstream classifiers trained on clean data by inheriting malicious behaviors from the encoders. Existing detection methods are designed for supervised learning and are ineffective when input labels are unavailable. DECREE addresses this limitation by detecting backdoors without relying on classifier headers or input labels. The effectiveness of DECREE is demonstrated through evaluations on over 400 trojaned encoders under three paradigms. The method achieves high detection accuracy even with limited or no access to the pre-training dataset. The code for DECREE is publicly available on GitHub.
