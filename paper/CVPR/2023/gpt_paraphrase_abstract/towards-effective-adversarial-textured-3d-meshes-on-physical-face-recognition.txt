We aim to develop a reliable technique for evaluating the robustness of face recognition systems against physical adversarial attacks. Current physical attacks are either easily detectable or ineffective against commercial systems. Our technique involves creating adversarial textured 3D meshes (AT3D) that can be 3D-printed and applied to an attacker's face to evade defenses. However, optimizing the mesh-based space can be challenging due to local optima. To overcome this, we propose perturbing the low-dimensional coefficient space based on a 3D Morphable Model, resulting in improved transferability, search efficiency, and visual quality. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in identifying vulnerabilities in various commercial systems.
