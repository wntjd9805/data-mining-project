New algorithms have recently been developed to rearrange models in a way that maintains their functionality within the solution space. These algorithms have provided insights into the complexity of error surfaces and have shown promising properties, such as mode connectivity. However, finding the optimal rearrangement is challenging, and current optimization techniques lack differentiability, making it difficult to integrate them into gradient-based optimization methods and often leading to suboptimal solutions. To address this issue, we propose a differentiable Sinkhorn re-basin network that can determine the optimal transportation plan for a given objective. Unlike existing methods, our approach is differentiable, making it easy to adapt to various tasks in deep learning. Additionally, we introduce a new cost function that leverages the linear mode connectivity property, enabling incremental learning. We compare the effectiveness of our re-basin method against similar approaches in the literature under different conditions, including optimal transport and linear mode connectivity. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of our continual learning method based on re-basin using several common benchmark datasets, achieving competitive results compared to the state-of-the-art. The source code for our method is available at https://github.com/fagp/sinkhorn-rebasin.
