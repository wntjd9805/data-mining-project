We propose a self-supervised contrastive learning framework that utilizes both images and tabular data to train unimodal encoders. This framework combines SimCLR and SCARF, two leading contrastive learning strategies, and is simple and effective. We demonstrate the strength of this framework by predicting risks of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease using cardiac MR images and clinical features from the UK Biobank. We also show that tabular features describing size and shape play a significant role in the learning process and improve the quality of the learned embeddings. Additionally, we introduce a novel form of supervised contrastive learning called label as a feature (LaaF), which outperforms all supervised contrastive baselines.
