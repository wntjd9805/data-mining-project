The Deep Implicit Function (DIF) has become popular for representing 3D shapes efficiently. Current methods divide shapes into local regions and learn each region using a local latent code and a decoder. While this approach captures local details well, it still faces challenges due to the diversity and imbalanced distribution of local regions. To address this, we propose a new method called LP-DIF, which represents shapes using clusters of local regions and multiple decoders. Each decoder focuses on a specific cluster of regions that share a common pattern. We extract local codes for all regions, cluster them into groups based on similarity, and train decoders to learn the patterns of each group. This simplifies the learning of fine geometric details by reducing the diversity seen by each decoder. To address data imbalance, we introduce a region re-weighting module to each decoder using a kernel density estimator. This module dynamically adjusts the weights of regions during learning. Our LP-DIF method restores more geometry details and improves the quality of 3D reconstruction. Experimental results show that our method outperforms previous approaches.
