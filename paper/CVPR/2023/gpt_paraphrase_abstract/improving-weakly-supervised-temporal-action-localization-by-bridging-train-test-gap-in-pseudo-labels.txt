The goal of weakly supervised temporal action localization is to generate temporal boundaries for actions while also classifying the action category. Pseudo-label-based methods have been widely studied as an effective solution for this task. However, existing methods often generate pseudo labels during training and make predictions during testing using different pipelines or settings, leading to a gap between training and testing. In this paper, we propose a method to generate high-quality pseudo labels from predicted action boundaries. We acknowledge that existing post-processing techniques, such as NMS, can result in information loss and insufficient quality of action boundaries. Additionally, transforming action boundaries into pseudo labels is challenging due to overlapping predicted action instances with different confidence scores. Furthermore, the generated pseudo-labels can be fluctuating and inaccurate in the early stages of training, reinforcing false predictions without self-correction mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose an effective pipeline for learning better pseudo labels. Our approach includes a Gaussian weighted fusion module to preserve information of action instances and obtain high-quality action boundaries. We also formulate the pseudo-label generation as an optimization problem with constraints based on the confidence scores of action instances. Finally, we introduce the concept of âˆ† pseudo labels, which enables the model to self-correct. Our method outperforms existing methods on two benchmarks, THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.3, with improvements of 1.9% on THUMOS14 and 3.7% on ActivityNet1.3 in terms of average mAP.
