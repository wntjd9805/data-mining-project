Cell instance segmentation in cytology images is crucial for biology analysis and cancer screening. However, it is challenging due to overlapping cell clusters and the presence of mimics and debris. To address these issues, we present a novel approach called De-overlapping Network (DoNet). DoNet employs a decompose-and-recombined strategy, consisting of a Dual-path Region Segmentation Module (DRM) and a Semantic Consistency-guided Recombination Module (CRM). DRM effectively breaks down cell clusters into intersection and complement regions, while CRM integrates the segmented regions. Additionally, we introduce a Mask-guided Region Proposal Strategy (MRP) to incorporate the containment relationship between the nucleus and cytoplasm. MRP utilizes cell attention maps to improve inner-cell instance prediction. We evaluate our approach on the ISBI2014 and CPS datasets, and our results demonstrate that DoNet outperforms other state-of-the-art cell instance segmentation methods. The code for DoNet is available at https://github.com/DeepDoNet/DoNet.
