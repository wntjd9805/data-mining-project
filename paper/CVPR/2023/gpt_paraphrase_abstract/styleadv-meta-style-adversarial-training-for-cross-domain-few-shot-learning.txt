Cross-Domain Few-Shot Learning (CD-FSL) is a task that addresses the challenge of learning from limited data across different domains. The task involves transferring knowledge from a source dataset to new target datasets. The main difficulty in CD-FSL is the significant difference in visual styles between datasets. Previous methods, such as wave-SAN, attempted to alleviate this issue by swapping styles between images. However, this approach only generated styles that were similar to the original set of source styles. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new method called StyleAdv, which combines model-agnostic meta adversarial training with a style adversarial attack. Our style attack method generates both "virtual" and "hard" adversarial styles for training the model. By continuously challenging the model with these adversarial styles, it becomes more robust to different visual styles, leading to improved generalization on new target datasets. We evaluate our method on eight different target datasets using both CNN-based backbones and large-scale pre-trained vision transformers. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in CD-FSL. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/lovelyqian/StyleAdv-CDFSL.
