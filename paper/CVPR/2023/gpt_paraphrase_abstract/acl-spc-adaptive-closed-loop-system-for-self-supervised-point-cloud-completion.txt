Point cloud completion involves filling in the missing parts of a partial point cloud obtained from depth sensors in order to generate a complete point cloud. While supervised methods have made significant progress in completing synthetic point clouds, they are not easily applicable in real-world scenarios due to differences between synthetic and real-world datasets or the need for prior information. To address these limitations, we propose a new self-supervised framework called ACL-SPC for point cloud completion. ACL-SPC trains and tests on the same data, taking a single partial input and attempting to output the complete point cloud using an adaptive closed-loop system. Our evaluation on various datasets demonstrates that ACL-SPC can successfully learn to complete partial point clouds as the first self-supervised approach. Our results show that our method performs comparably to unsupervised methods and outperforms supervised methods trained on synthetic datasets when applied to real-world datasets. Extensive experiments validate the importance of self-supervised learning and the effectiveness of our proposed method for real-world point cloud completion. The code for our method is publicly available.
