In the field of expert image recognition, precise labeling is necessary but expensive, leading to limited dataset sizes and reduced accuracy of learning systems. To overcome this challenge, we propose a method called PrOfeSsional lEvel cRowd (POSER) annotation, which involves annotating expert data with crowdsourcing. We introduce a new approach called SSL withIt is a human-in-human filtering (SSL-HF), based on semi-supervised learning (SSL). In this method, crowd-source workers serve as filters for pseudo-labels, replacing the unreliable confidence thresholding used in current SSL methods. To allow annotation by non-experts, classes are implicitly specified through positive and negative sets of examples, accompanied by deliberative explanations that highlight areas of class ambiguity. This way, SSL-HF utilizes the strong low-shot learning and confidence estimation skills of humans to create an intuitive and effective labeling experience. Experimental results demonstrate that SSL-HF outperforms various alternative approaches in multiple benchmarks.
