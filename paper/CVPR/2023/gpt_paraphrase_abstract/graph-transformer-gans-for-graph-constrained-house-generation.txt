A new approach called GTGAN is introduced for the task of generating graph-constrained houses. The method utilizes a graph Transformer generative adversarial network that incorporates graph convolutions and self-attentions to model interactions between connected and non-connected graph nodes. The proposed connected node attention and non-connected node attention capture global relations within the input graph. Additionally, a graph modeling block is introduced to leverage local vertex interactions based on the house layout topology. A node classification-based discriminator is also proposed to preserve high-level semantic and discriminative features for different house components. A graph-based cycle-consistency loss is proposed to maintain the relative spatial relationships between ground truth and predicted graphs. Experimental results on two house generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of GTGAN, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both objective quantitative scores and subjective visual realism.
