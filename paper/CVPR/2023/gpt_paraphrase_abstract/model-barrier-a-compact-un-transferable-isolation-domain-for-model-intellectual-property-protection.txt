The protection of intellectual property (IP) for models has become increasingly important in order to incentivize creators and owners. This involves preventing the unauthorized use of well-trained models on different domains. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called Compact Un-Transferable Isolation Domain (CUTI-domain). This approach acts as a barrier, preventing illegal transfers from authorized to unauthorized domains. CUTI-domain achieves this by highlighting the unique style features of the authorized domain, causing recognition failure on unauthorized domains with irrelevant style features. We offer two solutions for using CUTI-domain, depending on whether the unauthorized domain is known or not: target-specific CUTI-domain and target-free CUTI-domain. Our experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that CUTI-domain can be easily implemented as a plug-and-play module with different backbones, providing an efficient solution for protecting model IP.
