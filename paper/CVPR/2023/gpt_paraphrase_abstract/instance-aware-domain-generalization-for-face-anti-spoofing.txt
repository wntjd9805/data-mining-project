Recently, there has been a focus on improving the generalization of face anti-spoofing (FAS) systems by using domain generalization (DG) techniques. However, existing methods rely on domain labels to align the distribution of each domain, which may not accurately reflect real domain distributions. Additionally, these methods only focus on coarse-grained domain-level alignment, which may not ensure that learned representations are insensitive to domain styles. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach for DG FAS that aligns features at the instance level without using domain labels. Our proposed Instance-Aware Domain Generalization framework aims to learn generalizable features by reducing the sensitivity to instance-specific styles. We introduce Asymmetric Instance Adaptive Whitening, which adaptively eliminates style-sensitive feature correlations to improve generalization. Furthermore, we propose Dynamic Kernel Generator and Categorical Style Assembly to extract instance-specific features and generate style-diversified features with large style shifts, respectively, to enhance the learning of style-insensitive features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to state-of-the-art competitors. The code for our method will be publicly available.
