Deep neural networks have been successfully used for image restoration tasks such as super-resolution, de-noising, and de-blurring. However, these networks require significant computational resources to run. Previous research has focused on designing new networks or pruning parameters to address this issue. However, these approaches do not consider the impact of image compression on the quality of image restoration. To address this limitation, we propose a framework called AccelIR. AccelIR optimizes image compression by considering the entire pipeline of image restoration tasks. It uses IR-aware compression to encode an image, adjusting compression levels for different blocks within the image based on their impact on the quality of image restoration. Then, a lightweight IR network is applied to the compressed image, reducing the computational overhead while maintaining the same quality and size of the restored image.Our evaluation of AccelIR using nine different IR networks demonstrates its effectiveness. On average, AccelIR reduces the computing overhead of super-resolution, de-noising, and de-blurring tasks by 49%, 29%, and 32% respectively. This highlights the potential of AccelIR to significantly reduce the computational requirements of image restoration tasks while preserving the quality of the final results.
