Recent advancements in semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSS) have shown notable progress. However, state-of-the-art methods often become more complex, adding network components and training procedures. This study introduces AugSeg, a straightforward approach within a teacher-student framework that emphasizes data perturbations to enhance SSS performance. Instead of directly applying supervised learning techniques, we argue that data augmentations should be tailored to semi-supervised scenarios. AugSeg adopts a simplified intensity-based augmentation that randomly selects data transformations with varying distortion strengths. Additionally, we incorporate labeled information into unlabeled samples based on the model's confidence estimation. Without unnecessary complexities, AugSeg achieves new state-of-the-art performance on SSS benchmarks using different partition protocols.
