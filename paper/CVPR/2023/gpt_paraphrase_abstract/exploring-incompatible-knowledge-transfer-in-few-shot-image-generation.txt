The aim of this study is to address the problem of incompatible knowledge transfer in few-shot image generation (FSIG) methods, which results in low-quality synthetic images. FSIG aims to generate diverse and realistic images from a target domain using only a few reference samples. Existing methods rely on transferring prior knowledge from a source generator, pre-trained on a related domain, to learn the target generator. However, it has been observed that the issue of incompatible knowledge transfer arises from the least significant filters of the source generator. To mitigate this problem, the authors propose a technique called knowledge truncation, which complements knowledge preservation. Knowledge truncation involves lightweight pruning-based methods to remove the problematic filters. The effectiveness of knowledge truncation is demonstrated through extensive experiments, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in FSIG. The proposed method is simple yet effective in improving the quality of synthetic images.
