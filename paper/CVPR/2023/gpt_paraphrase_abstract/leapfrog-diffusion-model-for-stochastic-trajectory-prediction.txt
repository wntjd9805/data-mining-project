A novel diffusion-based trajectory prediction model called LEapfrog Diffusion (LED) is proposed to address the challenge of real-time prediction in stochastic trajectory prediction. The model leverages a trainable leapfrog initializer to learn an expressive multi-modal distribution of future trajectories, which significantly accelerates inference speed by skipping denoising steps. Furthermore, the leapfrog initializer is trained to allocate correlated samples to provide diverse predicted trajectories, resulting in improved prediction performance. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that LED consistently improves performance and achieves significant improvements in average displacement error (ADE) and final displacement error (FDE) on the NFL dataset. Additionally, LED achieves substantial speed improvements compared to the standard diffusion model on various datasets, meeting real-time inference needs.
