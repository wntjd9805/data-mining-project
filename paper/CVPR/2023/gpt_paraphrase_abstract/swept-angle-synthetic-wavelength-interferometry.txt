We introduce a novel imaging method called swept-angle synthetic wavelength interferometry, which enables high-precision 3D sensing at the micron scale. Similar to traditional synthetic wavelength interferometry, our technique utilizes light with two closely spaced optical wavelengths to capture inter-ferometric measurements that encode depth information for each pixel. However, our approach also incorporates a new type of light source that mimics spatially-incoherent illumination. This feature renders our interferometric measurements immune to aberrations and surface scattering, which are known to distort phase measurements. By combining the robustness of scanning interferometric setups with the speed of full-field interferometric setups, our technique can accurately reconstruct depth information for the entire frame with a lateral and axial resolution of 5 Âµm. Furthermore, it achieves a frame rate of 5 Hz, even in the presence of strong ambient light. To validate our method, we construct an experimental prototype and demonstrate its capabilities by scanning various objects. These objects include those commonly encountered in inspection and fabrication applications, as well as objects with challenging light scattering effects.
