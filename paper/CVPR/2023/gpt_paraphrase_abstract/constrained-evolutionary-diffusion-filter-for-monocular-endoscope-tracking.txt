Stochastic filtering is a commonly used method for solving nonlinear optimization problems in computer vision and augmented reality applications. However, many existing methods suffer from a lack of balance between exploration and exploitation, leading to suboptimal results. To address this issue, this study introduces a novel constrained evolutionary diffusion filter for nonlinear optimization. This filter incorporates spatial state constraints and adaptive history-recall differential evolution, rather than sequential resampling, to overcome the problems of particle degeneracy and impoverishment. Experimental results, specifically in the context of monocular endoscope 3-D tracking, demonstrate that the proposed filtering approach significantly improves the balance between exploration and exploitation, outperforming recent 3-D tracking methods. Notably, the surgical tracking error is reduced from 4.03 mm to 2.59 mm.
