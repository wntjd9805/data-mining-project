Face super-resolution (FSR) techniques have made significant progress with the advent of deep learning. However, existing methods have limitations such as fixed receptive field or inability to maintain facial structure, which affects FSR performance. To address these issues, we propose a spatial-frequency mutual network (SFMNet) that incorporates Fourier transform to capture global facial structure information and achieve image-size receptive field. SFMNet consists of a spatial branch and a frequency branch, exploiting the correlations between spatial and frequency domains. The frequency branch captures global dependency while the spatial branch extracts local dependency, and a frequency-spatial interaction block (FSIB) is introduced to combine these complementary dependencies. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art FSR techniques in recovering high-resolution face images. The implementation and model of SFMNet can be found at https://github.com/wcy-cs/SFMNet.
