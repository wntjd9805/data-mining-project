The object detection pipeline has been simplified by the recent detection transformer (DETR) through the removal of hand-crafted designs and hyperparameters used in traditional two-stage object detectors. However, there has been a lack of focus on utilizing the simple yet effective DETR architecture for domain adaptive object detection. In response to this, we propose DA-DETR, a domain adaptive object detection transformer that incorporates information fusion to enable effective transfer from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Our approach introduces a novel CNN-Transformer Blender (CTBlender) that cleverly combines CNN features and Transformer features to align features and transfer knowledge between domains. CTBlender utilizes Transformer features to modulate CNN features at multiple scales, allowing for accurate object identification and localization by merging high-level semantic information with low-level spatial information. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DA-DETR consistently outperforms existing methods on various domain adaptation benchmarks.
