Recent focus in instance segmentation has been on query-based models, which are non-maximum suppression (NMS)-free and end-to-end. However, the effectiveness of these models on high-accuracy real-time benchmarks has not been well demonstrated. In this study, we showcase the potential of query-based models in efficient instance segmentation algorithm designs. We introduce FastInst, a straightforward yet powerful query-based framework for real-time instance segmentation. FastInst achieves a real-time speed of 32.5 FPS while achieving an average precision (AP) of over 40 (40.5 AP) on the COCO test-dev dataset without any additional features. FastInst follows the meta-architecture of Mask2Former and incorporates instance activation-guided queries, a dual-path update strategy, and ground truth mask-guided learning. These design choices allow us to use lighter pixel decoders and fewer Transformer decoder layers, resulting in improved performance. Experimental results demonstrate that FastInst surpasses most state-of-the-art real-time models, including strong fully convolutional baselines, in terms of both speed and accuracy.
