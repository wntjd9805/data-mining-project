Test-time adaptation methods have recently gained attention as a practical solution to bridge the gap between different domains, without the need for labeled target data. This paper introduces TTA-COPE, a test-time adaptation method for category-level object pose estimation. Our approach involves a pose ensemble technique combined with a self-training loss using pose-aware confidence. Unlike previous unsupervised domain adaptation methods for object pose estimation, our method processes test data sequentially and online, without requiring access to the source domain during runtime. Extensive experiments show that our proposed pose ensemble and self-training loss significantly enhance category-level object pose performance during test time, both in semi-supervised and unsupervised scenarios.
