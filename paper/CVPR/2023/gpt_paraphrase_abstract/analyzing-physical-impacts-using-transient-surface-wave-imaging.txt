This paper focuses on extracting information from transient surface vibrations of objects. Previous works have either imaged surface vibrations to recover material properties or captured transient vibrations to recover localized signals. However, these approaches neglect the spatiotemporal relationship between vibrations at different points on the object. In this paper, we propose a method that simultaneously measures transient surface vibrations at a sparse set of object points using a dual-shutter camera. We utilize a model to localize the disturbance source and demonstrate its effectiveness for various materials. Additionally, we show that transient object vibrations can provide cues about impact force and the material properties of the impacting object. We showcase the applications of our approach in localizing ping-pong ball strikes on a table during a game and recovering the locations of footsteps by imaging the floor vibrations they create.
