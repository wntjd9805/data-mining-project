This paper presents a new approach for constructing high-definition maps (HD-maps) for autonomous driving. Current methods involve converting rasterized maps into vectorized maps through a segmentation-based pipeline and then performing extensive post-processing. In contrast, this paper proposes a parameterization-based method using unified piecewise Bézier curves. To achieve end-to-end vectorization of changing map elements, the authors introduce a simple yet effective architecture called BeMapNet, which predicts map elements directly without the need for post-processing. The authors also present a novel module called IPM-PE Align, which incorporates 3D geometry information into the Bird's Eye View (BEV) features using Transformer's common position encoding. They also propose a well-designed Piecewise Bézier Head to output the details of each map element, such as control points and curve segment numbers. Additionally, they introduce a Point-Curve-Region Loss that helps supervise the HD-map modeling, ensuring robustness and precision. Extensive comparisons demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches by at least 18.0 mAP.
