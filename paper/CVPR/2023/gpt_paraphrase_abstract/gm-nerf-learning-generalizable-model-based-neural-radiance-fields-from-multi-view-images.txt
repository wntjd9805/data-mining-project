This study focuses on generating high-quality images of human performers from a limited number of viewpoints. This is a challenging task due to the various body poses and occlusion issues. To address these challenges, the researchers propose a framework called Generalizable Model-based Neural Radiance Fields (GM-NeRF) that can generate free-viewpoint images. They introduce a geometry-guided attention mechanism to align the appearance code with a geometry proxy, reducing misalignment. Additionally, they utilize neural rendering and partial gradient backpropagation for better perceptual quality. The proposed method is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, showing superior results compared to existing methods in terms of view synthesis and geometric reconstruction.
