Computer vision applications have traditionally used a combination of Lambertian diffuse and microfacet specular reflection models to represent reflected radiance. However, these models are physically incompatible and have limited applicability. In this paper, we propose a new analytical reflectance model called the FresnelMicrofacet BRDF model. This model accurately represents the Fresnel reflection and transmission of surface microgeometry using a collection of oriented mirror facets. We also consider the light transport between these facets in the subsurface. Additionally, our model allows for the expression of both the radiometric and polarimetric behavior of reflected light, unifying body and surface reflections. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in terms of accuracy, expressive power, image-based estimation, and geometry recovery.
