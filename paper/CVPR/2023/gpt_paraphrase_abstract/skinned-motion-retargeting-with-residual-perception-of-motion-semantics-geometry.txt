This study introduces the Residual RETargeting network (R2ET) structure, which consists of two neural modification modules. These modules are designed to adjust source motions to align with target skeletons and shapes. The first module, called the skeleton-aware module, focuses on preserving the semantic meaning of the source motion. The second module, the shape-aware module, considers the geometry of the target characters to minimize issues such as interpenetration and contact-missing. The proposed R2ET network incorporates distance-based losses to explicitly model motion semantics and geometry. By learning residual motion modifications, the network generates realistic retargeted motion in a single inference without the need for additional post-processing. To strike a balance between these modifications, a balancing gate is introduced to perform linear interpolation. Experimental results on the Mixamo dataset demonstrate that R2ET achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, effectively preserving motion semantics while reducing interpenetration and contact-missing. The code for R2ET is available at https://github.com/Kebii/R2ET.
