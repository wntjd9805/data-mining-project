The aim of content-aware visual-textual presentation layout is to arrange elements such as text, logo, and underlay in a given canvas for template-free graphic design. In practical applications like poster designs, the canvas is initially not empty, and both the relationships between elements and layers need to be considered for creating a proper layout. Some recent works have addressed these concerns simultaneously but have suffered from issues such as limited layout variety and spatial misalignment. To address these limitations, we introduce a new dataset called PKU PosterLayout, comprising 9,974 poster-layout pairs and 905 non-empty canvas images. This dataset offers greater challenges and usefulness in terms of layout variety, domain diversity, and content diversity. We then propose a method called design sequence formation (DSF), which reorganizes elements in layouts to mimic the design processes of human designers. Additionally, we present a novel conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) based on CNN-LSTM architecture that generates appropriate layouts. The discriminator in this network is design-sequence-aware and supervises the "design" process of the generator. Experimental results demonstrate the usefulness of the new benchmark and the effectiveness of our approach, which achieves the best performance by generating suitable layouts for diverse canvases.
