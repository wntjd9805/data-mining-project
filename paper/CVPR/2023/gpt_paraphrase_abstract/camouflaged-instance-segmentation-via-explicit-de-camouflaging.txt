Camouflaged Instance Segmentation (CIS) is the task of predicting masks for camouflaged objects, particularly animals in the wild that blend with their surroundings. Existing instance segmentation methods struggle with this task due to the disruptive nature of camouflage. In order to overcome these challenges, we propose a new approach called De-camouflaging Network (DCNet), which consists of two modules: a pixel-level camouflage decoupling module and an instance-level camouflage suppression module. The DCNet offers several advantages. Firstly, the pixel-level camouflage decoupling module utilizes Fourier transformation to extract camouflage characteristics. It then employs a difference attention mechanism to remove these characteristics while retaining the target object features in the pixel representation. Secondly, the instance-level camouflage suppression module aggregates comprehensive instance information using instance prototypes. To enhance segmentation accuracy and mitigate the impact of background noise, we introduce reliable reference points to establish a more robust similarity measurement. By leveraging these two modules, our DCNet effectively models de-camouflaging and achieves accurate segmentation for camouflaged instances. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets (COD10K and NC4K) demonstrate the superior performance of our DCNet compared to state-of-the-art CIS methods. On average, our approach achieves more than 5% improvement in terms of average precision.
