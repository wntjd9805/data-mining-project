This study presents a new approach for estimating 3D hand shape using a combination of non-parametric mesh fitting and the MANO model. While direct mesh fitting methods are highly accurate, the resulting meshes often contain artifacts and do not resemble realistic hand shapes. On the other hand, parametric models like MANO produce plausible hand shapes but lack accuracy compared to non-parametric methods. To address this tradeoff, the authors propose a weakly-supervised framework that integrates both approaches. The joint model achieves well-aligned and high-quality 3D meshes, particularly in challenging scenarios involving two hands or hand-object interactions.
