Semi-supervised learning techniques have significantly improved the performance of 3D medical image segmentation. Unlike 2D images, 3D medical volumes contain information from different directions, such as transverse, sagittal, and coronal planes, which offer complementary views. Leveraging these complementary views and the similarity between adjacent 3D slices, a novel annotation approach and corresponding semi-supervised model were developed for effective segmentation. The proposed approach involves annotating only two orthogonal slices in a labeled volume, reducing the annotation burden. Registration is then performed to obtain initial pseudo labels for sparsely labeled volumes. Leveraging unlabeled volumes, a dual-network paradigm called Dense-Sparse Co-training (DeSCO) is introduced. This paradigm utilizes dense pseudo labels in the early stage and sparse labels in the later stage, while ensuring consistent output from both networks. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. For instance, with just 10 annotated slices, the method achieves a Dice score of up to 86.93% on the KiTS19 dataset. The code and models for this approach are available at https://github.com/HengCai-NJU/DeSCO.
