The dating of bronze dings in ancient Chinese history has been crucial for archaeological research. However, the current process relies on skilled experts and is time-consuming. In this study, we propose a learning-based approach that combines deep learning techniques and archaeological knowledge to streamline the dating process. We create a comprehensive image dataset of bronze dings with detailed attribute information. By using a multihead classifier and a knowledge-guided relation graph, we analyze the relationship between attributes and the era of the dings. Through comparison experiments, we demonstrate that our dating method outperforms existing methods. We believe that our dataset and applied networks will contribute to fine-grained classification research in interdisciplinary fields. The dataset and source code can be found in our supplementary materials and will be made available after submission.
