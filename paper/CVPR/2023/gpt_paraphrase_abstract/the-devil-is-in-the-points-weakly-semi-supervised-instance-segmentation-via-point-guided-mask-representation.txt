This paper introduces a new learning scheme called weakly semi-supervised instance segmentation (WS-SIS) with point labels. The goal is to achieve efficient and high-performance instance segmentation by utilizing a dataset with a few fully-labeled images and many point-labeled images. The main challenge in semi-supervised approaches is the trade-off between false-negative and false-positive instance proposals. To address this challenge, the proposed method effectively uses the budget-friendly point labels as a weak supervision source. Additionally, when the amount of fully-labeled data is extremely limited, a MaskRefineNet is introduced to refine noisy masks. Experimental results on COCO and BDD100K datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves promising results, comparable to a fully-supervised model, even with only 50% of the fully labeled COCO data. Moreover, with as little as 5% of fully labeled COCO data, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art semi-supervised learning method significantly. The code for the proposed method is available at https://github.com/clovaai/PointWSSIS.
