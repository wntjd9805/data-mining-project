This paper examines a phenomenon in which query-based object detectors make incorrect predictions at the final decoding stage, despite predicting correctly at an intermediate stage. The authors identify two limitations in the training process that contribute to this issue: insufficient training emphasis and cascading errors from the decoding sequence. To address this, they propose a new training strategy called Selective Query Recollection (SQR). SQR accumulates intermediate queries as the decoding stages progress and selectively forwards them to downstream stages, in addition to the sequential structure. This approach emphasizes training on later stages and enables later stages to incorporate intermediate queries from earlier stages directly. SQR can be easily integrated into different query-based object detectors without modifying the inference pipeline. The authors apply SQR to Adamixer, DAB-DETR, and Deformable-DETR under various settings and consistently observe a significant improvement of 1.4 to 2.8 average precision (AP).
