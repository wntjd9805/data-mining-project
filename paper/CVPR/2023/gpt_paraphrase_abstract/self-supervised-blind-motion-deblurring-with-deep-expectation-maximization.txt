This paper introduces a novel approach for addressing the challenge of removing camera shake-induced blur from images. Unlike existing methods that rely on supervised learning with a dataset of blurred and latent images, this method is dataset-free. It involves a deep neural network (DNN) re-parametrization of the latent image and utilizes a Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) approach for training the DNN without the need for latent images. The MCEM approach uses Langevin dynamics for Monte Carlo simulation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing methods in removing motion blur from images of static scenes.
