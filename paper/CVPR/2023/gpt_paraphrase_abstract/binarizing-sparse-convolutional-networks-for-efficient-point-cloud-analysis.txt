This paper introduces a binary sparse convolutional network called BSC-Net for efficient point cloud analysis. It is observed that sparse convolution operation leads to larger quantization errors compared to standard convolution. Traditional network quantization methods directly binarize weights and activations in sparse convolution, resulting in performance degradation due to significant quantization loss. However, this paper proposes a different approach by searching for the optimal subset of convolution operations that activate sparse convolution at various locations. This helps alleviate quantization errors and close the performance gap between real-valued and binary sparse convolutional networks without increasing complexity. The paper presents the shifted sparse convolution technique, which combines information from the receptive field for active sites that match predefined positions. Differentiable search strategies are employed to discover the optimal positions for active site matching in shifted sparse convolution, leading to significant reduction in quantization errors for efficient point cloud analysis. The proposed method is evaluated against recent advancements in sparse convolution network binarization, and experimental results on Scan-Net and NYU Depth v2 datasets demonstrate that BSC-Net achieves significant improvements over the strong baseline and outperforms state-of-the-art network binarization methods without additional computation overhead.
