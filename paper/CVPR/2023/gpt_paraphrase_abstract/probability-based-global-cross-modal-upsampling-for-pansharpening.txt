Pansharpening is a crucial step in remote sensing image processing. While deep learning methods have shown good performance in this task, the current up-sampling methods used in these approaches only consider the local information of each pixel in the low-resolution multi-spectral image and ignore the global information and cross-modal information of the guiding panchromatic image. This limits their ability to improve performance. To address this limitation, this study introduces a novel probability-based global cross-modal up-sampling method (PGCU) for pansharpening. The PGCU method is formulated from a probabilistic perspective and incorporates an efficient network module that fully utilizes the global and cross-modal information while considering channel specificity. The PGCU module consists of three blocks: information extraction, distribution and expectation estimation, and fine adjustment. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the PGCU method compared to other popular up-sampling methods. Moreover, the experiments show that the PGCU module can enhance the performance of existing state-of-the-art deep learning pansharpening methods. The code for implementing the PGCU method is available at https://github.com/Zeyu-Zhu/PGCU. Figure 1 illustrates the difference between local upsampling methods and the proposed PGCU method, highlighting the limited receptive field of the local method and the ability of the PGCU method to fully exploit the rich global and cross-modal information.
