A new technique called the HandsOff framework is introduced in this study. It utilizes generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate synthetic datasets with labeled images. Unlike previous methods, this framework does not require new annotations of synthetic images, making it more practical for practitioners. By training on less than 50 pre-existing labeled images, the HandsOff framework can generate an unlimited number of synthetic images and corresponding labels. It combines GAN inversion with dataset generation, resulting in rich pixel-wise labeled datasets in various challenging domains such as faces, cars, full-body human poses, and urban driving scenes. The method outperforms prior dataset generation approaches and transfer learning baselines in tasks like semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, and depth estimation. Moreover, it addresses common challenges in model development caused by fixed, hand-annotated datasets, such as the long-tail problem in semantic segmentation.
