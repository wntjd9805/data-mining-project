Rolling shutter correction (RSC) is gaining popularity for commercial and industrial applications using RS cameras. However, existing RSC methods employ a two-stage network structure that hampers fast inference and overlooks intrinsic information interactions. This paper introduces JAMNet, a single-stage encoder-decoder-based network, designed for efficient RSC. JAMNet extracts pyramid features from consecutive RS inputs and simultaneously refines the two complementary information (global shutter appearance and undistorted motion field) through joint learning in the decoder. To incorporate adequate motion cues for guiding joint learning, a transformer-based motion embedding module is introduced, and hidden states are passed across pyramid levels. Furthermore, a novel data augmentation strategy called "vertical flip + inverse order" is proposed to unlock the potential of RSC datasets. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, particularly achieving a significant 4.7 dB PSNR improvement on real-world RSC.
