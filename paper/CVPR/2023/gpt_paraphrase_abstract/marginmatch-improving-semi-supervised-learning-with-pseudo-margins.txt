We present MarginMatch, a novel SSL approach that combines consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on the model's confidence to decide whether to mask an unlabeled example, MarginMatch also assesses the model's behavior on pseudo-labeled examples during training to ensure low-quality predictions are masked out. By enforcing high-quality pseudo-labels, MarginMatch achieves significant improvements on four vision benchmarks in low data scenarios and two large-scale datasets. For instance, on CIFAR-100 with only 25 labels per class, MarginMatch reduces the error rate by 3.25% compared to the state-of-the-art. Similarly, on STL-10 with as few as 4 labels per class, MarginMatch achieves a 3.78% improvement. The code for MarginMatch is available at https://github.com/tsosea2/MarginMatch.
