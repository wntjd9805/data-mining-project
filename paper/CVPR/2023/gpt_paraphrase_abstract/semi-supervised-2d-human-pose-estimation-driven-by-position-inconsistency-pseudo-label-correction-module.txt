This paper focuses on semi-supervised 2D human pose estimation and addresses two problems that were previously ignored. Firstly, it discusses the issue of using the pseudo label of a lightweight model to guide large models during interactive training. Secondly, it mentions the negative impact of noise pseudo labels on training. The complexity of the labels used for 2D human pose estimation, which include keypoint category and keypoint position, is also highlighted.To tackle these problems, the authors propose a semi-supervised 2D human pose estimation framework called SSPCM, which is driven by a position inconsistency pseudo label correction module. The framework introduces an auxiliary teacher and utilizes the pseudo labels generated by the two teacher models at different periods to calculate the inconsistency score and remove outliers. The two teacher models are then updated through interactive training, and the student model is updated using the pseudo labels from both teachers.In order to further enhance the performance of the student model, the authors incorporate the semi-supervised Cut-Occlude technique based on pseudo keypoint perception to generate more challenging and effective samples. Additionally, they introduce a new indoor overhead fisheye human keypoint dataset called WEPDTOF-Pose.Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the previous best semi-supervised 2D human pose estimation method. The authors plan to release the code and dataset at the provided GitHub link. Figure 1 in the paper shows a performance comparison between their method (SSPCM) and two other methods (DataDistill and DUAL) on the COCO dataset. The results show that using 1000, 5000, and 10000 labeled person instances, their method achieves an increase of 2.3mAP, 1.9mAP, and 1.1mAP respectively compared to the previous method.
