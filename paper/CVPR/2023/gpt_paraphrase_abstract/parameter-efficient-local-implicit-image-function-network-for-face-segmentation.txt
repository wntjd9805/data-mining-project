This study focuses on face parsing, which involves labeling each pixel in an image of a human face to identify specific facial regions such as eyes, lips, nose, and hair. The researchers propose a lightweight face-parsing method called FP-LIIF that takes advantage of the structural consistency of the human face. They design a simple architecture consisting of a convolutional encoder and a pixel MLP decoder, which significantly reduces the number of parameters compared to existing models while achieving comparable or superior performance on various datasets. Unlike other approaches, their network does not require pretraining and can generate segmentations at different resolutions without altering the input resolution. This innovative approach enables facial segmentation on devices with limited computational power or bandwidth due to its higher frames per second (FPS) and smaller model size.
