Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is an effective technique for addressing the problem of domain shift. UDA methods aim to align the representations of the source and target domains in order to improve the generalization on the target domain. However, in real-world scenarios, access to labeled source data is often restricted due to privacy regulations, data transmission constraints, or proprietary data concerns. The Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) setting aims to overcome these limitations by adapting a source-trained model for the target domain without requiring access to the source data.In this study, we investigate the SFDA setting for the task of adaptive object detection. We propose a novel training strategy to adapt a source-trained object detector to the target domain without using source data. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive loss that leverages the relationships between objects in the target domain to enhance the target representations. These object instance relations are modeled using an Instance Relation Graph (IRG) network, which guides the contrastive representation learning process. Additionally, we employ a student-teacher approach to effectively distill knowledge from the source-trained model to the target domain.Through extensive experiments on multiple object detection benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our proposed approach efficiently adapts source-trained object detectors to the target domain, surpassing the performance of state-of-the-art domain adaptive detection methods.
