The current state-of-the-art models for generating scene graphs suffer from a decrease in quality due to the uneven distribution of relationships and their parent object pairs. The training process focuses mostly on the majority relationships and pairs, neglecting the object-conditional distribution of relationships in minority pairs. As a result, the biased model performs well on common relationships like 'on' and 'wearing', but poorly on less frequent relationships like 'eating' and 'hanging from'. To address this issue, we propose using virtual evidence integrated within a Bayesian Network (BN) that considers triplets. This approach helps preserve the object-conditional distribution of relationship labels and eliminates bias caused by the marginal probability of relationships. However, learning the within-triplet Bayesian network is challenging due to the limited number of relationships in the minority classes. To overcome this, we use embedding-based augmentation of triplets, borrowing samples from neighboring triplets in the semantic space. We conducted experiments on two datasets and achieved a significant improvement in relationship recall. Additionally, our approach achieves a better balance between recall and mean recall performance compared to other state-of-the-art debiasing techniques for scene graph models.
