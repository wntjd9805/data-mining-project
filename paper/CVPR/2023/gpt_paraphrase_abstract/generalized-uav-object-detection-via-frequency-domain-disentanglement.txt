This paper presents a novel approach to improving the generalization ability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles object detection (UAV-OD) networks in complex and unseen real-world scenarios. The generalization ability of these networks is often reduced due to domain shift. To address this issue, the authors propose a frequency domain disentanglement method. They first confirm that different bands in an image have varying effects on UAV-OD generalization. Based on this finding, they design two learnable filters: one to extract domain-invariant spectrum and another to extract domain-specific spectrum. The former is used to train the UAV-OD network and enhance its generalization capacity. Additionally, they introduce a new instance-level contrastive loss to guide network training, enabling the extraction of domain-invariant and domain-specific spectra for better disentangling results. Experimental results on three unseen target domains demonstrate that their method outperforms both the baseline method and state-of-the-art approaches in terms of generalization ability.
