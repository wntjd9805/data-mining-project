Channel pruning is a technique that reduces the computational and memory requirements of neural networks while maintaining their accuracy. While channel pruning has been successful for 2D image-based convolutional networks (CNNs), there is limited research on applying these methods to 3D point-based neural networks (PNNs). This is because the representations of 2D images and 3D point clouds, as well as the network architectures, are different. In this study, we propose CP3, a Channel Pruning Plug-in for Point-based networks, which is specifically designed to adapt 2D channel pruning methods for PNNs. CP3 incorporates a coordinate-enhanced channel importance metric that captures the correlation between dimensional information and individual channel features. It also recycles discarded points in the PNN's sampling process to enhance the robustness of channel pruning. Experimental results on various PNN architectures demonstrate that CP3 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 2D CNN pruning approaches on different point cloud tasks. For example, our compressed PointNeXt-S model achieves an accuracy of 88.52% with a pruning rate of 57.8%, surpassing baseline pruning methods with an accuracy gain of 1.94%.
