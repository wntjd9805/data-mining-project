This study addresses the limitations of existing methods such as BARF and GARF in bundling camera poses with neural radiance fields (NeRF). While these methods have shown impressive results, they cannot be applied to Generalizable NeRFs (GeNeRFs) that require more complex image feature extractions using 3D CNN or transformer architectures. The authors analyze the challenges of optimizing camera poses with GeNeRFs and propose a new method called DBARF. DBARF adjusts camera poses by using a cost feature map as an implicit cost function and can be jointly trained with GeNeRFs in a self-supervised manner. Unlike previous methods, which are only applicable to per-scene optimized NeRFs and require accurate initial camera poses, DBARF can generalize across scenes without the need for good initialization. The effectiveness and generalization ability of DBARF are demonstrated through experiments on real-world datasets. The code for DBARF is available at https://aibluefisher.github.io/dbarf.
