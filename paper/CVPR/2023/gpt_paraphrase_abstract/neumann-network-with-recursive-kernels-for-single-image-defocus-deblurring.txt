We introduce a novel approach called learnable recursive kernel representation (RKR) for single image defocus deblurring (SIDD). SIDD aims to recover an all-in-focus image from a defocused blurry image, which is a challenging task due to the spatially-varying defocus blurring effects with significant size variation. Our RKR expresses a defocus kernel as a linear combination of recursive, separable, and positive atom kernels, capturing the strong correlation among defocus kernels of different sizes and the blob-type structure of defocus kernels. This parametrization provides a compact yet effective representation of the spatially-varying defocus blurring process. We then present a physics-driven and efficient deep model for SIDD, incorporating a cross-scale fusion structure inspired by the truncated Neumann series. This structure approximates the matrix inversion of the RKR-based blurring operator. To further improve the learning process, we propose a reblurring loss to regularize the RKR learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, achieving superior results while maintaining a comparable model size to top-performing approaches.
