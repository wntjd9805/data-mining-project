Current learning-based methods for sensor noise modeling in extreme low-light conditions are not as effective as physical model-based solutions. To address this, we propose a novel approach that combines learning-based techniques with physics-guided modeling. Our method utilizes a normalizing flow-based framework to represent the complex noise characteristics of CMOS camera sensors. Each component of the noise model is dedicated to a specific type of noise, guided by physical models. Additionally, we consider the ISO dependence in the noise model, which is often overlooked in existing learning-based methods. To train our noise model, we collect a new dataset containing paired noisy-clean images, as well as flat-field and bias frames spanning a wide range of ISO settings. Compared to existing methods, our noise model offers a flexible structure and accurate modeling capabilities, leading to improved denoising performance in extreme low-light scenes. The dataset and code for our approach are available at https://github.com/happycaoyue/LLD.
