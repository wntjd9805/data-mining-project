This paper presents a novel end-to-end inverse rendering pipeline that aims to estimate geometry, materials, and illumination from multi-view RGB images. Recent approaches have attempted to model indirect illuminations reflected from different materials using Spherical Gaussians (SG), but this often leads to the blurring of high-frequency reflection details. To overcome this limitation, the proposed method introduces Monte Carlo sampling-based path tracing and caches the indirect illumination as neural radiance. This approach enables a physics-faithful and easy-to-optimize inverse rendering method. To improve efficiency and practicality, the method utilizes SG to represent smooth environment illuminations and incorporates importance sampling techniques. To supervise indirect illuminations from unobserved directions, a novel radiance consistency constraint is developed between implicit neural radiance and path tracing results of unobserved rays. The joint optimization of materials and illuminations significantly enhances the decomposition performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on multiple synthetic and real datasets, particularly in terms of inter-reflection decomposition.
