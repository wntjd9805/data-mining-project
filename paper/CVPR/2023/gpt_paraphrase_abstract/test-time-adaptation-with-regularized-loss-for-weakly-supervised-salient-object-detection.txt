CNNs are prone to overfitting during training, leading to poor performance on test data. Test-time adaptation is a method to address overfitting by adjusting the trained model to individual test images. However, the lack of ground truth data poses a challenge for test-time adaptation. This approach is only applicable in scenarios where an effective loss function that does not require ground truth can be designed. In this study, we propose a novel approach for test-time Salient Object Detection (SOD) under weak supervision. Our approach utilizes a regularized loss function, which is suitable for training CNNs when precise ground truth is unavailable. The regularized loss function assigns lower values to more probable object segments, allowing for fine-tuning of a pre-trained CNN on a specific test image. We demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches for weakly supervised SOD.
