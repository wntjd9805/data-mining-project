The extraction of parametric edge curves from point clouds is a crucial task in 3D vision and geometry processing. Current methods rely on keypoint detection, which often produces noisy results and leads to errors in edge extraction. To overcome this limitation, we introduce NerVE, a novel neural volumetric edge representation that can be easily learned using a volumetric learning framework. NerVE can be converted into a flexible piece-wise linear curve representation, allowing for the learning of various types of curves. Additionally, NerVE encodes structural information, simplifying the edge extraction process to a graph search problem. By converting NerVE to the piece-wise linear representation, we can obtain parametric curves using standard spline fitting algorithms. We evaluate our approach on the challenging ABC dataset, demonstrating that a simple network based on NerVE significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.
