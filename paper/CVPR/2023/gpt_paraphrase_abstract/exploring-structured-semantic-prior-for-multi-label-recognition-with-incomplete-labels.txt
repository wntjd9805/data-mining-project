Multi-label recognition with incomplete labels is a difficult task. Previous research has focused on utilizing the image-to-label correspondence in models like CLIP to compensate for the lack of annotations. However, these approaches neglect the valuable information about label-to-label correspondence. This paper proposes a solution to this problem by introducing a structured semantic prior through a semantic prior prompter. The authors then present a novel Semantic Correspondence Prompt Network (SCP-Net) that effectively utilizes this structured semantic prior. Additionally, a Prior-Enhanced Self-Supervised Learning method is introduced to further enhance the utilization of the prior. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to existing approaches. The code for the method is made available on GitHub.
