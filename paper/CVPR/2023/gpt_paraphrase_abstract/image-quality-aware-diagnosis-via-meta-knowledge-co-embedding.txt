In clinical practice, medical images often suffer from degradation, which reduces the performance of deep learning models. Previous research has focused on filtering out low-quality images that cause degradation, but this ignores the potential value these images may have for the models. By effectively learning and leveraging the knowledge of image degradations, models can better resist their adverse effects and prevent misdiagnosis. This paper introduces the concept of image quality-aware diagnosis, which aims to use low-quality images and image quality labels to achieve more accurate and robust diagnoses. However, the diversity of degradations and the lack of apparent connection between image quality assessment and disease diagnosis make it challenging to effectively use quality labels for diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-knowledge co-embedding network with two subnets: Task Net and Meta Learner. The Task Net enhances diagnosis by incorporating explicit quality information through knowledge co-embedding features. The Meta Learner ensures the effectiveness and semantic constraints of these features through meta-learning and joint-encoding masking. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method by achieving superior performance on five datasets with four commonly used medical imaging modalities.
