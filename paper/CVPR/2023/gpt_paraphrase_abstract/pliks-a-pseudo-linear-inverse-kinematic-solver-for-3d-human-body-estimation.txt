We present PLIKS (Pseudo-Linear Inverse KinematicSolver), a method for reconstructing a 3D mesh of the human body from a single 2D image. Unlike current techniques that regress the shape, pose, and translation of a parametric model through a non-linear mapping with limited flexibility, PLIKS approaches the problem as a model-in-the-loop optimization. It utilizes a linearized formulation of the parametric SMPL model and allows for analytical reconstruction of the human model using pixel-aligned vertices. This approach enables the incorporation of accurate camera calibration information and the introduction of additional constraints. Our quantitative evaluations demonstrate that PLIKS outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, achieving more accurate reconstruction with over 10% improvement on standard 3D human pose and shape benchmarks. Additionally, PLIKS shows a reconstruction error improvement of 12.9 mm on the AGORA dataset.
