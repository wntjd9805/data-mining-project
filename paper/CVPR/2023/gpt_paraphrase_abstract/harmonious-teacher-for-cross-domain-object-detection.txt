Recently, self-training approaches have shown promising results in cross-domain object detection. These approaches involve generating pseudo labels for unlabeled samples in the target domain using a model, and refining the model by selecting high-confidence samples. However, the quality of the pseudo labels is crucial for the success of self-training. In this study, we propose a new approach called Harmonious Teacher to improve self-training in cross-domain object detection.To enhance the quality of the pseudo labels, we introduce a regularization technique that focuses on the consistency of classification and localization predictions during the training of the detection model. This consistency is enforced for both labeled samples from the source domain and unlabeled samples from the target domain. By doing so, we ensure that the pseudo labels accurately represent the objects in the target domain.Furthermore, we improve the traditional sample selection method by incorporating a sample reweighing strategy based on the consistency of classification and localization scores. This strategy allows us to rank the predictions more effectively and utilize all instance predictions from the target domain, including valuable hard examples.Without any additional complexities, our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various cross-domain scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of the Harmonious Teacher approach.
