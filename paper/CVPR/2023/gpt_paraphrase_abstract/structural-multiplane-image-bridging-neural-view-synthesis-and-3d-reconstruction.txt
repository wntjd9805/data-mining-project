The Multiplane Image (MPI) is a representation used for view synthesis, but its fixed structure limits its performance for surfaces imaged at oblique angles. To address this limitation, we propose the Structural MPI (S-MPI) which approximates 3D scenes and bridges view synthesis and 3D reconstruction. The S-MPI overcomes the limitations of MPI, such as discretization artifacts and redundant layers, while also enabling planar 3D reconstruction. However, applying S-MPI poses challenges such as high-fidelity approximation of RGBα layers and plane poses, handling non-planar regions, achieving multi-view consistency, and efficient rendering. To tackle these challenges, we propose a transformer-based network that predicts compact and expressive S-MPI layers, masks, poses, and RGBα contexts. Non-planar regions are handled as a special case within our framework. We ensure multi-view consistency by using global proxy embeddings that encode plane-level features covering the entire 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous MPI-based view synthesis methods and planar reconstruction methods.
