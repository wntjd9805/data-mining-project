Humans universally dislike cleaning up messy rooms, and if machines were to assist with this task, they need to understand human preferences for organized arrangements. This includes various types of symmetry, co-linearity or co-circularity, uniform spacing in linear or circular patterns, and other inter-object relationships related to style and functionality. Previous approaches either relied on explicit human input or generated scenes from scratch, but these methods do not address the rearrangement of existing messy scenes without a predefined goal state. In this paper, we introduce LEGO-Net, a data-driven iterative method based on transformers that learns to rearrange objects in messy rooms to achieve regularity. Inspired by diffusion models, LEGO-Net starts with an initial messy state and iteratively adjusts the position and orientation of objects to reach a regular state while minimizing travel distance. By training our method on a dataset of professionally arranged scenes with randomly perturbed object positions and orientations, we are able to successfully recover a regular arrangement. Our results demonstrate that LEGO-Net outperforms other methods in reliably rearranging room scenes. Additionally, we propose a metric for evaluating regularity in room arrangements using number-theoretic techniques.
