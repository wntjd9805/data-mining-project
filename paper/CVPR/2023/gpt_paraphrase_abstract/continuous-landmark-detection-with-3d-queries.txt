We introduce a novel facial landmark detection network that overcomes the limitations of existing networks by allowing the prediction of continuous and unlimited landmarks. Unlike previous methods, our network does not require a fixed set of landmarks during training and inference. Instead, the user can specify the number and location of desired landmarks at inference time. Our approach combines a simple image feature extractor with a queried landmark predictor, where the user can input any continuous query points relative to a 3D template face mesh. This flexibility allows us to leverage all pre-existing 2D landmark datasets for training, even if they have inconsistent landmark configurations. The result is a highly capable facial landmark detector that only needs to be trained once and can be applied to various applications such as 3D face reconstruction, arbitrary face segmentation, and even works with helmet-mounted cameras. This advancement has the potential to greatly simplify face tracking workflows in media and entertainment applications.
