We propose a new method for capturing accurate depth information through scattering media using polarimetric indirect time-of-flight (iToF) imaging. iToF imaging is a cost-effective way to obtain dense depth information, but it is prone to multipath interference (MPI) artifacts in the presence of scattering media, leading to reduced depth accuracy. Traditional iToF cameras struggle to accurately measure depth through fog due to the scattering of the active illumination.   To address this issue, we introduce a polarimetric iToF imaging approach that can robustly capture depth information in the presence of scattering media. By understanding the principles of indirect ToF imaging and the polarization of light, we develop a computational model that takes into account scattering-aware polarimetric phase measurements to correct MPI errors.   Our method starts by creating a scattering-aware polarimetric iToF model that can estimate the phase of unpolarized backscattered light. We then combine optical filtering of polarization with our computational modeling of unpolarized backscattered light, using scattering analysis of phase and amplitude. This enables us to estimate the scattering energy through the participating media, effectively addressing the MPI problem.   To validate our method, we conduct experiments using a customized off-the-shelf iToF camera. Our method surpasses baseline methods by a significant margin, thanks to our scattering model and polarimetric phase measurements.   Overall, our proposed method offers a robust solution for capturing accurate depth information through scattering media using polarimetric iToF imaging.
