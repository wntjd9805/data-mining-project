In industrial processing, unforeseen defects can occur in products due to uncontrollable factors. Existing unsupervised methods for defect localization often use pre-trained models, resulting in low-resolution outputs that negatively impact visual performance. To address this issue, we introduce PyramidFlow, a novel approach that does not rely on pre-trained models and enables high-resolution defect localization. PyramidFlow utilizes a latent template-based defect contrastive localization paradigm to reduce intra-class variance, similar to pre-trained models. Additionally, it incorporates pyramid-like normalizing flows for multi-scale fusing and volume normalization to improve generalization. Our comprehensive evaluations on MVTecAD dataset demonstrate that PyramidFlow outperforms comparable algorithms that do not utilize external priors, even achieving state-of-the-art performance in more challenging BTAD scenarios.
