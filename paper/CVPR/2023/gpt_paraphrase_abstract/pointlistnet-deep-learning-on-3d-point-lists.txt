The effectiveness of PointListNet, a proposed deep neural network, has been demonstrated in processing both regular 1D lists (such as natural languages) and irregular 3D sets (such as point clouds). While natural language processing focuses on modeling words and their order dependency, point cloud understanding requires comprehension of irregular point coordinates. However, certain types of data, such as proteins and non-coding RNAs, possess both regular list and irregular set structures. These are referred to as 3D point lists in this paper, and a Transformer-style PointListNet is proposed to model them. The PointListNet utilizes non-parametric distance-based attention, as the distance between points often determines their correlation in the micro world. Additionally, unlike the vanilla Transformer, which solely relies on linear transformations and does not explicitly consider relative relations, our PointListNet incorporates both 1D order and 3D Euclidean displacements into values. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments on protein fold classification and enzyme reaction classification. The results affirm the positive impact of PointListNet in these tasks.
