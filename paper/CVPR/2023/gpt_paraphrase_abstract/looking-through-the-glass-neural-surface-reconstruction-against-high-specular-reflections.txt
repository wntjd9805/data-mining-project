We introduce NeuS-HSR, a new framework for surface reconstruction using neural implicit methods. While these methods have been successful in generating high-quality 3D object surfaces in the presence of slight specular highlights, they struggle when faced with high specular reflections (HSR) that occur when capturing objects through glasses. The complexity and ambiguity of these scenes violate multi-view consistency, making it difficult for existing methods to accurately reconstruct target objects.To address this issue, our proposed NeuS-HSR framework utilizes implicit neural rendering and parameterizes the object surface as an implicit signed distance function (SDF). To mitigate the interference caused by HSR, we propose a novel auxiliary plane module that separates the rendered image into two appearances: the target object and the auxiliary plane. This module combines physical assumptions and neural networks to generate the appearance of the auxiliary plane.Extensive experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that NeuS-HSR surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of accurate and robust target surface reconstruction in the presence of HSR. Our code for NeuS-HSR is publicly available at https://github.com/JiaxiongQ/NeuS-HSR.
