Current color difference metrics used in image processing are not suitable for accurately measuring color differences in photographic images due to their complexity. This paper focuses on developing a deep color difference metric specifically for photographic images. The proposed metric has four key properties: it aligns with observations in vision science by considering the connection between color and form, it is a mathematically proper metric, it accurately measures color differences in photographic images, and it is robust to mild geometric distortions. To achieve these properties, the authors propose a multi-scale autoregressive normalizing flow for feature transformation, followed by the Euclidean distance. Experimental results using a large-scale dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed metric. The source code for the metric is available on GitHub.
