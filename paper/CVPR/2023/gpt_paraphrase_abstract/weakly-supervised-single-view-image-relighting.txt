We introduce a learning-based technique for relighting a single image containing Lambertian and low-frequency specular objects. This approach allows for the insertion of objects from photos into new scenes and relighting them according to the new environmental lighting, a crucial aspect for augmented reality applications. Our method addresses both inverse rendering and re-rendering challenges. To overcome the ill-posed inverse rendering problem, we propose a weakly-supervised approach utilizing a low-rank constraint. To facilitate the training process, we contribute a large-scale dataset called Relit, consisting of 750K images with aligned objects under varying illuminations. For re-rendering, we propose a differentiable specular rendering layer capable of rendering low-frequency non-Lambertian materials under different spherical harmonics illuminations. The entire pipeline is end-to-end and efficient, enabling implementation in mobile apps for AR object insertion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Additional information can be found on our project page: https://renjiaoyi.github.io/relighting/.
