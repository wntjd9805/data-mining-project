Spherical image object detection is important in various applications such as virtual reality, robotics, and automatic driving. Existing detectors use ln-norms loss for regression of spherical bounding boxes, but this approach has two flaws: independent parameter optimization and inconsistency between the metric (dominated by IoU) and loss. These problems are more significant in spherical image detection compared to planar image detection. Although solutions using IoU loss and related variants have been discussed for planar image detection, they cannot be applied to spherical image object detection due to the non-differentiability of Spherical IoU (SphIoU). In this paper, we propose a simple and effective regression loss based on Gaussian Label Distribution Learning (GLDL) for spherical image object detection. Additionally, we observe that the scale of objects in a spherical image varies greatly, making the sample selection strategy based on SphIoU challenging. Therefore, we introduce GLDL-ATSS as a better training sample selection strategy for objects in spherical images, which addresses the drawback of the IoU threshold-based strategy for scale-sample imbalance. Our approach is evaluated on two datasets with different baseline detectors, and the extensive results demonstrate its effectiveness.
