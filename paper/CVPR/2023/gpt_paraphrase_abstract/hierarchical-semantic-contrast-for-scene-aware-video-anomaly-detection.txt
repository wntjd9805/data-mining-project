This study addresses the challenge of improving scene-awareness in video anomaly detection (VAD). The authors propose a method called hierarchical semantic contrast (HSC) to develop a scene-aware VAD model using normal videos. They incorporate foreground object and background scene features with high-level semantics using pre-trained video parsing models. The authors then introduce scene-level and object-level contrastive learning within an autoencoder-based reconstruction framework to ensure that encoded latent features are compact within the same semantic classes and separable across different classes. This strategy helps handle the diversity of normal patterns and enhances their discrimination ability. To handle rare normal activities, a skeleton-based motion augmentation technique is designed to increase samples and refine the model. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.
