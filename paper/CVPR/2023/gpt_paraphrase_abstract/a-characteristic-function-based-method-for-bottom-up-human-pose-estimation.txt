Recent methods for human pose estimation typically approach the problem as a heatmap estimation task, using the overall L2 loss to optimize the heatmap prediction. However, in bottom-up human pose estimation, where each heatmap contains multiple body joints, using the overall L2 loss may not be the best choice. This is because minimizing the overall L2 loss does not always ensure accurate localization of body joints across different sub-regions of the heatmap. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to bottom-up human pose estimation. We optimize the heatmap prediction by minimizing the distance between two characteristic functions derived from the predicted heatmap and the ground truth heatmap. Our analysis reveals that the distance between these characteristic functions serves as an upper bound for the L2 losses in sub-regions of the predicted heatmap. By minimizing this distance, we can enhance the model's ability to accurately locate body joints in various sub-regions of the heatmap. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed method through extensive experiments on the COCO dataset and the CrowdPose dataset.
