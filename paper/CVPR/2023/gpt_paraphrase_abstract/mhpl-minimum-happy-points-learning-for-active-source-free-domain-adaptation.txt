Source free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a technique that aims to transfer a trained model from a source domain to an unlabeled target domain without accessing the source data. However, SFDA faces challenges due to the lack of source data and target supervised information, resulting in limited performance gains. To overcome this, active source free domain adaptation (ASFDA) incorporates active learning to explore and exploit informative samples. This paper introduces the concept of minimum happy (MH) points, which are neighbor-chaotic, individual-different, and source-dissimilar data points that are difficult to explore using existing methods. The proposed minimum happy points learning (MHPL) approach actively explores and exploits MH points by employing three unique strategies: neighbor environment uncertainty, neighbor diversity relaxation, and one-shot querying. To fully leverage MH points in the learning process, a neighbor focal loss is designed, which assigns weighted neighbor purity to the cross entropy loss of MH points, thus emphasizing their importance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MHPL outperforms various baseline methods and achieves significant performance improvements at a low labeling cost.
