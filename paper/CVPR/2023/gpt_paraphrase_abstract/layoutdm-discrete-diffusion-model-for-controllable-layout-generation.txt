In this study, the goal is to generate realistic layouts by arranging element bounding boxes according to specific constraints. The proposed model, called LayoutDM, is designed to handle various layout generation tasks using discrete state-space diffusion models. The model learns to progressively infer a noise-free layout from the initial input, incorporating a discrete diffusion process to account for layout corruption. For conditional generation, layout constraints are introduced through masking or logit adjustment during the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate that LayoutDM produces high-quality layouts and outperforms both task-specific and task-agnostic baseline models across multiple layout tasks.
