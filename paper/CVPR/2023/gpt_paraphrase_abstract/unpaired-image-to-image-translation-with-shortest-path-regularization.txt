Unpaired image-to-image translation involves mapping images from one domain to another while preserving the content. However, existing methods may result in the network mapping inputs to random permutations of images in the target domain. In this study, we approach the problem differently by considering the paths connecting the two domains. We propose that the optimal path length between input and output images should be the shortest. Based on this assumption, we introduce a new method that generates images along the path and encourages the network to find the shortest path without relying on pair information. Our approach outperforms existing methods in various tasks, as demonstrated through extensive experiments. The code can be found at https://github.com/Mid-Push/santa.
