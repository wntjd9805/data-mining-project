Conservation efforts can benefit greatly from monitoring animal behavior, as it provides valuable information about wildlife health, population status, and ecosystem function. However, the development of automated recognition systems for animal behavior is currently hindered by the lack of appropriately labeled datasets. Existing video datasets have limitations, as they do not classify animals according to established biological taxonomies, are too small for large-scale behavioral studies, and lack temporally localized annotations. To address these limitations, we introduce MammalNet, a new large-scale animal behavior dataset with taxonomy-guided annotations. MammalNet consists of over 18,000 videos totaling 539 hours, making it approximately ten times larger than the largest existing animal behavior dataset. It covers a wide range of mammal categories and captures 12 high-level animal behaviors studied in previous research. We establish three benchmarks on MammalNet for animal and behavior recognition, including standard recognition, compositional low-shot recognition, and behavior detection. Our dataset and code are publicly available at the provided link: https://mammal-net.github.io.
