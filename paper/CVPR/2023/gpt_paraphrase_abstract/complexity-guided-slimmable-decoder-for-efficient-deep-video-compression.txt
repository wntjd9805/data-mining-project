This study introduces a new approach for efficient deep video compression called the complexity-guided slimmable decoder (cgSlimDecoder) combined with skip-adaptive entropy coding (SaEC). The cgSlimDecoder uses new channel width selection modules to determine the optimal channel width for each convolution layer based on target complexity constraints. By optimizing the complexity-rate-distortion objective function, the cgSlimDecoder automatically allocates the appropriate number of parameters for different modules, allowing it to support multiple complexity levels with a single decoder. The SaEC further accelerates the entropy decoding process by skipping the coding for well-predicted elements in the feature maps. Experimental results show that the proposed methods can be integrated into popular video codecs (DVC, FVC, and DCVC) to significantly improve coding efficiency without sacrificing performance.
