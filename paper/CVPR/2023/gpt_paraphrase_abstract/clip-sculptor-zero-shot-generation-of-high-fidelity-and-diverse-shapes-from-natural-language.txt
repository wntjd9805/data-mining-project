Recent studies have shown that natural language can be utilized to create and modify 3D shapes. However, these approaches have limitations in terms of the quality and variety of shapes generated. To overcome these limitations, we propose CLIP-Sculptor, a method that generates high-quality and diverse 3D shapes without the need for paired (text, shape) data during training. CLIP-Sculptor employs a multi-resolution approach, starting with low-dimensional latent space generation and then upscaling to higher resolution to enhance shape fidelity. To enhance shape diversity, we utilize a discrete latent space, which is modeled using a transformer conditioned on CLIP's image-text embedding space. Additionally, we introduce a new variation of classifier-free guidance to improve the balance between accuracy and diversity. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CLIP-Sculptor outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.
