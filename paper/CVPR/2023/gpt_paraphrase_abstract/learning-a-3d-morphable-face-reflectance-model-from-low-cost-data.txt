This paper presents a novel approach to modeling non-Lambertian effects in 3D Morphable Face Models, specifically focusing on facial specularity. Previous studies have developed parametric models for diffuse and specular albedo using Light Stage data. However, these models alone cannot fully determine the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF). Furthermore, the requirement of Light Stage data poses challenges for researchers. In this study, we propose the first 3D morphable face reflectance model with spatially varying BRDF, using only low-cost publicly-available data. We incorporate linear shine weighting into parametric modeling to represent variations in specular intensity and shine across the face. To reconstruct the reflectance parameters from non-Light Stage data, we develop an inverse rendering algorithm, which is then used to train an initial morphable reflectance model. To improve the model's generalization capability and expressive power, we introduce an update-by-reconstruction strategy to fine-tune it on an in-the-wild dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves realistic rendering with plausible facial specularities. The released code can be accessed here.
