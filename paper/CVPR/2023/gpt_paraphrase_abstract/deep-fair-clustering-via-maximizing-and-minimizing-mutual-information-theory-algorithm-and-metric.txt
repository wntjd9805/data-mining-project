Fair clustering is a technique used to divide data into clusters while ensuring that sensitive attributes, such as gender, race, or RNA sequencing technique, do not dominate the clustering process. Although many recent works have achieved significant success in this area, most of them rely on heuristic approaches and lack a unified theory for algorithm design. This study aims to address this gap by introducing a mutual information theory for deep fair clustering and proposing a new algorithm called FCMI. The FCMI algorithm leverages the concept of mutual information to achieve four key characteristics in deep fair clustering: compact, balanced, and fair clusters, as well as informative features. Additionally, the study introduces a novel fair clustering metric based on information theory. Unlike existing evaluation metrics, this metric considers both clustering quality and fairness as a whole rather than separately. To evaluate the effectiveness of FCMI, experiments are conducted on six benchmarks, including a single-cell RNA-seq atlas, and compared against 11 state-of-the-art methods using five metrics.
