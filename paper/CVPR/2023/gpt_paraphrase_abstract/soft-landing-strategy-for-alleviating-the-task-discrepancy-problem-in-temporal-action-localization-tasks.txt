Temporal Action Localization (TAL) methods commonly face a task discrepancy problem when utilizing a pretrained snippet encoder trained on Trimmed Action Classification (TAC) tasks. Existing solutions to this problem, such as re-training the encoder or end-to-end fine-tuning, often come with a high memory and computation cost. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called Soft-Landing (SoLa) strategy. SoLa incorporates a lightweight neural network module on top of the frozen encoder to bridge the transferability gap between the pretrained encoder and downstream tasks. Additionally, we introduce an unsupervised training scheme for the SoLa module using inter-frame Similarity Matching, which eliminates the need for temporal annotations by using the frame interval as a supervisory signal. Experimental evaluation on various benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in mitigating the task discrepancy problem while maintaining computational efficiency.
