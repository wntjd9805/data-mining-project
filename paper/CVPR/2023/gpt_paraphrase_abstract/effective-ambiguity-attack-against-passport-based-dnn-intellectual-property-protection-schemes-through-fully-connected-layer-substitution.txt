The protection of valuable intellectual property assets, such as well-trained deep neural networks (DNNs), has become a significant concern due to the high cost of training these models. One method, called the passport-based approach, has been proposed as a secure solution against advanced attacks. However, in this study, we introduce a new and effective attack called the ambiguity attack, which successfully forges multiple valid passports using a small training dataset. By inserting a specially designed accessory block, we can achieve almost identical performance to the authorized passport, using less than 10% of the training data. Furthermore, our attack strategy can be extended to target other IP protection methods that rely on watermark embedding. We also discuss potential solutions to mitigate these attacks.
