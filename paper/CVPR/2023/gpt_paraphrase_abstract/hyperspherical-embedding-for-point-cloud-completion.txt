The point cloud completion task aims to predict complete shapes of objects from partial observations obtained from depth sensors. Previous approaches have used an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder extracts embeddings used as inputs for generating predictions from the decoder. However, these learned embeddings have sparse distribution in the feature space, resulting in poor generalization during testing. To overcome this, this study proposes a hyperspherical module that transforms and normalizes the embeddings to be on a unit hypersphere. This module decouples the magnitude and direction of the output embedding, optimizing only the directional information. The theoretical analysis shows that the hyperspherical embedding enables more stable training with a wider range of learning rates and more compact embedding distributions. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvement in point cloud completion for both single-task and multi-task learning, validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.
