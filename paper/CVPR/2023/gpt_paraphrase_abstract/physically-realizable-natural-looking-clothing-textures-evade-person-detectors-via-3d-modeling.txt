Recent research has focused on creating adversarial clothing to evade person detectors. However, existing methods are either limited to specific viewing angles or easily noticeable by humans. To address these limitations, we propose crafting adversarial texture for clothes using 3D modeling. Unlike rigid objects, clothes are non-rigid, which presents challenges in physical realization. To create natural-looking adversarial clothes that can evade person detectors from multiple angles, we introduce adversarial camouflage textures (AdvCaT) that resemble typical textures found in daily clothes, specifically camouflage textures. We employ the Voronoi diagram and Gumbel-softmax trick to parameterize the camouflage textures and optimize the parameters through 3D modeling. Additionally, we develop an efficient augmentation pipeline on 3D meshes by combining topologically plausible projection (TopoProj) and Thin Plate Spline (TPS) techniques to bridge the gap between digital and real-world objects. The resulting 3D texture pieces are printed on fabric materials and tailored into T-shirts and trousers. Experimental results demonstrate high success rates of these adversarial clothes in evading multiple detectors.
