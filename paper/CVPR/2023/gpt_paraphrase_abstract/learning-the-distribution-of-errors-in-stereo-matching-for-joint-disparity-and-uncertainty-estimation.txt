We introduce a novel loss function for deep stereo matching that simultaneously estimates disparity and uncertainty. Our motivation stems from the need for accurate uncertainty predictions and the observation that multi-task learning enhances performance across all tasks. To achieve this, we propose matching the uncertainty distribution with the distribution of disparity errors using a KL divergence term in the network's loss function. We employ a differentiable soft-histogramming technique to approximate the distributions for incorporation into the loss. Through experimental evaluation on extensive datasets, we demonstrate significant enhancements in both disparity and uncertainty prediction. The code for our approach is publicly available at https://github.com/lly00412/SEDNet.git.
