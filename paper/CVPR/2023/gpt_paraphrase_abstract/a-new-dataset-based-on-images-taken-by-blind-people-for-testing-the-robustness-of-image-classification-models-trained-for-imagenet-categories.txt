Our objective is to enhance the current practices in designing image classification models by improving their performance on images from different domains. In order to achieve this, we have introduced a novel dataset called VizWiz-Classification. This dataset consists of 8,900 images taken by visually impaired individuals, with accompanying metadata indicating the presence or absence of 200 ImageNet object categories. We compare this dataset to mainstream datasets used for evaluating the generalization capabilities of ImageNet-trained models. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of 100 ImageNet classification models on our new test dataset. Our detailed analysis reveals that these models struggle when dealing with images that have quality issues. To facilitate future research in this area, we have made our dataset available on an evaluation server at: https://vizwiz.org/tasks-and-datasets/image-classification.
