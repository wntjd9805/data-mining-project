The study focuses on backdoor attacks against neural networks, where the attacker compromises the integrity of the victim model to manipulate its predictions. Previous research proposed various stealthy backdoor attacks, such as using imperceptible perturbations or special image styles as triggers. However, these attacks are easily defeated by common preprocessing-based defenses and lack robustness. This paper introduces a novel color backdoor attack that is both robust and stealthy. The key idea is to shift the entire color space of an image uniformly as the trigger, which is resilient to image transformations and maintains a natural appearance. The optimal trigger is found by defining naturalness restrictions and using the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to search for it. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the color backdoor attack against different mainstream defenses.
