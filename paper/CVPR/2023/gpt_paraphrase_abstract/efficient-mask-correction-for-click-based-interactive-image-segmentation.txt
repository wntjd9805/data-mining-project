The objective of click-based interactive image segmentation is to extract target masks by using positive/negative clicks as input. Existing methods require running the entire segmentation network each time a new click is placed, which is inefficient as multiple clicks may be necessary to achieve satisfactory accuracy. In this study, we propose an efficient approach that utilizes a lightweight mask correction network to correct the mask. Our method ensures low computational cost even with a large backbone network, starting from the second click. However, a simple correction network with limited capacity is unlikely to achieve comparable performance to a traditional segmentation network. Therefore, we introduce a click-guided self-attention module and a click-guided correlation module to effectively leverage click information and enhance performance. These modules select templates based on semantic similarity with click features and propagate template information to other pixels through the self-attention module, while the correlation module uses templates to obtain target outlines directly. With our efficient architecture and two click-guided modules, our method demonstrates superior performance and efficiency compared to existing methods.
