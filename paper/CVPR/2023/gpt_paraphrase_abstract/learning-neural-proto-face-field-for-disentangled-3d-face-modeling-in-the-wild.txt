This paper introduces a new approach called Neural Proto-face Field (NPF) for robust 3D face modeling. Unlike existing generative models, NPF is able to handle extreme conditions such as pose, shadow, and appearance by disentangling facial cues and incorporating multi-view priors. NPF learns a face prototype that captures consistent identity information and extracts priors from a collection of in-the-wild photos. It then deforms the prototype to incorporate facial expressions while ensuring expression consistency and personal idiosyncrasies. Finally, NPF optimizes the model to fit a target image, recovering specific details of appearance and geometry. Experimental results demonstrate that NPF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of facial shape and texture recovery.
