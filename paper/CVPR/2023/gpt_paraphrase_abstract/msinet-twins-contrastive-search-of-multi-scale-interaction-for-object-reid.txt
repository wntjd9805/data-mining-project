Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is increasingly popular in the field of object Re-Identification (ReID) as it improves retrieval performance. However, previous studies overlook the differences in training approaches between ReID and image classification. To address this, we propose the Twins Contrastive Mechanism (TCM), which reduces category overlaps between training and validation data, providing more appropriate supervision for ReID architecture search. We also introduce the Multi-Scale Interaction (MSI) search space, which searches for rational interaction operations between multi-scale features. Additionally, we incorporate a Spatial Alignment Module (SAM) to enhance attention consistency when dealing with images from different sources. Our proposed NAS scheme automatically searches for a specific architecture named MSINet. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art ReID methods in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.
