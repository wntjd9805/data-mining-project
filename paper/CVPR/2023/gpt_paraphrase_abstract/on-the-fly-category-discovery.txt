While machines have surpassed humans in terms of visual recognition, they are limited to providing answers from a predefined set of categories. Unlike machines, humans have the ability to recognize and categorize new objects upon first observation. To bridge this gap, researchers have developed techniques known as novel category discovery (NCD) that transfer knowledge from known categories to identify unseen categories. However, current NCD methods operate under a transductive learning and offline inference paradigm, which means they can only work with a predefined query set and cannot provide instant feedback. This paper introduces a new approach called on-the-fly category discovery (OCD) that enables the model to instantly recognize and categorize novel samples, using inductive learning and streaming inference. The authors begin by designing a practical baseline model based on hash coding. However, they observe that hash codes are sensitive to variations within categories, leading to disturbances. To address this issue, they propose a new architecture called Sign-Magnitude dIsentangLEment (SMILE) that mitigates the problem. Experimental results show that SMILE outperforms the baseline model and previous approaches. The code for this research is available at the provided GitHub link.
