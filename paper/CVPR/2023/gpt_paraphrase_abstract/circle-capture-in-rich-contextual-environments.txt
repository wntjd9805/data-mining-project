However, conventional motion capture systems based on optics are not suitable for capturing both human movements and complex scenes simultaneously. The lack of comprehensive 3D human motion datasets hinders the development of high-quality human motion models. To address this, we propose a new motion acquisition system where the actor is immersed in a virtual world while being motion captured in the real world. This system allows for the quick collection of high-quality human motion in diverse scenes without concerns of occlusion or the need for physical scene construction. Our dataset, called CIRCLE, includes 10 hours of full-body reaching motion from 5 subjects in nine scenes, along with ego-centric information of the environment in various forms like RGBD videos. We utilized this dataset to train a model that generates human motion based on scene information. By leveraging our dataset, the model learns to use ego-centric scene information to accomplish complex reaching tasks in 3D scenes.
