This paper presents a new motion estimation framework for different motion models. It introduces a progressive event-to-map alignment approach that utilizes spatio-temporal correlations to align events. The framework aligns sampled events to a time-surface map and updates the motion model by minimizing a novel time-surface loss. It also applies a dynamic batch size strategy to adjust the batch size adaptively, ensuring consistency with the current motion model. The proposed framework offers three advantages: it iteratively refines motion parameters for accurate estimation, optimizes only a small portion of events within each iteration to reduce runtime, and maintains the constant velocity assumption through the dynamic batch size strategy. The framework is evaluated on challenging high-speed scenes with rotational, homography, and 6-DOF motion models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency.
