Detecting mirrors in static images has been extensively studied, but detecting mirrors in dynamic scenes is still a relatively unexplored area due to the lack of a high-quality dataset and an effective method for video mirror detection (VMD). This study is the first to address the VMD problem using a deep-learning-based approach. The researchers observe that there are often similarities between the contents inside a mirror and the real scene outside the mirror. However, these similarities may not always be present in every frame due to changes in camera pose. To overcome this challenge, they propose a method called VMD-Net, which can handle spatially missing correspondences by considering mirror correspondences within individual frames as well as across multiple frames using a dual correspondence module. They also introduce a large-scale dataset for VMD (VMD-D) containing 14,987 image frames from 269 videos with manually annotated masks. Experimental results demonstrate that their proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in related fields. Additionally, to enable real-time VMD, they optimize the method by removing redundant multi-level module design and eliminating post-processing steps commonly used in existing methods. This makes the method highly efficient and practical for real-time video-based applications. The code, dataset, and models are available at the provided link (https://jiaying.link/cvpr2023-vmd/).
