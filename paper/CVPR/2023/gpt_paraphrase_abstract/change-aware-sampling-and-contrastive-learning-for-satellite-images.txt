Automatic remote sensing tools have the potential to address various large-scale challenges like disaster management and climate change. However, a significant portion of the available satellite image data lacks labels, rendering it less useful for supervised learning algorithms. To overcome this limitation, self-supervised learning offers a solution by enabling the acquisition of effective representations for different tasks without relying on labels. In this study, we capitalize on the unique characteristics of satellite images to enhance self-supervised feature learning. Specifically, we utilize the temporal signal to compare images with long-term and short-term differences, taking advantage of the infrequent changes in satellite imagery. To this end, we introduce a novel loss function called Change-Aware Contrastive (CACo) Loss, which incorporates these characteristics. Additionally, we propose a new method for sampling diverse geographical regions. Our experiments demonstrate that leveraging these properties results in improved performance across various downstream tasks. For instance, our method achieves a 6.5% relative enhancement in semantic segmentation and an 8.5% relative improvement in change detection compared to the best-performing baseline.
