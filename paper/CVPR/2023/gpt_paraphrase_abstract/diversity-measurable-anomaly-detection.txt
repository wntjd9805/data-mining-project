Reconstruction-based anomaly detection models aim to suppress the ability to generalize anomalies, but this often leads to poor reconstruction of diverse normal patterns. Previous attempts at addressing this issue by modeling sample diversity have resulted in shortcut learning and the transmission of abnormal information. To address this tradeoff problem, we propose the Diversity-Measurable Anomaly Detection (DMAD) framework. Our approach incorporates the Pyramid Deformation Module (PDM), which models diverse normals and measures the severity of anomalies by estimating multi-scale deformation fields. By decoupling deformation from prototypical embedding and integrating an information compression module, PDM improves the reliability of the final anomaly score. We conducted experiments on surveillance videos and industrial images, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, DMAD performs well in the presence of contaminated data and anomaly-like normal samples.
