The paper proposes a geometry awareness model called GeoMVSNet for improving depth estimation in cascade Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods. Previous methods lacked the integration of geometric information from coarse stages, resulting in sub-optimal reconstruction results. To address this, GeoMVSNet incorporates geometric clues from coarse estimations to enhance feature extraction at finer stages. It also utilizes probability volumes and a lightweight regularization network to enhance depth-wise geometry intuition. Additionally, frequency domain filtering and curriculum learning are employed to mitigate the negative impact of high-frequency regions and progressively improve geometry integration. To enhance full-scene geometry perception, a depth distribution similarity loss based on the Gaussian-Mixture Model assumption is introduced. Experimental results on DTU and Tanks and Temples datasets demonstrate that GeoMVSNet achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first on the T&T-Advanced set.
