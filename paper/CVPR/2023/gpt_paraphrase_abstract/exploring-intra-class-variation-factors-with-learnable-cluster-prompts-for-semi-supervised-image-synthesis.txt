The conventional method for semi-supervised class-conditional image synthesis involves adding class labels to a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). However, this approach may not adequately capture the diverse visual characteristics of different classes. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a Learnable Cluster Prompt-based GAN (LCP-GAN) that leverages a broader range of supervision to capture class-wise characteristics and intra-class variation. To make use of partially labeled data, the authors perform soft partitioning for each class and explore the association between intra-class clusters and visual concepts in the feature space of a pre-trained language-vision model like CLIP. For generating class-conditional images, a cluster-conditional generator is designed by incorporating a combination of intra-class cluster label embeddings. Additionally, a real-fake classification head is added on top of CLIP to differentiate between real and synthesized instances based on the learnable cluster prompts. This approach enhances the generator with more semantic language supervision. LCP-GAN not only achieves superior generation capability but also matches the performance of fully supervised versions of the base models (BigGAN and StyleGAN2-ADA) on various standard benchmarks.
