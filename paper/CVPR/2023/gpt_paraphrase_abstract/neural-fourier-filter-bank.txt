We propose a new approach for efficient and detailed reconstructions by utilizing wavelets. Our method involves training a neural field that decomposes the signal both spatially and in terms of frequency. We adopt the grid-based spatial decomposition paradigm, but with a unique twist - we use Fourier features encodings to store specific frequencies in each grid. We then employ a multi-layer perceptron with sine activations, incorporating these Fourier encoded features at appropriate layers. This allows for sequential accumulation of higher-frequency components on top of lower-frequency components, which are summed up to generate the final output. Our experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses the current state of the art in terms of model compactness and convergence speed across various tasks, including 2D image fitting, 3D shape reconstruction, and neural radiance fields.
