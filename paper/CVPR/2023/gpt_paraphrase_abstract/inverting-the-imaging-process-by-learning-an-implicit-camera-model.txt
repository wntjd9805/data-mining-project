Implicit neural networks have become popular for representing visual signals in computer vision and graphics. However, existing implicit representations focus solely on modeling the scene, neglecting the imaging process of a camera. In this paper, we propose a novel implicit camera model that represents the physical imaging process using a deep neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on two inverse imaging tasks: generating all-in-focus photos and HDR imaging. To achieve this, we develop an implicit blur generator and an implicit tone mapper to model the camera's aperture and exposure. Our model is trained alongside implicit scene models using multi-focus stack and multi-exposure bracket supervision. Through extensive testing on images and videos, we show that our model produces accurate and visually appealing all-in-focus and high dynamic range images. Additionally, our implicit neural camera model has the potential to be useful in various other inverse imaging tasks.
