Most camera lens systems are traditionally designed separately from computer vision methods. However, recent advancements have shown that optimizing lenses together with other components, such as neural networks, can lead to better image quality and performance on vision tasks. Existing methods have limitations, as they only optimize a subset of lens parameters and cannot optimize the glass materials due to their categorical nature. In this study, we propose a differentiable spherical lens simulation model that accurately captures geometric aberrations. To overcome the challenges of lens design, which include non-convex loss function landscapes and manufacturing constraints, we introduce quantized continuous glass variables. These variables facilitate optimization and selection of glass materials in an end-to-end design context. We also incorporate carefully designed constraints to ensure manufacturability. In the field of automotive object detection, our approach demonstrates improved detection performance compared to existing designs, even when using simplified two- or three-element lenses that may result in degraded image quality.
