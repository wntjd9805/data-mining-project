This paper focuses on the problem of estimating optimal planes and sensor poses for depth sensors used in 3D reconstruction. The goal is to minimize the point-to-plane distance. The method used to solve this problem is called plane adjustment (PA), which is similar to bundle adjustment (BA) in visual reconstruction. Instead of using Newton's method, which is computationally complex for large-scale problems, an approximation method called Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) is commonly used. However, this paper proposes using Newton's method efficiently to solve the PA problem. By eliminating planes from the cost function, the number of variables is reduced. Additionally, this method ensures that the optimal planes for the current estimated poses can be obtained at each iteration, improving convergence. The challenge lies in efficiently computing the Hessian matrix and the gradient of the cost. The paper provides an efficient solution and empirical evaluation shows that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms.
