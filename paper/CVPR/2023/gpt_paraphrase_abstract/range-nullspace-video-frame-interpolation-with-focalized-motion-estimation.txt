This paper introduces a new framework for continuous-time video frame interpolation (VFI) in computer vision. VFI is a crucial technique for generating intermediate video frames and motion trajectories. However, accurately inferring intermediate motion and synthesizing high-quality frames pose significant challenges. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose two novel approaches.   Firstly, they introduce focalized trajectory fitting, which estimates motion trajectories by considering reliable optical flow candidates and suppressing outliers. This confidence-aware approach improves the accuracy of intermediate motion estimation.   Secondly, the authors propose range-nullspace synthesis, a new method for generating video frames. This approach treats frame synthesis as solving an ill-posed problem and involves learning decoupled components in orthogonal subspaces. By addressing this problem in a novel way, the authors achieve high-quality frame synthesis.  The proposed framework outperforms previous methods on 7 out of 10 public VFI benchmarks. This demonstrates its effectiveness and establishes new records in the field.
