Neural radiance fields (NeRF) face challenges in synthesizing novel views with sparse inputs. Previous methods have used external supervision or complex rendering techniques to address this challenge. In this paper, we propose a simple baseline called Frequency regularized NeRF (FreeNeRF) that outperforms previous methods with minimal modifications to NeRF. We analyze the challenges in few-shot neural rendering and identify the importance of frequency in NeRF's training. As a result, we introduce two regularization terms: one to regulate the frequency range of NeRF's inputs and another to penalize near-camera density fields. These techniques come at no additional computational cost. By making just one line of code change, the original NeRF can achieve similar performance to complex methods in the few-shot setting. FreeNeRF achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse datasets. We hope that this simple baseline will encourage a reevaluation of the role of frequency in NeRF's training, both in the low-data regime and beyond. The project is released at FreeNeRF.
