Spectral-type subspace clustering algorithms have demonstrated high performance in various subspace clustering applications. However, existing algorithms in this category primarily focus on creating constraints for the reconstruction coefficient matrix or utilizing feature extraction methods to identify underlying features in the data samples. This paper introduces a novel approach called adaptive graph convolutional subspace clustering (AGCSC), which combines the graph convolution technique with both feature extraction and coefficient matrix constraint. The proposed algorithm updates and adjusts the graph-convolutional operator iteratively and adaptively. By employing AGCSC, we argue that the aggregated feature representation of the original data samples becomes suitable for subspace clustering, and the coefficient matrix accurately reveals the subspace structure of the data set. Numerous experiments on subspace clustering validate our claims, showing that AGCSC outperforms related methods and deep models.
