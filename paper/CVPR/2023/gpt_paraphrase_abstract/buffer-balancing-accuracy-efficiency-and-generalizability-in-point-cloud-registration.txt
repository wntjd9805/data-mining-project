Creating an ideal framework for point cloud registration is a difficult task as existing techniques lack accuracy, efficiency, and generalizability. This paper introduces BUFFER, a method that aims to achieve a balance between these three elements. BUFFER combines point-wise and patch-wise techniques to overcome limitations. It includes a Point-wise Learner to enhance efficiency by predicting keypoints and estimating point orientations, a Patch-wise Embedder to extract efficient and general patch features, and an Inliers Generator to search for inlier correspondences. Experimental results demonstrate that BUFFER achieves high accuracy, efficiency, and generalization, outperforming other methods. The code for BUFFER is available at https://github.com/aosheng1996/BUFFER.
