The accuracy of instance segmentation involves counting objects, accurately localizing predictions, and classifying each prediction. Average Precision (AP) is the commonly used metric to evaluate these aspects. However, AP does not penalize duplicate predictions in the high-recall range and cannot differentiate between correctly localized but incorrectly categorized instances. This flaw has led to network designs that achieve high AP but also generate numerous false positives. Therefore, AP cannot be relied upon to select a model that balances false positives and high recall effectively.To address this issue, we examine alternative metrics in existing literature and propose two new measures to explicitly quantify both spatial and categorical duplicate predictions. Additionally, we suggest a Semantic Sorting and NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression) module that eliminates duplicates based on a pixel occupancy matching scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that modern segmentation networks yield significant AP improvements, but also produce a substantial number of duplicates. Our Semantic Sorting and NMS module can be easily incorporated as a plug-and-play component to reduce ambiguous predictions and maintain AP.
