This paper explores the use of robust image segmentation for privacy-preserving visual localization. The authors propose a new framework called SegLoc, which utilizes image segmentation to create compact and privacy-preserving 3D maps of scenes. They enhance the existing segmentation approach by incorporating discriminative clustering, consistency regularization terms, and joint learning of global and local image representations. In their localization pipeline, they use the global representation for image retrieval and the local representation to refine pose estimation by minimizing label inconsistency between the map's 3D points and their projection onto the query image. Through various experiments, the authors demonstrate that their proposed representation achieves close-to-state-of-the-art pose estimation results while ensuring that the 3D map does not contain sufficient information for an attacker to reconstruct personal details from the original images.
