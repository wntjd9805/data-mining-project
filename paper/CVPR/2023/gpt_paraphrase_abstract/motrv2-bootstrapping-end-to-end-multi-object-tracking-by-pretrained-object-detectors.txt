This paper introduces MOTRv2, a pipeline that enhances end-to-end multi-object tracking using a pretrained object detector. Existing methods like MOTR and TrackFormer have been less successful than tracking-by-detection approaches due to their inadequate detection performance. To address this, we propose an elegant modification to MOTR by incorporating an additional object detector. We utilize the anchor formulation of queries and generate proposals as anchors using the object detector, which improves detection prior to MOTR. This modification effectively resolves conflicts between joint learning detection and association tasks in MOTR. MOTRv2 retains the query propagation feature and performs well on large-scale benchmarks. In fact, it achieved first place (73.4% HOTA on DanceTrack) in the 1st Multiple People Tracking in Group Dance Challenge. Additionally, MOTRv2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BDD100K dataset. We believe that this simple yet effective pipeline can offer valuable insights to the end-to-end MOT community.
