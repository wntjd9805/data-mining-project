Image restoration techniques have been extensively researched for single degradations, yielding excellent results. However, these methods fail to address the complex and unpredictable nature of real-world environments where multiple degradations can occur simultaneously or change over time. Recent studies have explored image restoration for both known and unknown multiple degradations, but these approaches either require large networks or have sub-optimal architectures that do not effectively handle interference between different degradations. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive discriminative filter-based model for specific degradations (ADMS) inspired by the filter attribution integrated gradients (FAIG) technique. Our method allows the network to have dedicated filters for each degradation, comprising only a small fraction of the total network parameters. These filters are applied adaptively using degradation classification (DC), which explicitly separates the network for different degradations. Through comparison studies, our proposed method has demonstrated its effectiveness and achieved state-of-the-art performance in benchmark datasets for all-in-one image restoration, including Rain-Noise-Blur and Rain-Snow-Haze.
