The analysis of reflections on shiny objects can provide valuable and hidden information about the surrounding environment. By transforming these objects into cameras, we can unlock various applications such as capturing images from angles that are normally inaccessible to conventional cameras, including reflections on the human eye. However, this task is difficult due to the influence of multiple factors, including the object's shape, material properties, the three-dimensional environment, and the viewer's perspective. Our method aims to convert glossy objects with unknown shapes into radiance-field cameras, allowing us to capture the world from the object's point of view. Our key insight is to treat the object's surface as a virtual sensor that records the reflected light as a two-dimensional representation of the five-dimensional radiance field surrounding the object. By recovering the radiance fields of the environment, we can estimate the depth and radiance of both the object and its surroundings, as well as generate novel views that are only visible to the glossy object in the scene. Additionally, our approach enables imaging around occlusions caused by nearby objects. We train our method end-to-end using multiple views of the object, and it jointly estimates the object's geometry, diffuse radiance, and the five-dimensional radiance field of the environment.
