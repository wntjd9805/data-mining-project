This paper introduces PCT-Net, a straightforward and versatile image harmonization technique that can be easily applied to full-resolution images. The main concept involves training a parameter network using downsampled input images to predict parameters for pixel-wise color transforms (PCTs) that are then applied to each pixel in the full-resolution image. The study demonstrates that affine color transforms are both efficient and effective, producing harmonization results that are at the forefront of the field. Additionally, the researchers explore the use of both CNNs and Transformers as the parameter network, finding that Transformers yield superior outcomes. The proposed method is evaluated on the publicly available full-resolution iHarmony4 dataset, composed of four datasets, and exhibits a reduction of more than 20% in foreground MSE (fMSE) and MSE values, along with a 1.4dB increase in the PSNR value. Remarkably, the method achieves these results while maintaining a lightweight architecture. A user study involving 20 participants confirms that the method outperforms two other recent methods, as demonstrated by a higher B-T score.
