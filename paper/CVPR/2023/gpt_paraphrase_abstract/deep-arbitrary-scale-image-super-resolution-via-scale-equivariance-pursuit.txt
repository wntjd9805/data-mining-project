This study introduces two new modules within a transformer-style framework to improve the performance of arbitrary-scale image super-resolution (ASISR). These modules, namely the Adaptive Feature Extractor and the Neural Kriging upsampling operator, enhance the representation learning and spatial feature fusion processes. The proposed modules can be easily integrated into various stages of a super-resolution network. Additionally, a pre-training strategy is employed to further boost the model's performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior scale-equivariance capability of the proposed modules and learning framework compared to state-of-the-art methods for super-resolution at arbitrary scales.
