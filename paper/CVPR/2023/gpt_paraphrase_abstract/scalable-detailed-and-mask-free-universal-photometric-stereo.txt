This paper introduces SDM-UniPS, a revolutionary Photometric Stereo network called SDM-UniPS that is Scalable, Detailed, Mask-free, and Universal. The network is capable of producing highly detailed surface normal maps comparable to those generated by 3D scanners, even when images are taken in uncontrolled environments with unknown and varying lighting conditions. The authors have improved upon previous universal photometric stereo networks by incorporating spatial-light features and considering non-local interactions among surface points. Additionally, they have created a new synthetic training dataset that covers a wide range of shapes, materials, and illumination scenarios found in real-world scenes. Extensive evaluation shows that SDM-UniPS outperforms calibrated, lighting-specific techniques on public benchmarks and achieves excellent results with a smaller number of input images, even without object masks.
