The proposed SQUID system utilizes Space-aware Memory Queues to analyze radiography images and detect anomalies. By identifying recurrent patterns in anatomical structures, SQUID is able to classify and detect unseen or modified patterns in the images. In comparison to 13 other methods, SQUID outperforms them in unsupervised anomaly detection on two chest X-ray benchmark datasets, as measured by the Area Under the Curve. Furthermore, a new dataset called DigitAnatomy has been created to encourage the advancement, evaluation, and interpretability of anomaly detection methods in relation to spatial correlation and consistent shape in chest anatomy.
