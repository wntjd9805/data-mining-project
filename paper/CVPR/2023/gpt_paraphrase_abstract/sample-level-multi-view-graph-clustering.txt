We propose a new approach for multi-view clustering that addresses several challenges in existing methods. Previous algorithms do not consider the topological structure of data, which is important for clustering on a manifold. Additionally, they do not fully explore the consistency of local structures between different views. In this paper, we learn the topological structure of data to exploit the implied data manifold. We also consider that the consistency of multiple views is generally similar, while inconsistent structures are the minority. To better maintain cross-view consistency, we explore the intersections of multiple views at the sample level. We present a unified framework and an efficient algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Experimental results on various multi-view datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority over other state-of-the-art approaches.
