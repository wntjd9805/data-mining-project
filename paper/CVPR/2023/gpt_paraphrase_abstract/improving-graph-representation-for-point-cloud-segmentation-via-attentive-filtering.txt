Self-attention networks have shown impressive results in point cloud segmentation by effectively modeling long-range dependencies. However, graph convolutions have proven to be better at capturing local geometry information with lower computational cost. In this study, we propose a hybrid architecture called AF-GCN that combines graph convolutions and self-attention mechanisms. We utilize graph convolutions to aggregate local features in the shallow encoder stages, while introducing a self-attention-like module called GAF in the deeper stages to better capture long-range contexts from distant neighbors. Additionally, we employ a Spatial Feature Projection (SFP) module to improve graph representation for point cloud segmentation, allowing for better handling of spatial variations in unstructured point clouds. Furthermore, we introduce a graph-shared down-sampling and up-sampling strategy to fully utilize the graph structures in point cloud processing. We evaluate our AF-GCN on multiple datasets, including S3DIS, ScanNetV2, Toronto-3D, and ShapeNetPart, and our experimental results demonstrate competitive performance.
