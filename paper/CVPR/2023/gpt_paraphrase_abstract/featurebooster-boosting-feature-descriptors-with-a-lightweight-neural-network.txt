We present a lightweight network that enhances descriptors of keypoints within the same image. The network takes original descriptors and the geometric properties of keypoints as input, utilizing an MLP-based self-boosting stage and a Transformer-based cross-boosting stage to improve the descriptors. The boosted descriptors can be either real-valued or binary. We apply the proposed network to enhance both hand-crafted (ORB, SIFT) and state-of-the-art learning-based descriptors (SuperPoint, ALIKE), and evaluate their performance in image matching, visual localization, and structure-from-motion tasks. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in all tasks, particularly in challenging scenarios like varying illumination or repetitive patterns. The computational requirements of our method are low, with processing times of 3.2ms on desktop GPU and 27ms on embedded GPU for 2000 features. This makes our method suitable for practical systems. The code and trained weights are publicly available on GitHub at github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/FeatureBooster.
