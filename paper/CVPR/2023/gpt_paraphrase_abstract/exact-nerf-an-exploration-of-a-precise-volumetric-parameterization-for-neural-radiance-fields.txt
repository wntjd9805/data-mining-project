Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have gained significant attention for their precise synthesis of novel scene views. However, the current method of sampling points along a narrow ray can lead to ambiguous representations and rendering artifacts like aliasing. A recent variant called mip-NeRF addresses this problem by using an Integrated Positional Encoding (IPE) based on a conical view frustum. However, mip-NeRF approximates this integral using a multivariate Gaussian distribution, which is reliable for short frustums but fails for elongated regions, especially when dealing with distant objects.To overcome these limitations, we propose a new approach called Exact-NeRF. Instead of using an approximated conical-based formulation, we utilize a pyramid-based integral formulation to calculate the IPE accurately. Our method represents the first analytical solution for the IPE within the NeRF domain. Our experiments demonstrate that Exact-NeRF matches the accuracy of mip-NeRF while offering a natural extension to more challenging scenarios, such as unbounded scenes. By addressing the unexplored issues of frustum approximation in previous NeRF work and providing insight into potential future extensions, our contribution aims to advance the field of NeRF research.
