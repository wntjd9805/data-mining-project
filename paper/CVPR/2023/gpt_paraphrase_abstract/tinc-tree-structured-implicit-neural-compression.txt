The abstract discusses the use of Implicit Neural Representation (INR) as a data compression technique for target scenes. While INR has the advantage of using a small number of parameters to accurately describe scenes, it has a limited spectrum coverage and struggles to effectively remove redundancy in complex data. Current studies can only exploit either global or local correlation in the data, resulting in limited performance. To address these limitations, the paper proposes a Tree-structured Implicit Neural Compression (TINC) approach. TINC conducts compact representation for local regions and extracts shared features in a hierarchical manner. It uses Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) to fit partitioned local regions and organizes these MLPs in a tree structure to share parameters based on spatial distance. This parameter sharing scheme ensures continuity between adjacent regions and removes both local and non-local redundancy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TINC improves the compression fidelity of INR and outperforms commercial tools and other deep learning methods. Additionally, TINC is highly flexible and can be customized for different data and parameter settings. The source code for TINC can be accessed at https://github.com/RichealYoung/TINC.
