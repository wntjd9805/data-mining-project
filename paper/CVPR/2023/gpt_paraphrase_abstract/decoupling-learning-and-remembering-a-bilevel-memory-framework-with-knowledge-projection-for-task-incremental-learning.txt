We propose a solution to the challenge of balancing plasticity and stability in incremental learning by introducing a Bilevel Memory system with Knowledge Projection (BMKP). This system is inspired by the multi-level memory structure of the human memory system. BMKP separates the functions of learning and remembering by using a working memory for adaptively modeling learning and a long-term memory for enduringly storing the knowledge incorporated within the learned model. To address the issue of extracting learned knowledge from the working memory and assimilating it into the long-term memory, we discover that the parameters learned by the working memory exist in a redundant high-dimensional space, while the knowledge incorporated in the model can be represented compactly under a group of pattern basis shared by all incremental learning tasks. Hence, we propose a knowledge projection process to dynamically maintain the shared basis, allowing the loosely organized model knowledge of the working memory to be projected into a compact representation for storage in the long-term memory. We evaluate the performance of BMKP on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet datasets and find that it achieves state-of-the-art performance while utilizing less memory.
