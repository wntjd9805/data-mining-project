The challenge of scale variation in object detection remains a significant issue, especially in semi-supervised scenarios. Current methods rely on strict conditions to filter high-quality pseudo labels, but this approach lacks positive supervision for objects with extreme scales. To address this problem, we propose a new framework that includes a mixed scale teacher to improve pseudo label generation and scale-invariant learning. We also introduce a method for mining pseudo labels using score promotion, which benefits from better predictions using mixed scale features. Our experiments on MS COCO and PASCAL VOC datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in various semi-supervised settings.
