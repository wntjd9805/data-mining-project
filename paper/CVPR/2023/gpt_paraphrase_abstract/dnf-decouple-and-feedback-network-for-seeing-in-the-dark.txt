The limitations of existing architectures in low-light image enhancement have hindered the performance of methods that utilize RAW data. These limitations include the domain ambiguity caused by mixed mapping across different domains and the neglect of valuable features in lossy image-level dataflow by multi-stage methods. To address these issues, we propose a solution called the Decouple aNd Feedback (DNF) framework. DNF decouples domain-specific subtasks and fully utilizes the unique properties of RAW and sRGB domains to mitigate domain ambiguity. It also incorporates a feedback mechanism for feature propagation across stages to prevent information loss. Our method significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with only 19% of the parameters, achieving substantial improvements in PSNR on the Sony and Fuji subsets of SID.
