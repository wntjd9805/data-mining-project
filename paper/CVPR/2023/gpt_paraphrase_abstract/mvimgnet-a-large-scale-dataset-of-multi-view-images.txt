Deep learning algorithms are known for being data-driven, and the use of large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet, has greatly influenced computer vision tasks. However, there is currently no equivalent dataset for 3D vision. To address this gap, we introduce MVImgNet, a large-scale dataset of multi-view images that can be easily obtained by shooting videos of real-world objects. MVImgNet contains 6.5 million frames from 219,188 videos, covering 238 object classes, and includes annotations for object masks, camera parameters, and point clouds. The multi-view nature of the dataset provides 3D-aware signals, making it a bridge between 2D and 3D vision. We conducted pilot studies to explore the potential of MVImgNet in various 3D and 2D visual tasks, such as radiance field reconstruction, multi-view stereo, and view-consistent image understanding. The results show promising performance and open up possibilities for future research. Additionally, we derived a 3D object point cloud dataset called MVPNet through dense reconstruction on MVImgNet. MVPNet includes 87,200 samples from 150 categories, with class labels for each point cloud. Experiments demonstrate that MVPNet can improve real-world 3D object classification while presenting new challenges for point cloud understanding. Both MVImgNet and MVPNet will be made publicly available to inspire the wider vision community.
