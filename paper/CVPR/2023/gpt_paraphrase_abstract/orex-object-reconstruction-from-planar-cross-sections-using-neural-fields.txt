Reconstructing 3D shapes from planar cross-sections is a difficult task that is important for applications in medical imaging and geographic informatics. Typically, the input consists of a function that indicates whether a point is inside or outside the shape, defined on a sparse set of planes in space. The goal is to interpolate this function to obtain a complete volume representation of the shape. Existing methods for this problem often produce low quality results or rely on additional information such as target topology or appearance. In this paper, we propose a new method called OReX for 3D shape reconstruction from slices alone. Our approach uses a Neural Field as an interpolation prior, where a neural network is trained to estimate the inside/outside status of a given 3D coordinate based on the input planes. This neural prior promotes smoothness and self-similarities in the reconstructed shape. However, the neural prior tends to oversmooth high-frequency details, so we introduce an iterative estimation architecture and a hierarchical input sampling scheme to address this issue. These techniques allow the training process to focus on capturing high-frequency details in later stages. We also identify and analyze a ripple-like effect that occurs during the mesh extraction step of the reconstruction process. To mitigate this effect, we regularize the spatial gradients of the indicator function around input boundaries during network training. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that our method is robust, accurate, and scalable to larger input sizes. We achieve state-of-the-art results compared to previous approaches and show the effectiveness of our contributions through analysis and ablation studies.
