Interactive image segmentation is a process that involves obtaining a segmentation mask for an image by incorporating user annotations. In this process, the feedback from previous rounds of interaction is utilized to guide the user's annotations and provide valuable prior information for the segmentation model. However, existing methods tend to overlook the significance of feedback or simply concatenate it with the original input, resulting in underutilization of feedback and an increased need for annotations. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach called Focused and Collaborative Feedback Integration (FCFI) that maximizes the utilization of feedback for click-based interactive image segmentation. FCFI begins by focusing on the local area surrounding the new click and adjusting the feedback based on the similarities of high-level features. It then iteratively updates both the feedback and deep features in a collaborative manner to effectively integrate the feedback into the features. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of FCFI, we conducted experiments on four benchmark datasets: GrabCut, Berkeley, SBD, and DAVIS. The experimental results demonstrate that FCFI achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring less computational overhead compared to previous methods. For a visual representation of our approach, we provide Figure 1, which illustrates the interactive system and compares the independent segmentation method, feedback-as-input segmentation method, and our deep feedback-integrated segmentation method. In this figure, the green and red clicks represent foreground and background annotations, respectively.To further assist researchers and practitioners in implementing our approach, we have made the source code available at https://github.com/veizgyauzgyauz/FCFI.
