The task of intrinsic image decomposition (IID) involves breaking down a natural image into albedo and shade. This task is typically solved using supervised learning methods, but this approach is not ideal because it is difficult to obtain ground truth albedo and shade in general scenes. On the other hand, unsupervised learning methods are currently not as effective as supervised learning methods due to the lack of criteria for solving the ill-posed problems. To address this issue, we propose unsupervised IID with the utilization of LiDAR, specifically LiDAR intensity. However, simply inputting LiDAR intensity is not effective because conventional unsupervised learning methods rely on image-to-image transformations. To overcome this, we introduce an intensity consistency loss that calculates the error between LiDAR intensity and gray-scaled albedo, providing a criterion for the ill-posed problem. Additionally, LiDAR intensity is challenging to handle due to its sparsity and occlusion, so we propose a LiDAR intensity densification module. We evaluated the quality of our estimations using our own dataset, which includes RGB images, LiDAR intensity, and human annotations. The results show that our approach achieves estimation accuracy that surpasses conventional unsupervised learning methods.
