Traditional methods of 3D shape reconstruction rely on identifying object features or textures in multiple images of the subject. However, these methods are not effective when the subject is semi-transparent and constantly changing focus. In this study, we address these challenges by using adaptive blurring and transparency to render a candidate shape for comparison with the images. We use the microscopic nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a case study, as it freely moves in a 3D fluid with changing optical properties. We model the worm as a 3D curve and develop a differentiable renderer to construct images from 2D projections. We compare these rendered images against the raw images and use gradient descent to update the curve, camera, and renderer parameters. Our method is robust to interference, such as bubbles and dirt in the fluid, and remains consistent through complex sequences of postures. It also provides reliable estimates from blurry images and outperforms previous attempts to track C. elegans in 3D. These findings demonstrate the potential of direct approaches to shape estimation in complex physical environments without relying on ground-truth data.
