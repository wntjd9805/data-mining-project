This paper explores a new aspect of sketches, demonstrating that they are not only useful in various visual understanding tasks but also inherently salient. The authors aim to investigate how sketches can be utilized as a weak label to identify salient objects in an image. They propose a novel method that focuses on explaining the concept of a "salient object" through hand-drawn sketches. The approach involves a photo-to-sketch generation model that generates sequential sketch coordinates using a 2D attention mechanism. The accumulation of attention maps over time steps highlights salient regions. The authors conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments, which support their hypothesis and demonstrate that their sketch-based saliency detection model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.
