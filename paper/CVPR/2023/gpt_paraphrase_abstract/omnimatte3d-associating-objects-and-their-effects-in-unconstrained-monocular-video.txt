We present a novel approach for decomposing videos into a background and foreground layers, capturing stationary elements and moving objects respectively, including their associated effects. Unlike previous methods, our approach is applicable to unconstrained monocular videos with arbitrary camera and object motion. Instead of mapping the video onto a fixed 2D canvas, we utilize recent advancements in monocular camera pose and depth estimation to generate a complete RGBD video layer for the background and individual video layers for each foreground object. To address the issue of underconstrained decomposition, we propose a new loss formulation based on multi-view consistency. Our method is evaluated on challenging videos with complex camera motion and demonstrates significant qualitative improvement compared to existing approaches.
