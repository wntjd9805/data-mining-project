A new approach to object recognition has been developed through semantic correspondence. However, the current method of matching single objects is insufficient for identifying similarities within a category and falls short in real-world recognition tasks. To address this issue, we propose a multi-instance semantic correspondence task that aims to establish correspondence between multiple objects in pairs of images. To support this task, we create a dataset called MISC210K, which is derived from the COCO Detection 2017 task. The dataset is constructed through three steps: selecting categories and cleaning the data, designing keypoints based on 3D models and object description rules, and conducting collaborative annotation by humans and machines. Through this process, we select 34 object classes and annotate 4,812 challenging images using a semi-automatic workflow, resulting in 218,179 image pairs with annotated instance masks and instance-level keypoint pairs. We design a dual-path collaborative learning pipeline to train both the instance-level co-segmentation task and the fine-grained level correspondence task simultaneously. Benchmark evaluation and detailed analysis, along with suggestions for future directions, are provided. Our project is publicly available on https://github.com/YXSUNMADMAX/MISC210K.
