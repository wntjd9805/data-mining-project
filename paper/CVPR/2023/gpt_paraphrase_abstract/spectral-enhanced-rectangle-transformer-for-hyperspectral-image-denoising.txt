Denoising is a critical step in hyperspectral image (HSI) applications. Existing HSI denoising methods that utilize deep learning have limitations in capturing non-local self-similarity. Transformers have shown promise in capturing long-range dependencies, but there have been few attempts to specifically design a Transformer for modeling the spatial and spectral correlation in HSIs.To address these issues, we propose a spectral enhanced rectangle Transformer. This Transformer explores the non-local spatial similarity and global spectral low-rank property of HSIs. We accomplish this by using rectangle self-attention horizontally and vertically to capture non-local similarity in the spatial domain. Additionally, we design a spectral enhancement module that extracts the global underlying low-rank property of spatial-spectral cubes to suppress noise while enabling interactions among non-overlapping spatial rectangles.We conducted extensive experiments on synthetic noisy HSIs and real noisy HSIs to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The results demonstrate the superiority of our approach in terms of both objective metrics and subjective visual quality.The code for our method is available at https://github.com/MyuLi/SERT.
