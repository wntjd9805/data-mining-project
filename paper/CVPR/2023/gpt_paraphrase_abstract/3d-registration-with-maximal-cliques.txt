This paper introduces a novel method called Maximal Cliques (MAC) for 3D point cloud registration (PCR) in computer vision. The main idea is to relax the previous maximum clique constraint and extract more local consensus information from a graph to generate accurate pose hypotheses. The method involves the following steps: 1) Construction of a compatibility graph to establish the affinity relationship between initial correspondences. 2) Identification of maximal cliques in the graph, where each clique represents a consensus set. Node-guided clique selection is performed, with each node corresponding to the maximal clique with the highest graph weight. 3) Computation of transformation hypotheses for the selected cliques using the SVD algorithm. The best hypothesis is then used for registration. Extensive experiments conducted on U3M, 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and KITTI datasets demonstrate that MAC significantly improves registration accuracy compared to various state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, when combined with deep-learned methods, MAC achieves a state-of-the-art registration recall of 95.7% on 3DMatch and 78.9% on 3DLoMatch.
