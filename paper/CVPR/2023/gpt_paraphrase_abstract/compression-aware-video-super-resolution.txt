Videos stored on mobile devices or delivered on the Internet are typically compressed and have unknown compression parameters. This creates a performance gap between ideal inputs assumed by most video super-resolution (VSR) methods and real-world applications. While some recent works have attempted to super-resolve compressed videos, they do not adequately handle videos with varying levels of compression. In this paper, we propose a novel and practical compression-aware video super-resolution model that can adapt its enhancement process based on the estimated compression level. We design a compression encoder to model the compression levels of input frames, and a base VSR model is conditioned on the computed representation by incorporating compression-aware modules. Additionally, we leverage the embedded meta data in compressed video streams for information fusion, further strengthening the VSR model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method on compressed VSR benchmarks. The source code is available at https://github.com/aprBlue/CAVSR.
