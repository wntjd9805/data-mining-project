We present a new approach for 3D reconstruction of digital humans that combines the occupancy field, albedo field, and visibility field. This approach addresses the challenges of occlusion ambiguity and self-shadowed relighting. To improve training efficiency, we discretize visibility and incorporate it with geometric 3D depth and local 2D image features. We also introduce a new rendering-inspired loss called TransferLoss, which ensures alignment between visibility and occupancy. Our method outperforms existing techniques in terms of reconstruction accuracy and achieves comparable results to ray-traced ground truth in relighting.
