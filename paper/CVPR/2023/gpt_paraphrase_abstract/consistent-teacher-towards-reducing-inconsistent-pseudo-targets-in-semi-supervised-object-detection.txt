This study focuses on addressing the issue of inconsistent pseudo targets in semi-supervised object detection (SSOD). The researchers found that these oscillating pseudo targets can hinder the training of an accurate detector by introducing noise and causing overfitting problems. To address this, they propose a solution called Consistent-Teacher, which consists of three components.The first component is adaptive anchor assignment (ASA), which replaces the static IoU-based strategy. ASA helps the student network become resistant to noisy pseudo-bounding boxes. The second component is a 3D feature alignment module (FAM-3D) that calibrates the subtask predictions. FAM-3D allows each classification feature to dynamically query the optimal feature vector for the regression task at different scales and locations. The last component is a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) that dynamically adjusts the score threshold of pseudo-bounding boxes. This helps stabilize the number of ground truths at an early stage of training and improves the reliability of the supervision signal. The Consistent-Teacher approach achieves strong results in various SSOD evaluations. With a ResNet-50 backbone and only 10% of annotated MS-COCO data, it achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 40.0, surpassing previous methods that used pseudo labels by around 3 mAP. When trained on fully annotated MS-COCO data with additional unlabeled data, the performance further increases to 47.7 mAP.
