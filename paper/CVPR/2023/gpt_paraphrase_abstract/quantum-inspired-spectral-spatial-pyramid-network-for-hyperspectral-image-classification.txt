Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is the process of assigning labels to pixels in order to categorize different land covers. Traditional deep learning models have been used for HSI classification, but with the emergence of quantum computers, there is potential for a new paradigm in designing these models. In this study, we propose a quantum-inspired spectral-spatial network (QSSN) for HSI feature extraction. The QSSN consists of a phase-prediction module (PPM) and a measurement-like fusion module (MFM) inspired by quantum theory to fuse spectral and spatial information. The QSSN uses a quantum representation to represent the HSI data and extracts joint spectral-spatial features using the MFM. Building upon the QSSN, we introduce an end-to-end quantum-inspired spectral-spatial pyramid network (QSSPN) for HSI feature extraction and classification. The QSSPN progressively learns feature representations through cascading QSSN blocks and performs classification using a softmax classifier. This is the first attempt to incorporate quantum theory into the design of HSI processing models. Extensive experiments are conducted on three HSI datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed QSSPN framework over existing methods.
