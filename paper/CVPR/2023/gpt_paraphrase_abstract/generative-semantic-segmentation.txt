We introduce Generative Semantic Segmentation (GSS), a novel approach to semantic segmentation using generative learning. In our method, we view semantic segmentation as an image-based mask generation problem instead of traditional per-pixel discriminative learning. This is achieved by employing a latent prior learning process instead. We model the variational posterior distribution of latent variables given the segmentation mask, which is expressed using a special image format called "maskige". This posterior distribution enables the unconditional generation of segmentation masks. To perform semantic segmentation on a given image, we incorporate a conditioning network that is trained to minimize the divergence between the posterior distribution of maskige (segmentation masks) and the latent prior distribution of input training images. Through extensive experiments on established benchmarks, we demonstrate that our GSS approach achieves competitive performance compared to existing methods in standard semantic segmentation tasks and sets a new state of the art in the more challenging cross-domain scenario.
