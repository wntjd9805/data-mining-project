We propose a unique teacher-student model for semi-supervised multi-organ segmentation. Typically, data augmentation is used on unlabeled data in teacher-student models to ensure consistent training between the teacher and student. However, we recognize that the fixed relative locations and variable sizes of different organs in a multi-organ CT scan can provide valuable distribution information. Therefore, we leverage the prior anatomy as a guide for data augmentation, aiming to reduce the mismatch between labeled and unlabeled images in semi-supervised learning. Our approach involves a data augmentation strategy called partition-and-recovery N3 cubes, which is applied to both labeled and unlabeled images. This strategy encourages unlabeled images to learn organ semantics based on the relative locations provided by the labeled images (cross-branch) and improves the learning ability for small organs (within-branch). Additionally, for within-branch, we refine the quality of pseudo labels by blending the learned representations from small cubes to incorporate local attributes. Our method, named MagicNet, treats the CT volume as a magic cube, with the N3 cube partition-and-recovery process resembling the rules of playing a magic cube. We conducted extensive experiments on two public CT multi-organ datasets, which demonstrated the effectiveness of MagicNet. Notably, MagicNet outperformed state-of-the-art semi-supervised medical image segmentation approaches, achieving a 7% improvement in Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) on the MACT dataset with only 10% labeled images.
