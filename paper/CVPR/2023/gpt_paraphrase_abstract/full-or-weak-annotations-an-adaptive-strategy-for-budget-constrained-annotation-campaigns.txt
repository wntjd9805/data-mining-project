Annotating new datasets for machine learning tasks is a time-consuming and expensive process. This is especially true for segmentation applications, where manual delineations of relevant image content can be extremely costly or require domain-specific expertise. However, recent advancements in transfer learning and training with weak supervision have allowed segmentation models to benefit from different types of annotations. Despite this, determining how to distribute full segmentation and other weak annotations for a new domain application remains a challenge. There is no prior knowledge on how to allocate an annotation budget for a given dataset. In response to this, we propose a new approach to determine annotation strategies for segmentation datasets. Our method involves estimating the proportion of segmentation and classification annotations to collect based on a fixed budget. We accomplish this by modeling the expected improvement of the final segmentation model. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that our approach produces annotations that perform nearly as well as the optimal solution for various annotation budgets and datasets.
