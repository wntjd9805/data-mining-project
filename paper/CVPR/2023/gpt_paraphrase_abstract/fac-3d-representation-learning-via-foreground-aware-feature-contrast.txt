Contrastive learning has shown promise in unsupervised pre-training for 3D scene understanding tasks. However, current methods tend to favor background points and neglect object awareness and foreground-to-background discrimination. To address these issues, we propose a foreground-aware feature contrast (FAC) framework. FAC includes two novel contrast designs: building positive pairs within the same foreground segment and encouraging foreground-to-background distinctions. Our approach effectively captures correspondences among foreground regions during pre-training, leading to superior knowledge transfer and data efficiency in downstream tasks such as 3D semantic segmentation and object detection. All codes, data, and models are provided.
