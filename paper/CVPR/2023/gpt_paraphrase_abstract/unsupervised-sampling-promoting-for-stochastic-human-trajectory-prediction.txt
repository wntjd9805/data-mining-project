To address the challenge of predicting human motion accurately, trajectory prediction systems often use probabilistic models. These models are crucial for capturing the multi-modality phenomenon and inferring a limited set of potential future trajectories. However, existing methods rely on Monte Carlo random sampling for inference, which falls short in covering realistic paths due to the long tail effect of the predicted distribution. To enhance the sampling process in stochastic prediction, we propose a new approach called BOsampler. This method leverages Bayesian optimization to adaptively mine potential paths in an unsupervised manner. The sequential design strategy of BOsampler ensures that each new prediction depends on previously drawn samples. In our approach, trajectory sampling is modeled as a Gaussian process, and an acquisition function is constructed to measure the value of potential samples. This acquisition function utilizes the original distribution as a prior and encourages exploration of paths in the long-tail region. Importantly, this sampling technique can be seamlessly integrated into existing stochastic predictive models without the need for retraining. Experimental results using various baseline methods demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. To facilitate further research, we have released the source code for BOsampler, which can be accessed through the provided link.
