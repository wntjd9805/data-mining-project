This paper presents the Implicit Diffusion Model (IDM), a novel approach for high-fidelity continuous image super-resolution. Current super-resolution methods often suffer from over-smoothing and artifacts, and are limited to fixed magnifications. IDM addresses these limitations by integrating an implicit neural representation and a denoising diffusion model in an end-to-end framework. The implicit neural representation is used in the decoding process to learn continuous-resolution representation. Additionally, the authors propose a scale-adaptive conditioning mechanism that includes a low-resolution conditioning network and a scaling factor. The scaling factor regulates the resolution and balances the influence of low-resolution information and generated features in the final output, allowing the model to accommodate continuous-resolution requirements. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of IDM and demonstrate its superior performance compared to previous methods. The source code for IDM is available at https://github.com/Ree1s/IDM.
