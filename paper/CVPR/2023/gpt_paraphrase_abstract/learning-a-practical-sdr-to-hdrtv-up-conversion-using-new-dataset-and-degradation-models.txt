The demand for SDR-to-HDRTV up-conversion has increased in the media industry as users now possess HDR-WCG TVs while most available footage is still in SDR. Current learning-based approaches in the research community have been employed to tackle this task. However, when applied to real SDR footage, these methods tend to produce dim and desaturated results, offering little improvement to the viewing experience. This deficiency is attributed to the training set (HDR-SDR pair) used. To address this issue, we propose a new HDRTV dataset called HDRTV4K and introduce new HDR-to-SDR degradation models. We train a luminance-segmented network (LSN) consisting of a global mapping trunk and two Transformer branches that focus on the bright and dark luminance range. We also update the assessment criteria by using tailored metrics and conducting subjective experiments. Ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
