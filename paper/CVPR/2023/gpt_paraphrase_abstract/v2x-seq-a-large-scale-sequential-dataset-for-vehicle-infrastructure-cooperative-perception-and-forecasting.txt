Utilizing information from infrastructure and vehicles can enhance decision-making and safety in autonomous driving by tracking and predicting the behaviors of surrounding traffic participants. However, the lack of real-world sequential datasets hinders research in this field. To address this issue, we present V2X-Seq, the first large-scale sequential V2X dataset. It includes data frames, trajectories, vector maps, and traffic lights captured from natural environments. V2X-Seq consists of two parts: the sequential perception dataset, with over 15,000 frames from 95 scenarios, and the trajectory forecasting dataset, comprising approximately 80,000 infrastructure-view scenarios, 80,000 vehicle-view scenarios, and 50,000 cooperative-view scenarios from 28 intersection areas, covering 672 hours of data. Based on V2X-Seq, we introduce three novel tasks for vehicle-infrastructure cooperative (VIC) autonomous driving: VIC3D Tracking, Online-VIC Forecasting, and Offline-VIC Forecasting. We also provide benchmarks for these tasks. For data, code, and the most recent information, visit https://github.com/AIR-THU/DAIR-V2X-Seq.
