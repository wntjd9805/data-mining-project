Most current instance segmentation methods use fixed-resolution masks, but this comes with limitations. Low-resolution masks lack detail, while high-resolution masks result in excessive computation. This paper introduces a solution called DynaMask. It utilizes a dual-level Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) to gradually increase the resolution of the mask grid, ensuring high-quality segmentation. It includes a region-level top-down path (r-FPN) to incorporate contextual and detailed information from different stages of the image-level FPN (i-FPN). To address the computational and memory costs of using large masks, a Mask Switch Module (MSM) is developed to select the most suitable mask resolution for each instance, maintaining efficiency and accuracy. The proposed method, DynaMask, consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with only a moderate increase in computation. The source code can be found at https://github.com/lslrh/DynaMask.
