PROTOCON is a new method for semi-supervised learning (SSL) that focuses on label-scarce SSL, where existing approaches tend to underperform. This method improves the accuracy of pseudo-labels by incorporating information from their nearest neighbors. It achieves this by using an online clustering approach in an embedding space, trained with a prototypical loss, to create well-formed clusters. The online nature of PROTOCON allows it to utilize the label history of the entire dataset in one training cycle without needing to store image embeddings, making it scalable to larger datasets at a low cost. Additionally, PROTOCON addresses the challenge of poor training signal in the initial phase by including an auxiliary self-supervised loss. Experimental results demonstrate that PROTOCON outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, including CIFARs, ImageNet, and DomainNet, showing significant improvements in accuracy and faster convergence.
