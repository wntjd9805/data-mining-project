The PDAVIS camera is a new type of vision sensor that can capture both conventional polarization frames and polarization brightness changes with high resolution and a wide range. Previous methods for reconstructing polarization from these brightness changes have not been very effective. In this study, we have developed a new deep neural network called E2P that directly outputs polarization information from the raw data. We have also created a large dataset for training the network. Our results show that E2P outperforms previous methods and provides more accurate measurements of polarization in challenging scenes. The code and data for E2P are publicly available.
