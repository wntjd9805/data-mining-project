We examine the task of solving LP relaxations of MAP-MRF inference problems, focusing on a recent method proposed in [16, 35]. This method utilizes a variant of the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm to minimize a smooth convex function over a combinatorial polytope. To enhance its efficiency, we introduce an efficient implementation of this algorithm by leveraging in-face Frank-Wolfe directions, which were previously introduced in a different context in [4]. In a broader sense, we define an abstract data structure that facilitates in-face FW directions for combinatorial sub-problems and provide a specialized version for tree-structured MAP-MRF inference subproblems. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach currently outperforms other LP solvers for certain problem classes.
