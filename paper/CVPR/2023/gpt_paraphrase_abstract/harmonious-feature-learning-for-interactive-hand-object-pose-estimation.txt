Joint hand and object pose estimation from a single image is a difficult task due to occlusion when the hand and object interact. Current approaches extract coarse features from a single backbone and enhance them using interaction modules. However, these approaches overlook the fact that the hand and object compete in feature learning since they are considered foreground and are often occluded. To address this issue, we propose a novel Harmonious Feature Learning Network (HFL-Net). HFL-Net combines the benefits of single- and double-stream backbones by sharing the parameters of low- and high-level convolutional layers of a common ResNet-50 model for the hand and object. This allows the middle-level layers to extract the hand and object as the sole targets, avoiding competition in feature learning. The shared high-level layers ensure that their features are harmonious, facilitating mutual feature enhancement. Specifically, we enhance the hand's feature by concatenating it with the feature from the object stream at the same location. We then apply a self-attention layer to deeply fuse the concatenated feature. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the HO3D and Dex-YCB databases. Notably, our model even surpasses existing works that solely perform single-hand pose estimation. The code for our approach is available at https://github.com/lzfff12/HFL-Net.
