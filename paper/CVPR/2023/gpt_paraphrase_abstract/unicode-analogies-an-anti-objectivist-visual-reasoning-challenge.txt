Analogical reasoning allows agents to extract relevant information from scenes and navigate them efficiently. While progressive-matrix problems (PMPs) are commonly used to assess analogical reasoning in computer vision, we believe that the current dominant methodology fails to reveal the lack of meaningful generalization in solvers and reinforces a limited perception of objects. In this study, we propose the Unicode Analogies challenge, which consists of polysemic, character-based PMPs to evaluate the conceptualization ability of vision systems. Unlike existing PMP datasets, the Unicode Analogies challenge incorporates characters that vary in levels of abstraction, resulting in visually diverse images. Our framework aims to challenge models by presenting tasks that require robust feature extraction, yet can still be solved by human participants. We argue that the Unicode Analogies challenge effectively captures and tests a crucial aspect of human visual reasoning that is currently lacking in AI systems.
