There is ongoing confusion and discussion regarding the potential influence of cutting-edge Neuroscience findings on Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically in the field of Computer Vision (CV). This study focuses on the topic of Face Recognition (FR), which is extensively researched in both Neuroscience and CV. Neuroscience studies have shown that face attributes are crucial for human face recognition, and their contribution has been explained within the Neuroscience community. While a few CV works have improved FR performance through attribute enhancement, none of them have been significantly inspired by the human face recognition mechanism or achieved substantial performance improvements. To experimentally demonstrate our idea, we intentionally model the biological characteristics of the human face recognition system using classical Convolutional Neural Network Operators (CNN Ops). The proposed network, called BioNet, consists of two cascade sub-networks: the Visual Cortex Network (VCN) modeled with a classical CNN backbone, and the Inferotemporal Cortex Network (ICN) composed of three biologically-inspired modules. Our experiments confirm that incorporating cutting-edge findings about the human face recognition system can enhance CNN-based FR networks. Moreover, both identity-related attributes (e.g., gender) and identity-unrelated attributes (e.g., expression) benefit the deep FR models, with the latter contributing even more significantly. Additionally, BioNet achieves significant performance improvements on standard FR benchmark datasets, such as boosting IJB-B@1e-6 from 52.12% to 68.28% and MegaFace from 98.74% to 99.19%.
