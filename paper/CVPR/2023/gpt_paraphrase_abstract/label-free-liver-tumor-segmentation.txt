We have successfully demonstrated that AI models can accurately segment liver tumors without the need for manual annotation by utilizing synthetic tumors in CT scans. These synthetic tumors possess two notable advantages: (I) they closely resemble real tumors in terms of shape and texture, to the point where even medical professionals can mistake them for real tumors; (II) they effectively train AI models to perform liver tumor segmentation, achieving similar or even comparable performance to models trained on real tumors. This breakthrough is particularly significant because no previous work utilizing solely synthetic tumors has achieved such levels of accuracy.The implications of our findings are twofold. Firstly, the need for labor-intensive manual annotation of tumors voxel by voxel, a process that has taken years to develop, can be greatly reduced in the future. Secondly, our synthetic tumors have the potential to generate numerous examples of small or even tiny tumors, which can greatly enhance the success rate of detecting early-stage liver cancer. This is a crucial aspect of cancer detection and can significantly improve patient outcomes.In addition to enriching the training data, our approach of synthesizing tumors also allows us to thoroughly evaluate the robustness of AI models. By subjecting the models to the challenges posed by synthetic tumors, we can assess their performance in a rigorous manner.In summary, our study demonstrates that AI models can accurately segment liver tumors using synthetic tumors in CT scans, eliminating the need for manual annotation and potentially speeding up the tumor detection process. The realistic nature of our synthetic tumors and their ability to train AI models effectively make them a valuable tool in the field of cancer detection. Furthermore, the generation of small and tiny synthetic tumors can aid in the early detection of liver cancer. This research not only enhances training data but also enables a comprehensive evaluation of AI model robustness.
