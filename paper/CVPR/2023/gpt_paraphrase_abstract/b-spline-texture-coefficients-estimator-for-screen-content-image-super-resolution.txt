We propose a method for super-resolution of screen content images (SCIs) using an implicit neural representation with B-splines. SCIs have sharp edges and homogeneous areas, which differ from natural images. To minimize information distortion when the resolution of a display device differs from SCIs, we handle the edges and textures appropriately. Our method extracts scaling, translating, and smoothing parameters of B-splines and uses them in a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to recover high-resolution SCIs. Compared to a transformer-based reconstruction and an implicit Fourier representation method, our network performs better in almost all upscaling factors due to the positive constraint and compact support of the B-spline basis. Additionally, our super-resolution results are accurately recognized as text letters with high confidence by a pre-trained scene text recognition network.
