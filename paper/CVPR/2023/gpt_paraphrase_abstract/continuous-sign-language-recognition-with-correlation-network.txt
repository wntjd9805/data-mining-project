We propose a method called CorrNet that addresses the limitation of current continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) methods in capturing and utilizing body trajectories across consecutive frames. CorrNet consists of a correlation module and an identification module. The correlation module computes correlation maps between the current frame and adjacent frames to identify trajectories of spatial patches. The identification module emphasizes the body trajectories within these correlation maps. By doing so, CorrNet generates features that provide an overview of local temporal movements to accurately identify signs. We evaluated CorrNet on four large-scale datasets and achieved state-of-the-art accuracy. Comparisons with previous methods also demonstrate the effectiveness of CorrNet. Visualizations further illustrate how CorrNet emphasizes human body trajectories across adjacent frames.
