This study proposes a model called BPFRe for face retouching, which aims to remove blemishes while preserving the details of the input image. The challenge lies in distinguishing blemishes from facial characteristics. The model consists of two stages: an encoder-decoder module for coarse blemish removal and a generator for enhancing local detail. An attention module is incorporated to suppress blemishes and refine the transferred features. This model achieves significant performance improvements in various face retouching tasks. The reliance on paired training data is reduced by applying effective regularization on unpaired samples.
