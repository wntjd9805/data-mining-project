Artificial lights, which are influenced by the grid's alternating current, have the potential to estimate the Electric Network Frequency (ENF) through subtle variations in intensity and spectrum. However, current video-based ENF estimation methods are limited by imaging quality and are susceptible to interference from non-ideal sampling, motion, and extreme lighting conditions. This paper introduces a new modality using event cameras, which encode light intensity variations and emit events with high temporal resolution and dynamic range. The authors propose an Event-based ENF (E-ENF) estimation method that overcomes the limitations of video-based methods by utilizing mode filtering and harmonic enhancement. They also create a dataset called EV-ENFD that contains both events and videos in diverse scenes. Experiments on EV-ENFD demonstrate that the E-ENF method outperforms conventional video-based methods, particularly in challenging environments with object motions and extreme lighting conditions. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/xlx-creater/E-ENF. Figure 1 illustrates the processing pipeline for E-ENF extraction and presents comparative experimental results under different recording environments, including recorded event streams and the extracted V-ENF and E-ENF.
