This study focuses on evaluating the robustness of infrared object detectors against adversarial examples in real-world scenarios. Current physical infrared attacks are complex to implement practically due to the complicated transformation from the digital world to the physical world. To address this issue, the researchers propose a physically feasible infrared attack method called "adversarial infrared patches". These patches manipulate the thermal distribution of the target object by attaching a patch of thermal insulation material. To enhance the effectiveness of these attacks, a novel aggregation regularization is introduced to guide the simultaneous learning of the patch's shape and location on the target object. This allows for a simple gradient-based optimization to solve for them. The proposed adversarial infrared patches are tested on different object detection tasks using various object detectors. The experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves a high Attack Success Rate (ASR) of over 90% against pedestrian and vehicle detectors in physical environments, considering different angles, distances, postures, and scenes. Importantly, the adversarial infrared patch is easy to implement and can be constructed in the physical world within just 0.5 hours, proving its effectiveness and efficiency.
