A previous method in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection has shown promising results by using auxiliary data as OOD data. However, this method treats all auxiliary data equally, which does not account for the imbalance in the distribution of OOD data across different classes. In this study, we propose a balanced energy regularization loss that effectively addresses the class imbalance issue in OOD data for various tasks. Our approach assigns different prior probabilities to auxiliary data based on their respective classes, with a heavier regularization for samples from majority classes compared to minority classes. Our approach outperforms the prior energy regularization loss in OOD detection for semantic segmentation, long-tailed image classification, and image classification tasks. Additionally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in OOD detection for semantic segmentation and long-tailed image classification tasks.
