Fluorescence staining is a widely used technique in biological research to study cellular structures, but it has drawbacks such as being slow, expensive, and harmful to cells. This paper introduces a new approach called subcellular structure prediction (SSP) that uses deep learning to predict the 3D fluorescent images of multiple subcellular structures based on a 3D transmitted-light image. However, SSP faces challenges due to limited labeling and the varying sizes of subcellular structures. To address these challenges, the authors propose a network called Re-parameterizing Mixture-of-Diverse-Experts (RepMode). RepMode dynamically organizes its parameters using task-specific priors, allowing it to handle single-label prediction tasks effectively. The network incorporates a Mixture-of-Diverse-Experts (MoDE) block to learn generalized parameters for all tasks and utilizes gating re-parameterization (GatRep) to generate specialized parameters for each task. This approach enables RepMode to maintain a compact and practical topology while achieving a powerful theoretical topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RepMode outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance in SSP.
