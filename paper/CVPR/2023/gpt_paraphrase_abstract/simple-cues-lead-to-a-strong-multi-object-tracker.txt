The traditional approach for Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has been tracking-by-detection (TbD), where objects are detected and then associated across video frames. This is typically done using motion and appearance cues, such as re-identification networks. However, recent attention-based methods have shown impressive results by learning these cues in a data-driven manner. This paper aims to investigate whether the simple TbD methods can achieve similar performance to these end-to-end models. To do so, the authors propose two key ingredients that enhance the performance of a standard re-identification network in appearance-based tracking. They thoroughly analyze the failure cases of this approach and demonstrate that combining appearance features with a basic motion model yields strong tracking results. The proposed tracker is evaluated on four public datasets, namely MOT17, MOT20, BDD100k, and DanceTrack, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.
