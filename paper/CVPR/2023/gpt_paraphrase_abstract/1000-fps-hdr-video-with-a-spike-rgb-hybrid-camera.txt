Capturing high frame rate and high dynamic range (HFR&HDR) color videos in high-speed scenes is a challenge with conventional cameras. Increasing the frame rate often leads to increased noise due to shorter exposure times. While alternating exposures can reduce noise, it sacrifices frame rate because of longer exposure times. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid camera system that combines a neuromorphic spiking camera with an alternating-exposure RGB camera. This system captures HFR&HDR scenes with high fidelity by leveraging the strengths of each camera. The spiking camera records fast motion information, which is used to reconstruct motion representation. The spike-based optical flows then guide the recovery of missing temporal information in the long-exposure RGB images, while preserving their color accuracy. By utilizing the temporal constraint estimated from spike trains, both missing and distorted colors across RGB frames are recovered, resulting in time-consistent and HFR color frames. We have created a new dataset called Spike-RGB, consisting of synthetic and real-world data, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method outperforms existing HDR video reconstruction techniques and commercial high-speed cameras, achieving 1000 FPS HDR videos.
