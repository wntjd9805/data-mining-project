Current line-based reconstruction methods are not as advanced as point-based methods, despite the fact that line segments can efficiently represent the layout of a scene. Lines are prevalent in urban and indoor environments and provide strong geometric cues. This paper introduces LIMAP, a library for creating 3D line maps from multi-view imagery. LIMAP addresses the degeneracy problem of line triangulation, incorporates scoring and track building techniques, and utilizes structural priors such as line coincidence, parallelism, and orthogonality. The code integrates with point-based Structure-from-Motion methods and can enhance line reconstruction using 3D points. Additionally, LIMAP can recover 3D association graphs between lines and points/vanishing points. Experimental results demonstrate that LIMAP outperforms existing approaches for 3D line mapping and introduces opportunities for further research. The paper presents two example applications, visual localization and bundle adjustment, where combining lines and points achieves the best outcomes.
