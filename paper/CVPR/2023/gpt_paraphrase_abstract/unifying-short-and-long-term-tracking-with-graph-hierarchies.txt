We propose a unified and scalable multi-object tracking approach called SUSHI. Existing methods for object tracking in long videos often rely on separate techniques for short-term and long-term association, leading to complex and specialized solutions. SUSHI addresses this issue by processing long clips using a hierarchy of sub-clips, allowing for scalability. We utilize graph neural networks to handle all levels of the hierarchy, making our model applicable across different temporal scales and more versatile. Experimental results on four diverse datasets show that SUSHI outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. The code and models for SUSHI are publicly available at bit.ly/sushi-mot.
