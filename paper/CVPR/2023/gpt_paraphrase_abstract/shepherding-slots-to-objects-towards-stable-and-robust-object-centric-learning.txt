The goal of object-centric learning (OCL) is to understand scenes by representing them as a collection of object-centric representations. While OCL has been successful in multi-view image and video datasets, it remains challenging for single-view images due to the limited information they provide. This leads to inconsistent learning of object-centric representation. To address this issue, we propose a new OCL framework called SLot Attention via SHepherding (SLASH). SLASH consists of two modules, Attention Refining Kernel (ARK) and Intermediate Point Predictor and Encoder (IPPE), which enhance the learning process. ARK prevents slots from being distracted by background noise, while IPPE indicates locations for slots to focus on, facilitating the learning of object-centric representation. Additionally, we introduce a weak semi-supervision approach for OCL, allowing our framework to be used without assistant annotation during inference. Our experiments demonstrate that SLASH enables consistent learning of object-centric representation and achieves strong performance across four datasets. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/object-understanding/SLASH. Figure 1 illustrates the inconsistent learning results of Slot Attention with different seeds, highlighting the importance of overcoming background noise for effective object-centric representation.
