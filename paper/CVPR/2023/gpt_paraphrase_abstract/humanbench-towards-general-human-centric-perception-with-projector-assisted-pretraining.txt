This paper focuses on the development of a general pretrain model for human-centric vision tasks. The authors introduce a benchmark called HumanBench, which evaluates the generalization abilities of different pretraining methods on 19 datasets encompassing various human-centric tasks. They also propose a pretraining method called PATH that learns both coarse-grained and fine-grained knowledge in human bodies. The evaluation results on HumanBench demonstrate that PATH achieves state-of-the-art performance on 17 datasets and comparable performance on the other 2 datasets. The code for the benchmark is available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/HumanBench.
