Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to segment new objects in a query image using only a few annotated support images. However, previous methods that have shown good performance in this task, whether prototypical learning methods or affinity learning methods, do not effectively address false matches caused by their own pixel-level correlation. In this study, we propose a new approach called Adaptive Buoys Correlation (ABC) network to mitigate false matches by focusing on representative reference features (referred to as buoys). The ABC network consists of a buoys mining module and an adaptive correlation module. The buoys mining module is designed to learn the buoys without any correspondence supervision, taking into account their representativeness, task awareness, and resilience. The adaptive correlation module further enhances the buoy-correlation-based pixel matching with adaptive abilities. Experimental results on two challenging benchmarks using two different backbones demonstrate that our ABC network consistently outperforms several leading methods in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings. Overall, our proposed ABC network is a versatile solution that achieves significant improvements in few-shot segmentation tasks.
