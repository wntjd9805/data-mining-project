We propose a new label assignment strategy called one-to-few (o2f) for dense detection. Current one-to-one (o2o) label assignment methods in transformer-based detectors have limitations due to the limited number of positive samples. While recent methods introduce extra positive samples, they are not practical for dense and fully convolutional detectors. Our o2f strategy defines multiple soft anchors for each object, serving as both positive and negative samples. During training, the weights of these soft anchors are dynamically adjusted to enhance "representation learning" and "duplicated prediction removal" at different stages. Our approach enables the detector to learn strong feature representation and perform end-to-end dense detection. Experimental results on COCO and CrowdHuman datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the o2f scheme. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/strongwolf/o2f.
