Omnidirectional images (ODIs) have garnered significant interest in research due to their potential for immersive experiences. However, most ODIs lack the necessary high resolution to capture detailed scenes. Previous methods have attempted to address this issue through image super-resolution (SR) on equirectangular projection (ERP) images. However, these methods neglect the geometric properties of ERP during the degradation process, limiting their applicability to real ERP images. In this study, we propose Fisheye downsampling, a technique that emulates real-world imaging processes and generates more realistic low-resolution samples. Additionally, we introduce a distortion-aware Transformer (OSRT) that can continuously and self-adaptively modulate ERP distortions. Compared to previous methods, OSRT achieves superior performance, outperforming them by approximately 0.2dB in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). Furthermore, we present a simple data augmentation strategy that synthesizes pseudo ERP images from plain images. This strategy effectively mitigates the overfitting problem of large networks and significantly enhances the performance of ODISR. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art capabilities of our OSRT.
