The detection of forged faces is becoming increasingly important due to the security risks associated with face manipulation techniques. While recent studies have shown promising results in detecting deepfakes within the same domain, the challenge arises when trying to detect forgeries created using unseen methods during training. We propose a framework called Action-Units Relation Learning to address this issue. This framework consists of the Action Units Relation Transformer (ART) and the Tampered AU Prediction (TAP). ART establishes the relationship between different facial action units (AU) using an AU-agnostic Branch and an AU-specific Branch, which work together to uncover clues of forgery. TAP involves tampering with AU-related regions at the image level and generating challenging pseudo samples at the feature level. The model is then trained to predict the tampered AU regions using location-specific supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations.
