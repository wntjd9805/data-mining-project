Optical flow estimation is a key aspect of computer vision. To achieve low-latency estimation, event-based cameras that detect sparse intensity changes are ideal. However, existing methods that use local plane fitting of events only provide the normal component of the optical flow. On the other hand, frame-based deep neural networks can estimate the full flow, but their dense operations are computationally intensive and not suitable for low-latency estimation. In this study, we propose a method called tangentially elongated Gaussian (TEG) belief propagation (BP) that allows incremental estimation of the full flow. We model the probability of the full flow using TEGs based on the normal flow measurements, and use message-passing based on BP to efficiently update the estimation using sparse measurements. Through theoretical justifications and real-world dataset evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of TEGBP, which outperforms the state-of-the-art incremental quasi-full flow method by a significant margin. The code for TEGBP is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/DensoITLab/tegbp/.
