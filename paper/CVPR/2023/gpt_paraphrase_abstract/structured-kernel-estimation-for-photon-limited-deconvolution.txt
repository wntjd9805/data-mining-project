This paper proposes a new technique for estimating blur in low light conditions with camera shake. Existing image restoration networks are effective in well-illuminated scenes but struggle with strong photon shot noise. The proposed method uses a gradient-based backpropagation approach to estimate the blur kernel, reducing the search space and improving kernel estimation. When incorporated into an iterative framework, this low-dimensional representation produces better kernel estimates and improves deconvolution performance compared to end-to-end trained neural networks.
