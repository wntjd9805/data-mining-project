This paper focuses on the semantic segmentation of vector graphics (VG), specifically roughcast floorplans with bare wall structures. The goal is to produce accurate segmentations that can be used for interior furnishing and room space modeling. Previous methods for semantic segmentation have mainly dealt with raster images of well-decorated floorplans, resulting in segmented rooms with jagged boundaries and outlier fragments. This is because pixel-level segmentation does not take into account the regular elements (such as line segments) in vector floorplans. To address this issue, the authors propose a pipeline that utilizes the regular elements in vector floorplans for more comprehensive segmentation. The pipeline involves classifying line segments as room boundaries and partitioned regions as room segments. To capture the structural relationships between lines and regions, two-stream graph neural networks are used to process the line segments and partitioned regions separately. A novel modulated graph attention layer is also introduced to integrate the information from both streams. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms image-based methods in terms of both mIoU and mAcc by directly operating on vector floorplans. Furthermore, a new metric is proposed to evaluate room integrity and boundary regularity, which confirms that the method produces more regular segmentations.
