Advances in self-supervised visual representation learning have opened up possibilities for unsupervised methods in tasks like object discovery and instance segmentation. However, discovering objects in an image without supervision is extremely challenging, as it involves determining the desired objects, when to separate them, how many there are, and their respective classes. These answers rely on the evaluation tasks and datasets. This study proposes a different approach by focusing on identifying the background instead. By doing so, the salient objects naturally emerge without strong assumptions about their characteristics. The proposed model, FOUND, consists of a single conv1 Ã— 1 initialized with coarse background masks extracted from self-supervised patch-based representations. After training and refining these seed masks, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised saliency detection and object discovery benchmarks. Additionally, the approach yields favorable results in the unsupervised semantic segmentation retrieval task. The code to replicate the results is available at https://github.com/valeoai/FOUND.
