The current method of testing self-driving vehicles (SDVs) in simulations involves replaying real-world scenarios without real-time reactions. However, in order to safely deploy SDVs in the real world, it is necessary to evaluate them in closed-loop systems. To achieve this, we propose the use of real-world scenarios that are made reactive and controllable, allowing for closed-loop evaluation of SDVs in various what-if situations. We introduce MIXSIM, a hierarchical framework for mixed reality traffic simulation, which models agent goals as routes and learns a reactive route-conditional policy. By inferring each agent's route, MIXSIM can re-simulate the scenario and test different autonomy systems under the same conditions. Additionally, by varying each agent's route, we can expand testing to what-if situations with realistic variations in agent behaviors or safety critical interactions. Our experiments demonstrate that MIXSIM can serve as a realistic, reactive, and controllable digital representation of real-world scenarios.
