In computational pathology, cell detection is a crucial task for extracting valuable medical information from whole-slide images. Pathologists typically zoom in and out to examine tissue-level structures and classify cells based on their morphology and context. However, existing cell detection models do not adequately capture these behaviors due to a lack of datasets with overlapping cell and tissue annotations. To address this limitation, we introduce the OCELOT dataset, which specifically focuses on studying cell-tissue relationships in histopathology. OCELOT provides overlapping annotations of cells and tissues from various organs. Additionally, we propose multi-task learning approaches that simultaneously learn both cell and tissue tasks, resulting in improved cell detection performance across multiple datasets. Specifically, on the OCELOT test set, our approaches achieve up to a 6.79 improvement in F1-score compared to models trained solely for cell detection. We believe that the release of the OCELOT dataset and our research contributions pave the way for incorporating cell-tissue relationships in computational pathology.
