Deep learning methods, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), have the ability to generate high-quality images but lack the capability to semantically edit these images. Previous studies have explored manipulating latent variables to control image generation, but linear semantic arithmetic methods have limitations in terms of image editing quality. On the other hand, methods that discover nonlinear semantic pathways offer non-commutative editing, meaning the results differ based on the order of application. In this research, a new approach called deep curvilinear editing (DeCurvEd) is proposed to determine vector fields that allow for semantic editing in a commutative manner. The theoretical analysis shows that the editing of multiple attributes depends solely on their quantities, not the order in which they are edited. Experimental results demonstrate that DeCurvEd outperforms previous methods by disentangling image attributes and enabling higher-quality editing.
