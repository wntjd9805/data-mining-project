We introduce a new bird's-eye-view (BEV) detector that incorporates perspective supervision, enabling faster convergence and better compatibility with modern image backbones. Current BEV detectors are often limited to specific pre-trained backbones like VoVNet, preventing effective integration with evolving image backbones. To overcome this limitation, we focus on optimizing BEV detectors by introducing perspective view supervision. Our approach involves a two-stage BEV detector, where proposals from the perspective head are used for final predictions in the bird's-eye-view head. We extensively evaluate our model through various experiments, analyzing the impact of different supervision methods and the generalizability of our detector. The proposed method is validated using both traditional and modern image backbones, achieving state-of-the-art (SoTA) results on the large-scale nuScenes dataset. The code for our model will be made available soon.
