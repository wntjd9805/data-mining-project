This paper introduces Real-time Controllable Denoising (RCD), a deep image and video denoising pipeline that allows users to edit denoising levels in real-time with only one-time network inference. Unlike existing methods, RCD replaces the last output layer of a CNN-based model with a lightweight module that outputs multiple noise maps. A NoiseDecorrelation process is proposed to enforce the orthogonality of the noise feature maps, enabling arbitrary noise level control through noise map interpolation. RCD enables real-time editable denoising without sacrificing the performance of heavy-weight models.
