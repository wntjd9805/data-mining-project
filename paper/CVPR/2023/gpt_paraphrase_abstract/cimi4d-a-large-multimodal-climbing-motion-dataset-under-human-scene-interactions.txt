Research on motion capture has mainly focused on ground-based movements such as walking, sitting, and dancing, neglecting off-ground actions like climbing. However, climbing is an important action in sports and firefighting, presenting challenges in capturing due to its complex poses, interactions with the environment, and localization difficulties. The lack of specific datasets has hindered a deeper understanding of climbing actions. To address this limitation, we have collected CIMI4D, a comprehensive dataset of rock climbing motion, including pose measurements, LiDAR point clouds, RGB videos, static point cloud scenes, and scene meshes. The dataset also includes annotations of rock holds to facilitate the exploration of human-environment interactions. The dataset incorporates a blending optimization process to correct pose drift and magnetic interference. We evaluate CIMI4D through various tasks such as human pose estimation, prediction, and generation. The experimental results demonstrate that CIMI4D poses significant challenges to existing methods while offering extensive research opportunities. We have made the dataset available to the research community at http://www.lidarhumanmotion.net/cimi4d/.
