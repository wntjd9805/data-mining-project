Current methods for open-set action recognition focus on improving uncertainty scores but neglect the significance of feature representations. Our research demonstrates that incorporating features with greater semantic diversity can greatly enhance open-set performance, even with the same uncertainty scores. In this study, we analyze the behavior of feature representation in open-set action recognition using the information bottleneck theory. Based on our analysis, we propose a novel Prototypical Similarity Learning (PSL) framework to increase the instance-specific and class-specific information contained in the features, leading to improved performance. To address the issue of misclassifying unknown samples that resemble known samples, we introduce video shuffling in PSL to learn distinct temporal information between original and shuffled samples, thereby enhancing the class-specific information. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed PSL framework, which achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks for both open-set and closed-set performance.
