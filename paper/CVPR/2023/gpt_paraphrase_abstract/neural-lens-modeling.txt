This study addresses the limitations of current methods for 3D reconstruction and rendering that struggle to accurately model the effects of optical hardware stack and lenses. The authors propose NeuroLens, a neural lens model that can account for distortion and vignetting and can be optimized through point projection and ray casting. The model can be used for pre-capture calibration as well as calibration and refinement during 3D reconstruction. The authors evaluate the performance of their model using a comprehensive dataset and demonstrate its superiority over standard packages and recent approaches. The model is easy to use, can be integrated into existing systems, and is applicable to various lens types.
