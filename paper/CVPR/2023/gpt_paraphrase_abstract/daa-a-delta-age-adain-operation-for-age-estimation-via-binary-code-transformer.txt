Computer tasks often overlook the concept of comparing ages with others when recognizing age with the naked eye. This is because obtaining representative contrast images of each age is challenging. To address this, we developed the Delta Age AdaIN (DAA) operation inspired by transfer learning. This operation allows us to obtain the feature difference for each age by deriving the style map through learned values representing the mean and standard deviation. By treating the input of transfer learning as a binary code of the age natural number, we can acquire continuous age feature information. The learned values in the binary code mapping correspond to the mean and standard deviation of the comparison ages. Our method consists of four components: FaceEncoder, DAA operation, Binary code mapping, and AgeDecoder modules. After obtaining the delta age through AgeDecoder, we calculate the average value of all comparison ages and delta ages to predict the age. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on various facial age datasets while using fewer parameters. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/redcping/Delta_Age_AdaIN.
