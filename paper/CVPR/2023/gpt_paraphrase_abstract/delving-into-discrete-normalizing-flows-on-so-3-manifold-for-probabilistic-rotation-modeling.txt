Normalizing flows (NFs) are a useful tool for creating complex distributions by transforming a base distribution. They are commonly used in probabilistic models for data analysis. However, when dealing with rotations, such as in computer vision or robotics, there can be challenges due to occlusion and symmetry. Existing NFs in Euclidean space do not adequately handle rotations on the SO(3) manifold, as they lack continuity or many-to-one mapping. This paper introduces a new approach for normalizing flows on SO(3) by combining a Mobius transformation-based coupling layer and a quaternion affine transformation. This method allows for the effective representation of arbitrary distributions on SO(3) and the conditioning of the target distribution based on input observations. Experimental results demonstrate that our rotation normalizing flows outperform existing methods for both unconditional and conditional tasks.
