Sparsely annotated semantic segmentation (SASS) is a method of training a segmentation model using images with sparse labels. Previous approaches have focused on using low-level affinity or generating pseudo labels to improve supervision, but they have not adequately considered the relationship between labeled and unlabeled pixels. This paper introduces a novel SASS framework called Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Model (AGMM), which addresses this issue. The AGMM effectively provides reliable supervision for unlabeled pixels by utilizing the distributions of labeled and unlabeled pixels. It builds Gaussian mixtures based on labeled pixels and their similar unlabeled pixels, modeling the feature distribution of each class. The framework then combines information from labeled pixels and adaptively generated GMM predictions to supervise the training of unlabeled pixels, achieving online, dynamic, and robust self-supervision. Additionally, AGMM encourages the model to learn discriminative class decision boundaries by capturing category-wise Gaussian mixtures in an end-to-end contrastive learning manner. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets demonstrate that AGMM achieves state-of-the-art SASS performance.
