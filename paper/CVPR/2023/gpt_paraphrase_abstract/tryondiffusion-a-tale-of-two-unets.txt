The objective of this study is to generate a visual representation of how a garment would appear on a person, using two images: one of the person and another of the garment worn by a different individual. The main challenge lies in creating a realistic visualization of the garment while accounting for significant variations in body pose and shape between the subjects. Existing methods either prioritize preserving garment details without addressing pose and shape changes effectively, or enable try-on with desired pose and shape but lack garment details. To address these limitations, we propose a diffusion-based architecture called Parallel-UNet, which combines two UNets. This architecture allows us to preserve garment details and warp the garment to accommodate pose and body changes within a single network. The key concepts of Parallel-UNet include: 1) warping the garment implicitly through a cross attention mechanism, and 2) blending the garment warp and person together as part of a unified process rather than separate tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method, TryOnDiffusion, achieves state-of-the-art performance both qualitatively and quantitatively.
