Semi-supervised learning has shown promise for medical image segmentation when annotation is limited. However, the presence of cognitive bias in the model hinders segmentation performance, particularly in edge regions. Existing semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods lack mechanisms to address this bias. Although neural networks have strong learning abilities, they tend to deepen cognitive bias during training and struggle to correct themselves. In this study, we propose a novel framework called mutual correction (MCF) to address model bias and enhance the performance of semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Drawing inspiration from contrastive learning, MCF incorporates two different subnets to identify and utilize discrepancies between them to correct cognitive bias. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive difference review (CDR) module to identify inconsistent prediction regions and conduct a review training. Additionally, a dynamic competitive pseudo-label generation (DC-PLG) module is proposed to dynamically select more reliable pseudo-labels by evaluating the performance of the subnets in real-time. Experimental results on two medical image databases, including CT and MRI modalities, demonstrate that our method outperforms several state-of-the-art approaches.
