This study introduces a computationally efficient approach called SparseMat for generating high-resolution alpha matte for ultrahigh definition (UHD) images and videos. The increasing affordability of commodity UHD displays has created a demand for imaging in ultrahigh resolution (UHR). However, existing matting algorithms cannot directly process UHR images at full resolution without running out of memory on consumer-level computational platforms. Patch-based approaches, while memory efficient, can introduce artifacts due to patch partitioning. SparseMat addresses this issue by utilizing spatial and temporal sparsity to reduce computation redundancy. The method effectively detects spatio-temporal sparsity, which serves as a gate to activate input pixels for the matting model. By incorporating a sparse high-resolution module (SHM), SparseMat avoids patch-based inference and efficiently refines the full-resolution matte, while remaining memory efficient. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseMat can effectively and efficiently generate high-quality alpha matte for UHR images and videos in a single pass at the original high resolution.
