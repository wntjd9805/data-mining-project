This paper explores spatiotemporal predictive learning, which involves generating future frames based on historical frames. The authors investigate existing methods and propose a general framework for spatiotemporal predictive learning. This framework includes a spatial encoder and decoder to capture features within frames, and a middle temporal module to capture correlations between frames. While most methods use recurrent units for capturing long-term dependencies, these architectures are not computationally efficient. To address this, the authors propose the Temporal Attention Unit (TAU), which parallelizes the temporal module by decomposing temporal attention into static attention within frames and dynamic attention between frames. Additionally, the authors introduce a novel differential divergence regularization to account for inter-frame variations, in addition to the commonly used mean squared error loss. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves competitive performance on various spatiotemporal prediction benchmarks.
