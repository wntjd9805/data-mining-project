We propose a Gaussian process-based pixel-wise binary classification model called GPCIS for click-based interactive segmentation (IS). Unlike current deep learning methods, GPCIS fully utilizes and propagates click information to improve segmentation results. We use amortized variational inference to approximate the intractable Gaussian process posterior and decouple it into double space forms for efficient sampling. GPCIS incorporates deep kernel learning for flexibility. The derived GP posterior guides the propagation of click information, leading to improved segmentation throughout the image. The accuracy of predictions at clicked points is theoretically supported. We validate the effectiveness, generality, and efficiency of GPCIS through extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, comparing it with representative methods.
