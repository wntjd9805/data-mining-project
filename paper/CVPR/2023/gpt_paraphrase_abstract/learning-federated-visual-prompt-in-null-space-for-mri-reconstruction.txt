Federated Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) reconstruction allows hospitals to collaborate without sharing patient data, but data heterogeneity, limited training data, and communication issues hinder model convergence. To address this, we propose FedPR, a new algorithm that learns federated visual prompts in the null space of the global prompt for MRI reconstruction. FedPR uses a pre-trained model and only communicates prompts with few parameters, reducing communication costs. It also updates efficient federated visual prompts to mitigate the impact of data heterogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that FedPR outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms with minimal communication costs and limited local training data.
