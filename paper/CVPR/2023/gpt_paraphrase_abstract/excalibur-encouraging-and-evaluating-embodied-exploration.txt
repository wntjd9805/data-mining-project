The EX-CALIBUR benchmark aims to promote the development of exploratory interactive agents by allowing them to explore their environment and then assess their understanding of the physical world through inquiries. Unlike machines that are typically trained passively from fixed datasets or taught to complete specific tasks, this benchmark encourages agents to engage in free-form exploration without being solely focused on achieving goals. After answering a series of questions, agents can return to the scene to refine their knowledge and improve their performance. The experiments conducted using this benchmark highlight the challenges faced by current embodied systems and the potential for new innovative methods. Additionally, a virtual reality interface is presented to enable humans to interact seamlessly within the simulated world and provide human performance measures. EX-CALIBUR offers distinct challenges compared to existing benchmarks and represents a new frontier for research in embodied AI.
