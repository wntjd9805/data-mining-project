This study focuses on long-term temporal visual correspondence-based optimization for 3D video object detection. Visual correspondence involves mapping pixels across multiple images, and it is crucial for 3D scene reconstruction. However, it is less explored in the context of 3D video object detection because moving objects violate multi-view geometry constraints and are considered outliers during scene reconstruction. To address this issue, we propose a solution called BA-Det. BA-Det is an end-to-end object detector that incorporates object-centric temporal correspondence learning and featuremetric object bundle adjustment. Through empirical experiments, we demonstrate that BA-Det is effective and efficient for various 3D detectors under different setups. In fact, BA-Det achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) while incurring only minimal computation cost. The code for BA-Det is publicly available at https://github.com/jiaweihe1996/BA-Det.
