This paper introduces the use of event cameras with bio-inspired silicon sensors as a solution to the limited sensitivity of conventional cameras in capturing high-fidelity radiance. The authors propose that the transient frequency of event signals triggered by active lighting conditions can linearly reflect the radiance value. They present an innovative method to convert the high temporal resolution of event signals into precise radiance values, which enables various capabilities in image analysis. The feasibility of recovering radiance values solely from the transient event frequency is demonstrated through multiple experiments.
