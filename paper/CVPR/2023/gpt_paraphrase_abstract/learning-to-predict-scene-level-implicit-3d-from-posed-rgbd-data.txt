We present a novel approach for predicting scene-level implicit functions for 3D reconstruction using posed RGBD data. Our method allows us to map an unseen RGB image to a 3D reconstruction of a scene using implicit functions, without relying on meshes. This is significant as it enables us to leverage the vast amount of accelerometer+RGBD data that is becoming available through new phones. Our system, D2-DRDF, demonstrates comparable or superior performance to existing methods that require mesh supervision, and exhibits better resilience to sparse data.
