In this study, we address the challenges of single image dehazing by proposing a novel curricular contrastive regularization approach. Previous methods have used contrastive regularization to incorporate information from negative images, but these negatives are often represented far from the clear image, resulting in an under-constricted solution space. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a consensual contrastive space by assembling negatives from the hazy image and restorations by other methods. We also address the imbalanced learning difficulty caused by the different similarities between the clear image and negatives by implementing a curriculum learning strategy to reweight the importance of the negatives. Additionally, we enhance the interpretability of our dehazing network by incorporating a physics-aware dual-branch unit based on the atmospheric scattering model. Our proposed network, C2PNet, outperforms state-of-the-art methods on SOTS-indoor and SOTS-outdoor datasets, with significant boosts in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).
