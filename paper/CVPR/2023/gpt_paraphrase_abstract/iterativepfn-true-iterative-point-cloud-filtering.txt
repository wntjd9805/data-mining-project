The capture process of point clouds often introduces noise, limiting their quality. To address this, point cloud filtering or denoising is essential. Current learning-based methods involve training neural networks to predict filtered displacements, shifting noisy points onto clean surfaces. However, in high noise conditions, these methods only perform iterative filtering at test time, which is less effective in quickly converging points onto clean surfaces. We propose IterativePFN, a network consisting of multiple IterationModules that internally model the iterative filtering process. We train IterativePFN using a novel loss function that incorporates adaptive ground truth targets at each iteration, capturing the relationship between intermediate filtering results during training. This ensures faster convergence of the filtered results to clean surfaces. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and the source code is available at: https://github.com/ddsediri/IterativePFN.
