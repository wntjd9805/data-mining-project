Model selection is crucial in finding the best pre-trained model for a downstream task. However, existing hand-designed model selection criteria have limitations and can fail due to invalid assumptions. Integrating prior knowledge on model capacity and dataset into these criteria is also challenging. To overcome these issues, we propose a recommendation-based approach that learns from past training history. We use meta information of datasets and models as features and their transfer learning performance as a guided score. By training a recommendation system with thousands of historical training jobs, we can predict the model selection score based on the dataset and model features. Our approach allows for the integration of existing model selection scores as additional features and scales well with more historical data. We evaluate the accuracy of our predictions using 22 pre-trained models and 40 downstream tasks. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our learned approach outperforms previous hand-designed methods when relevant training history is available.
