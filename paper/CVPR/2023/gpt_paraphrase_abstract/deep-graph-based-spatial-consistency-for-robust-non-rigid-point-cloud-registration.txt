We examine outlier correspondence pruning in non-rigid point cloud registration. Unlike in rigid registration, spatial consistency is not a reliable criterion for identifying outliers in non-rigid cases. To address this, we introduce Graph-based Spatial Consistency Network (GraphSCNet) as a method for filtering outliers in non-rigid registration. Our approach is based on the observation that non-rigid deformations are typically locally rigid or locally shape preserving. We begin by creating a local spatial consistency measure using the deformation graph of the point cloud, which evaluates the spatial compatibility of correspondences near a graph node. We then develop an attention-based non-rigid correspondence embedding module to learn a robust representation of non-rigid correspondences based on this local spatial consistency. Despite its simplicity, GraphSCNet significantly enhances the quality of putative correspondences and achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging benchmarks. Our code and models are accessible at https://github.com/qinzheng93/GraphSCNet.
