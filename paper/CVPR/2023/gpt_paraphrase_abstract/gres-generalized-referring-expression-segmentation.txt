The authors introduce a new benchmark called Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES), which extends existing referring expression segmentation (RES) datasets and methods to allow expressions to refer to multiple target objects. They construct a large-scale GRES dataset called gRefCOCO that contains multi-target, no-target, and single-target expressions. GRES and gRefCOCO are designed to be compatible with RES, enabling extensive experiments to study the performance gap of existing RES methods on the GRES task. The authors find that complex relationship modeling is a major challenge in GRES and propose a region-based GRES baseline called ReLA. ReLA adaptively divides the image into regions with sub-instance clues and explicitly models the dependencies between regions and between regions and language. Experimental results show that ReLA achieves state-of-the-art performance on both GRES and classic RES tasks.
