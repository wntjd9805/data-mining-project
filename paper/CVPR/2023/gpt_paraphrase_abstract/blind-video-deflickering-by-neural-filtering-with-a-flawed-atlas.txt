Flickering artifacts are commonly found in videos and can be caused by various factors such as video processing algorithms, video generation algorithms, and specific recording situations. Previous methods for flicker removal often require specific instructions or annotations. In this study, we propose a general framework called "blind deflickering" that can remove flicker from a video without any additional guidance. Our approach combines a neural atlas with a neural filtering strategy to ensure temporal consistency while avoiding introducing artifacts. We created a dataset of real-world flickering videos to validate our method, and extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness, even surpassing baseline methods that use extra guidance. The source code for our method is publicly available.
