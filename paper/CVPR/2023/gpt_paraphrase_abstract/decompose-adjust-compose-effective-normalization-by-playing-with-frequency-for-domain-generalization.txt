Domain generalization (DG) is a crucial task in evaluating the resilience of computer vision models. Previous research has commonly employed normalization techniques for DG, treating statistics and normalized features as style and content respectively. However, the removal of style in normalization poses a challenge in distinguishing between content and style due to unclear boundaries. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel approach from a frequency domain perspective, considering amplitude as style and phase as content. By mathematically deriving the Fourier transform formula, the quantitative phase variation of normalization is verified. Utilizing this understanding, a new normalization method called P CN orm is introduced, which eliminates style while preserving content through spectral decomposition. Additionally, advanced variants of P CN orm, namely CCN orm and SCN orm, are proposed to independently adjust the degrees of variations in content and style, enabling the learning of domain-agnostic representations for DG. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these normalization methods, ResNet-variant models named DAC-P and DAC-SC are presented, showcasing robustness to the domain gap. Comparative evaluations reveal that the proposed models outperform other recent DG methods. Notably, DAC-SC achieves an average state-of-the-art performance of 65.6% across five datasets: PACS, VLCS, Office-Home, DomainNet, and TerraIncognita.
