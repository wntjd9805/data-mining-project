The existing lightweight model on client devices struggles with performance drops when faced with changing environments. This is mainly due to two limitations: the inability to update due to device computation limits and the limited generalization ability of the lightweight model. On the other hand, large models have shown strong generalization capability on the cloud but cannot be deployed on client devices due to computation constraints. To address this issue, we propose a new learning paradigm called Cloud-Device Collaborative Continual Adaptation, which promotes collaboration between the cloud and device to improve the generalization of the device model. In line with this paradigm, we introduce an Uncertainty-based Visual Prompt Adapted (U-VPA) teacher-student model that transfers the generalization capability of the large model on the cloud to the device model. Our approach involves implementing Uncertainty Guided Sampling (UGS) to continuously identify challenging data and transmit the most out-of-distribution samples from the device to the cloud. We also propose a Visual Prompt Learning Strategy with Uncertainty guided updating (VPLU) to specifically handle selected samples with distribution shifts. This strategy involves sending visual prompts to the device and combining them with incoming data to align the device's testing distribution with the cloud's training distribution. We evaluate our approach on two object detection datasets with continually changing environments and demonstrate its superiority over previous state-of-the-art methods in terms of test time adaptation and device-cloud collaboration. The code and datasets used in our experiments will be made publicly available.
