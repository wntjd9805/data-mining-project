Current methods for inverse tone mapping (ITM) can recover high dynamic range (HDR) radiance by predicting multiple exposure images from a single low dynamic range image. However, these methods have limitations. They estimate a fixed number of images, potentially leading to unnecessary computational costs or incorrect results. Additionally, they fail to fully utilize the connections between up-exposure and down-exposure models. In this study, we propose a novel approach to reconstruct HDR radiance using only two exposure images. Our method includes an exposure adaptive block to adjust exposure based on the input image's luminance distribution, a cross-model attention block to connect exposure adjustment models, and an end-to-end ITM pipeline incorporating a multi-exposure fusion model. We also introduce a multi-exposure dataset indicating optimal exposure levels. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches.
