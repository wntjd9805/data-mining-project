The use of flash in photography is crucial as it often serves as the only controllable light source. However, the decision to use flash is typically binary, with limited control over its characteristics. This study focuses on the computational control of flash lighting in photographs, both with and without flash. A new formulation is proposed for flash photograph formation, based on physical principles. Additionally, methods for decomposing and generating flash and no-flash photographs are developed. The effectiveness of this approach surpasses previous alternatives and enables the computational control of flash in real-world images.
