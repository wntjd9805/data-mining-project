We present PartNeRF, a new generative model for creating editable 3D shapes without the need for explicit 3D supervision. While current methods can generate high-quality 3D shapes, the ability to locally control and edit shapes is crucial for content creation applications. Existing part-aware models require 3D supervision and cannot produce textures. Our model addresses these limitations by generating objects as a set of locally defined NeRFs, augmented with an affine transformation. This allows for various editing operations, such as transforming parts and mixing parts from different objects. To ensure distinct and manipulable parts, we enforce a hard assignment of rays to parts, ensuring that the color of each ray is determined by only one NeRF. This means that altering one part does not affect the appearance of others. Evaluations on different ShapeNet categories demonstrate that our model can generate editable 3D objects with improved fidelity compared to previous approaches that require 3D supervision or rely solely on NeRFs.
