This study addresses the challenge of clothing bias in person re-identification (ReID) systems, where the clothing worn by individuals can interfere with accurate identification. Existing methods struggle to effectively eliminate the negative impact of clothing on identity due to a lack of theory and the difficulty of isolating its exact implications. To overcome this challenge, the authors propose a causality-based Auto-Intervention Model (AIM1) for robust cloth-changing person ReID (CC-ReID). AIM1 analyzes the influence of clothing on model inference and uses a dual-branch model to simulate causal intervention. Through model training, the automatic elimination of clothing bias occurs. AIM1 is designed to learn more discriminative identity clues that are not affected by clothing bias. The effectiveness of AIM1 is demonstrated through extensive experiments on two standard CC-ReID datasets, showing its superiority over other state-of-the-art methods.
