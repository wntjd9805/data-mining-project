Supervised anomaly detection models are typically trained using only normal samples, leading to ambiguous decision boundaries and limited discriminability. However, in real-world applications, a few anomaly samples are often available and their knowledge should be effectively utilized. Incorporating these known anomalies during training can introduce bias and hinder the model's ability to detect unseen anomalies. This paper introduces a novel approach to supervised anomaly detection that addresses these challenges. The proposed method employs an explicit boundary guided semi-push-pull contrastive learning mechanism, which enhances the model's discriminability while mitigating bias. The approach is based on two key components. First, an explicit and compact separating boundary is identified as guidance for feature learning. By relying solely on the normal feature distribution, the bias caused by known anomalies is reduced. Second, a boundary guided semi-push-pull loss is developed to pull normal features together and push abnormal features away from the separating boundary beyond a certain margin region. This enables the model to form a more explicit and discriminative decision boundary, effectively distinguishing both known and unseen anomalies from normal samples. The code for this approach will be made available at https://github.com/xcyao00/BGAD.
