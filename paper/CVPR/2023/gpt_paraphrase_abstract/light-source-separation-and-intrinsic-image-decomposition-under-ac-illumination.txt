This paper explores the use of flickering caused by alternating current (AC) illumination in artificial light sources for intrinsic image decomposition (IID). The authors propose a method that separates the light sources and conducts IID under AC illumination. They address the ambiguity in blind light source separation (LSS) and in IID assuming the diffuse reflection model, and explain how these ambiguities can be resolved using a physics-based approach. Experimental results demonstrate that their method can accurately recover the colors of the light sources, diffuse reflectance values, and diffuse and specular intensities under each light source. The authors also highlight the effectiveness of IID under AC illumination for auto white balancing applications.
