The need for effective face forgery detection methods has become prominent with the emergence of face synthesis techniques, driven by security concerns. Some existing methods combine auxiliary frequency-aware information with CNN backbones to identify forged clues. However, these methods struggle to generalize well to increasingly realistic counterfeit types due to a lack of interaction between the extracted frequency features and image content. To address this issue, we propose a Spatial-Frequency DynamicGraph approach that leverages relation-aware features in both spatial and frequency domains through dynamic graph learning. Our method includes three components: 1) Content-guided Adaptive Frequency Extraction module, which mines content-adaptive forged frequency clues. 2) Multiple Domains Attention Map Learning module, which enriches the spatial-frequency contextual features using multiscale attention maps. 3) Dynamic Graph Spatial-Frequency Feature Fusion Network, which explores the high-order relation between spatial and frequency features. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms existing approaches by a significant margin.
