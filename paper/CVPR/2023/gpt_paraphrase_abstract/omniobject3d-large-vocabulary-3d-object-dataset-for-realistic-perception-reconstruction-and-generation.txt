Recent advancements in 3D object modeling heavily rely on synthetic datasets due to the limited availability of large-scale real-scanned 3D databases. To address this issue and facilitate the development of 3D perception, reconstruction, and generation in real-world scenarios, we introduce OmniObject3D, an extensive dataset consisting of high-quality, real-scanned 3D objects. OmniObject3D possesses several key characteristics that enhance its utility: 1) Large Vocabulary: The dataset contains 6,000 scanned objects across 190 daily categories, overlapping with popular 2D datasets such as ImageNet and LVIS. This shared class structure enables the exploration of generalizable 3D representations.2) Rich Annotations: Each 3D object in OmniObject3D is captured using both 2D and 3D sensors, resulting in textured meshes, point clouds, multi-view rendered images, and multiple real-captured videos. These comprehensive annotations provide a wealth of information for various research tasks.3) Realistic Scans: The inclusion of professional scanners ensures high-quality object scans with accurate shapes and realistic appearances. This fidelity enhances the realism of the dataset, making it suitable for diverse applications.To fully exploit the vast potential of OmniObject3D, we establish four evaluation tracks: a) Robust 3D Perception: This track focuses on evaluating algorithms' ability to perceive and understand 3D objects accurately in challenging real-world conditions.b) Novel-View Synthesis: Here, researchers can assess the effectiveness of techniques in synthesizing novel views of objects based on the available 3D data.c) Neural Surface Reconstruction: This track explores the reconstruction of object surfaces using neural network-based methods, leveraging the rich annotations provided in OmniObject3D.d) 3D Object Generation: The final track investigates the generation of new 3D objects, presenting opportunities for innovative research in this domain.Through extensive studies conducted on these four evaluation tracks, our findings shed light on new observations, challenges, and prospects for future research in realistic 3D vision. OmniObject3D serves as a valuable resource for advancing the field of 3D perception and its related applications.
