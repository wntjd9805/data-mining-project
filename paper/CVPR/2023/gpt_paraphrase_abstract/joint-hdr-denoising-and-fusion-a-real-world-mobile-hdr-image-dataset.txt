Mobile phones have become an essential tool for capturing photos in our daily lives. However, their small aperture and sensor size often result in poor image quality, including noise and over-saturation. To address this issue, it is crucial to develop high dynamic range (HDR) imaging techniques specifically for mobile phones. Unfortunately, existing HDR image datasets are mainly constructed using DSLR cameras during the daytime, limiting their relevance to mobile phone HDR imaging.This study presents the creation of a new HDR image dataset called the Mobile-HDR dataset, which is the first of its kind to be developed using mobile phone cameras. The dataset includes paired low dynamic range (LDR) and HDR images captured in the raw image domain, encompassing both daytime and nighttime scenes with varying levels of noise. To enhance the quality of these images, a transformer-based model with a pyramid cross-attention alignment module is proposed. This model effectively combines highly correlated features from different exposure frames to perform joint HDR de-noising and fusion.Experiments conducted using our dataset and method demonstrate their superiority in mobile HDR imaging.
