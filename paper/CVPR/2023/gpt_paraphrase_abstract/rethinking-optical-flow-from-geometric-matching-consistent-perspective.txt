Optical flow estimation is a difficult problem that has not yet been fully solved. Recent advancements in deep learning models for optical flow have shown promising results. However, these models typically train from scratch using standard optical flow data, which limits their ability to accurately and geometrically match image features.In this study, we propose a new approach for optical flow estimation by incorporating Geometric Image Matching (GIM) as a pre-training task for better feature representations in the optical flow estimation process. GIM shares similar challenges with optical flow estimation and benefits from a large amount of labeled real-world data. By matching static scenes, our method learns more fundamental feature correlations between objects and scenes with consistent displacements.The proposed model, called MatchFlow, utilizes a QuadTree attention-based network that is pre-trained on MegaDepth to extract coarse features for further flow regression. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves strong generalization across different datasets. It outperforms the GMA model by reducing errors by 11.5% on the Sintel clean pass dataset and 10.1% on the KITTI test set. At the time of anonymous submission, our MatchFlow(G) model exhibits state-of-the-art performance on the Sintel clean and final pass datasets, while having similar computational and memory requirements compared to other published approaches.The code and models for our proposed method will be made publicly available at https://github.com/DQiaole/MatchFlow.
