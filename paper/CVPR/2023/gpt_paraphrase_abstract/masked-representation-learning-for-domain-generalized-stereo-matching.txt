Recently, there has been a focus on improving cross-domain performance in deep stereo matching methods, which has led to impressive achievements. However, these methods have not addressed the issue of significant fluctuations in generalization performance across different training epochs. To tackle this problem, this paper presents a novel approach that combines masked representation learning and multi-task learning for domain generalized stereo matching. The proposed method involves feeding masked left and complete right images as input to the models. Additionally, a lightweight decoder is integrated after the feature extraction module to reconstruct the original left image. The models are then trained using two tasks, stereo matching and image reconstruction, in a pseudo-multi-task learning framework. This approach encourages the models to learn structural information and improve generalization performance. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by implementing it on two well-known architectures, CFNet and LacGwcNet. Experimental results on multiple datasets reveal several key findings: (1) our method can easily enhance generalization performance in various stereo matching models; (2) our method mitigates the significant fluctuations in generalization performance across different training epochs; (3) it is observed that current methods tend to select the best results among different training epochs for generalization performance, but this is impractical to achieve with ground truth.
