We present G-MSM, a new unsupervised learning approach for non-rigid shape correspondence. Instead of treating input poses as a random set of samples, we model the underlying shape data manifold. Our method constructs an affinity graph on a set of training shapes using an adaptive multi-shape matching architecture. We combine pairwise correspondences by propagating maps along shortest paths in the shape graph. During training, we enforce cycle-consistency between optimal paths and pairwise matches, allowing our model to learn shape priors that are aware of topology. Our framework encompasses different types of shape graphs, such as template-based matching or learnable ranking/sorting. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on various shape correspondence benchmarks, including 3D scan meshes with topological noise and challenging inter-class pairs.
