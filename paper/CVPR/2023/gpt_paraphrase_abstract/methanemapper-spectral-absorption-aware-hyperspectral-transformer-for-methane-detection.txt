Methane is a major contributor to climate change, and the Airborne Visible-Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) has proven effective in mapping methane emissions. However, current methods of analyzing AVIRIS-NG data have limitations, such as being sensitive to local terrain conditions, requiring manual inspection from domain experts, and prone to significant errors. To address these challenges, we propose a new network called MethaneMapper that can detect and quantify methane emissions. MethaneMapper utilizes two novel modules to identify the most relevant methane plume regions and accurately localize them in the spectral domain. Through extensive evaluation, MethaneMapper achieves a mean average precision of 0.63 in detection and reduces the model size by five times compared to existing methods. Additionally, we introduce a large-scale dataset of methane plume segmentation masks, which includes over 4,000 methane plume sites from 1,200 AVIRIS-NG flight lines spanning from 2015 to 2022. This dataset will provide researchers with the opportunity to develop new methods for addressing the challenging problem of greenhouse gas detection and have a significant social impact.
