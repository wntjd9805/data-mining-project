DynamicDet is a novel framework for object detection that addresses the challenges of designing a powerful dynamic detector. The framework includes a carefully designed dynamic architecture specific to the object detection task, an adaptive router that analyzes multi-scale information and determines the inference route automatically, and a novel optimization strategy with an exiting criterion based on detection losses. Additionally, the framework incorporates a variable-speed inference strategy, allowing for a wide range of accuracy-speed trade-offs with only one dynamic detector. Experimental results on the COCO benchmark show that DynamicDet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy-speed trade-offs. For example, the inference speed of DynamicDet's Dy-YOLOv7-W6 is 12% faster than YOLOv7-E6, 17% faster than YOLOv7-D6, and 39% faster than YOLOv7-E6E, while maintaining comparable accuracy.
