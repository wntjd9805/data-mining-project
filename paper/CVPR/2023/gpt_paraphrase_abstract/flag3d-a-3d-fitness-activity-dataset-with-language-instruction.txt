The popularity of fitness activity analysis has led to increased interest in the field of computer vision research. While new tasks and algorithms have been proposed, there is a need for high-quality data with detailed labels and diverse environments. This paper introduces FLAG3D, a large-scale 3D fitness activity dataset that includes 180K sequences of 60 categories. FLAG3D includes three key features: 1) accurate 3D human pose captured from an advanced MoCap system to handle complex activities and large movements, 2) detailed language instructions describing specific activities, and 3) versatile video resources from a combination of high-tech MoCap systems, rendering software, and cost-effective smartphones in natural environments. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that FLAG3D is valuable for various challenges, including cross-domain human action recognition, dynamic human mesh recovery, and language-guided human action generation. The dataset and source code are publicly available at https://andytang15.github.io/FLAG3D.
