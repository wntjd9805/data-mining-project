The P3P problem is a well-known issue in multi-view geometry, involving determining the absolute pose of a calibrated camera based on three 2D-to-3D correspondences. Efforts have been made to develop faster and more stable algorithms for solving this problem, as it is crucial in various vision systems. Although the current state-of-the-art solvers are fast and stable, there are still scenarios where they fail. This paper presents a new algebraic formulation of the problem, treating it as finding the intersection of two conics. By doing so, the real roots of the polynomial system can be analytically characterized, and a tailored solution strategy can be applied to each instance of the problem. This approach results in a fast and stable solver that can successfully solve cases where other methods may fail. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our solver outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in terms of both speed and success rate.
