Detecting small objects in videos is challenging due to limited object information. Current methods focus on incorporating temporal information to improve feature extraction, but they often fail to capture crucial details for small objects, resulting in inadequate features. To address this issue, we propose a long short-term feature enhancement network (LSTFE-Net) for video small object detection. Our approach leverages context information from long-term frames and temporal information from short-term frames as valuable cues. We introduce a spatio-temporal feature alignment module to establish temporal correspondences between short-term and current frames. Additionally, a frame selection module identifies the long-term frame that provides the most relevant context information. Finally, a long short-term feature aggregation module combines the extracted features. Our LSTFE-Net achieves significant performance improvements, with a 4.4% absolute boost in Average Precision (AP) on the FL-Drones dataset.
