Continual Semantic Segmentation (CSS) is an extension of static semantic segmentation that introduces new classes incrementally for training. To address the issue of catastrophic forgetting in CSS, a memory buffer is used to store a small number of samples from previous classes for re-play. However, current methods for selecting memory samples are either random or based on a single-factor-driven hand-crafted strategy, which may not be optimal. In this study, we propose a new mechanism for selecting memory samples that automatically considers various factors such as sample diversity and class performance to ensure effective re-play. Our mechanism treats the selection process as a decision-making process and learns an optimal policy that maximizes validation performance on a reward set. To aid the selection decision, we introduce a novel state representation and a dual-stage action space. Through extensive experiments on the Pascal-VOC 2012 and ADE 20K datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our method outperforms the second-place approach by 12.54% for the 6-stage setting on Pascal-VOC 2012.
