This study focuses on meta-learning and other approaches to few-shot learning for image recognition and their application to various vision tasks such as pose estimation and dense prediction. The question arises whether there exists a few-shot meta-learning algorithm that can generalize across these diverse task types. To address this question, the researchers introduce Meta Omnium, a dataset-of-datasets that encompasses multiple vision tasks including recognition, keypoint localization, semantic segmentation, and regression. They conduct experiments using popular few-shot meta-learning baselines to assess their ability to generalize across tasks and transfer knowledge between them. The introduction of Meta Omnium allows researchers in the field of meta-learning to evaluate model generalization across a wider range of tasks and provides a unified framework for evaluating meta-learners in various vision applications consistently. The code and dataset for Meta Omnium are available at https://github.com/edi-meta-learning/meta-omnium.
