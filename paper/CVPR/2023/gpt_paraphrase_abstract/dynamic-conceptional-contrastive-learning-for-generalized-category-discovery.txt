Generalized category discovery (GCD) is a recently introduced problem that aims to automatically cluster partially labeled data. The challenge lies in the fact that the unlabeled data not only contains instances from known categories but also from novel categories. This poses a problem for traditional novel category discovery (NCD) methods, as they assume that unlabeled data only belongs to novel categories. To address this, self-supervised learning can be used to learn a discriminative representation for unlabeled data. However, this approach neglects the relationships between instances of the same concepts, resulting in subpar representation learning.In this paper, we propose a framework called Dynamic Conceptional Contrastive Learning (DCCL) to effectively improve clustering accuracy for GCD. The framework alternately estimates underlying visual conceptions and learns conceptional representations. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic conception generation and update mechanism to ensure consistent conception learning, further enhancing the optimization of DCCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DCCL achieves state-of-the-art performance on six visual recognition datasets, particularly on fine-grained datasets. For instance, our method outperforms the best competitor by 16.2% on new classes for the CUB-200 dataset. The code for DCCL is available at https://github.com/TPCD/DCCL.
