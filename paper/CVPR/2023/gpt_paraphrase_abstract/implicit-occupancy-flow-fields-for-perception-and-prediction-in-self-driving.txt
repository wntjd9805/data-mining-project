The abstract discusses the need for self-driving vehicles (SDVs) to accurately perceive their surroundings and predict the behavior of other traffic participants. It highlights the limitations of existing approaches, which either detect objects and forecast their trajectories or predict dense occupancy and flow grids for the entire scene. These approaches either sacrifice object recall or require excessive computational resources. To address these challenges, the authors propose a unified approach that combines perception and future prediction using a single neural network. This approach implicitly represents occupancy and flow over time and can be queried directly by the motion planner at specific locations. The authors also introduce an architecture that overcomes the limited receptive field of previous occupancy prediction methods by incorporating a global attention mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through extensive experiments in urban and highway settings, where it outperforms the current state-of-the-art.
