DeepSolo is a novel approach to end-to-end text spotting that combines text detection and recognition within a unified framework. Existing Transformer-based methods have addressed some limitations of traditional approaches but still face challenges in achieving synergy between the two sub-tasks and training efficiency. In this study, we propose DeepSolo, which employs a single Decoder with Explicit Points Solo to simultaneously handle text detection and recognition. Each text instance is represented as ordered points and modeled using learnable explicit point queries. These queries encode the necessary text semantics and locations, allowing for easy decoding of the center line, boundary, script, and confidence of the text. Additionally, we introduce a text-matching criterion to improve the accuracy of supervisory signals and enhance training efficiency. Experimental results on public benchmarks demonstrate that DeepSolo outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods while achieving better training efficiency. Furthermore, DeepSolo is compatible with line annotations, which require less annotation cost than polygons. The code for DeepSolo is available at https://github.com/ViTAE-Transformer/DeepSolo.
