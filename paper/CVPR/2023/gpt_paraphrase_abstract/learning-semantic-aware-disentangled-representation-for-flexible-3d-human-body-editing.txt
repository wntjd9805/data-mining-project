In recent years, there has been a growing interest in learning 3D representations of the human body. However, current approaches are limited in their ability to accurately and flexibly represent human bodies due to coarse semantics and a lack of supervised data. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to human body representation that addresses these limitations. Our approach utilizes fine-grained semantics and achieves high reconstruction accuracy in an unsupervised setting. We achieve this by establishing a correspondence between latent vectors and geometric measures of body parts through a part-aware skeleton-separated decoupling strategy. This enables us to control the editing of human bodies by modifying the corresponding latent codes. To train our representation, we employ a bone-guided auto-encoder and an orientation-adaptive weighting strategy. The resulting representation can be applied to various applications, such as human body editing, latent code interpolation, and shape style transfer. Experimental results using public datasets demonstrate the accuracy of our reconstruction and the flexibility of our editing capabilities. The code for our method will be made available.
