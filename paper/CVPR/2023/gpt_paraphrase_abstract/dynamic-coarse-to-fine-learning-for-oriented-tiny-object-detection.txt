Existing detectors face significant challenges in detecting small objects with arbitrary orientations, particularly in assigning labels. Despite recent advancements in adaptive label assignment in oriented object detectors, there are still issues with severe mismatch and imbalance due to the extreme geometry shape and limited features of these small objects. Specifically, the position prior, positive sample feature, and instance are mismatched, and the learning of extreme-shaped objects is biased and unbalanced due to insufficient feature supervision.To address these issues, we propose a solution called DCFL, which consists of a dynamic prior and a coarse-to-fine assigner. Firstly, we model the prior, label assignment, and object representation dynamically to alleviate the mismatch problem. Secondly, we utilize coarse prior matching and finer posterior constraints to assign labels dynamically, providing more appropriate and relatively balanced supervision for diverse instances. Through extensive experiments on six datasets, we demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline detector. Notably, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for one-stage detectors on the DOTA-v1.5, DOTA-v2.0, and DIOR-R datasets when trained and tested at a single scale.
