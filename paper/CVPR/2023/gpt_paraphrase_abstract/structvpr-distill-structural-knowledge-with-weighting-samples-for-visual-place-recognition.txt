Visual place recognition (VPR) is typically seen as an image retrieval problem. However, current deep learning-based methods struggle to extract stable global features from RGB images, requiring a time-consuming re-ranking step to utilize spatial structural information for better performance. To address this, we introduce StructVPR, a novel training architecture that enhances structural knowledge in RGB global features to improve stability in dynamic environments. StructVPR utilizes segmentation images as a more precise source of structural knowledge input into a CNN network and employs knowledge distillation to avoid online segmentation and inference during testing. To enhance the quality of the distilled knowledge, we partition samples and assign weights to each sample's distillation loss. Through this approach, StructVPR achieves impressive performance on multiple benchmarks using only global retrieval and even surpasses the performance of many two-stage methods by a significant margin. With the addition of re-ranking, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining low computational cost.
