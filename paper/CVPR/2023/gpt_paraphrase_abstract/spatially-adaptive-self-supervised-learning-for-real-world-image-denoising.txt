In recent years, there has been significant progress in self-supervised image denoising (SSID). However, most existing methods are designed to handle spatially independent noise and are not practical for real-world sRGB images with spatially correlated noise. While pixel-shuffle downsampling has been suggested as a solution to break the noise correlation, it compromises the original image information and limits the denoising performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that seeks spatially adaptive supervision for denoising real-world sRGB images. Our method takes into consideration the characteristics of flat and textured regions in noisy images and constructs separate supervisions for each. For flat areas, we derive the supervision from non-adjacent pixels, which are far enough from the current pixel to exclude the influence of noise-correlated ones. We extend the blind-spot network to a blind-neighborhood network (BNN) to provide supervision on flat areas. For textured regions, the supervision needs to be closely related to the content of adjacent pixels. To meet this requirement, we introduce a locally aware network (LAN) that selectively supervises itself with the output of BNN. By combining these two supervisions, a denoising network (such as U-Net) can be effectively trained. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art SSID methods on real-world sRGB photographs.
