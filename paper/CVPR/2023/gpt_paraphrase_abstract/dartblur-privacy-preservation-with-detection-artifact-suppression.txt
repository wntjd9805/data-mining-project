Currently, privacy is a major concern in the development of AI algorithms. While machine learning algorithms have the potential to enhance our daily lives, it is crucial to protect personal information from being exposed. Among all types of sensitive information, facial data is particularly vulnerable. As a result, several datasets containing facial information have been removed from the public domain, and the research community is actively searching for solutions to address privacy concerns.To preserve privacy, existing methods can be categorized into two types: blur-based and face replacement-based methods. Blur-based methods, due to their ease of use and accessibility, have become the preferred choice in practical applications. However, the use of blur-based methods can introduce artifacts that negatively impact the performance of downstream tasks.In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving method called DartBlur, which utilizes a deep neural network (DNN) architecture to generate blurred faces. DartBlur effectively conceals facial privacy information while simultaneously suppressing detection artifacts. We have devised four training objectives that specifically aim to improve ease of review and maximize artifact suppression. To optimize our algorithm, we employ an adversarial training strategy with a second-order optimization pipeline.Experimental results demonstrate that DartBlur surpasses existing face replacement methods in terms of ease of review and accessibility. Additionally, it exhibits a distinct advantage in suppressing training artifacts compared to traditional blur-based methods. Our implementation of DartBlur is publicly available at https://github.com/JaNg2333/DartBlur.
