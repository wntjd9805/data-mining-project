Diffusion models have become an effective tool for generating point clouds. These models typically involve iteratively denoising for thousands of steps, resulting in high-quality samples. However, the complexity of learning steps has limited their application in many real-world 3D scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a model called Point Straight Flow (PSF), which achieves impressive performance using just one step. Our approach involves reformulating the standard diffusion model to optimize the learning trajectory into a straight path. Additionally, we employ a distillation strategy to shorten the path without sacrificing performance, allowing for use in real-world 3D applications with latency constraints. We evaluate PSF on various 3D tasks and find that it performs comparably to the standard diffusion model while outperforming other efficient point cloud generation methods. In real-world applications such as point cloud completion and training-free text-guided generation with low-latency requirements, PSF demonstrates favorable performance.
