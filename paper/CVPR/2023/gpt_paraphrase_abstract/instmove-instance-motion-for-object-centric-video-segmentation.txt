Cutting-edge video segmentation methods are limited in their ability to handle occlusion and rapid movement due to their reliance on object appearances, which are susceptible to disturbances. Optical flow is commonly used to provide motion information, but it only considers pixel-level motion and is often inaccurate under occlusion and fast movement. This study introduces InstMove, which focuses on instance-level motion for object-centric video segmentation. Unlike pixel-wise motion, InstMove utilizes instance-level motion information that is not dependent on image feature embeddings, resulting in more accurate and robust segmentation in the presence of occlusion and fast-moving objects. InstMove incorporates instance masks to represent the physical presence of an object and employs a memory network to learn the object's position and shape in the next frame. By integrating InstMove into existing state-of-the-art methods, significant improvements are achieved in three video segmentation tasks. Specifically, a 1.5 AP improvement is observed on the heavily occluded OVIS dataset, and a 4.9 AP improvement is achieved on the YouTubeVIS-Long dataset, which contains predominantly fast-moving objects. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of instance-level motion as a powerful solution for object-centric video segmentation in complex scenarios.
