This paper addresses three limitations of conventional skeleton-based action recognition: skeleton detection and tracking errors, limited variety of targeted actions, and person-wise and frame-wise action recognition. The authors propose a point cloud deep-learning paradigm and a novel deep neural network architecture called Structured Keypoint Pooling. The proposed method aggregates keypoint features based on prior knowledge of the data structure, achieving robustness against input errors. The architecture allows for efficient treatment of time-series keypoints and extends the variety of targeted actions. Additionally, the authors propose a Pooling-Switching Trick inspired by Structured Keypoint Pooling, which enables weakly supervised detection of person-wise and frame-wise actions using only video-level action labels. The proposed method is evaluated in experiments and outperforms state-of-the-art skeleton-based action recognition and spatio-temporal action localization methods.
