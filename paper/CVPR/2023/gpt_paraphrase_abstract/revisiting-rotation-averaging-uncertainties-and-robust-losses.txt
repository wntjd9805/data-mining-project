This paper examines the rotation averaging problem in global Structure-from-Motion pipelines. The authors argue that current methods have a main issue with the cost function, as it is only weakly connected to the input data through estimated epipolar geometries. To address this, they propose a better modeling of noise distributions by directly incorporating uncertainty from point correspondences into rotation averaging. This uncertainty can be obtained for free by considering the Jacobians of two-view refinements. Additionally, the authors explore the integration of a variant of the MAGSAC loss into the rotation averaging problem, instead of using traditional robust losses used in current frameworks. The proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in terms of accuracy on large-scale public benchmarks. The code for the proposed method is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangganlin/GlobalSfMpy.
