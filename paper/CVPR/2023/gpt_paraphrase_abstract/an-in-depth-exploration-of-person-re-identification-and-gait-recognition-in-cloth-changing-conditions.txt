The objective of person re-identification (ReID) and gait recognition is to match individuals under surveillance cameras. However, there is limited research on video-based ReID due to the absence of a suitable benchmark for cloth-changing scenarios, and gait recognition is usually studied under controlled conditions. To address this issue, we propose a Cloth-Changing benchmark for Person re-identification and Gait recognition (CCPG). CCPG is a dataset that captures indoor and outdoor sequences of 200 individuals with various cloth-changing statuses. Unlike previous datasets, CCPG provides both RGB and silhouette versions of the data. We conducted comprehensive experiments on video-based ReID and gait recognition methods to systematically investigate the cloth-changing problem. The results show that both ReID and gait recognition have their strengths in different cloth-changing conditions, suggesting that gait recognition can be a potential solution. The CCPG dataset is available at https://github.com/BNU-IVC/CCPG.
