The Lucas-Kanade (LK) method is a popular algorithm for aligning images, but it often struggles with large distortions. To address this issue, we propose a new method called PRISE, which incorporates star-convex constraints into the optimization problem. Our approach involves training a neural network to learn a star-convex loss landscape around the ground truth, enabling the LK method to converge more accurately. We introduce contrastive (hinge) losses to enforce strong star-convexity during training. We also present an efficient sampling algorithm to reduce training costs and analyze the quality of solutions obtained from PRISE. We evaluate our method on benchmark datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results, particularly for small pixel errors. The code for PRISE can be downloaded from https://github.com/Zhang-VISLab.
