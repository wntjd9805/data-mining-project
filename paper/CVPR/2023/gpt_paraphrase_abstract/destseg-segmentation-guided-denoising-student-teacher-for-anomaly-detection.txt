In computer vision, the problem of detecting visual anomalies is commonly addressed as a one-class classification and segmentation task. The student-teacher (S-T) framework has been successful in tackling this challenge. However, previous approaches using the S-T framework have only applied constraints on normal data and combined multi-level information based on empirical methods. In this study, we propose a superior model called DeSTSeg, which combines a pre-trained teacher network, a denoising student encoder-decoder, and a segmentation network into a single framework. To enhance the constraints on anomalous data, we introduce a denoising procedure that enables the student network to learn more robust representations. By training the student network on synthetically corrupted normal images to match the teacher network's features of the same images without corruption, we improve its performance. Additionally, to effectively integrate the multi-level features from the S-T framework, we train a segmentation network using synthetic anomaly masks, resulting in significant performance enhancement. Experimental results on an industrial inspection benchmark dataset demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an image-level AUC of 98.6%, pixel-level average precision of 75.8%, and instance-level average precision of 76.4%.
