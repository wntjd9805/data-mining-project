The challenge of multi-modal image registration is aligning images with different distributions. This study introduces a self-supervised approach called Indescribable Multi-model SpatialEvaluator (IMSE) to address this challenge. IMSE creates an accurate evaluator to measure spatial differences between images and optimizes registration by minimizing the predicted error of the evaluator. To enhance IMSE performance, a style enhancement method called Shuffle Remap is proposed to randomize and change the image distribution. The results show that IMSE outperforms existing methods for registration using different datasets. IMSE can be easily integrated into the traditional registration process and provides a convenient way to evaluate and visualize registration results. Additionally, IMSE has the potential to be used for image-to-image translation. The code for IMSE is available at the provided GitHub link.
