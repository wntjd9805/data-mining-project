The detection and localization of forged images is challenging due to the significant differences in forgery attributes between images generated in CNN-synthesized and image-editing domains. In order to address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical fine-grained approach for representation learning in image forgery detection and localization (IFDL). Our approach involves representing forgery attributes of manipulated images with multiple labels at different levels, and performing fine-grained classification using the hierarchical dependency between these levels. This encourages the algorithm to learn comprehensive features and the inherent hierarchical nature of different forgery attributes, thereby enhancing the IFDL representation. Our IFDL framework consists of three components: a multi-branch feature extractor, localization module, and classification module. The feature extractor branches classify forgery attributes at different levels, while the localization and classification modules identify pixel-level forgery regions and detect image-level forgery, respectively. Additionally, we have created a hierarchical fine-grained dataset to support our research. We have evaluated the effectiveness of our method on seven different benchmarks, for both IFDL and forgery attribute classification tasks.
