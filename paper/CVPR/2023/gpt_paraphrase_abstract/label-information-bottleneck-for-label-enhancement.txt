This study addresses the challenging problem of Label Enhancement (LE), which involves accurately recovering label distributions from logical labels. The authors propose a novel method called Label Information Bottleneck (LIB) for LE. The recovery process can be hindered by irrelevant information in the dataset, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this, the authors aim to extract the essential label-relevant information to improve recovery performance. The proposed method consists of two joint processes: 1) learning the representation with essential label-relevant information, and 2) recovering label distributions based on the learned representation. The label-relevant information is excavated using the "bottleneck" created by the learned representation. Importantly, the method explores both the label-relevant information related to label assignments and the label-relevant information related to label gaps. The effectiveness and competitiveness of LIB are verified through evaluation experiments conducted on various benchmark label distribution learning datasets. The source codes for LIB are publicly available at https://github.com/qinghai-zheng/LIBLE.
