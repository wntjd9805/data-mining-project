Creating a convenient and efficient model to track and render human-object interactions in four dimensions is crucial for various applications. However, the challenge lies in achieving this using a single RGBD camera. This paper introduces Instant-NVR, a neural approach that combines traditional non-rigid tracking with recent instant radiance field techniques. Instant-NVR utilizes a multi-thread tracking-rendering mechanism and incorporates a robust human-object capture scheme to provide reliable motion priors. It also introduces a novel hybrid deformation module to represent the interacting scene and includes an on-the-fly reconstruction scheme for dynamic/static radiance fields using efficient motion-prior searching. To improve appearance details for online novel-view synthesis, the paper introduces an online key frame selection scheme and a rendering-aware refinement strategy. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Instant-NVR in generating human-object radiance fields in real-time, achieving photo-realistic novel view synthesis even in complex interaction scenarios.
