This paper presents a practical approach to capturing microscale 3D shapes using a teleidoscopic imaging system. The main challenge in reconstructing these shapes is acquiring the target from multiple viewpoints while maintaining a sufficient depth-of-field. Our proposed solution involves using a teleidoscopic measurement system that consists of three planar mirrors and a monocentric lens. The planar mirrors create multiple viewpoints through multiple reflections, while the monocentric lens enables high magnification and clear, surround view even in closeup imaging. Our contributions include a structured ray-pixel camera model that efficiently handles refractive and reflective projection rays, analytical evaluations of the depth of field in our teleidoscopic imaging system, and a practical calibration algorithm for the system. Real image evaluations validate the effectiveness of our measurement system.
