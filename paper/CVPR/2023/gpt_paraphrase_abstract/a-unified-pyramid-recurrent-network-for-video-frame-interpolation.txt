We introduce UPR-Net, a novel Unified Pyramid Recurrent Network for frame interpolation. UPR-Net utilizes lightweight recurrent modules within a flexible pyramid framework to estimate bi-directional flow and synthesize intermediate frames. By incorporating estimated flow at each pyramid level, UPR-Net generates forward-warped representations for frame synthesis. It also enables iterative refinement of both optical flow and intermediate frames across pyramid levels. Our iterative synthesis strategy improves the robustness of frame interpolation, especially in cases with large motion. Despite its lightweight nature (1.7M parameters), our UPR-Net performs exceptionally well on various benchmarks. The code and trained models of UPR-Net can be found at: https://github.com/srcn-ivl/UPR-Net.
