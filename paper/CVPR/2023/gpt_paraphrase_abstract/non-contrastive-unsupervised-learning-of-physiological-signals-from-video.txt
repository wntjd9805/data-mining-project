This abstract discusses the extraction of subtle periodic signals, such as blood volume pulse and respiration, from RGB video for non-contact health monitoring at a low cost. Currently, advancements in remote pulse estimation rely on deep learning solutions that are trained and evaluated on benchmark datasets with ground truth from contact-PPG sensors. However, this study presents a novel unsupervised learning framework for signal regression that eliminates the need for labeled video data. By assuming periodicity and finite bandwidth, the proposed approach discovers the blood volume pulse directly from unlabeled videos. The study demonstrates that encouraging sparse power spectra within physiological band limits and variance over batches of power spectra is enough to learn visual features of periodic signals. The first experiments using unlabeled video data, not specifically created for remote pulse estimation, are conducted to train robust pulse rate estimators. With limited biases and promising empirical results, this approach has the potential to discover other periodic signals from video, enabling multiple physiological measurements without relying on ground truth signals.
