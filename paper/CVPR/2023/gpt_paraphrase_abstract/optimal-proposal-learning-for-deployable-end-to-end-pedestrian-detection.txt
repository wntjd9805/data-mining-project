This paper presents a new framework called Optimal Proposal Learning (OPL) for end-to-end pedestrian detection. The goal is to develop a deployable pedestrian detection model without using Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) post-processing, which is time-consuming and complex. The proposed framework utilizes a CNN-based light detector and introduces two novel modules: Coarse-to-Fine (C2F) learning strategy and Completed Proposal Network (CPN). The C2F strategy improves the accuracy of positive proposals by reducing ambiguity in sample assignment during training and testing. The CPN module provides additional information to recall hard pedestrian samples. The effectiveness of the OPL method is demonstrated through extensive experiments on CrowdHuman, TJU-Ped, and Caltech datasets, where it outperforms other existing methods.
