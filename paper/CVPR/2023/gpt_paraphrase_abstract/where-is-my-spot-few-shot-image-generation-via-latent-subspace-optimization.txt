This paper addresses the challenge of generating diverse images of an unseen category with limited training data. The authors propose a method of projecting sparse few-shot samples into a continuous latent space to generate an infinite number of unseen samples. They introduce a centroid latent position in a conditional StyleGAN, where the corresponding output image maximizes similarity with the given samples. The authors assume that the neighboring latent subspace around the centroid belongs to the novel category and introduce two latent subspace optimization objectives. The first objective adjusts the StyleGAN to produce results with the new class label condition using few-shot samples as positive anchors. The second objective alters the centroid and its surrounding latent subspace to generate more precise images of the novel class. These reciprocal optimization objectives inject the novel class into the StyleGAN latent subspace, enabling easy production of new unseen samples. The authors conducted extensive experiments that demonstrated superior few-shot generation performance compared to existing methods, particularly in terms of diversity and generation quality.
