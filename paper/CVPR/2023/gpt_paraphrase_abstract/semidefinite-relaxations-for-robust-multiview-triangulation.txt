We suggest a method using convex relaxations to achieve robust and optimal multiview triangulation. By incorporating a least squares cost function, we expand current relaxation approaches to include non-robust multiview triangulation. We propose two formulations: one based on epipolar constraints and another based on fractional reprojection constraints. The first formulation is lower dimensional and remains accurate in the presence of moderate noise and outliers, while the second formulation is higher dimensional, slower, but maintains accuracy even with extreme noise and outliers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed approaches enable the computation of provably optimal reconstructions, even in the presence of significant noise and a high percentage of outliers.
