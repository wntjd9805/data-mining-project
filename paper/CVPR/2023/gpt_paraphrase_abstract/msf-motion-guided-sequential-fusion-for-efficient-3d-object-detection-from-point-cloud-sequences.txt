The paper introduces an efficient method called Motion-guided Sequential Fusion (MSF) for object detection in point cloud sequences. It addresses the issue of redundant computation in current multi-frame detectors by exploiting the continuity of object motion. The MSF method generates 3D proposals on the current frame and propagates them to preceding frames based on estimated velocities. Points-of-interest are pooled from the sequence and encoded as proposal features. The method also includes a Bidi-rectional Feature Aggregation (BiFA) module to enhance interactions between proposal features across frames. Additionally, a voxel-based sampling technique is optimized for point cloud pooling to achieve faster processing times. The proposed MSF method demonstrates improved efficiency and accuracy compared to other multi-frame detectors, achieving 83.12% and 78.30% mAP on the LEVEL1 and LEVEL2 test sets of Waymo Open Dataset, respectively.
