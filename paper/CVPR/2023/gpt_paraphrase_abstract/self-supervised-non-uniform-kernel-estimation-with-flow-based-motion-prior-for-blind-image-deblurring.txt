Many existing deep learning methods for blind image de-blurring are not effective in real-world scenarios because they do not consider important prior information about diverse and spatially varying motion blur. Although some methods attempt to estimate non-uniform blur kernels using CNNs, accurate estimation is still difficult due to the lack of ground truth data. To address these challenges, we propose a new approach that represents the field of motion blur kernels in a latent space using normalizing flows. Instead of directly estimating motion kernels, our method utilizes CNNs to predict the latent codes. To enhance the accuracy and robustness of non-uniform kernel estimation, we incorporate uncertainty learning and introduce a multi-scale kernel attention module to better integrate image features with estimated kernels. Extensive experiments, particularly on real-world blur datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves superior results in terms of both subjective and objective quality. It also exhibits excellent generalization performance for non-uniform image deblurring. The code for our method is publicly available at https://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/wsdong/Projects/UFPNet.htm.
