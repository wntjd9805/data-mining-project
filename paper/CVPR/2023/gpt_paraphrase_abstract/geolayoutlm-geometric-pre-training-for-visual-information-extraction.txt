Visual information extraction (VIE) is a crucial aspect of Document Intelligence, consisting of two tasks: semantic entity recognition (SER) and relation extraction (RE). While pre-trained models have made significant progress in SER, they often lack the ability to effectively incorporate geometric information, which is essential for RE. Another limitation is the gap between pre-training and fine-tuning phases for RE. To address these challenges, we propose GeoLayoutLM, a multi-modal framework for VIE. GeoLayoutLM explicitly models geometric relations through geometric pre-training tasks. Additionally, we introduce novel relation heads that are pre-trained using geometric pre-training tasks and fine-tuned for RE, enhancing feature representation. Our extensive experiments on standard VIE benchmarks demonstrate that GeoLayoutLM achieves competitive scores in SER and significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models in RE. For example, on the FUNSD dataset, the F1 score for RE improves from 80.35% to 89.45%. This highlights the importance of geometric information in RE. We also provide examples showing the limitations of previous models in handling geometric layout. By introducing a simple geometric restriction, we demonstrate a performance improvement in RE.
