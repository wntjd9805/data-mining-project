We present a new algorithm called context-based trit-plane coding (CTC) for achieving more efficient progressive image compression. Unlike traditional trit-plane coding, CTC incorporates autoregressive context models to improve compression efficiency. Our algorithm consists of three modules: a context-based rate reduction module, a context-based distortion reduction module, and a retraining scheme for the decoder. The rate reduction module accurately estimates trit probabilities, allowing for more compact encoding of the trit-planes. The distortion reduction module refines partial latent tensors and enhances the quality of the reconstructed image. The retraining scheme improves the rate-distortion tradeoffs of the decoder. Experimental results demonstrate that CTC outperforms the baseline trit-plane codec significantly, achieving a BD-rate improvement of -14.84% on the Kodak lossless dataset with minimal increase in time complexity.
