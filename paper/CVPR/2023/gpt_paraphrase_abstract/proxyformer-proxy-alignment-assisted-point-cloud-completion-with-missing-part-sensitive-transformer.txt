The incomplete nature of captured point clouds due to equipment defects or limited viewpoints necessitates the recovery of complete point clouds for practical tasks. This paper introduces a new point cloud completion approach called ProxyFormer, which divides point clouds into existing and missing parts. Information is exchanged between these parts through proxies. The proposed method fuses information into point proxies using feature and position extractors, and generates features for missing point proxies based on the features of existing point proxies. To improve the perception of missing points' positions, a missing part sensitive transformer is designed, which converts random normal distribution into reasonable position information and refines the missing proxies through proxy alignment. This enhances the sensitivity of predicted point proxies to missing part features and positions, making them more suitable for subsequent coarse-to-fine processes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art completion networks on benchmark datasets and achieves the fastest inference speed.
