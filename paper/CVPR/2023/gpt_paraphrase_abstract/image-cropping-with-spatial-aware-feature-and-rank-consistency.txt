Current methods for image cropping lack the ability to capture the spatial relationship between crops and aesthetic elements. Additionally, the high cost of labeling data limits the potential of utilizing unlabeled data. In order to address these issues, we propose a spatial-aware feature that encodes the relationship between candidate crops and aesthetic elements. This is achieved by combining crop masks and selectively aggregated feature maps, which are then fed into a lightweight encoder. Furthermore, we train a pair-wise ranking classifier on labeled images and transfer this knowledge to unlabeled images to ensure rank consistency. Our experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
