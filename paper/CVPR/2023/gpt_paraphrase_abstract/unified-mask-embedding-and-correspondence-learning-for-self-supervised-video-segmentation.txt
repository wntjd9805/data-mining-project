This paper aims to develop a self-supervised learning method for video object segmentation. The proposed framework simultaneously models dense correspondence between frames to learn discriminative features and incorporates object-level context for decoding target masks. Unlike previous approaches that rely on copying labels based on pixel correlations, our algorithm directly learns sequential segmentation from unlabeled videos. It involves clustering video pixels to create pseudo segmentation labels and utilizes these labels to learn mask encoding and decoding for video object segmentation. Additionally, unsupervised correspondence learning is incorporated to ensure a generic representation and prevent cluster degeneracy. Our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results on two standard benchmarks (DAVIS17 and YouTube-VOS) and bridges the gap between self-supervised and fully-supervised video object segmentation in terms of performance and network architecture design.
