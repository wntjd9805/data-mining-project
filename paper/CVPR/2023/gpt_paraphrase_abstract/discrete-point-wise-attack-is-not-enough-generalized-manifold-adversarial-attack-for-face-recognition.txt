Traditional adversarial attacks for Face Recognition (FR) models generate discrete examples for a specific target identity using a single state image. However, this point-wise attack approach lacks generalization against various unknown identity states and can be easily defended against. In this study, we propose a new pipeline called Generalized Manifold Adversarial Attack (GMAA) to improve attack performance by expanding the range of attack. GMAA expands the target from one to many, promoting better generalization for the generated adversarial examples. Additionally, it expands the adversarial examples from discrete points to a manifold by utilizing the knowledge that facial expression changes can be continuous. This augmentation mechanism enhances the effectiveness of the attack. Furthermore, we introduce a dual supervision approach with local and global constraints to improve the visual quality of the generated adversarial examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing that GMAA offers a semantic continuous adversarial space with higher generalization ability and visual quality.
