We present a solution to the challenge of identifying tree rings in microscopy images of shrub cross sections. This task is a specific case of instance segmentation and comes with unique difficulties, including the circular ring shape of the objects and the need for high precision, which current methods struggle to meet. To address these challenges, we propose a novel iterative approach called Iterative Next Boundary Detection (INBD). This method intuitively models the natural growth direction of the shrub by starting from the center of the cross section and iteratively detecting the boundaries of each ring. Our experiments demonstrate that INBD outperforms generic instance segmentation methods and is the only one that incorporates chronological order in its detection process. For those interested in replicating or building upon our work, our dataset and source code are available at http://github.com/alexander-g/INBD.
