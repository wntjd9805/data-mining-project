Existing deep learning-based edge detectors rely on pixel-wise labels provided by multiple annotators. However, these methods often overlook the inherent ambiguity of edges and the biases present in annotator labels. To address this issue, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware edge detector (UAED). UAED utilizes uncertainty to explore the subjectivity and ambiguity of diverse annotations. We start by converting the deterministic label space into a learnable Gaussian distribution. The variance of this distribution reflects the level of ambiguity among different annotations. By considering the learned variance as the estimated uncertainty of predicted edge maps, we can identify pixels with higher uncertainty, which are likely to be challenging for edge detection. To leverage the information from these uncertain pixels, we introduce an adaptive weighting loss. This loss function emphasizes learning from pixels with high uncertainty, enabling the network to focus on important areas. UAED can be combined with various encoder-decoder backbones, and extensive experiments demonstrate its consistently superior performance across multiple edge detection benchmarks. For further details and implementation, the source code of UAED is available at https://github.com/ZhouCX117/UAED.
