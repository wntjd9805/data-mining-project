The Intersection-over-Union (IoU) metric is widely used to evaluate the performance of 3D object detection. However, recent methods applying IoU to 3D bounding box regression have shown issues with abnormal gradient behavior in relation to angular error and object scale. This leads to slow convergence and suboptimal regression. In this paper, we propose a Gradient-Corrected IoU (GCIoU) loss to address these problems. Our approach includes a gradient correction strategy that ensures the model converges quickly during early training stages and achieves precise refinement of bounding boxes later on. Additionally, we introduce a gradient rescaling strategy to optimize the step size for objects at different scales. We integrate the GCIoU loss into multiple models, resulting in stable performance improvements and faster convergence. Experiments on the KITTI dataset confirm the superiority of our proposed method.
