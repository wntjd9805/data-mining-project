Point cloud sampling is an area of research that has not been widely explored in terms of data representation. The most commonly used methods for sampling point clouds are random sampling and farthest point sampling. However, with the advancement of neural networks, there have been various task-based learning methods proposed for sampling point clouds. These methods are primarily generative-based and do not directly utilize mathematical statistics for point selection. This paper introduces a novel non-generative method called Attention-based Point cloud Edge Sampling (APES), which draws inspiration from the Canny edge detection algorithm for images and incorporates the attention mechanism. APES identifies salient points in the outline of the point cloud. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our sampling method compared to existing approaches on standard benchmark tasks.
