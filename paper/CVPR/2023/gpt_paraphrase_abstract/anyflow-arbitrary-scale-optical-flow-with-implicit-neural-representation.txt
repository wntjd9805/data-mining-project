To effectively use optical flow in practical applications, it is often necessary to resize the input to smaller dimensions in order to reduce computational costs. However, downsizing the input poses challenges in accurately estimating flow, as smaller objects and motion ranges become harder to model. While recent approaches have shown high-quality flow estimation, they struggle to accurately represent small objects and precise boundaries when the input resolution is lowered, limiting their applicability to high-resolution inputs. In this study, we present AnyFlow, a robust network that accurately estimates flow from images of various resolutions. By representing optical flow as a continuous coordinate-based representation, AnyFlow is able to generate outputs at arbitrary scales from low-resolution inputs, resulting in superior performance compared to previous methods in capturing small objects with detailed preservation across a wide range of scenes. We achieve a new state-of-the-art performance in cross-dataset generalization on the KITTI dataset, while also achieving comparable accuracy to other state-of-the-art methods on online benchmarks.
