Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have achieved visually pleasing results, but their high computational cost limits their applications on resource-limited platforms. Previous methods to improve DPM efficiency have focused on accelerating testing, neglecting their complexity and size. This paper aims to lighten DPM while maintaining its performance. Starting with a small latent diffusion model (LDM), a fidelity drop is observed in synthetic images. Through assessment, it is discovered that DPM is biased against high-frequency generation and learns to recover different frequency components at different time-steps. This prevents compact networks from accurately representing frequency dynamics with high-frequency estimation. To address this, a customized design called Spectral Diffusion (SD) is proposed for light-weight image synthesis. SD incorporates wavelet gating to extract frequency dynamic features at each reverse step and conducts spectrum-aware distillation to promote high-frequency recovery. Experimental results show that SD achieves 8-18Ã— computational complexity reduction compared to latent diffusion models in various image generation tasks while maintaining competitive image fidelity.
