Current few-shot medical segmentation networks often rely on increasing the number of prototypes to improve performance. This can be explained by the concept of Vector Quantization (VQ), where more prototypes result in better separation of clusters in the feature space. However, the clustering of feature points and the ability to adapt to unseen tasks have not been sufficiently addressed in few-shot segmentation. In light of this, we propose a learning VQ mechanism composed of grid-format VQ (GFVQ), self-organized VQ (SOVQ), and residual oriented VQ (ROVQ). GFVQ generates prototypes by averaging square grids, ensuring uniform quantization of local details. SOVQ assigns feature points to different local classes adaptively, creating a new representation space where learnable local prototypes are updated globally. ROVQ introduces residual information to fine-tune the learned local prototypes without re-training, leading to improved generalization performance. Our VQ framework achieves state-of-the-art results on abdominal, cardiac, and prostate MRI datasets, and we hope this work will prompt a reevaluation of current few-shot medical segmentation model design. The code for our framework will be made publicly available soon.
