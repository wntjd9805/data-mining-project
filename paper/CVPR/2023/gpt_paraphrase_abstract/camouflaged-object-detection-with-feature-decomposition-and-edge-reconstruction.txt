The detection of camouflaged objects is a challenging task due to their similarity to the background and ambiguous boundaries. Existing approaches mimic the human visual system, but struggle when faced with highly deceptive camouflaged objects. In this paper, we propose the FEDER model for camouflaged object detection (COD). The FEDER model decomposes features into different frequency bands using learnable wavelets and focuses on informative bands to differentiate foreground and background. It includes a frequency attention module and a guidance-based feature aggregation module. To address the ambiguous boundary problem, we introduce an auxiliary edge reconstruction task. The FEDER model utilizes an ordinary differential equation-inspired edge reconstruction module to generate precise object boundaries. Experimental results demonstrate that our FEDER model outperforms existing methods with lower computational and memory costs. The code for our model will be made available at https://github.com/ChunmingHe/FEDER.
