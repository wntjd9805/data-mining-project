In recent years, there has been a rise in the development of high-quality 3D-aware GANs that utilize neural rendering techniques. These 3D GANs can be combined with GAN inversion methods to project real images into the latent space of the generator, enabling consistent synthesis and editing from various viewpoints, known as 3D GAN inversion. However, reconstructing a 3D portrait from a single monocular image remains a challenging task, even with the facial prior preserved in pre-trained 3D GANs. Existing 2D GAN inversion methods often focus solely on texture similarity, disregarding the accuracy of 3D geometry shapes. This can lead to issues such as geometry collapse, particularly when reconstructing side faces in extreme poses, and blurry synthetic results in novel views.In this study, we propose a new approach to enhance 3D GAN inversion by incorporating facial symmetry as a prior. We establish a pipeline and constraints that leverage a pseudo auxiliary view obtained through image flipping. This auxiliary view helps ensure that the inversion process produces a geometry shape that is consistent across different views and well-structured. To improve the fidelity of textures in unobserved viewpoints, we utilize pseudo labels generated through depth-guided 3D warping, which provides additional supervision. Furthermore, we introduce constraints to identify and filter out conflict areas in situations where asymmetry is present. Our method is thoroughly evaluated through quantitative and qualitative assessments of image reconstruction and editing, demonstrating its superior performance.Overall, our approach presents a novel solution for promoting 3D GAN inversion by incorporating facial symmetry as a prior, resulting in improved reconstruction and editing capabilities.
