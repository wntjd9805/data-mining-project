This study focuses on the challenge of editing 3D geometry and aims to simplify the process by using natural language commands. The goal is to allow users to easily modify the shape of 3D models by providing instructions such as making certain parts thinner or creating holes. To address this problem and enable detailed shape edits, the researchers have created a large dataset called ShapeTalk, which consists of over half a million descriptive sentences comparing the shapes of different 3D objects. They have also developed a framework called ChangeIt3D, which utilizes ShapeTalk and any 3D generative model to generate edits that closely align with the given instructions. Additionally, the researchers have introduced evaluation metrics to assess the effectiveness of language-assisted shape editing methods. It is worth noting that ShapeTalk eliminates the need for converting 2D to 3D using methods like neural rendering, which is required in existing image-language models. The code and data for this study are publicly available at https://changeit3d.github.io/.
