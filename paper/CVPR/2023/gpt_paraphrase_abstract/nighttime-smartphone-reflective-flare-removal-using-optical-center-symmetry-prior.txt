Reflective flare in photos, caused by light reflecting inside lenses, can degrade image quality. Existing methods for detecting and eliminating reflective flare often fail to identify all types of flares and may mistakenly remove light sources. To address this, we propose an optical center symmetry prior that suggests flare and light source are symmetrical around the lens's optical center. This prior helps accurately locate flare regions and is applicable to most smartphone cameras. We introduce a dataset called BracketFlare, containing diverse and realistic flare patterns, captured using continuous bracketing. By training neural networks on this dataset, we can effectively remove reflective flares. Our method demonstrates its effectiveness on both synthetic and real-world datasets through extensive experiments.
