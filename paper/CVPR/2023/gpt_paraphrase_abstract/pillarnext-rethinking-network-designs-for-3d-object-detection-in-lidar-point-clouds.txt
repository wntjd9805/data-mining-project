Most LiDAR based 3D object detection studies focus on designing specialized local point aggregators to handle sparse and unstructured raw point clouds. However, this paper proposes a different perspective by considering the allocation of computational resources. Surprisingly, the simplest pillar based models achieve high accuracy and low latency. Moreover, incorporating ideas from 2D object detection, such as increasing the receptive field, significantly improves performance. Through extensive experiments, the paper demonstrates that pillar based networks with modernized designs in architecture and training outperform existing methods on popular benchmarks like Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes. This challenges the common belief that detailed geometry modeling is crucial for achieving high performance in 3D object detection.
