Data augmentation (DA) is a useful method for enhancing the performance of deep neural networks, particularly in single image super-resolution (SR). However, there has been little research on DA techniques for light field SR, which requires the utilization of multi-view information. In this study, we introduce a new DA strategy called CutMIB specifically designed for light field SR. CutMIB maintains the structure of existing light field SR networks while improving their performance. It achieves this by first cutting low-resolution (LR) patches from each view at the same location. These LR patches are then blended together to create a blended patch, which is subsequently pasted onto the corresponding regions of high-resolution light field views and vice versa. Through this process, CutMIB enables light field SR networks to learn from implicit geometric information during training. Experimental results demonstrate that CutMIB significantly enhances the reconstruction performance and angular consistency of existing light field SR networks. We also validate the effectiveness of CutMIB in real-world light field SR and light field denoising tasks. The implementation code for CutMIB can be found at the following GitHub link: https://github.com/zeyuxiao1997/CutMIB.
