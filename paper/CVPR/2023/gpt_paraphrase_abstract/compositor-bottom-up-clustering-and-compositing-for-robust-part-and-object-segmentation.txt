This study introduces a robust method for jointly segmenting object parts and objects. The authors propose a hierarchical feature representation that includes pixel, part, and object-level embeddings to solve the segmentation problem in a bottom-up clustering approach. By grouping pixels into clusters using part-level embeddings as cluster centers, the authors are able to obtain object masks through composition of part proposals. This bottom-up interaction effectively integrates information from lower semantic levels to higher semantic levels, resulting in improved segmentation mask quality. The authors' novel approach, called Compositor, achieves state-of-the-art performance on PartImageNet and Pascal-Part datasets, surpassing previous methods by approximately 0.9% and 1.3% on PartImageNet, and 0.4% and 1.7% on Pascal-Part in terms of part and object mean Intersection over Union (mIoU). Additionally, Compositor demonstrates enhanced robustness against occlusion, with improvements of approximately 4.4% and 7.1% on part and object segmentation, respectively.
