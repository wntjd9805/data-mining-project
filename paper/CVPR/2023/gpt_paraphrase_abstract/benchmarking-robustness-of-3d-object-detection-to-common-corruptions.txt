This study focuses on the robustness of 3D object detection systems in autonomous driving. While these systems perform well under normal conditions, they often struggle with real-world corruptions such as adverse weather and sensor noises, raising concerns about their safety and reliability. To address this issue, the researchers create 27 types of common corruptions for both LiDAR and camera inputs, taking into account realistic driving scenarios. These corruptions are applied to public datasets, resulting in the creation of three corruption robustness benchmarks: KITTI-C, nuScenes-C, and Waymo-C. The researchers then conduct extensive experiments using 24 different 3D object detection models to assess their robustness against these corruptions. The evaluation reveals several important findings, including the significant performance drop caused by motion-level corruptions, the improved resilience of LiDAR-camera fusion models, and the vulnerability of camera-only models to image corruptions, highlighting the importance of LiDAR point clouds. The benchmarks and codes generated from this study are made publicly available to support future research in this area.
