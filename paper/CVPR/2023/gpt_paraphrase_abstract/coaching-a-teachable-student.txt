We present a new approach to teach a sensorimotor student agent how to drive using a privileged teacher agent. Existing methods for distilling knowledge to sensorimotor agents often lead to suboptimal driving behavior in the student, which we believe is due to differences in input, modeling capacity, and optimization processes between the two agents. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel distillation scheme that narrows the gap between the sensorimotor agent and its privileged teacher. Our approach involves training the student to align its input features with the teacher's privileged Bird's Eye View (BEV) space, allowing the student to benefit from direct supervision in internal representation learning. To support the challenging sensorimotor learning task, we optimize the student model using a student-paced coaching mechanism with additional supervision. We also introduce a high-capacity imitation learning privileged agent that outperforms previous agents in CARLA, ensuring the student learns safe driving behavior. Our sensorimotor agent achieves significant improvements in driving score in CARLA, surpassing current models by more than 20.6%, without the need for LiDAR, historical observations, ensemble of models, on-policy data aggregation, or reinforcement learning.
