The proposed Debiasing-TSTAS (D-TSTAS) framework addresses the label bias issue in timestamp supervised temporal action segmentation (TSTAS) methods. Previous approaches heavily rely on sparse timestamp annotations, leading to unsatisfactory performance. The D-TSTAS framework consists of two phases: Initialization and Refinement.   In the Initialization phase, the D-TSTAS framework introduces masked timestamp predictions (MTP) to reduce the dependency on annotated frames. This ensures that the initialized model captures more contextual information.   In the Refinement phase, the D-TSTAS framework overcomes the limitation of sparsely annotated timestamps by proposing a center-oriented timestamp expansion (CTE) approach. CTE progressively expands pseudo-timestamp groups that contain semantic-rich motion representation of action segments. Pseudo-labels generated from these pseudo-timestamp groups and the model output are used to refine the model in a fully supervised setup. Additionally, a segmental confidence loss is introduced to improve the model's confidence predictions within the pseudo-timestamp groups and enhance the accuracy of action boundaries.  Experimental results show that the D-TSTAS framework outperforms the state-of-the-art TSTAS method and achieves competitive results compared to fully supervised approaches on three benchmark datasets.
