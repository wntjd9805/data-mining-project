We introduce Mask Auto-Labeler (MAL), a Transformer-based framework for automatically generating high-quality masks for instance segmentation using only box annotations. MAL takes box-cropped images as input and generates mask pseudo-labels based on conditional generation. Our study demonstrates that Vision Transformers excel as mask auto-labelers, bridging the gap between auto-labeling and human annotation in terms of mask quality. By training instance segmentation models using MAL-generated masks, we achieve performance levels that are nearly on par with fully-supervised models, retaining up to 97.4% of their performance. Our best model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 44.1% on COCO instance segmentation (test-dev 2017), surpassing state-of-the-art box-supervised methods by significant margins. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the masks produced by MAL are sometimes even superior to human annotations.
