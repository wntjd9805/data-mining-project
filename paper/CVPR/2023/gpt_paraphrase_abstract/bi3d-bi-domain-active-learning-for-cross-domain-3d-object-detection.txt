The performance gap between unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques and fully annotated supervised models in 3D cross-domain tasks is still significant. To address this, we propose a Bi-domain active learning approach called Bi3D for cross-domain 3D object detection. Bi3D utilizes a domainness-aware source sampling strategy to avoid interference from irrelevant source data and a diversity-based target sampling strategy to select the most informative subset of target data with minimal annotation cost. We evaluate Bi3D on various cross-domain adaptation scenarios and achieve a promising target-domain detection accuracy of 89.63% on KITTI, surpassing UDA-based approaches (84.29%) and even outperforming the detector trained on the fully labeled target domain (88.98%).
