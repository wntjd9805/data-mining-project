This paper introduces a new approach called visual recognition by request (ViRReq) to address the limitations of current visual recognition algorithms. The authors propose decomposing visual recognition into smaller tasks called requests and utilizing a hierarchical and text-based dictionary called a knowledge base to define these tasks. ViRReq enables the learning of complex whole-part hierarchies with incomplete annotations and allows for the easy insertion of new concepts. The authors also integrate language-driven recognition into existing semantic and instance segmentation methods to establish a strong baseline. The effectiveness of ViRReq is demonstrated on two datasets, CPP and ADE20K, which contain hierarchical whole-part annotations.
