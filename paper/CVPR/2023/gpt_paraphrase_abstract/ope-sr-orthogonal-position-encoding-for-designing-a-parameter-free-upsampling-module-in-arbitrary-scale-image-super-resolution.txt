This paper introduces a novel approach to arbitrary-scale image super-resolution using orthogonal position encoding (OPE) and an OPE-Upscale module. The traditional method, implicit neural representation (INR), relies on position encoding but requires training parameters. In contrast, the OPE-Upscale module does not require any training parameters and directly performs linear combination operations, allowing for continuous and arbitrary-scale image reconstruction. The proposed method is computationally efficient and consumes less memory compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the method achieves comparable results in arbitrary-scale image super-resolution. Furthermore, the paper validates the design principle of OPE by showing its correspondence to a set of orthogonal basis.
