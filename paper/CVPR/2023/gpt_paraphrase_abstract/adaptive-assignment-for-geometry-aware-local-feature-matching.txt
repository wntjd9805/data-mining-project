The popularity of detector-free feature matching approaches is growing due to their impressive performance. However, these methods still face challenges when it comes to large-scale and viewpoint variations. This is because the mutual nearest neighbour criterion used in patch-level matching leads to geometric inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose AdaMatcher. This approach incorporates a feature interaction module to achieve feature correlation and co-visible area estimation. It then employs adaptive assignment in patch-level matching while estimating the scales between images. Finally, it refines co-visible matches through scale alignment and a sub-pixel regression module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdaMatcher surpasses solid baselines and achieves state-of-the-art results in various downstream tasks. Furthermore, the adaptive assignment and sub-pixel refinement module can be utilized to enhance the performance of other matching methods, such as SuperGlue. The code for AdaMatcher will be made publicly available at https://github.com/AbyssGaze/AdaMatcher.
