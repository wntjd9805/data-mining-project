Deep learning-based multi-view stereo techniques have become popular for reconstructing detailed objects from multiple viewpoints. However, current methods often overlook surface topology, resulting in incomplete reconstructions for textureless regions and surface boundaries. In order to overcome this limitation, we propose utilizing point-to-surface distance to enable the model to perceive a wider range of surfaces. By predicting the distance volume from the cost volume, we can estimate the signed distance of points surrounding the surface. Our proposed RA-MVSNet approach is patch-aware, enhancing perception range by associating hypothetical planes with surface patches. This strategy improves the completion of textureless regions and reduces outliers at the boundary. Additionally, the introduced distance volume allows for generating mesh topologies with fine details. Compared to traditional deep learning-based multi-view stereo methods, our RA-MVSNet approach achieves more comprehensive reconstruction results by leveraging signed distance supervision. Experimental results on the DTU and Tanks & Temples datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art results.
