Current high dynamic range (HDR) image fusion algorithms can blend multiple exposures, but they struggle when dealing with HDR imaging in low-light situations where the dynamic range is vast and the noise within one exposure varies spatially. Existing image denoising algorithms and HDR fusion algorithms are not effective in handling this issue, resulting in limitations for low-light HDR imaging. This paper presents two contributions. Firstly, the problem is identified as the co-existence of spatially varying signal-to-noise ratio and a wide luminance range within each exposure. It is found that while the issue can be addressed using a bank of denoisers, the complexity is high. Secondly, a new method called the spatially varying high dynamic range (SV-HDR) fusion network is proposed to simultaneously denoise and fuse images. This method introduces an exposure-shared block within a custom-designed multi-scale transformer framework. In various testing conditions, the proposed SV-HDR method outperforms existing methods.
