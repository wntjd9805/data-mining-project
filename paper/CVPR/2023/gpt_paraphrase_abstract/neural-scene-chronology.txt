The objective of this study is to develop a time-varying 3D model that can generate realistic renderings of large landmarks using Internet photos. The main challenges involve disentangling different types of temporal changes in the images and handling discrete and sporadic scene-level changes. To address these challenges, the researchers propose a new scene representation method that uses a temporal step function encoding to model discrete content changes over time. They also collect a dataset of four scenes with varying changes over time to aid in chronology reconstruction. The proposed method achieves impressive view synthesis results and allows for independent control of viewpoint, time, and illumination.
