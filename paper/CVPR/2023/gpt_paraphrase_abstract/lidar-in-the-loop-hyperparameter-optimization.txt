LiDAR is an important technology for 3D vision, where it uses light pulses to measure distances and create 3D point clouds. These point clouds are then used in various applications, such as training datasets or input for inference in 3D vision models. However, existing LiDAR systems are treated as fixed black boxes, and downstream methods are designed to be robust to fluctuations in measurements. This study proposes a different approach by directly optimizing LiDAR parameters for downstream tasks. To do this, a realistic LiDAR simulation method is developed to generate raw waveforms for the LiDAR system. A nonlinear multi-objective optimization problem is solved using a stochastic algorithm to optimize LiDAR parameters for 3D object detection and depth error metrics. The proposed method outperforms manual expert tuning in automotive 3D object detection models by 39.5% mean Average Precision.
