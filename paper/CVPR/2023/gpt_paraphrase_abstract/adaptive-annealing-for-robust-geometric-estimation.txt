Geometric estimation problems in computer vision often involve minimizing statistical loss functions to account for outliers in the data. However, this approach often leads to many local minima in the energy landscape. To address this issue, some methods use annealing techniques to adjust the scale parameter of the loss functions, such as graduated non-convexity (GNC). However, little attention has been given to the annealing schedule, resulting in a poor balance between speed and accuracy, as well as unreliable convergence to the global minimum. In this study, we propose a systematic approach to adaptively anneal the scale parameter in GNC by monitoring the positive-definiteness (local convexity) of the Hessian matrix of the cost function. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using the problem of registering 3D correspondences in the presence of noise and outliers. Additionally, we develop approximations to the Hessian matrix that greatly accelerate our method. We validate the performance of our approach by comparing it with state-of-the-art 3D registration methods on various synthetic and real datasets. Our approach achieves high accuracy and efficiency, reliably converging to the global solution better than existing methods.
