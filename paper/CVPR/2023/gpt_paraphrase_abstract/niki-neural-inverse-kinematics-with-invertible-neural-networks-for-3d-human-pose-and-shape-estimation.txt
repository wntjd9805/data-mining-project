This work presents NIKI, a novel method for 3D human pose and shape estimation. Existing methods either prioritize robustness to occlusions or pixel-aligned accuracy in non-occlusion cases, but not both. NIKI addresses this limitation by utilizing bi-directional errors to improve both robustness and mesh-image alignment. It achieves this by learning from both forward and inverse processes using invertible networks. In the inverse process, NIKI separates errors from the plausible 3D pose manifold, enhancing robustness. In the forward process, zero-error boundary conditions are enforced to improve sensitivity to reliable joint positions and enhance mesh-image alignment. NIKI also emulates analytical inverse kinematics algorithms for better interpretability. Experimental results on standard and occlusion-specific benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of NIKI in simultaneously achieving robust and well-aligned results.
