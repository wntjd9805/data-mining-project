We introduce ARTrack, a visual object tracking framework that uses an autoregressive approach. Rather than focusing solely on per-frame localization accuracy like existing template matching trackers, ARTrack interprets tracking as a sequence interpretation task. It progressively estimates object trajectories by considering previous states and their impact on subsequences. This time-autoregressive method allows ARTrack to effectively trace objects across frames. Unlike other trackers, ARTrack does not require customized localization heads or post-processing steps, making it simple and straightforward. Despite its simplicity, ARTrack achieves top performance on popular benchmark datasets. The source code for ARTrack is available at https://github.com/MIV-XJTU/ARTrack.
