This paper introduces QCNet, a modeling framework designed to enhance trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles. The existing agent-centric modeling approach requires repetitive computations during online prediction, which hinders efficiency. To address this issue, QCNet proposes a query-centric paradigm for scene encoding, allowing for the reuse of past computations and independent representations of the global spacetime coordinate system. Additionally, QCNet tackles the challenge of capturing the multimodality in agents' future behavior by employing anchor-free queries for trajectory proposals and a refinement module using anchor-based queries. This query-based decoder significantly outperforms other methods on motion forecasting benchmarks, achieving 1st place rankings. Moreover, the query-centric design enables streaming scene encoding and parallel multi-agent decoding.
