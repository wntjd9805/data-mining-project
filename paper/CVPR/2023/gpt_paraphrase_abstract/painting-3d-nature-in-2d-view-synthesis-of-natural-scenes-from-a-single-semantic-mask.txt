We present a new technique for generating multi-view consistent color images of natural scenes using a single semantic mask as input. Unlike previous methods that require multiple views or category-level prior knowledge, our approach utilizes a semantic field as an intermediate representation. This allows us to reconstruct the scene from the semantic mask and translate it into a radiance field using existing semantic image synthesis models. Our experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches, producing photorealistic and multi-view consistent videos of various natural scenes.
