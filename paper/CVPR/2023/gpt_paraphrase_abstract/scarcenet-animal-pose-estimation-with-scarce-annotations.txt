This study addresses the issue of animal pose estimation, which has been underexplored due to limited labeled data. The researchers propose a solution called ScarceNet that utilizes both labeled and unlabeled images to compensate for the lack of well-labeled data. The approach involves generating pseudo labels for the unlabeled images using a model trained with the limited labeled data. However, these pseudo labels are often noisy and can negatively impact performance if used directly for training. To address this, the researchers employ a small-loss trick to select reliable pseudo labels. However, this selection process overlooks many high-loss samples that could still be useful. To overcome this limitation, the researchers introduce a method to identify reusable samples from the high-loss group and generate new pseudo labels for them. Additionally, a student-teacher framework is introduced to enforce consistency in cases where samples are neither reliable nor reusable. By combining the reliable pseudo label selection, reusable sample re-labeling, and consistency constraint, the ScarceNet approach maximizes the utilization of unlabeled data. The approach is evaluated on the challenging AP-10K dataset and outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches significantly. Furthermore, it is tested on the TigDog dataset, demonstrating superior performance compared to domain adaptation-based approaches when only a few annotations are available. The code for the approach is available on the project website.
