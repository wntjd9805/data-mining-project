This study focuses on improving the trade-off between rate, distortion, and realism in generative compression techniques. These techniques aim to produce high-quality and realistic images at low bit rates. However, previous methods lack explicit control over the level of detail synthesized, leading to concerns about potentially misleading reconstructions. To address this issue, the researchers trained a decoder that can effectively navigate the trade-off between distortion and realism. By using a single compressed representation, the receiver can choose to reconstruct an image with low distortion close to the original input, a highly realistic image with superior perceptual quality, or any intermediate level of detail. The proposed method sets a new benchmark in distortion-realism performance, surpassing previous approaches by achieving better distortion at higher realism and better realism at lower distortion levels.
