We present Infinigen, a procedural generator that creates realistic 3D scenes of the natural world. Infinigen operates entirely through procedural generation, meaning that it creates every aspect of the scene, including shapes and textures, using randomized mathematical rules. It does not rely on any external sources, allowing for infinite variations and compositions. Infinigen covers a wide range of objects and scenes found in nature, such as plants, animals, terrains, and natural phenomena like fire, clouds, rain, and snow. It can be utilized to generate a diverse and unlimited amount of training data for various computer vision tasks, including object detection, semantic segmentation, optical flow, and 3D reconstruction. We believe that Infinigen will be a valuable resource for computer vision research and beyond. For more information, including videos, code, and pre-generated data, please visit infinigen.org.
