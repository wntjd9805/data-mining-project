We present SimpleNet, a user-friendly network designed to detect and locate anomalies. SimpleNet comprises four components: (1) a pre-trained Feature Extractor that generates local features, (2) a shallow Feature Adapter that transfers these local features to the target domain, (3) a straightforward Anomaly Feature Generator that creates synthetic anomaly features by introducing Gaussian noise to normal features, and (4) a binary Anomaly Discriminator that differentiates between normal and anomaly features. During inference, the Anomaly Feature Generator is not utilized. Our approach is based on three key insights. First, transforming pre-trained features to target-specific features helps mitigate domain bias. Second, generating synthetic anomalies in the feature space is more effective, as defects may not exhibit commonalities in the image space. Third, a simple discriminator is highly efficient and practical. Despite its simplicity, SimpleNet outperforms previous methods in both quantitative and qualitative measures. On the MVTec AD benchmark, SimpleNet achieves an anomaly detection AUROC of 99.6%, improving error reduction by 55.5% compared to the next best model. Furthermore, SimpleNet is faster than existing methods, achieving a high frame rate of 77 FPS on a 3080ti GPU. Additionally, SimpleNet demonstrates significant enhancements in performance for the One-Class Novelty Detection task. The code for SimpleNet can be found at: https://github.com/DonaldRR/SimpleNet.
