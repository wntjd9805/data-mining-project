Autonomous vehicles rely on high-definition (HD) semantic maps to navigate urban environments. However, traditional methods of creating these maps through manual annotation are expensive and not easily updated. Researchers have proposed using online sensor observations to infer local maps, but this approach is limited by the range of the sensors and can be affected by occlusions. In this study, we introduce Neural Map Prior (NMP), a neural representation of global maps that enables automatic updates and improves local map inference. To incorporate the map prior into local map inference, we use cross-attention to capture correlations between current and prior features. For updating the global neural map prior, we utilize a learning-based fusion module to guide the network in combining features from previous traversals. This design allows the network to learn a global neural map prior during sequential online map predictions. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset show that our framework is compatible with various map segmentation and detection architectures and significantly improves map prediction performance, even in adverse weather conditions and over longer time periods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learning-based system for constructing a global map prior.
