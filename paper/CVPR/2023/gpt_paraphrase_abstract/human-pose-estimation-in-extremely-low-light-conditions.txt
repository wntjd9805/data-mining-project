We investigate the challenging task of estimating human pose in extremely low-light images. The difficulty lies in the lack of available real low-light images with accurate labels and the presence of heavily corrupted inputs that significantly degrade the quality of predictions. To overcome the scarcity of labeled data, we develop a dedicated camera system and create a novel dataset consisting of real low-light images paired with well-lit images for precise pose labeling. This alignment between the low-light and well-lit images allows us to leverage the well-lit images as privileged information during training. Additionally, we propose a new model and training strategy that effectively utilize this privileged information to learn representations that are insensitive to lighting conditions. Our approach achieves outstanding performance on real extremely low-light images, and thorough analyses confirm the contributions of both our model and dataset to this success.
