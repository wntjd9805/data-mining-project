This paper presents a new approach to training Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by focusing on robust image classification. The authors propose a module called AdaptiveMix, which reduces the training data regions in the discriminator's image representation space. To achieve this, they create hard samples by mixing pairs of training images, narrowing the feature distance between difficult and easy samples. The effectiveness of AdaptiveMix is evaluated using popular GAN architectures, showing improved image quality in generated samples. Additionally, the authors demonstrate that AdaptiveMix can be applied to image classification and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) detection tasks, enhancing the performance of existing methods. The paper includes extensive experiments on seven publicly available datasets, with the results supporting the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code for AdaptiveMix is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/WentianZhang-ML/AdaptiveMix.
