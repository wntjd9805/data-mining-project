This study introduces PointDistiller, a framework for knowledge distillation in 3D object detection using point clouds. The framework addresses the limitations of previous distillation methods by incorporating local distillation, which extracts and distills the geometric structure of point clouds, and a reweighted learning strategy that focuses on crucial points or voxels. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of PointDistiller in improving the performance of both voxels-based and raw points-based detectors. The compressed PointPillars student model achieved significant improvements in mean average precision (mAP) compared to its teacher model. The code for PointDistiller is available on GitHub.
