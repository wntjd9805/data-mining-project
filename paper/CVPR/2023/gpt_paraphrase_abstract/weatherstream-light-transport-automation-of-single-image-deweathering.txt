Single image deweathering methods have been found to be more dependent on the dataset type rather than the model. In this study, a pipeline called WeatherStream is introduced, which automatically captures various real-world weather effects such as rain, snow, and rain fog, along with clean image pairs. Unlike previous methods that train on synthetic pairs, WeatherStream collects a dataset that reduces the Sim2Real domain gap. Manual collection of time multiplexed pairs has been attempted before, but it is limited in scale due to the need for human labor. The proposed pipeline utilizes light-transport physics and a model trained on a small initial seed dataset to filter out approximately 99.6% of unwanted scenes. This pipeline can generalize to new scenes and degradations, which can then be used to train existing models similar to fully human-labeled data. Training on the dataset collected through this procedure leads to significant improvements in multiple existing weather removal methods, as demonstrated on a carefully human-collected test set of real-world weather effects.
