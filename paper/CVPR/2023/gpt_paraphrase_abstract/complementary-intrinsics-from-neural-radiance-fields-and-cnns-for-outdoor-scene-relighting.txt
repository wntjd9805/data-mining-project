The difficulty of relighting outdoor scenes stems from the diverse illuminations and prominent cast shadows. One approach to address this challenge is through image decomposition of outdoor photo collections, which can partially solve the problem by utilizing weakly supervised labels with albedo and normal consistency from multi-view stereo. Another technique, known as neural radiance fields (NeRF), allows for editing the appearance code to generate more realistic outcomes without explicitly interpreting the image formation process of the outdoor scene. This study proposes a combination of intrinsic estimation from volume rendering using NeRF and inverse photo-metric image formation model through convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This approach generates more comprehensive and reliable pseudo labels, including cast shadows and sky appearances, in addition to albedo and normal, enabling the training of the CNN to predict interpretable and editable lighting parameters using a single-image prediction pipeline. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through experiments on various real outdoor scenes, showcasing its advantages in both intrinsic image decomposition and relighting.
