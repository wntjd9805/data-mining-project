Current approaches in asymmetric retrieval systems face a challenge in balancing retrieval efficiency and accuracy due to the limited capacity of lightweight query models. This study introduces the Asymmetric Feature Fusion (AFF) paradigm to enhance existing systems by leveraging the complementarity of different features at the gallery side. The proposed approach involves embedding gallery images into multiple features and using a dynamic mixer to aggregate these features into a compact embedding for efficient search. On the query side, only a lightweight model is used for feature extraction. The query model and dynamic mixer are jointly trained by sharing a momentum-updated classifier. Importantly, this paradigm improves the accuracy of asymmetric retrieval without adding any extra overhead to the query side. Extensive experiments conducted on various landmark retrieval datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed paradigm.
