Monocular 3D object localization in driving scenes is a challenging task due to its ill-posed nature. To address this, we propose Neu-rOCS, a framework that uses instance masks and 3D boxes as input to learn 3D object shapes through differentiable rendering. This approach allows us to obtain dense object coordinates, which can be used as supervision for training. Our framework leverages insights in learning category-level shape priors directly from real driving scenes and handles single-view ambiguities effectively. We also make critical design choices to improve the learning of object coordinates from an object-centric view. As a result, our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in monocular 3D localization, ranking 1st on the KITTI-Object benchmark among published monocular methods.
