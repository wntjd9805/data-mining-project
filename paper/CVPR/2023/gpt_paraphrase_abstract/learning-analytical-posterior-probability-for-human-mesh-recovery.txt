Current probabilistic methods for modeling uncertainty and ambiguity in human mesh recovery have limited precision due to constraints and difficulties in learning joint rotations. To overcome this, we introduce a new analytical formulation for learning posterior probability distributions of joint rotations based on bone directions in a Bayesian manner. Using this formulation, we propose a novel posterior-guided framework for human mesh recovery. Our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks and can easily integrate additional sensors due to its Bayesian nature. The code for our framework is available at https://github.com/NetEase-GameAI/ProPose.
