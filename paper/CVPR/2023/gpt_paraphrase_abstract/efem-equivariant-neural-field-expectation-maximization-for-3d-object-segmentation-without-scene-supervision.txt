We present Equivariant Neural Field Expectation Maximization (EFEM), a straightforward and reliable geometric algorithm for segmenting objects in 3D scenes without the need for annotations or training on scenes. Our unsupervised segmentation approach utilizes single object shape priors and introduces two innovative steps. Firstly, we incorporate equivariant shape representations to address the challenges posed by object configuration variations. Secondly, we propose a novel EM algorithm that iteratively refines segmentation masks using the equivariant shape prior. To assess the effectiveness and robustness of our method, we compile a new dataset called Chairs and Mugs, which includes diverse object configurations and novel scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms (weakly) supervised methods in different scenes.
