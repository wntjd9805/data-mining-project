The recent advancements in open-world object and open-set detection have made significant progress in identifying previously unseen objects and distinguishing them from known ones. However, these studies have not delved deep enough into the transfer of knowledge from known classes to unknown ones, resulting in limited capability to detect unknown objects hidden in the background. This paper proposes a solution called the unknown sniffer (UnSniffer) that can identify both unknown and known objects.To address the issue of improper suppression of unknown objects in the background, we introduce the concept of generalized object confidence (GOC) score. This score is learned using only known samples for supervision and can be generalized to unknown objects. Additionally, we propose a negative energy suppression loss to further suppress non-object samples in the background.In the inference stage, obtaining the best bounding box for each unknown object is challenging due to the lack of semantic information during training. To overcome this, we introduce a graph-based determination scheme to replace the hand-designed non-maximum suppression (NMS) post-processing.Furthermore, we present the Unknown Object Detection Benchmark, which is the first publicly available benchmark for evaluating the precision of unknown object detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. The code for our approach is available at: https://github.com/Went-Liang/UnSniffer.
