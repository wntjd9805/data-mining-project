Labeling objects using pixel-wise segmentation is a time-consuming task. Existing methods for weakly supervised instance segmentation rely on bounding boxes, but we have discovered that box-supervised methods can produce fine segmentation masks. We have developed BoxTeacher, a training framework for weakly supervised instance segmentation that utilizes a sophisticated teacher to generate high-quality masks as pseudo labels. To address the issue of noisy masks, we have introduced a mask-aware confidence score to estimate the quality of the pseudo masks. Additionally, we have proposed the noise-aware pixel loss and noise-reduced affinity loss to optimize the student model with the pseudo masks. Extensive experiments have shown that BoxTeacher achieves remarkable performance on the challenging COCO dataset, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods and bridging the gap between box-supervised and mask-supervised approaches.
