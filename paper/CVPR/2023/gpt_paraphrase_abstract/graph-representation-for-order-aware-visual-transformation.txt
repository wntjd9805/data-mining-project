This paper introduces a novel formulation for visual reasoning that focuses on identifying changes between image pairs and determining their temporal orders. The ability to recognize scene dynamics and their chronological sequences is crucial for human cognition, enabling tasks such as following instructions, analyzing events, detecting abnormal dynamics, and restoring scenes. However, the performance of current AI systems in these capabilities remains uncertain. Previous studies have primarily focused on identifying and describing synchronous changes in image pairs, disregarding the potential order within these changes. To address this limitation, we propose a visual transformation graph structure to represent order-aware changes. We evaluate existing methods using a newly generated dataset and identify shortcomings in change order recognition. Finally, we present a new model that improves order-aware change recognition by explicitly associating different changes and identifying their orders within a graph representation.
