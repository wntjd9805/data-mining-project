Automatic radiology reporting has the potential to alleviate the workload of radiologists and improve the interpretation of diagnoses. Recent research has combined data-driven neural networks with medical knowledge graphs to address biases in this task. However, the fixed structures of these graphs may not provide the most appropriate scope of knowledge and limit effectiveness. To overcome this limitation, we propose a knowledge graph called DCL, which has a dynamic structure and nodes. The graph is initially constructed from general knowledge and then updated with specific knowledge extracted from retrieved reports. Each image feature is integrated with its corresponding updated graph before being used to generate a report. Additionally, we introduce Image-Report Contrastive and Image-Report Matching losses to better represent visual features and textual information. Our DCL model outperforms previous state-of-the-art models on the IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, as demonstrated through evaluation.
