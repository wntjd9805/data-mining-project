In this study, we focus on the crucial task of predicting the future movements of road agents in autonomous driving scenarios. We introduce FJMP, a Factorized Joint Motion Prediction framework, to generate a set of joint trajectory predictions for multi-agent driving scenarios. Our approach models the interaction dynamics of the future scene using a sparse directed interaction graph, where explicit interactions between agents are represented as edges. To simplify the prediction task, we prune the graph into a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and decompose the joint prediction into a sequence of marginal and conditional predictions based on the DAG's partial ordering. We decode the joint future trajectories using a directed acyclic graph neural network (DAGNN). Our experiments on the INTERACTION and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that FJMP outperforms non-factorized approaches by producing more accurate and scene-consistent joint trajectory predictions, particularly for highly interactive and kinematically interesting agents. FJMP is ranked first on the multi-agent test leaderboard of the INTERACTION dataset.
