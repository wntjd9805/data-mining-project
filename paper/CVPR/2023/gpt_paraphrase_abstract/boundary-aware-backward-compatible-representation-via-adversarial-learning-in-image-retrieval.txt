Image retrieval is crucial in the internet world, and it typically involves an online embedding model and a large-scale vector database. Upgrading traditional models can be time-consuming as all image embeddings in the database need to be recomputed. However, backward-compatible training (BCT) allows for immediate deployment of the new model by ensuring that the new embeddings are comparable to the old ones. The key challenge in BCT is improving compatibility between the two models without negatively impacting retrieval performance. To address this, we propose AdvBCT, an Adversarial Backward-Compatible Training method with an elastic boundary constraint that considers both compatibility and discrimination. Through adversarial learning, we reduce the distribution disparity between the embeddings of the new and old models. Additionally, we introduce an elastic boundary constraint during training to enhance compatibility and discrimination. Extensive experiments on GLDv2, Revisited Oxford (ROxford), and Revisited Paris (RParis) datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other BCT methods in terms of both compatibility and discrimination. The implementation of AdvBCT is publicly available at https://github.com/Ashespt/AdvBCT.
