We introduce an innovative method for segmenting and counting densely packed self-similar trees using a top-view RGB image sequence. Our approach combines pixel content, shape, and self-occlusion to achieve accurate results. Initially, we divide the image sequence into segments and create a contour graph that incorporates temporal information. Then, by utilizing a graph convolutional network, we merge neighboring tree crown patches to obtain a final set of tree crowns. Through extensive studies and comparisons, our method outperforms previous techniques, delivering precise instance segmentation and counting even in tightly packed tree formations. Additionally, we provide diverse forest image sequence datasets captured at different altitudes and leaf conditions for future benchmarking and evaluation purposes.
