The limited capacity of 3DMM-based face reconstruction methods leads to the failure in recovering high-frequency facial details. Previous attempts to address this issue through detail maps or non-linear operations have not been successful. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical representation network (HRN) for accurate and detailed face reconstruction from a single image. Our approach involves disentangling the geometry and introducing a hierarchical representation for detailed face modeling. Additionally, we incorporate 3D priors of facial details to improve the accuracy and authenticity of the reconstructed results. We also introduce a de-retouching module to better separate the geometry and appearance. Our framework can be extended to a multi-view approach by considering detail consistency across different views. Experimental results on both single-view and multi-view face reconstruction benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and visual effects. Furthermore, we present a high-quality 3D face dataset called FaceHD-100 to facilitate research in high-fidelity face reconstruction.
