Restoring high frame-rate videos from low frame-rate blurry videos is a difficult task. Current methods for interpolating blurry frames assume a known exposure time, which is not suitable for videos captured in unpredictable environments. This paper addresses the problem of blurry frame interpolation under blind exposure, utilizing an event camera to assist the process. The event camera's high temporal resolution helps recover the lost exposure prior during the imaging process. By leveraging the event streams to estimate the exposure prior, we make the blind exposure problem solvable. Additionally, we propose a temporal-exposure control strategy using iterative residual learning to model the mutual constraint between sharp and blurry frames. Our method significantly outperforms existing techniques on both synthetic and real-world datasets captured under blind exposure conditions.
