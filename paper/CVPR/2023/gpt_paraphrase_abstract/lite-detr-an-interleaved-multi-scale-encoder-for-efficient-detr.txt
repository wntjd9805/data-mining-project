Lite DETR is a new object detection framework that reduces the computational inefficiency of multi-scale features in DEtection TRansformer-based (DETR) models. By introducing an efficient encoder block and a key-aware deformable attention mechanism, Lite DETR reduces the GFLOPs of the detection head by 60% while maintaining 99% of the original performance. The proposed lite DETR approach is effective and efficient, and it can be applied to existing DETR-based models. The code for Lite DETR is available on GitHub.
