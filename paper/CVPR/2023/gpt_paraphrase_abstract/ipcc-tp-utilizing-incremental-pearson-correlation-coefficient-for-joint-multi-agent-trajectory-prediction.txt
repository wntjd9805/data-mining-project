Reliable prediction of trajectories for multiple agents is crucial for the safe planning and control of autonomous systems. However, modeling complex social interactions caused by different driving intentions and road conditions is a major challenge in processing multiple agents simultaneously. Previous methods have used graph-based message propagation or attention mechanisms to capture these interactions in the form of marginal probabilistic distributions, but these approaches are inherently sub-optimal.To address this issue, we propose a new module called IPCC-TP that improves the modeling of multi-agent interactions. IPCC-TP is based on the Incremental Pearson Correlation Coefficient and is designed to be relevance-aware. It learns pairwise joint Gaussian Distributions by estimating the means and covariances through interactive incremental movements. This module can be easily integrated into existing multi-agent prediction methods, enhancing the original motion distribution decoders.Extensive experiments conducted on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that IPCC-TP significantly improves the performance of baseline methods. By incorporating IPCC-TP, the accuracy and reliability of trajectory prediction for autonomous systems can be greatly enhanced.
