The use of cameras for 3D object detection is a cost-effective solution compared to LiDAR-based systems. However, accurately estimating depth is a challenge due to the lack of direct 3D measurements. Previous methods have focused on improving depth estimation through network designs. This study proposes a collaborative approach called CoCa3D, which enables agents to share information through communication. The most informative cues are selected to optimize communication efficiency. By incorporating shared messages from multiple viewpoints, CoCa3D improves depth estimation and complements occluded and long-range regions. The performance of CoCa3D is evaluated on real-world and simulation datasets, showing significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art methods. These results suggest that with sufficient collaboration, camera-only systems have the potential to surpass LiDAR in practical scenarios. The dataset and code for CoCa3D have been released.
