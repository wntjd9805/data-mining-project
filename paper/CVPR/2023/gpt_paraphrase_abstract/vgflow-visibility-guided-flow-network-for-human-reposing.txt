The task of human reposing involves creating a realistic image of a person in any possible pose. However, existing methods face challenges in maintaining texture, pattern coherence, cloth boundaries, handling occlusions, and generating skin. These difficulties are worsened by the wide range of possible pose orientations, the non-rigid nature of clothing, and the diversity in body shape among individuals. To address these challenges, we propose VGFlow, which uses a visibility-guided flow module to separate the flow into visible and invisible parts, allowing for simultaneous texture preservation and style manipulation. Additionally, we incorporate a self-supervised patch-wise "realness" loss to enhance the output and avoid network artifacts. VGFlow achieves superior results compared to existing methods, as demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative evaluations using various image quality metrics (SSIM, LPIPS, FID). The results can be downloaded from the Project Webpage.
