Anomaly detection plays a crucial role in large-scale industrial manufacturing. While recent methods have shown high accuracy, they often come at the cost of increased latency. Memory-based approaches like PatchCore and Coupled-hypersphere-based Feature Adaptation (CFA) achieve impressive results but require an external memory bank, leading to longer execution times. In contrast, Reversed Distillation (RD) offers good performance with low latency. In this study, we aim to enhance the performance of RD and establish a new benchmark on the challenging MVTec dataset for both anomaly detection and localization. Our method, RD++, outperforms PatchCore by being six times faster and CFA by being two times faster, while introducing minimal latency compared to RD. We also evaluate our method on the BTAD and RetinalOCT datasets to demonstrate its generalizability. Additionally, we conduct ablation experiments to gain insights into the configurations of our method. The source code for our method will be available at https://github.com/tientrandinh/Revisiting-Reverse-Distillation.
