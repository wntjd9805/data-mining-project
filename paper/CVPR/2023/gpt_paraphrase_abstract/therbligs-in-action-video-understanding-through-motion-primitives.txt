This paper presents a novel approach to modeling action using Therbligs, which are rule-based, compositional, and hierarchical atoms. These atoms offer a consistent and expressive representation of action, with a focus on contact-centered information. The authors introduce a differentiable method of rule-based reasoning to ensure logical consistency in the modeling process. Importantly, this approach does not replace existing architectures but enhances them by incorporating Therblig-based representations. The authors have annotated two popular video datasets, EPIC Kitchens 100 and 50-Salads, with Therblig-centered annotations. They demonstrate the benefits of adopting Therblig representations through evaluations on tasks such as action segmentation, action anticipation, and action recognition. The results show significant relative improvements over the baseline methods on both datasets. The authors plan to make their code and data publicly available.
