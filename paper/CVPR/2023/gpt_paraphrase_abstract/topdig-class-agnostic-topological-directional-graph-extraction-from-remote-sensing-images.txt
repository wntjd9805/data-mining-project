In recent years, there has been significant progress in automatically extracting vectors from remote sensing images. However, most existing methods focus on specific targets and struggle to perform consistently across different categories. To address this issue, we propose a novel model called TopDiG that can extract topological directional graphs directly from remote sensing images. TopDiG utilizes a topology-concentrated node detector (TCND) to identify nodes and obtain a concise understanding of the topological components. We also introduce a dynamic graph supervision (DGS) strategy that generates adjacency graph labels from unordered nodes. Additionally, we design a directional graph (DiG) generator module to construct topological directional graphs based on the predicted nodes.Our experiments on various datasets, including Inria, CrowdAI, GID, GF2, and Massachusetts, demonstrate that TopDiG is not limited to specific classes and achieves competitive performance across all datasets.
