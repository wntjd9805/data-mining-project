Professional photographers often need to perform editing operations on their photos, such as removing distractions and improving the main subjects. These edits are challenging because they require a careful balance between manipulating the viewer's attention and maintaining the realism of the photo. Although there have been successful approaches to amplifying or attenuating attention, many of them result in unrealistic edits. In this study, we propose a method called realism loss for enhancing images based on saliency, which allows us to maintain high realism across different types of images while reducing distractions and highlighting the objects of interest. Our evaluations with professional photographers show that our method achieves both realism and effectiveness, outperforming recent approaches in terms of memory usage and processing time. Therefore, our method offers a practical solution for automating image enhancement and photo cleanup operations.
