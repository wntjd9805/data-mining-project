Point cloud classification is crucial for security-critical applications like autonomous driving and augmented reality. However, current classifiers are susceptible to adversarial perturbations in point clouds. Existing certified defenses against adversarial point clouds have a limitation: their certified robustness guarantees are probabilistic, meaning they may produce incorrect guarantees with some probability. To address this, we propose a framework called PointCert that can transform any point cloud classifier into a certifiably robust one against adversarial point clouds, providing deterministic guarantees. PointCert predicts the same label for a point cloud if the number of added, deleted, or modified points is below a certain threshold. We also introduce several methods to optimize the certified robustness guarantees of PointCert in different application scenarios. We evaluate PointCert on benchmark datasets, ModelNet and ScanObjectNN, and find that it outperforms state-of-the-art certified defenses, even though their robustness guarantees are probabilistic.
