The effectiveness of collective insights from a group of experts in clinical tasks surpasses that of an individual's best diagnostic. However, current AI-based research on medical image segmentation tends to focus on replicating the performance of the best individual rather than utilizing the power of expert groups. This paper presents a novel approach based on a single diffusion model that generates multiple plausible outputs by learning a distribution over group insights. By leveraging the stochastic sampling process of diffusion, our model produces a distribution of segmentation masks with minimal additional learning. We validate our approach on three different medical image modalities (CT, ultrasound, and MRI) and demonstrate its capability to generate multiple variants while capturing their frequency of occurrence. Our comprehensive results show that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art ambiguous segmentation networks in terms of accuracy, while also preserving the naturally occurring variation. Additionally, we introduce a new metric that evaluates both the diversity and accuracy of segmentation predictions, aligning with the interests of clinical practice and collective insights.
