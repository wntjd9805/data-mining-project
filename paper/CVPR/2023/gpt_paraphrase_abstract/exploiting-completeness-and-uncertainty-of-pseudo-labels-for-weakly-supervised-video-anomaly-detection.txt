Weakly supervised video anomaly detection has made significant progress by utilizing two-stage self-training methods, which generate pseudo labels and refine anomaly scores. To enhance this framework, we propose a novel approach that leverages completeness and uncertainty properties for more effective self-training. Our method includes a multi-head classification module with a diversity loss, which maximizes the distribution differences of predicted pseudo labels across heads. This encourages the generation of pseudo labels that cover a wide range of abnormal events. Additionally, we introduce an iterative uncertainty pseudo label refinement strategy that improves both the initial and updated pseudo labels obtained by the desired classifier in the second stage. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including UCF-Crime, TAD, and XD-Violence, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, our approach addresses the limitation of existing methods that tend to focus on the most anomalous clip, by utilizing the multi-head classification module and diversity loss to encourage pseudo labels that cover the complete abnormal events.
