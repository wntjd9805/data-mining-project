Deep neural networks (DNNs) have made significant advancements in image restoration. However, a major limitation is their inability to effectively handle real-world degradations with varying degrees or types. This paper introduces a novel training strategy called Distortion-Invariant Representation Learning (DIL) to enhance the generalization ability of DNNs for unknown degradations. DIL treats each distortion type and degree as a specific confounder and aims to learn a distortion-invariant representation by eliminating the negative effects of each degradation. The approach is derived using the back-door criterion in causality and models interventions of different distortions from an optimization perspective. To simulate confounders, counterfactual distortion augmentation is employed to generate virtual distortion types and degrees. Each distortion is then intervened with a virtual model update based on corresponding distorted images, effectively removing their influence from a meta-learning perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the generalization capability of DIL on unseen distortion types and degrees. The code for this method can be found at https://github.com/lixinustc/Causal-IR-DIL.
