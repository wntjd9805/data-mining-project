The current mem-orability community is engaged in a debate on the most effective way to estimate the memorability of visual content. This study aims to investigate how different properties of images and videos contribute to their consolidation in memory. By analyzing the impact of various features, a model is developed to simulate the crucial aspects of a suggested "pathway to memory." This model, called M3-S, is a unique memorability network that processes input videos in a modular manner, mimicking the four key steps of the memory pathway: raw encoding, scene understanding, event understanding, and memory consolidation. The modules of the network learn distinct and significant representations, which differ substantially from one another. Furthermore, certain representations prove to be more successful in predicting memorability than others, supported by an extensive ablation study. The proposed approach outperforms existing methods on the two largest video memorability datasets, indicating its potential for new applications in this field. The code for our model is publicly available at https://github.com/tekal-ai/modular-memorability.
