This study introduces a novel algorithm called BAAM (bi-contextual attention and attention-guided modeling) for monocular 3D pose and shape reconstruction of car objects in a 3D traffic scene. Previous studies have focused less on reconstructing detailed shapes and have treated each 3D object as an independent entity, resulting in a loss of context between objects and the overall scene. The BAAM algorithm first reconstructs the 3D shape of objects based on attention-guided modeling, which considers the relationship between detected objects and vehicle shape priors. It then estimates the 3D pose of objects using bi-contextual attention, leveraging the context between objects and the road environment. To eliminate false objects, a 3D non-maximum suppression algorithm based on Bird-Eye-View distance is proposed.Extensive experiments demonstrate that BAAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ApolloCar3D dataset. It is also shown that BAAM can be integrated into existing monocular 3D object detectors on the KITTI dataset, resulting in significant performance improvement. The code for BAAM is available at https://github.com/gywns6287/BAAM.
