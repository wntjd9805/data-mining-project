Detection-based methods in crowd analysis have been criticized for their poor performance in dense crowds. However, we believe that these methods have been underestimated and offer valuable information that is often overlooked. Specifically, the size and confidence score of output proposals and bounding boxes can provide insights into crowd scale and density. To make use of these underutilized features, we propose Crowd Hat, a module that can easily be integrated with existing detection models. This module employs a mixed 2D-1D compression technique to refine output features and obtain spatial and numerical distribution of crowd-specific information. Building on these features, we also propose region-adaptive NMS thresholds and a decouple-then-align approach to address the main limitations of detection-based methods. Our comprehensive evaluations on various crowd analysis tasks, such as crowd counting, localization, and detection, demonstrate the effectiveness of utilizing output features and the potential of detection-based methods in crowd analysis. The code for Crowd Hat is openly available at https://github.com/wskingdom/Crowd-Hat.
