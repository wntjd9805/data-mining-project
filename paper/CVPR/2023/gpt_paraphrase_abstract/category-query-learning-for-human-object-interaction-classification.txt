We propose a new approach called category query learning for human-object interaction (HOI) tasks. Instead of focusing on improving human-object features, we use category queries that are associated with interaction categories. These queries are transformed into image-specific representations using a transformer decoder and learned through an auxiliary image-level classification task. This approach draws inspiration from a previous method used for multi-label image classification but is applied for the first time to the challenging HOI classification task. Our method is simple, general, and effective. We validate it on three representative HOI baselines and achieve new state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks. The code for our method can be found at https://github.com/charles-xie/CQL.
