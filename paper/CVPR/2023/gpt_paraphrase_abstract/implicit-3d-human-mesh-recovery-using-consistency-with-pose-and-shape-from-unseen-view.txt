We propose the Implicit 3D Human Mesh Recovery (ImpHMR) method for inferring the 3D pose and shape of a person from an image. While existing methods can only consider the direction in which the image was taken, ImpHMR utilizes Neural Feature Fields to imagine a person in 3D space at the feature-level. Feature fields are generated by a CNN-based image encoder, and the pose and shape parameters are regressed from these features. The model can predict results including the silhouette from an arbitrary direction and ensure consistency with unseen views through self-supervised learning. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of ImpHMR.
