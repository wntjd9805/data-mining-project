Fully test-time adaptation is a method that aims to improve the performance of deep neural networks when faced with cross-domain problems. Inspired by biological learning processes, we propose a soft Hebbian learning approach that allows for online adaptation without supervision. By incorporating a feedback neuro-modulation layer, we can further enhance the performance of the feed-forward Hebbian learning process. This neuro-modulated Hebbian learning method enables effective adaptation of the network model during the testing phase. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, significantly improving the adaptation performance of network models.
