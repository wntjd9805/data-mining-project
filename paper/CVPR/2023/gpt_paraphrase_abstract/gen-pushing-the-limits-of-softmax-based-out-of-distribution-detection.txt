Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is a crucial aspect of deploying neural networks in safety-critical applications. Detecting OOD data in large-scale datasets is a challenging task that requires accessing training data or exposing models to outliers during training. Some post-hoc methods can avoid these constraints but are not as competitive. In this study, we introduce the Generalized ENtropy score (GEN), a simple yet effective entropy-based score function that can be applied to any pre-trained softmax-based classifier. We evaluate its performance on the ImageNet-1k OOD detection benchmark, a large-scale dataset. GEN consistently improves the average AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve) across six commonly-used CNN-based and visual transformer classifiers compared to state-of-the-art post-hoc methods. The average AUROC improvement is at least 3.5%. Moreover, we demonstrate that combining GEN with feature-based enhancing methods and training statistics further enhances OOD detection performance.
