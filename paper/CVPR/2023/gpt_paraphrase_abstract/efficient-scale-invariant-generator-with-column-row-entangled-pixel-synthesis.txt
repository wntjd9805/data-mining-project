This study introduces the concept of Column-Row Entangled Pixel Synthesis (CREPS), a novel generative model that addresses the limitations of existing solutions for image synthesis. While current GAN-based methods rely heavily on convolutions and hierarchical architectures, leading to inconsistencies and texture sticking issues when scaling the output resolution, CREPS offers an efficient and scale-equivariant alternative. By avoiding spatial convolutions and coarse-to-fine design, CREPS eliminates memory footprint and inference speed obstacles commonly associated with INR-based generators. The proposed model utilizes a unique bi-line representation that decomposes layer-wise feature maps into separate column and row encodings, enabling scale-consistent and alias-free image synthesis at any desired resolution. Experimental results on various datasets validate CREPS' ability to generate high-quality images. The code for this model is available on GitHub.
