We propose a new unsupervised background subtraction (BGS) algorithm called Zero-shot Background Subtraction (ZBS) that leverages zero-shot object detection. Unlike previous unsupervised BGS methods, ZBS performs well in complex scenarios such as shadows or night lights and can detect objects outside of pre-defined categories. ZBS utilizes zero-shot object detection to build an open-vocabulary instance-level background model, allowing for effective foreground extraction by comparing detection results with the background model. ZBS also has rich and extensible categories and can easily generalize to other tasks like abandoned object detection in unseen environments. Experimental results on the CDnet 2014 dataset demonstrate that ZBS outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised BGS methods by 4.70% F-Measure. The code for ZBS is available at https://github.com/CASIA-IVA-Lab/ZBS.
