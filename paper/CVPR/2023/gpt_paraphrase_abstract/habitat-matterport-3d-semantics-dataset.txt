Presented is the Habitat-Matterport 3D Semantics (HM3DSEM) dataset, which is currently the largest collection of 3D real-world spaces with densely annotated semantics available to the academic community. This dataset includes 142,646 object instance annotations across 216 3D spaces and 3,100 rooms within those spaces. Notably, the scale, quality, and diversity of object annotations in HM3DSEM surpass previous datasets. A notable feature of HM3DSEM is the utilization of texture information to accurately annotate object boundaries at the pixel level. The effectiveness of the HM3DSEM dataset is demonstrated through its application in the Object Goal Navigation task, outperforming previous datasets in training policies.
