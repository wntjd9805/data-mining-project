The sketch community has faced unique challenges, particularly the scarcity of data. As a result, the community has resorted to using photo-based pre-training for core tasks related to sketch understanding. This paper aims to explore whether this photo-based pre-training can actually benefit sketch tasks. The authors propose using the topology of photo data learned during pre-training as a source of supervision for downstream sketch tasks. They specifically focus on fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval (FG-SBIR) and demonstrate how the topology-informed supervision from photos can act as a constraint during fine-tuning. They formulate this constraint as a photo ranking problem and use a cross-modal triplet loss. By incorporating this new approach to pre-training, the authors surpass previously published results on multiple FG-SBIR benchmarks. Interestingly, this significant improvement can be achieved with just a few additional lines of code. The implementation of their method is available on GitHub.
