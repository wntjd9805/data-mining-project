Group activity recognition is a challenging task in which causality relations play an important role. Existing graph models focus on learning synchronous temporal features to understand actor relations, but this approach is insufficient for capturing asynchronous temporal features that are crucial for understanding causality relations. To address this limitation, we propose an Actor-Centric Causality Graph Model that learns asynchronous temporal causality relations through three modules. First, we detect causality relations by analyzing the influences between a centric actor and its correlative actor. We estimate the self influence of the centric actor using self regression and the correlative influence from the correlative actor to the centric actor using correlative regression. This estimation takes into account asynchronous features at different timestamps. Second, we synchronize the action features of the cause and effect actions by estimating the temporal delay between them. We then enhance the feature of the effect action by fusing the synchronized features in a channel-wise manner. Third, we describe the nodes (actors) in the graph with causality features and learn the edges by fusing the causality relation with appearance and distance relations. This fusion allows us to capture the crucial features of the effect action, which complement the synchronous relation inference used in the base model. Experimental results on the Volleyball dataset and Collective Activity dataset demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.
