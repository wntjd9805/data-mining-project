The task of scene graph generation involves creating a semantic graph structure from an image, where nodes represent objects and edges represent their relationships. However, a major challenge in this task is dealing with distracting objects and relationships in the image, which can hinder contextual reasoning. Additionally, there are often numerous irrelevant candidate relations to consider. To address this issue, we propose a solution called the Selective Quad Attention Network (SQUAT). SQUAT is designed to learn how to select relevant object pairs and disambiguate them through diverse contextual interactions. It consists of two main components: edge selection and quad attention. The edge selection module identifies relevant object pairs, or edges, in the scene graph to aid contextual reasoning. The quad attention module then updates the edge features by utilizing both edge-to-node and edge-to-edge cross-attentions, enabling the capture of contextual information between objects and object pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of SQUAT, as it achieves state-of-the-art results on the Visual Genome and Open Images v6 benchmarks.
