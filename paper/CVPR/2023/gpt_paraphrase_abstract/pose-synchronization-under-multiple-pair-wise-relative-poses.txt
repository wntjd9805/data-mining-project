This study focuses on pose synchronization, a fundamental problem in many inverse applications, where consistent absolute poses need to be estimated among a collection of objects based on noisy relative pose estimates. The extreme setting considered in this paper involves multiple incorrect relative pose estimates between each object pair. Traditional methods that recover a low-rank matrix encoding relative poses in block fail in this extreme setting. To address this, a three-step algorithm is proposed. The first step employs diffusion and clustering techniques to compute candidate poses for the input objects, supported by theoretical justification. The second step optimizes the best pose for each object jointly. Finally, the third step refines the output from the second step. Experimental results using benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art pose synchronization techniques in terms of accuracy in estimating absolute poses.
