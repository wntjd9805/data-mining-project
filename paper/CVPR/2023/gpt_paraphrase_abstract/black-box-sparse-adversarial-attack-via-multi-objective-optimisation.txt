Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial images, which raises concerns about their reliability in safety-critical tasks. Sparse adversarial attacks, which limit the number of modified pixels, have proven to be highly effective in causing misclassifications. However, existing methods face challenges in simultaneously minimizing the number of modified pixels and the size of the modifications. These methods often require a large number of queries and unrestricted access to the targeted DNN. On the other hand, methods that limit the number of modified pixels often allow unbounded modifications, making them easily detectable.To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel multi-objective sparse attack algorithm that efficiently minimizes the number of modified pixels and their size. Drawing inspiration from evolutionary computation, our algorithm incorporates a mechanism for prioritizing objectives that aligns with the attacker's goals. Our approach outperforms existing sparse attacks on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet trained DNN classifiers while requiring a small query budget. It achieves competitive attack success rates while perturbing fewer pixels. Overall, our proposed attack algorithm provides a solution to the limitations of current sparse attack methods by jointly minimizing the number of modified pixels and their size.Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in restricted scenarios, indicating its potential to enhance DNN security.
