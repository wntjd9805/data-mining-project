Creating training datasets for image recognition models that work in challenging environments is difficult and expensive due to issues with data collection and annotation. This abstract proposes a solution to this problem by suggesting a noise-accounted RAW image augmentation method. Unlike traditional approaches that apply data augmentation to standard RGB images, this method applies color jitter and blur to RAW images before applying a non-linear Image Signal Processor (ISP), resulting in more realistic intensity. Additionally, a noise amount alignment method is introduced to address the domain gap in noise properties caused by the augmentation. The authors demonstrate that their proposed method significantly improves image recognition accuracy in challenging environments using simple training data.
