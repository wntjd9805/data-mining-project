Paraphrased abstract:Mapping using LiDAR is a crucial task in self-driving and mobile robotics, but it comes with challenges. DeepMapping, a method that uses simple deep networks for map estimation through self-supervised training, faces limitations when dealing with large-scale datasets due to the absence of loop closures and accurate cross-frame point correspondences, as well as the slow convergence of its global localization network. To overcome these issues, we introduce DeepMapping2, which incorporates two innovative techniques: 1) organizing the training batch based on map topology derived from loop closing, and 2) employing a self-supervised local-to-global point consistency loss that leverages pairwise registration. Our experiments and ablation studies on publicly available datasets like KITTI, NCLT, and Nebula validate the effectiveness of our approach.
