PanelNet is a framework that utilizes the unique properties of indoor 360 panoramas to understand indoor environments. These panoramas have continuous and seamless horizontal direction, while gravity is an important factor in indoor design. The framework represents the panoramas as consecutive vertical panels with corresponding 3D panel geometry. To minimize the negative effects of panoramic distortion, a panel geometry embedding network is incorporated to encode both local and global geometric features of a panel. Additionally, a Local2Global Transformer is introduced to capture the geometric context in room design by aggregating local information within a panel and panel-wise global context. This approach significantly improves model performance with minimal training overhead. PanelNet outperforms existing methods in indoor 360 depth estimation and achieves competitive results in indoor layout estimation and semantic segmentation compared to state-of-the-art approaches.
