We propose a Semi-supervised Underwater Image Restoration (Semi-UIR) framework that addresses the lack of labeled data in underwater image restoration techniques. The naive mean-teacher method used in previous approaches has two main problems: the consistency loss used in training may be ineffective when the teacher's prediction is wrong, and using L1 distance may cause the network to over-fit wrong labels, resulting in confirmation bias. To overcome these issues, we introduce a reliable bank to store the "best-ever" outputs as pseudo ground truth and conduct an empirical analysis to select the most trustworthy NR-IQA method. Additionally, we incorporate contrastive regularization to prevent overfitting on wrong labels. Our experimental results on both full-reference and non-reference underwater benchmarks show that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of quantitative and qualitative improvements. The code for our algorithm is available at https://github.com/Huang-ShiRui/Semi-UIR.
