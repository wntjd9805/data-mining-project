Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt pre-trained models to test distributions using only unlabeled test data streams. While previous TTA methods have been successful on simple test data streams, they may struggle in dynamic scenarios like autonomous driving, where the test data gradually changes over time. In this study, we propose practical test-time adaptation (PTTA) to address this challenge. We introduce a Robust Test-Time Adaptation (RoTTA) method that can handle complex data streams in PTTA. Our approach includes a robust batch normalization scheme to estimate normalization statistics, a memory bank to sample category-balanced data considering timeliness and uncertainty, and a time-aware reweighting strategy with a teacher-student model to stabilize the training procedure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoTTA allows for continual test-time adaptation on correlatively sampled data streams. Our method is easy to implement and suitable for rapid deployment.
