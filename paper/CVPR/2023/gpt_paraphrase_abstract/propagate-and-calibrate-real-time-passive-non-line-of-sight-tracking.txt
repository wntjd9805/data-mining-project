NLOS tracking, which can detect object motion out of sight, has gained attention but previous methods relying on active illumination are costly and have complex experimental conditions. In contrast, we propose a passive method using only a relay wall to track a person in an invisible room. By analyzing imperceptible changes in relay wall videos, we introduce difference frames as carriers of motion messages. Our method, PAC-Net, leverages both dynamic and static messages on a frame-level granularity through alternating propagation and calibration. To evaluate our method, we create and share the first dynamic passive NLOS tracking dataset, NLOS-Track, which includes real-shot and synthetic data. The dataset and codes are available at https://againstentropy.github.io/NLOS-Track/.
