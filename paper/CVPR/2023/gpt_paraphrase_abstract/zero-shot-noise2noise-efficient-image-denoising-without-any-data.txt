Recently, self-supervised neural networks have demonstrated impressive performance in denoising images. However, existing dataset free methods have limitations such as high computational requirements, the need for a noise model, or insufficient image quality. In this study, we propose a solution that addresses these issues by introducing a simple 2-layer network that does not rely on training data or knowledge of the noise distribution. This approach, inspired by Noise2Noise and Neighbor2Neighbor, effectively denoises images with pixel-wise independent noise, while keeping computational costs low. Our experiments on both artificial and real-world camera and microscope noise reveal that our method, called ZS-N2N (Zero Shot Noise2Noise), often outperforms other dataset-free methods while reducing costs. This makes it suitable for scenarios with limited data availability and computational resources.
