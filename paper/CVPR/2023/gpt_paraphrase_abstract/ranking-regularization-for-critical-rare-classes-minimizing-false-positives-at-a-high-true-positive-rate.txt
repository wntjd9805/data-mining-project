In various real-life scenarios, the presence of a critical class is infrequent, and failing to detect it can have significant consequences. For instance, rare tumors require accurate diagnosis to ensure proper treatment, while undetected fraudulent banking transactions can result in substantial losses or legal penalties. To address this issue, systems often need to prioritize high true positive rates, even if it means tolerating false positives. This paper introduces a new method called ranking-based regularization (RankReg) to minimize false positives in systems that operate at a high true positive rate. The proposed approach is simple to implement and effectively reduces false positives, complementing traditional imbalanced learning losses. Through empirical experiments on popular datasets (CIFAR-10&100 and Melanoma), our technique outperforms the previous state-of-the-art methods by significant margins, showcasing its effectiveness.
