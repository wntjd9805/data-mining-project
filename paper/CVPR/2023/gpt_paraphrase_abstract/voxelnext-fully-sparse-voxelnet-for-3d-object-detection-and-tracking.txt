This paper introduces VoxelNext, a novel approach for fully sparse 3D object detection. Unlike traditional methods that rely on hand-crafted proxies and dense prediction heads, VoxelNext predicts objects directly based on sparse voxel features. The proposed sparse convolutional network, VoxelNeXt, efficiently detects and tracks 3D objects through voxel features without the need for sparse-to-dense conversion or post-processing. The method achieves a favorable trade-off between speed and accuracy compared to other detectors on the nuScenes dataset. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of a fully sparse voxel-based representation for LIDAR 3D object detection and tracking through extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks. The model outperforms existing LIDAR methods on the nuScenes tracking test benchmark. The code and models for VoxelNext are available on GitHub at github.com/dvlab-research/VoxelNeXt.
