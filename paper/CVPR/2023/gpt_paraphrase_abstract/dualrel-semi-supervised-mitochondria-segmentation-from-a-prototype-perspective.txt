Automatic mitochondria segmentation has become popular due to advancements in deep learning. However, current methods rely on manual gathering by domain experts, which is time-consuming. Using semi-supervised segmentation methods from natural image fields to reduce labeling costs is not ideal. In this study, we address the differences between mitochondrial images and natural images and propose a reliable prototype-level supervision approach for effective semi-supervised mitochondria segmentation. Our proposed DualRel network consists of a reliable pixel aggregation module and a reliable prototype selection module. DualRel has several advantages, including the use of referential correlation to improve prototype learning without explicit supervision, and a module to evaluate the reliability of prototypes for consistency regularization. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing semi-supervised segmentation methods. Notably, even with limited training samples, DualRel achieves comparable results to current fully supervised methods.
