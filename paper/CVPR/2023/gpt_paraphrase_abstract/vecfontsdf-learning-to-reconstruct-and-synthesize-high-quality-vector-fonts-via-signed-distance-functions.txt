This paper introduces a new method called VecFontSDF for automatically generating high-quality vector fonts. While existing methods focus mainly on raster image generation, VecFontSDF utilizes signed distance functions (SDFs) to represent the shape of each glyph. The proposed method learns to model glyphs as shape primitives enclosed by parabolic curves, which can be converted to quadratic BÃ©zier curves commonly used in vector fonts. This allows for easy extension of existing image generation methods to synthesize vector fonts. The effectiveness of VecFontSDF is demonstrated through qualitative and quantitative experiments on a publicly-available dataset, showing superior performance in tasks such as vector font reconstruction, interpolation, and few-shot vector font synthesis.
