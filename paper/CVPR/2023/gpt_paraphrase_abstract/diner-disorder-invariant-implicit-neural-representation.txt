The limited capacity of implicit neural representations (INR) in solving inverse problems is due to spectral bias in network training. To address this issue, we propose disorder-invariant implicit neural representation (DINER) by adding a hash-table to a traditional INR backbone. By rearranging the coordinates of the input signal, DINER ensures that signals with the same attribute histogram but different arrangement orders are projected into the same distribution. This allows the subsequent INR network to better model the mapped signal, resulting in reduced spectral bias. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of DINER across different INR backbones (MLP vs. SIREN) and tasks (image/video representation, phase retrieval, and refractive index recovery). DINER outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both quality and speed. The project page can be found at: https://ezio77.github.io/DINER-website/.
