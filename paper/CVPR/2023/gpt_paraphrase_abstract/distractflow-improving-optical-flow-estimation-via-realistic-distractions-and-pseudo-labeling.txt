We propose Dis-tractFlow, a new method for training optical flow estimation models. Our approach involves introducing realistic distractions to the input frames, resulting in what we call distracted pairs. By combining one frame with a distractor image depicting a similar domain, we induce visual perturbations that align with natural objects and scenes. This technique allows the model to learn variations and become more robust against challenging deviations, compared to traditional augmentation methods that focus solely on low-level modifications. In addition to the supervised loss computed between the estimated flow for the original pair and its ground-truth flow, we include a second supervised loss between the distracted pair's flow and the original pair's ground-truth flow. This loss is weighted by the same mixing ratio. When unlabeled data is available, we extend our augmentation approach to self-supervised settings using pseudo-labeling and cross-consistency regularization. This involves enforcing the estimated flow on the distracted pair to agree with the flow of the original pair. By doing so, we significantly increase the number of available training pairs without needing additional annotations. Our method is model-agnostic and can be applied to training any optical flow estimation models. Through extensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks such as Sintel, KITTI, and SlowFlow, we demonstrate that DistractFlow consistently improves existing models, surpassing the current state-of-the-art methods.
