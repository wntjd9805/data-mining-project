This paper examines and enhances the common-sense capabilities of popular vision-language (VL) models. Despite their success, these models still lack the ability to reason using common-sense knowledge, which is crucial for artificial general intelligence. The authors identify the lack of common-sense knowledge in existing large-scale VL datasets as a key reason for this limitation. To address this, they propose a scalable approach called "Data Augmentation with kNowledge graph linearization for CommonsensE capabil-ity" (DANCE), which injects common-sense knowledge into VL datasets during training. This technique utilizes a commonsense knowledge graph (such as ConceptNet) to create variations of text descriptions in the datasets. Additionally, the authors introduce a retrieval-based commonsense diagnostic benchmark for evaluating the improved commonsense abilities. Through extensive experiments on representative VL models, they demonstrate that DANCE significantly enhances commonsense reasoning while maintaining performance on retrieval tasks. The code and data for DANCE are available at the provided GitHub link.
