This paper presents a new method for interpolating view-time in stereo videos. The method is based on X-Fields, which uses a convolutional decoder to map input coordinates to 2D RGB images. However, the authors identify several issues with using X-Fields in their application and propose novel techniques to overcome these challenges. They find that X-Fields struggles to interpolate disparities for large baseline cameras, so they introduce multi-plane disparities to reduce the spatial distance between objects in the stereo views. Additionally, they propose non-uniform time coordinates to handle non-linear and sudden motion spikes in videos. The authors also make several simple, but important, improvements to X-Fields. Experimental results show that their approach outperforms existing methods, while maintaining real-time performance and low memory and storage costs.
