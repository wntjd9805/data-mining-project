Supervision in metric learning has traditionally relied on human-labeled classes, but we believe this approach limits progress in the field. To address this, we propose a new regularization method called HIER. HIER aims to uncover the underlying semantic hierarchy of training data and utilize it to provide more comprehensive and detailed supervision compared to existing metric learning techniques. Unlike previous methods that require annotation for the semantic hierarchy, HIER learns hierarchical proxies in hyperbolic spaces. These proxies are trainable parameters that approximate the semantic hierarchy between groups of data. HIER operates in hyperbolic space because its geometric properties are well-suited for representing hierarchical structures. We evaluated HIER on four standard benchmarks and found that it consistently outperformed conventional methods when integrated with them. In fact, HIER achieved the best results in almost all settings, surpassing even the existing hyperbolic metric learning technique.
