This paper presents a new representation of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) using textured polygons, allowing for efficient synthesis of novel images using standard rendering pipelines. The proposed approach represents NeRF as a collection of polygons with textures that represent binary opacities and feature vectors. The polygons are rendered traditionally using a z-buffer, resulting in an image with features at each pixel. These features are then processed by a view-dependent MLP in a fragment shader to generate the final pixel color. By utilizing the polygon rasterization pipeline, which offers extensive pixel-level parallelism, this approach enables NeRFs to be rendered at interactive frame rates on various compute platforms, including mobile phones.
