SinGRAF is a generative model that can create realistic 3D objects, even with limited training data. It can generate different variations of a 3D scene while maintaining the appearance of the input images. By incorporating a progressive-scale patch discrimination approach, SinGRAF outperforms other similar models in terms of quality and diversity.
