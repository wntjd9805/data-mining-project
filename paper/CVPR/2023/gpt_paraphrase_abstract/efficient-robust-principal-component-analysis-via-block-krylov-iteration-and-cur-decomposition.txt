This paper introduces an efficient algorithm for robust principal component analysis (RPCA) that overcomes the computational challenges associated with singular value decomposition (SVD) in large-scale matrices. The algorithm, called eRPCA, utilizes block Krylov iteration and CUR decomposition to estimate the rank and update the low-rank matrix component. In the rank estimation step, the Krylov iteration method approximates the eigenvalue decomposition, significantly reducing the computational resource requirement. The CUR decomposition is then employed to replace SVD in updating the low-rank matrix component, further reducing the complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed eRPCA algorithm outperforms existing methods in various low-level vision tasks, confirming its efficiency and effectiveness.
