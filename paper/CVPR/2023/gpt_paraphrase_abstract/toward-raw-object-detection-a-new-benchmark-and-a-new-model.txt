This paper focuses on the importance of high dynamic range (HDR) data in computer vision applications like robotics and autonomous driving. The authors aim to achieve object detection using RAW sensor data, which preserves HDR information without additional costs. They introduce a new dataset called ROD, containing annotated instances of day and night driving scenes with a 24-bit dynamic range. Using this dataset, they investigate the impact of dynamic range on deep neural network (DNN)-based object detectors and highlight the significance of dynamic range adjustment for detection on RAW sensor data. They propose a simple and effective adjustment method that is image adaptive and jointly optimized with the downstream detector. Extensive experiments demonstrate that detection performance on RAW sensor data surpasses that of standard dynamic range (SDR) data in various situations. Additionally, they analyze the influence of texture information and pixel distribution on the performance of DNN-based detectors.
