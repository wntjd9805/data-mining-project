Skeleton-based human action recognition is a crucial aspect in various fields. Current approaches typically employ convolutional neural networks (CNN) or graph convolutional networks (GCN) as backbone models to extract spatial-temporal features. However, the pooling methods used in these approaches, such as temporal average/max pooling, do not effectively capture high-order dynamics information. To tackle this issue, we propose a plug-and-play module called Koopman pooling, which is a parameterized technique based on Koopman theory. The Koopman operator is capable of linearizing non-linear dynamics systems, enabling the representation of complex systems through a dynamics matrix for classification purposes. Additionally, we introduce an eigenvalue normalization method to ensure that the learned dynamics remain non-decaying and stable. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our Koopman pooling framework can be seamlessly extended to one-shot action recognition when combined with Dynamic Mode Decomposition. We evaluate our proposed method on three benchmark datasets: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA. Through extensive experiments, we clearly observe that Koopman pooling significantly enhances performance in both full-dataset and one-shot settings.
