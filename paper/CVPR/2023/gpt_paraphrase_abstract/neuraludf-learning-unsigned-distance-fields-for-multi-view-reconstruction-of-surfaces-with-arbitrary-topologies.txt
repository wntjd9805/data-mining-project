We introduce a new technique called NeuralUDF, which uses volume rendering to reconstruct surfaces of any topology from 2D images. Existing methods in neural rendering have been successful in reconstructing closed surfaces using Signed Distance Function (SDF) representations. However, these methods are limited in their ability to handle objects with non-closed surfaces. In this paper, we propose representing surfaces using the Unsigned Distance Function (UDF) and develop a novel volume rendering approach to learn the neural UDF representation. We introduce a new density function that optimizes the UDF fields, allowing for robust reconstruction. Our experiments on the DTU and DeepFashion3D datasets demonstrate that our method can reconstruct high-quality non-closed shapes with complex topologies and achieve comparable performance to SDF-based methods for closed surfaces.
