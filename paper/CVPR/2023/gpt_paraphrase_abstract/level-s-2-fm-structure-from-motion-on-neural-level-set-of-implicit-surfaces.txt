This paper introduces a novel neural incremental Structure-from-Motion (SfM) approach called Level-S2fM. The approach aims to estimate camera poses and scene geometry from a set of uncalibrated images by learning coordinate Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) for implicit surfaces and radiance fields based on established key-point correspondences. The incremental nature of the SfM pipeline presents challenges in optimizing the coordinate MLPs for volumetric neural rendering when dealing with two-view and few-view configurations. However, the authors demonstrate that the strong inductive basis provided by the 2D correspondences can help overcome these challenges by leveraging the relationship between ray sampling schemes. The paper proposes a fresh perspective on the incremental SfM pipeline, including two-view geometry initialization, camera pose registration, 3D point triangulation, and Bundle Adjustment, by incorporating neural implicit surfaces. By utilizing coordinate MLPs to unify the scene geometry in small MLP networks, Level-S2fM considers the zero-level set of the implicit surface as a useful top-down regularization technique for managing reconstructed 3D points, identifying outliers through querying Signed Distance Functions (SDF), and refining estimated geometries using Neural Bundle Adjustment (NBA). The Level-S2fM approach not only achieves promising results in camera pose estimation and scene geometry reconstruction but also offers potential for neural implicit rendering even without prior knowledge of camera extrinsic parameters.
