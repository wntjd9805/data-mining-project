Recently, there has been a growing focus on computer vision's interpolation task, particularly video interpolation. However, the field of point cloud interpolation has not received as much attention. This is problematic because real-world scenarios often involve nonlinear large motions, which pose challenges for point cloud interpolation. To address these issues, we propose NeuralPCI, a 4D spatio-temporal Neural field that integrates multi-frame information to handle nonlinear large motions in both indoor and outdoor scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset called NL-Drive, which is specifically designed for point cloud interpolation in autonomous driving scenes with large nonlinear motions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that NeuralPCI achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the Dynamic Human Bodies (DHB) and NL-Drive datasets. Furthermore, our method can be extended to other tasks such as point cloud extrapolation, morphing, and auto-labeling, showcasing its potential in various domains.
