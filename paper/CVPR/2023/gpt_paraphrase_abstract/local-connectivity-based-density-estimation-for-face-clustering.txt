Recent graph-based methods for face clustering have been successful in predicting the connectivity of edges. However, these methods often include false positive edges that connect nodes belonging to different classes. This poses a risk of integrating different clusters when the connectivity of these false positive edges is incorrectly estimated. To address this problem, we propose a new face clustering method that utilizes density-based clustering and focuses on maintaining edges with higher density. To achieve this, we introduce a reliable density estimation algorithm based on the local connectivity between K nearest neighbors (KNN). By using this algorithm, we are able to exclude negative node pairs from the KNN graph while ensuring that enough positive pairs are retained. In addition, we develop a pairwise connectivity estimation network to predict the connectivity of the selected edges. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing clustering methods on large-scale face clustering datasets as well as fashion image clustering datasets. The code for our method is publicly available on GitHub at the following link: https://github.com/illian01/LCE-PCENet.
