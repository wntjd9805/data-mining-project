We present a new approach called NL-GAT for robust 3D shape classification. NL-GAT consists of two sub-networks: a global relationship network (GRN) and a global structure network (GSN). In the GRN, we capture global relationships between points using point-point features. In the GSN, we enhance local features with a geometric shape attention map. To ensure rotation invariance and extract more information from sparse point clouds, all sub-networks use Gram matrices with different dimensions as input. The GRN effectively preserves low-frequency features and improves classification results. Experimental results on various datasets show that NL-GAT outperforms other state-of-the-art models, particularly in the case of sparse point clouds with noise and arbitrary SO(3) rotation. NL-GAT achieves a classification result of 85.4%, which is a 39.4% improvement compared to the best performance of other methods.
