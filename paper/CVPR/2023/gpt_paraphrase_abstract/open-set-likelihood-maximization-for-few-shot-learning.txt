We address the Few-Shot Open-Set Recognition (FSOSR) problem, where we classify instances among a small number of labeled classes and simultaneously detect instances that do not belong to any known class. We focus on the transductive setting, which utilizes unlabeled query instances during inference. However, existing transductive methods perform poorly in open-set scenarios. To address this, we propose a generalized version of the maximum likelihood principle that incorporates latent scores to reduce the influence of potential outliers. Our approach includes supervision constraints from the support set and penalties to discourage overconfident predictions on the query set. We optimize the latent scores and parametric model alternately using block-coordinate descent, benefiting from each other. We name our formulation Open-Set Likelihood Optimization (OSLO), which is interpretable and modular, compatible with any pre-trained model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing inductive and transductive methods in both inlier classification and outlier detection for open-set recognition.
