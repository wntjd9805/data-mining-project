Optimal transport (OT) has gained popularity in machine learning, data science, and computer vision. However, the OT problem assumes an equal amount of mass in source and target measures, limiting its application. To address this limitation, Optimal Partial Transport (OPT) has been proposed. OPT also involves solving a linear programming problem, which can be computationally challenging. In this study, we present an efficient algorithm for calculating the OPT problem in one dimension. Additionally, we introduce the Sliced OPT distance by utilizing slicing techniques. We conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the computational and accuracy advantages of the Sliced OPT-based approach. Specifically, we apply the Sliced OPT problem to noisy point cloud registration and color adaptation. The code for our method is available at the provided Github Link.
