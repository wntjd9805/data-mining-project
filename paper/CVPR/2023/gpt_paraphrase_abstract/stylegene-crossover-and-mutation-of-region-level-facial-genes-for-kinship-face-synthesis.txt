This paper introduces a novel approach, called the RFG (Region-level Facial Gene) extraction framework, to address the challenge of synthesizing high-quality descendant faces with genetic relations. The lack of large-scale, high-quality annotated kinship data has hindered the development of accurate kinship face synthesis. The proposed framework utilizes the IGE (Image-based Gene Encoder), LGE (Latent-based Gene Encoder), and Gene Decoder to learn the RFGs of a given face image and the relationships between RFGs and the latent space of Style-GAN2.To train the framework, only face images of the corresponding author are required, eliminating the need for paired kinship face data. Cycle-like losses are designed to measure the L2 distances between the output of the Gene Decoder and image encoder, as well as between the output of LGE and IGE. This ensures that the synthesized faces accurately represent the desired genetic relations.Furthermore, a crossover and mutation module is incorporated into the framework to inherit facial parts from parents, increasing the diversity of descendant faces. A Gene Pool is utilized to introduce variations into the mutation of RFGs. This comprehensive approach significantly enhances the quality and diversity of the generated kinship faces.The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through qualitative, quantitative, and subjective experiments on several benchmark datasets including FIW, TSKinFace, and FF-Databases. The results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both quality and diversity of synthesized kinship faces. The potential applications of this high-fidelity kinship face synthesis technique include kinship verification, missing child identification, and social media analysis.
