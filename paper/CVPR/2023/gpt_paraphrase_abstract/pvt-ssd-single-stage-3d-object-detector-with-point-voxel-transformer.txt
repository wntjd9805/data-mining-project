We propose a new approach called PVT-SSD for 3D object detection using a combination of point- and voxel-based representations. This approach addresses the limitations of both methods by using voxel-based sparse convolutions for efficient feature encoding and a Point-Voxel Transformer (PVT) module for obtaining accurate positions and long-range contexts. We introduce an input-dependent Query Initialization module to associate the two representations by generating reference points and content queries. The PVT module then fuses contextual and geometric information around reference points into content queries. Additionally, we design the Virtual Range Image module to quickly find neighboring points of reference points. Experimental results on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method. The code for our approach will be made available.
