Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technology has gained popularity in recent years for its ability to extract the Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) from facial videos, enabling applications such as health monitoring and emotional analysis. However, existing methods struggle to generalize well for unseen domains due to the influence of environmental changes on the BVP signal. In this paper, we address the domain shift problem in rPPG measurement and propose a domain-label-free approach called NEuron STructure modeling (NEST). NEST improves generalization by maximizing the coverage of feature space during training, reducing the chance of under-optimized feature activation during inference. Additionally, NEST enriches and enhances domain invariant features across multiple domains. We create and benchmark a large-scale domain generalization protocol for the rPPG measurement task and demonstrate through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both cross-dataset and intra-dataset settings.
