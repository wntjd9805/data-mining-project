Efforts have been made to improve the performance of unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. However, there is still a significant performance gap compared to supervised learning. To address this issue, we propose a common framework that utilizes different weak labels, such as image, point, and coarse labels from the target domain. Our approach focuses on learning better prototypes that represent class features by leveraging these weak labels. These improved prototypes are then used for the contrastive alignment of class features. We perform two types of feature alignments: aligning pixel features with prototypes within each domain, and aligning pixel features from the source domain to prototypes in the target domain in an asymmetric manner. The asymmetric alignment is crucial for preserving target features during training, especially when weak labels are available from the target domain. Experimental results on various benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves significant improvements compared to existing methods and can narrow the performance gap with supervised learning. The code for our approach will be made available at https://github.com/anurag-198/WDASS.
