Transfer-based black-box attacks are a type of attacks that do not require knowledge of the attacked models, making them more secretive. However, these attacks often rely on ensembling multiple models, which is time-consuming and resource-intensive. Additionally, it is challenging to obtain diverse models for the same task. To overcome these limitations, this study focuses on a single-model transfer-based black-box attack on object detection. The goal is to achieve a highly transferable adversarial attack using only one model on multiple black-box detectors. The researchers propose an enhanced attack framework by adjusting the training strategies of the existing method. They also apply self-ensemble approaches to optimize the input data, the attacked model, and the adversarial patch. This allows them to efficiently use limited information and prevent overfitting of the patch. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the black-box transferability of the optimized patch on multiple mainstream detectors, while also enhancing white-box performance.
