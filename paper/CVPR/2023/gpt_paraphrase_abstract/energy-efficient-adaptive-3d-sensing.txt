This paper introduces an adaptive active depth sensor that optimizes range, power consumption, and eye-safety. Instead of projecting light patterns to the entire scene, the sensor only projects onto small regions of interest where depth is necessary. The proposed method is compared to other sensing strategies and is shown to consume the least power while maintaining the shortest eye-safety distance. Two hardware prototypes are implemented to validate the advantages of the adaptive sensing scheme. Experimental results confirm its capability to acquire higher quality geometry adaptively.
