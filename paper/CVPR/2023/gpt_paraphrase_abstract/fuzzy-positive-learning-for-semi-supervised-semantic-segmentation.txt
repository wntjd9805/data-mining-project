Semi-supervised learning (SSL) aims to explore class boundaries without relying heavily on human annotations. While most methods focus on improving error-prone pseudo-labeling, our approach, Fuzzy Positive Learning (FPL), takes a different approach by extracting informative semantics from multiple potentially correct candidate labels. In this paper, we present FPL as a plug-and-play solution for accurate SSL semantic segmentation. FPL adaptively encourages fuzzy positive predictions and suppresses highly-probable negatives. Despite its simplicity, FPL effectively reduces the interference caused by incorrect pseudo labels and achieves clear pixel-level semantic discrimination. FPL consists of two main components: fuzzy positive assignment (FPA) provides each pixel with an adaptive number of labels, and fuzzy positive regularization (FPR) ensures that the predictions of fuzzy positive categories are larger than the rest under different perturbations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on Cityscapes and VOC 2012 datasets consistently demonstrate the superiority of our approach.
