Many current methods for 3D reconstruction lack detail or efficiency. However, both effectiveness and efficiency are crucial in real-world applications such as autonomous driving and augmented reality. We believe this issue arises from wasting resources on depth samples that do not provide value. To address this problem, we propose a new learning-based 3D reconstruction framework called Dionysus. Our main contribution is identifying the most promising depth candidates from estimated semantic maps. This approach allows us to achieve both high effectiveness and efficiency by focusing on the most reliable depth samples. We accomplish this by checking cross-view semantic consistency to distinguish unreliable depth candidates and redistributing depth samples among pixels to enable adaptive sampling. Experimental results on popular datasets validate the effectiveness of our approach.
