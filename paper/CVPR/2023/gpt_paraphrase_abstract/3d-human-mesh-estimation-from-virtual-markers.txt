Recent advancements in volumetric 3D pose estimation have led to the proposal of human mesh estimators that estimate 3D skeletons as intermediate representations. These estimators then regress dense 3D meshes by utilizing mesh topology. However, this approach lacks body shape information as skeletons are extracted, resulting in subpar performance. Advanced motion capture systems address this issue by using physical markers on the body surface, enabling the extraction of realistic meshes from non-rigid motions. Nonetheless, these systems cannot be applied to images without markers. This research introduces a novel intermediate representation called virtual markers, which learns 64 landmark keypoints on the body surface through generative modeling using large-scale motion capture data. Mimicking the effects of physical markers, virtual markers can be accurately detected in wild images and enable the reconstruction of realistic meshes using simple interpolation. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three datasets, notably surpassing existing methods on the SURREAL dataset, which encompasses diverse body shapes.
