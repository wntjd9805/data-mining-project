Image segmentation is a crucial task in imaging and vision. While supervised deep learning has been successful in segmentation with abundant annotated training data, obtaining such annotations, especially for histopathology images with varying and irregular shapes, is expensive. Therefore, weakly supervised learning using sparse point annotations has emerged as a promising approach to reduce annotation efforts. This study introduces a contrast-based variational model for generating segmentation results, which can serve as reliable supplementary supervision for training deep segmentation models in histopathology images. The proposed method considers the common characteristics of target regions in histopathology images and can be trained end-to-end. It produces more consistent and smoother boundary segmentation, and is more robust to unlabeled regions. Experimental results on two histology datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency compared to previous models.
