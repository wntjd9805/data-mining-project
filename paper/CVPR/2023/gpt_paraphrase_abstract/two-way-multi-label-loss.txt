The abstract discusses the challenges of multi-label classification in natural images and proposes a new loss function to address these challenges. Currently, binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss is commonly used for multi-label classification, but it has issues with imbalance and lacks discriminative power. The proposed loss function combines elements of softmax and multi-label scenarios to improve classification accuracy and enhance the margin between classes. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs competitively compared to other multi-label losses and also provides transferrable features for single-label ImageNet training. The code for the proposed method is available at the provided GitHub link.
