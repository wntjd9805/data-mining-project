We present a novel framework for training control policies for vision-based human-to-robot handovers, which is a crucial task in human-robot interaction. Although EmbodiedAI research has made progress in training robot agents in simulated environments, interacting with humans remains challenging due to the difficulty of simulating humans. However, recent advancements have led to the development of realistic simulated environments specifically for human-to-robot handovers. Taking advantage of this, we propose a method that involves training with a human-in-the-loop using a two-stage teacher-student framework that incorporates motion and grasp planning, reinforcement learning, and self-supervision. Our approach outperforms baseline methods on a simulation benchmark, as well as sim-to-sim and sim-to-real transfer scenarios.
