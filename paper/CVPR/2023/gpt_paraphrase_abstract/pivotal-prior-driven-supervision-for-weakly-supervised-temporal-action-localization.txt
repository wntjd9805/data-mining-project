PivoTAL is a novel approach to Weakly-supervised Temporal Action Localization (WTAL), which aims to locate actions in untrimmed videos using only video-level supervision. Unlike previous methods that classify each frame and aggregate predictions, PivoTAL takes a localization-by-localization perspective and directly learns to localize action snippets. This approach improves action localization by explicitly understanding action boundaries and considering the entire video instead of focusing on discriminative parts only. PivoTAL achieves this by leveraging spatio-temporal regularities through action-specific scene priors, action snippet generation priors, and learnable Gaussian priors for training supervision. Experimental results on benchmark datasets, THUMOS-14 and ActivitNet-v1.3, demonstrate significant improvement (at least 3% avg mAP) compared to existing methods.
