Current methods primarily focus on individual weather conditions and do not consider the connections between different weather conditions at a deep representation level. However, these connections can offer complementary representations that compensate for the lack of training data, resulting in improved performance and generalization. This paper specifically examines the closely related weather conditions of rain and snow to explore their connections at a deep representation level. The challenge lies in finding an optimal connection strategy when handling rain and snow in a multi-task learning approach, in order to enhance both de-raining and desnowing performance. To address this, we propose a smart knowledge assignment strategy called SmartAssign, which assigns the knowledge learned from both tasks to a specific task in an optimal manner. Additionally, we introduce a novel knowledge contrast mechanism to improve the accuracy of knowledge assignment by preserving better uniqueness between tasks. To overcome the limitations of convolutional neural networks' modeling ability due to inherited biases, we incorporate a novel transformer block as the backbone of our network, enabling the effective combination of long-range context dependency and local image details. Through extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that SmartAssign successfully explores the effective connection between rain and snow, significantly enhancing the performance of both de-raining and desnowing.
