To address the limitations of optical flow in foggy scenes, existing methods focus on domain adaptation to transfer knowledge from clean to synthetic foggy domains. However, these methods fail to consider the gap between synthetic and real foggy domains, rendering them ineffective for real-world scenes. In this study, we propose an unsupervised cumulative domain adaptation optical flow framework called UCDA-Flow. Our framework includes two modules: depth-association motion adaptation and correlation-alignment motion adaptation. We observe that depth plays a crucial role in optical flow, with deeper depth resulting in inferior performance. Hence, we introduce a depth-association motion adaptation module to bridge the gap between clean and foggy domains. Additionally, we discover that the cost volume correlation exhibits similar distributions in synthetic and real foggy images. This insight leads us to develop a correlation-alignment motion adaptation module that transfers motion knowledge from the synthetic foggy domain to the real foggy domain. By treating synthetic fog as an intermediate domain, our unified framework progressively transfers knowledge from clean scenes to real foggy scenes. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method.
