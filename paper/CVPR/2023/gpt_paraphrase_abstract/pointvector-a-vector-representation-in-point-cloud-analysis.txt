Recently, there has been significant progress in point-based methods for point cloud analysis. These methods, particularly the concise MLP structures like Point-NeXt, have shown promising results and competitiveness compared to Convolutional and Transformer structures. However, there is a limitation in standard MLPs when it comes to effectively extracting local features. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Vector-oriented Point Set Abstraction technique that can aggregate neighboring features using higher-dimensional vectors. To facilitate network optimization, we introduce a transformation from scalar to vector by utilizing independent angles based on 3D vector rotations. Subsequently, we present the PointVector model, which follows the structure of PointNeXt. Our experimental results demonstrate that PointVector achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 72.3% mIOU on the S3DIS Area 5 and 78.4% mIOU on the S3DIS dataset (6-fold cross-validation), using just 58% of the model parameters compared to PointNeXt. We believe that our work will contribute to the development of concise and effective feature representations in point cloud analysis. The code for our approach will be made available soon.
