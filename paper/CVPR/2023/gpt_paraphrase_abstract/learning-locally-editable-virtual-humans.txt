This paper proposes a new approach for creating and customizing neural avatars by combining the modeling power of neural fields with the 3D consistency of skinned meshes. The authors introduce a feature codebook that stores local geometry and texture features on the vertices of a deformable body model, allowing for generative auto-decoding and editing of avatars. They also provide a new dataset, called CustomHumans, for training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that their method produces diverse avatars with better model fitting performance compared to existing methods. The code and dataset are publicly available at https://ait.ethz.ch/custom-humans.
