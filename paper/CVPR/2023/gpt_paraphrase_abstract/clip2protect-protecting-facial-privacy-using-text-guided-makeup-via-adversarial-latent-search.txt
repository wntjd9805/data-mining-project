The success of deep learning face recognition systems has raised concerns about privacy as they can be used to track users without authorization. Existing methods to protect privacy do not create realistic images that safeguard facial privacy while maintaining user experience. To address this, we propose a new approach that involves two steps. Firstly, we convert the given face image into a latent space and adjust the generative model to accurately reconstruct the image from its latent code. This step provides a good starting point for generating high-quality faces resembling the original identity. Secondly, we use user-defined makeup text prompts and identity-preserving regularization to search for adversarial codes in the latent space. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach generates faces with stronger black-box transferability compared to the current state-of-the-art privacy protection method, with an improvement of 12.06% in face verification tasks. Additionally, we show the effectiveness of our approach in commercial face recognition systems. Our code can be accessed at https://github.com/fahadshamshad/Clip2Protect.
