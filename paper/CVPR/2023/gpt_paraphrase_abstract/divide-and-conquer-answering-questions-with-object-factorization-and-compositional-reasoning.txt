Humans possess an inherent ability to answer a wide range of questions by connecting different concepts and breaking down complex problems into smaller tasks. In contrast, existing visual reasoning methods heavily rely on predefined training samples and statistical priors, limiting their capability to handle novel objects and biases in real-world scenarios. Additionally, these methods often lack transparency in their decision-making process. Taking inspiration from human reasoning, we propose a comprehensive framework that addresses these challenges. Our framework includes a principled object factorization method and a novel neural module network. The object factorization method decomposes objects based on their key characteristics and generates prototypes that represent various objects. These prototypes capture important semantics, enabling the proposed network to measure similarity between objects in a common semantic space and make decisions using a compositional reasoning process. Our framework is capable of answering questions involving diverse objects, regardless of whether they were seen during training, and it overcomes biased question-answer distributions. Furthermore, our framework provides an interpretable interface, allowing for a better understanding of the decision-making process of the models.
