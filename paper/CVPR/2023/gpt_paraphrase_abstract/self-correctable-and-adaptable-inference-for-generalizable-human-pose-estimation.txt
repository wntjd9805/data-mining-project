The generalization problem is a major challenge in tasks like human pose estimation and machine learning. The existing networks lack the ability to identify prediction errors, generate feedback, and correct errors on an individual basis, leading to reduced performance in generalization. This study introduces a self-correctable and adaptable inference (SCAI) method to address this challenge. The SCAI method uses human pose estimation as an example to demonstrate its effectiveness. It involves learning a correction network that corrects prediction results based on a fitness feedback error. This error is generated by a fitness feedback network, which maps the prediction result to the original input and compares it with the original input. Surprisingly, the self-referential feedback error is highly correlated with the actual prediction error, suggesting its potential for guiding the correction process. It can also serve as a loss function to optimize the correction network during the inference process. Extensive experiments on human pose estimation show that the SCAI method significantly improves generalization capability and performance in this task.
