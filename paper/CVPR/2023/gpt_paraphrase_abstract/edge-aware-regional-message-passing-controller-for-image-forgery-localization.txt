This study focuses on image forgery localization, which aims to determine whether an image has been manipulated. While deep learning methods have made significant progress in this area, they often struggle with distinguishing between forged and authentic regions due to feature coupling. To overcome this issue, the authors propose a two-step strategy called Edge-aware Regional Message Passing Controlling (ERMPC). In the first step, the authors leverage edge information by using a context-enhanced graph construction and a threshold-adaptive differentiable binarization edge algorithm. The former combines global semantic information to differentiate between forged and authentic regions, while the latter generates learnable edges based on the output of the former. In the second step, a region message passing controller guided by the learnable edges is introduced to reduce the message passing between forged and authentic regions. This approach explicitly models the inconsistency between the two regions, enabling better performance on refined forged images. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that ERMPC outperforms existing image forgery localization methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.
