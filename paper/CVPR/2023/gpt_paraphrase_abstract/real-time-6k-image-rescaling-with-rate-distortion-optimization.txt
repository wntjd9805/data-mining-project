Contemporary methods for image rescaling aim to embed a high-resolution image into a low-resolution thumbnail image, which carries information for high-resolution image reconstruction. Unlike traditional image super-resolution techniques, this approach allows for faithful restoration of the high-resolution image using the embedded information in the thumbnail. However, current state-of-the-art methods for image rescaling do not optimize the file size of the low-resolution image for efficient sharing and struggle to achieve real-time performance for ultra-high-resolution image reconstruction, such as 6K resolution. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework called HyperThumbnail for real-time 6K rate-distortion-aware image rescaling. Our framework utilizes an encoder with a quantization prediction module to embed the high-resolution image into a JPEG low-resolution thumbnail, minimizing the file size while maximizing the quality of the high-resolution reconstruction. Additionally, we employ an efficient frequency-aware decoder to reconstruct the high-fidelity high-resolution image from the low-resolution thumbnail in real time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms previous image rescaling methods in terms of rate-distortion performance and is capable of achieving real-time 6K image reconstruction.
