Jointly matching multiple, non-rigidly deformed 3D shapes is a difficult problem that is computationally complex. To achieve a perfect matching, it is necessary to ensure cycle-consistency, meaning that following the point correspondences between shapes should lead back to the starting vertex of the original shape. However, existing quantum shape-matching methods do not support multiple shapes or cycle consistency. This paper introduces a novel quantum-hybrid approach for 3D shape multi-matching that addresses these challenges. The approach is designed to be compatible with modern adiabatic quantum hardware and scales linearly with the number of input shapes. To achieve this, the problem is reduced to a sequence of three-shape matchings, which is the main technical contribution of this work. By utilizing quantum annealing, the approach is able to retrieve high-quality solutions with low energy for the intermediate objectives that are NP-hard. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms previous quantum-hybrid two-shape matching methods and is comparable to classical multi-matching methods.
