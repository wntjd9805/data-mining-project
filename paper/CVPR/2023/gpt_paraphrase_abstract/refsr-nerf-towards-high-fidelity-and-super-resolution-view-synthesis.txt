We introduce RefSR-NeRF, an extension of NeRF that addresses its limitations in high resolution rendering. NeRF has been successful in neural rendering but struggles with learning high frequency details and suffers from computational issues as resolution increases. Our proposed framework, RefSR-NeRF, first learns a low resolution NeRF representation and then reconstructs high frequency details using a high resolution reference image. Simply using pre-trained models from the literature leads to unsatisfactory results due to divergence in the degradation model. To overcome this, we develop a lightweight RefSR model that learns the inverse degradation process from NeRF renderings to high resolution images. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a remarkable balance between rendering quality, speed, and memory usage, surpassing or matching the performance of NeRF and its variants. Our approach offers a 52Ã— speedup with minimal additional memory usage. Code will be available in Mindspore and Pytorch.
