We introduce HandAvatar, an innovative approach to hand animation and rendering that produces smooth geometry and texture while accounting for self-occlusion. Our method involves creating a high-resolution mesh topology called MANO-HD to accurately represent personalized hand shapes. By breaking down the hand geometry into individual bone parts and reconstructing them into a consistent occupancy field, we ensure a coherent representation across different parts.In terms of texture modeling, we propose a shading field called SelF that considers self-occlusion. We place drivable anchors on the MANO-HD surface to capture albedo information for various hand poses. Additionally, we incorporate directed soft occupancy to describe the relationship between rays and surfaces, enabling the generation of an illumination field that separates pose-independent albedo from pose-dependent illumination.Trained using monocular video data, our HandAvatar enables the animation and rendering of hands in any pose while maintaining high visual fidelity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HandAvatar facilitates hand appearance editing. Please visit our project website at https://seanchenxy.github.io/HandAvatarWeb for more information.
