We propose a new method for learning 3D scene priors without the need for 3D ground truth. Instead, we utilize 2D supervision from multi-view RGB images to represent a 3D scene as a latent vector. This allows us to decode the scene into objects with their class categories, 3D bounding boxes, and meshes. Our trained autoregressive decoder enables various downstream applications such as scene synthesis, interpolation, and single-view reconstruction. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in single-view reconstruction and achieves state-of-the-art results in scene synthesis without relying on 3D supervision.
