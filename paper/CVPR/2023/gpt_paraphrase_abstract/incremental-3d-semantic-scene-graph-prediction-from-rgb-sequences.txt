We present a real-time framework for constructing a 3D semantic scene graph from an RGB image sequence. Our framework includes an incremental entity estimation pipeline and a scene graph prediction network. The pipeline reconstructs a sparse point map and incorporates entity estimation from the input images, while the network estimates 3D semantic scene graphs using multi-view and geometric features. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the 3RScan dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in this challenging task. The implementation of our framework is available at https://shunchengwu.github.io/MonoSSG.
