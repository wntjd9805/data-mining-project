This study focuses on unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for semantic segmentation, which aims to improve the performance of a model on an unlabeled target domain by leveraging a labeled source domain. Previous approaches have made significant progress by using pseudo-labels on the target domain images. However, these pseudo-labels are of low quality due to domain discrepancies, which hinders the adaptation process. Therefore, there is a need for accurate methods to estimate the reliability of these pseudo-labels in order to rectify them. In this paper, the authors propose a method to estimate the rectification values of the predicted pseudo-labels using implicit neural representations. They consider the rectification value as a signal defined over the continuous spatial domain. By taking an image coordinate and nearby deep features as inputs, they predict the rectification value at a given coordinate as an output. This approach enables high-resolution and detailed estimation of rectification values, which is crucial for generating accurate pseudo-labels, especially at mask boundaries. The rectified pseudo-labels are then utilized in a rectification-aware mixture model (RMM), which is learned end-to-end to aid in the adaptation process. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated on various UDA benchmarks, including synthetic-to-real and day-to-night scenarios. The proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
