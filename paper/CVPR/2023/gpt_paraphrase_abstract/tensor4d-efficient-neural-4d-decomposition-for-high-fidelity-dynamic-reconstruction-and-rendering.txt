We present Tensor4D, a highly efficient approach for modeling dynamic scenes. Our solution revolves around a novel 4D tensor decomposition method, which allows for the direct representation of dynamic scenes as a spatio-temporal tensor. To address memory constraints, we hierarchically decompose the 4D tensor by projecting it into three time-aware volumes and then nine compact feature planes. This enables the simultaneous capture of spatial information over time in a compact and memory-efficient manner. When applied to dynamic scene reconstruction and rendering, Tensor4D further factorizes the 4D fields into different scales, enabling the learning of structural motions and dynamic detailed changes from coarse to fine. We have validated the effectiveness of our method on both synthetic and real-world scenes through extensive experiments. The results demonstrate that our method achieves high-quality dynamic reconstruction and rendering, even with sparse-view camera rigs or a monocular camera. The code and dataset for Tensor4D will be made publicly available at https://github.com/DSaurus/Tensor4D.
