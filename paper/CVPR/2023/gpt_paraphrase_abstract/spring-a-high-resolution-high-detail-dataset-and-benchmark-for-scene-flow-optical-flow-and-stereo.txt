Recent advancements in motion and stereo estimation techniques have allowed for the recovery of highly detailed structures in images. However, these detailed structures are not adequately represented in existing benchmark datasets or their evaluation methods. To address this issue, we present the Spring benchmark, a computer-generated benchmark that offers high-resolution and high-detail datasets for scene flow, optical flow, and stereo. The benchmark is based on rendered scenes from the Blender movie "Spring" and provides photo-realistic HD datasets with state-of-the-art visual effects and ground truth training data. Additionally, we have developed a website where users can upload, analyze, and compare their results.One of the key features of the Spring benchmark is its novel evaluation methodology, which incorporates a super-resolved UHD ground truth. This allows for a more accurate assessment of the quality of fine structures in the images and provides detailed performance statistics for different regions of the image. In terms of the number of ground truth frames, the Spring benchmark is significantly larger than other benchmarks such as KITTI 2015 and MPI Sintel optical flow benchmark.Preliminary results on our benchmark have shown that accurately estimating fine details is a challenging task, as current methods still have room for improvement in terms of accuracy. The Spring benchmark and its corresponding datasets are publicly available at http://spring-benchmark.org.Figure 1 illustrates the high level of detail present in the Spring dataset. The dataset consists of HD images with super-resolved UHD ground truth for disparities and optical flow.
