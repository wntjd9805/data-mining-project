Recently, AutoFlow has shown promise in learning optical flow from a training set. However, it relies on ground truth labels in the target domain to calculate its search metric. We have observed a strong correlation between the ground truth search metric and self-supervised losses. To address this, we propose self-supervised AutoFlow, which can handle real-world videos without ground truth labels. By using self-supervised loss as the search metric, our self-supervised AutoFlow achieves similar performance to AutoFlow on datasets like Sintel and KITTI, where ground truth is available. Additionally, it outperforms AutoFlow on the real-world DAVIS dataset. We also investigate the use of self-supervised AutoFlow in a (semi-)supervised setting and achieve competitive results compared to the current state-of-the-art methods.
