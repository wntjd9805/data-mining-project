We introduce 3D Highlighter, a method that utilizes text input to identify semantic regions on a mesh. One of the notable features of our system is its ability to identify relevant regions even when the concepts are not directly related. For instance, our system can determine where to add clothing to a 3D animal model. Our approach involves contextualizing the text description through a neural field and coloring the corresponding region on the shape using a probability-weighted blend. To achieve this, we utilize a pre-trained CLIP encoder for neural optimization, eliminating the need for 3D datasets or annotations. This makes 3D Highlighter highly adaptable, versatile, and capable of localizing regions on various input shapes. Interested users can access our code at https://github.com/threedle/3DHighlighter.
