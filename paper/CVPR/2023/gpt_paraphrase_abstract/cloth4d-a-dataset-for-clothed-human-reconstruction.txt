This study introduces CLOTH4D, a dataset of clothed human models that aims to address the need for large-scale and high-quality 4D clothing data for virtual world creation. The dataset consists of 1,000 subjects with varied appearances, 1,000 3D outfits, and over 100,000 clothed meshes paired with unclothed humans. The clothing textured meshes are accurately and meticulously created following fashion design standards and are simulated using professional software. The dataset also includes separate textured clothing and under-clothing body meshes, which better represent the physical world compared to single-layer raw scans. Additionally, the dataset provides clothed human motion sequences simulated with 289 actions, covering both basic and complex dynamics.To evaluate the temporal stability of the generated 3D human meshes, the study introduces a series of novel temporally-aware metrics, which have been overlooked in previous research. By assessing and retraining current state-of-the-art clothed human reconstruction methods using the CLOTH4D dataset, the study uncovers insights, demonstrates improved performance, and suggests potential future research directions. The availability of the dataset further confirms its advancement in the field. The CLOTH4D dataset can be accessed at [website URL].
