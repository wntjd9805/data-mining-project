We introduce a new technique for creating a 3D surface from a point cloud that is large, sparse, and contains noise. Our method is based on the Neural Kernel Fields (NKF) approach and shares its ability to generalize well. However, we address the limitations of NKF in three ways. Firstly, we can handle large scenes thanks to compactly supported kernel functions, which allow for memory-efficient sparse linear solvers. Secondly, we are robust against noise through a gradient fitting solve. Thirdly, we minimize the training requirements, enabling us to learn from any dataset of dense oriented points and mix training data of objects and scenes at different scales. Our method can reconstruct millions of points in just a few seconds and can handle very large scenes efficiently. We achieve excellent results on benchmark tests of object, indoor, and outdoor scene reconstructions, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods.
