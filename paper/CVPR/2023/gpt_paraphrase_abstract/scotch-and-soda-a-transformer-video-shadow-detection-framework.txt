Detecting shadows in videos is challenging due to the significant deformation they undergo between frames. In this study, we emphasize the importance of considering shadow deformation when developing a video shadow detection method. To address this issue, we propose a novel module called shadow deformation attention trajectory (SODA) that is specifically designed to handle the extensive shadow deformations observed in videos. Additionally, we introduce a new mechanism called shadow contrastive learning (SCOTCH), which aims to facilitate the network in learning a unified representation of shadows by utilizing a vast number of positive shadow pairs across different videos. Through an ablation study, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of SODA and SCOTCH. Furthermore, we show that our proposed techniques outperform existing methods for video shadow detection.
