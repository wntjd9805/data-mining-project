This paper introduces a new model called TCL, which aims to improve the performance of learning from noisy data. TCL utilizes a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to link label-free latent variables with label-noisy annotations, allowing it to detect examples with incorrect labels. Additionally, TCL incorporates cross-supervision with an entropy regularization loss to handle noisy labels and learn discriminative representations. Experimental results demonstrate that TCL outperforms existing methods on various benchmarks and real-world datasets, achieving significant improvements even in extremely noisy scenarios. The source code for TCL is available at https://github.com/Hzzone/TCL.
