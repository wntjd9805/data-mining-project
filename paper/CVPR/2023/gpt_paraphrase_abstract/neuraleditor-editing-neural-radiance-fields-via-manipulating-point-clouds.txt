This paper introduces NeuralEditor, a tool that allows for the native editing of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in general shape editing tasks. While NeRFs have shown impressive results in synthesizing novel views, editing the shape of the scene remains a significant challenge. The authors propose exploiting the explicit point cloud representation underlying NeRFs, considering NeRF rendering as a process that projects the associated 3D point cloud to a 2D image plane. NeuralEditor introduces a new rendering scheme that utilizes deterministic integration within K-D tree-guided density-adaptive voxels, resulting in high-quality rendering and precise point clouds through optimization. The tool enables shape editing by mapping associated points between point clouds. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that NeuralEditor achieves state-of-the-art performance in both shape deformation and scene morphing tasks. It supports zero-shot inference and further fine-tuning over the edited scene. The code, benchmark, and demo video for NeuralEditor can be accessed at im-mortalco.github.io/NeuralEditor.
