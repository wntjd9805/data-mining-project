Creativity is an essential aspect of human cognition and a fundamental element in our understanding of the world. While computer vision primarily focuses on literal interpretations of images, the comprehension of metaphorical representations in images has received limited attention. To address this gap, we present Meta-CLUE, a collection of visual tasks centered around visual metaphor. Additionally, we curate a dataset containing high-quality metaphor annotations, including abstract objects, concepts, relationships, and corresponding object boxes. Our analysis of state-of-the-art models in vision and language, based on these annotations, highlights the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches in various visual metaphor tasks such as classification, localization, understanding, and generation. By undertaking this research, we aim to advance the development of AI systems with creative capabilities similar to those of humans. The project page can be accessed at https://metaclue.github.io.
