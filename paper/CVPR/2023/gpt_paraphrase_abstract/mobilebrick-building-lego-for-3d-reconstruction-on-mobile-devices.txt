Creating high-quality 3D ground-truth shapes for evaluating 3D object reconstruction is challenging. Existing methods, such as replicating objects or using 3D scanners, have limitations and introduce biases in evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce a new dataset captured using a mobile device, which includes accurate 3D ground-truth annotations for 153 object models with diverse structures. Instead of relying on expensive 3D scanners, we use LEGO models with known geometry for image capture, resulting in precise 3D ground-truth shapes. The combination of high-resolution RGB images and low-resolution depth maps captured on a mobile device, along with precise 3D geometry annotations, provides a unique opportunity for future research in high-fidelity 3D reconstruction. Additionally, we evaluate various 3D reconstruction algorithms using our dataset.
