Geometric model fitting is a complex problem in computer vision. While quantum optimization has shown improvements in fitting single models, the challenge of fitting multiple models remains open. This paper presents the first quantum approach to multi-model fitting (MMF) and demonstrates its effectiveness using quantum hardware. We define MMF as a problem that can be efficiently solved by adiabatic quantum computers without relaxing the objective function. Additionally, we propose an iterative and decomposed version of our method to handle real-world-sized problems. Experimental evaluations on various datasets show promising results.
