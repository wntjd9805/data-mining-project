Open world object detection (OWOD) has garnered significant attention due to its practical application in real-world scenarios. However, previous OWOD approaches have relied on manual selection of unknown proposals from the background, resulting in uncertainty and lack of appropriateness. In this study, we propose a novel approach that considers object detection as a process of entangling object-level features, where unknown traits are propagated to known proposals through convolutional operations. This allows for the distillation of unknown recognition without the need for manual selection. To address uncertainties, we introduce an Annealing-based Label-Transfer framework that effectively explores known proposals. The framework incorporates a Label-Transfer Learning paradigm to separate known and unknown features, and a Sawtooth Annealing Scheduling strategy to redefine decision boundaries for known and unknown classes. This promotes recognition for both known and unknown objects. Additionally, we introduce a metric called the Equilibrium Index to comprehensively evaluate the performance trade-off between known and unknown classes. Notably, this is the first OWOD approach that eliminates the need for manual unknown selection. Extensive experiments on common benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model achieves superior detection performance, with a significant improvement in unknown mean average precision (200% increase) and even higher performance in known detection compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
