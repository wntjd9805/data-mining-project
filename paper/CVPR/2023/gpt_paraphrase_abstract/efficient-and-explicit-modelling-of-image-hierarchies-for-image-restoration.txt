This paper presents a novel approach for effectively and explicitly representing image hierarchies in global, regional, and local scales during image restoration. The study begins by examining two essential characteristics of natural images: cross-scale similarity and anisotropic image features. Drawing inspiration from these properties, the authors introduce a method called anchored stripe self-attention, which strikes a balance between the computational complexity of self-attention and its modeling capabilities beyond the regional scope. The authors then propose a new network architecture called GRL, which utilizes anchored stripe self-attention, window self-attention, and channel attention enhanced convolution to explicitly model image hierarchies at the global, regional, and local levels. The effectiveness of the proposed network is demonstrated through its application to seven different image restoration tasks, encompassing both real-world and synthetic scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in several of these tasks. The code for implementing the proposed network is made available at https://github.com/ofsoundof/GRL-Image-Restoration.git.
