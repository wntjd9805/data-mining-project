Feature matching in computer vision is the task of finding correspondences between two images of a 3D scene. While most methods focus on sparse matching, we propose a novel dense approach that aims to find all correspondences. Previous dense methods have shown poorer performance compared to sparse and semi-sparse methods for two-view geometry estimation. However, our new dense method outperforms both dense and sparse methods in geometry estimation. This is achieved through three main contributions: a kernel regression global matcher, warp refinement using stacked feature maps and depthwise convolution kernels, and learning dense confidence through consistent depth and a balanced sampling approach for dense confidence maps. Extensive experiments confirm that our proposed method, Dense Kernelized Feature Matching, achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple geometry estimation benchmarks. Specifically, we achieve significant improvements of +4.9 and +8.9 AUC@5â—¦ on the MegaDepth-1500 dataset compared to the best previous sparse method and dense method, respectively. The code for our method is available at the following repository: https://github.com/Parskatt/DKM.
