We introduce a novel network architecture called All-Pairs Multi-Field Transforms (AMT) for video frame interpolation. Our approach incorporates two key components. Firstly, we construct bidirectional correlation volumes for every pair of pixels, utilizing the predicted bilateral flows to update both flows and the interpolated content feature. Secondly, we generate multiple sets of fine-grained flow fields from a single pair of updated coarse flows, enabling separate backward warping on the input frames. This combination of designs allows us to generate accurate task-oriented flows and address challenges related to modeling large motions and handling occluded areas in frame interpolation. As a result, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks while maintaining high efficiency. Additionally, our convolution-based model outperforms Transformer-based models in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Source code for our model is available at https://github.com/MCG-NKU/AMT.
