The abstract discusses the use of Radiance Fields (RF) for representing scenes and their applications in new view synthesis and mixed reality. However, existing segmentation methods for RFs struggle with complex objects. To address this, the ISRF method is introduced, which enables interactive segmentation of objects with fine structure and appearance. This method utilizes nearest neighbor feature matching and bilateral search to accurately segment objects. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of ISRF in segmenting and compositing objects from RFs into different scenes with varying appearances. Additionally, an interactive segmentation tool is provided for others to use.
