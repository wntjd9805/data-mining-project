Modern displays and content support images and videos with more than 8 bits. However, in situations where compression codecs are used, low bit-depth (LBD) images with less than 8 bits can result in banding and blurry artifacts. Previous methods for expanding the bit depth (BDE) still produce unsatisfactory high bit-depth (HBD) images. In this study, we propose an implicit neural function with a bit query to recover de-quantized images from arbitrarily quantized inputs. We also develop a phasor estimator to utilize information from neighboring pixels. Our method outperforms previous BDE methods in terms of performance on both natural and animation images. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on YouTube UGC datasets for reducing banding. The source code for our method is available at the following URL: https://github.com/WooKyoungHan/ABCD.
