Diffusion model-based solvers that solve inverse problems have shown excellent performance when the forward operator is known. However, their applicability to blind inverse problems, where the forward operator is unknown, has not been thoroughly explored. In this study, we propose a solution for blind inverse problems by utilizing a parallel reverse diffusion guided operator. By incorporating gradients from intermediate stages, our method enables joint optimization of the forward operator parameters and the image. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two specific tasks: blind deblurring and imaging through turbulence. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and can also be adapted to other blind inverse problems with known functional forms. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/BlindDPS/blind-dps.
