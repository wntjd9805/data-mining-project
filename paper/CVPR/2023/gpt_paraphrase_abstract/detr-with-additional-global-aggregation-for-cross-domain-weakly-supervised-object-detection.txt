This paper introduces a method for cross-domain weakly supervised object detection (CDWSOD) using a DETR-based approach. The method utilizes the attention mechanism in DETR to aggregate semantics across the entire image, allowing for the exploitation of weak supervision for domain alignment. The proposed method, called DETR-GA, incorporates global aggregation by adding multiple class queries and a foreground query to the encoder and decoder, respectively, to generate image-level predictions. This query-based aggregation has two advantages: it helps locate relevant positions and exclude distractions in the encoder, and it establishes a consensus on class semantics between the object queries and foreground query in the decoder, enabling mutual benefit between strong and weak supervision for domain alignment. Extensive experiments on four cross-domain benchmarks demonstrate that DETR-GA significantly improves cross-domain detection accuracy and surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods.
