In this study, we suggest the utilization of a depth covariance function in the field of geometric vision tasks. By employing this covariance function, we can establish prior probabilities for depth functions, create predictive distributions based on observations, and develop techniques for selecting active points. These approaches are then applied to various tasks such as depth completion, bundle adjustment, and monocular dense visual odometry.
