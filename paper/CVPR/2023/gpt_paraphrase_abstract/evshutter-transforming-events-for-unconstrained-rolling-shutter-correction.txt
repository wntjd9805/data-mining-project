The Rolling Shutter (RS) CMOS sensors commonly used in capturing high resolution images introduce distortions and artifacts when there is motion. To address this issue, RS distortion correction algorithms have been developed. However, existing methods rely on a constant velocity assumption and require multiple frames to predict the displacement field. In this study, we propose a new method called Eventful Shutter (EvShutter) that corrects RS artifacts using a single RGB image and event information with high temporal resolution. Our method includes a flow-based deblurring module to remove blur and a double encoder hourglass network to compensate for RS distortion. Unlike previous methods, our approach does not rely on a constant velocity assumption and utilizes a simple architecture called Filter and Flip (FnF) for RS transformation. We have created a dataset called RS-ERGB, which consists of real events and high-quality RS images with optional blur, to evaluate our method and facilitate future research. The RS images in the dataset are generated from grayscale (GS) images using an adaptive interpolation-based simulator. Our experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art image- and event-based methods in terms of PSNR and LPIPS metrics, achieving a 9.16 dB and 0.75 dB improvement respectively in PSNR, and a 23% and 21% improvement in LPIPS.
