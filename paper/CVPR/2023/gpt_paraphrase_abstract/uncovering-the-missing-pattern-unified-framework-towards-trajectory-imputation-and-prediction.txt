Trajectory prediction is a crucial task for understanding the movement of entities or human behavior based on observed sequences. However, current methods often assume that the observed sequences are complete, disregarding the possibility of missing values due to object occlusion, limited scope, or sensor failure. This limitation significantly affects the accuracy of trajectory prediction. In order to overcome this issue, our paper introduces a unified framework called the Graph-based Conditional Variational Recurrent Neural Network (GC-VRNN), which can simultaneously perform trajectory imputation and prediction. To achieve this, we propose a novel Multi-Space Graph Neural Network (MS-GNN) that can extract spatial features from incomplete observations and utilize missing patterns. Additionally, we utilize a Conditional VRNN with a specially designed Temporal Decay (TD) module to capture temporal dependencies and patterns in incomplete trajectories. The inclusion of the TD module allows for the conveyance of valuable information through the temporal flow. Furthermore, we curate and evaluate three practical datasets for the joint problem of trajectory imputation and prediction. Extensive experiments validate the exceptional performance of our proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses the lack of benchmarks and techniques for trajectory imputation and prediction in a unified manner.
