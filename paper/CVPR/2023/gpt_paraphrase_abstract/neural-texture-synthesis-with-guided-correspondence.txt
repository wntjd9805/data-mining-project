In the era of deep learning, the combination of Markov random fields (MRFs) and neural networks, referred to as the CNNMRF model, has not been fully appreciated despite its importance in classical approaches to texture synthesis. This paper aims to reintroduce and promote the use of CNNMRF for texture synthesis by presenting two key observations. Firstly, we propose the computation of Guided Correspondence Distance in nearest neighbor search, which enables the definition of a Guided Correspondence loss to measure the similarity between the synthesized texture and the example. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing neural approaches in both uncontrolled and controlled texture synthesis scenarios. Moreover, the Guided Correspondence loss can serve as a versatile textural loss in various tasks such as training generative networks for real-time controlled synthesis and single-image editing through inversion. In contrast, existing textural losses, including the Sliced Wasserstein loss, are not capable of handling these challenging tasks.
