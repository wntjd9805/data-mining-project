This study focuses on detecting outliers from a given data distribution using a technique called semantically coherent out-of-distribution (SCOOD) detection. When in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples coexist, it can lead to model overfitting if not properly distinguished. To solve this problem, the researchers propose a new uncertainty-aware optimal transport scheme. This scheme includes an energy-based transport mechanism that estimates the cost of uncertainty and promotes the assignment of semantic-agnostic representation. Additionally, an inter-cluster extension strategy is employed to enhance the discrimination of semantic properties among different clusters by increasing the margin distance. The researchers also introduce a T-energy score to address the magnitude gap between the parallel transport and classifier branches. Extensive experiments conducted on two standard SCOOD benchmarks demonstrate superior out-of-distribution detection performance, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by 27.69% and 34.4% on FPR@95, respectively.
