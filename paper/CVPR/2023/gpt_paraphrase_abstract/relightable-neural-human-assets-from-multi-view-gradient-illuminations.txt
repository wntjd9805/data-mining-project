This paper introduces UltraStage, a new 3D human dataset designed to facilitate research in human modeling and relighting. Unlike existing datasets, UltraStage provides high-quality images of over 2,000 human assets captured under both multi-view and multi-illumination settings. Each example in the dataset includes 32 surrounding views illuminated with one white light and two gradient illuminations. This allows for the recovery of detailed surface normal and spatially-varying material maps, which are useful for relighting applications. Additionally, the dataset includes neural human assets that enable novel view synthesis under arbitrary lighting conditions. These neural assets demonstrate high capture performance and can represent fine details such as facial wrinkles and cloth folds. The authors validate the dataset in single image relighting tasks, training neural networks with virtual relighted data from the neural assets and showcasing improvements in realistic rendering compared to previous methods. The UltraStage dataset will be made publicly available to the research community to promote advancements in human modeling and rendering tasks.
