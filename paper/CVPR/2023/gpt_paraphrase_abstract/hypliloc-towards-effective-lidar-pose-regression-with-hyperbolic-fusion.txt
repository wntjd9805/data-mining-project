LiDAR relocalization is essential in various fields such as robotics, autonomous driving, and computer vision. However, traditional LiDAR-based retrieval methods are computationally expensive and can result in inaccurate pose estimations if the database is sparse. In contrast, pose regression methods directly estimate global poses from images or point clouds, without the need for database matching. These methods are more computationally efficient. In this study, we propose a new model called HypLiLoc for LiDAR pose regression. Our model utilizes two separate backbones to extract 3D and 2D projection features. We also incorporate multi-modal feature fusion in Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces to enhance feature representations. Experimental results demonstrate that HypLiLoc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both outdoor and indoor datasets. We also conduct extensive studies on the framework design, confirming the effectiveness of multi-modal feature extraction and multi-space embedding. The code for our model is publicly available at the following GitHub link: https://github.com/sijieaaa/HypLiLoc.
