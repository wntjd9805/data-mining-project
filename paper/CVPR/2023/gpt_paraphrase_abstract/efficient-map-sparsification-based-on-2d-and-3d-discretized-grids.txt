Localization in robot autonomous navigation is commonly done using pre-built maps. However, as the map size increases, memory usage and localization efficiency become problematic. To address this, map sparsification is necessary to select a subset of the map for localization. Previous methods used quadratic terms in mixed-integer programming to ensure a uniform distribution of selected landmarks, which required high memory capacity and heavy computation. In this study, we propose a more efficient linear form of map sparsification and select uniformly distributed landmarks based on 2D discretized grids. Additionally, we introduce a space constraint term based on 3D discretized grids to reduce the impact of different spatial distributions between mapping and query sequences. Our extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superior efficiency and localization performance of our proposed methods.
