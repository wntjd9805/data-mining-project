The performance of 3D object detection from point clouds using DETR-based detectors is not as good as dense detectors with post-processing. This is because DETRs use a larger number of queries than the ground truth objects, leading to many false positives during inference. To address this issue, we propose a sparse 3D detector called Query Contrast Voxel-DETR (Con-QueR). Con-QueR eliminates false positives by enhancing queries based on their best-matched ground truth objects. We achieve this by creating positive and negative GT-query pairs for each ground truth object and using a contrastive loss to enhance positive pairs over negative ones. Con-QueR reduces false positives by approximately 60% and achieves a mAPH/L2 of 71.6 on the Waymo Open Dataset validation set, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by over 2.0 mAPH/L2. Our code is available.
