The availability of 3D LiDAR point cloud data has grown in recent years, but annotating this data is expensive and time-consuming. There is a need for semi-supervised semantic segmentation methods, particularly in the field of autonomous driving. Existing methods often use large segmentation networks to improve accuracy, but this comes at a high computational cost. They also use uniform sampling, which leads to sub-optimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a new pipeline that uses a smaller architecture and requires fewer ground-truth annotations while achieving superior segmentation accuracy. We introduce a novel Sparse Depthwise Separable Convolution module that reduces the network parameter count without sacrificing performance. To effectively sub-sample our training data, we introduce a new Spatio-Temporal Redundant Frame Downsampling (ST-RFD) method that leverages sensor motion to extract a more diverse subset of training data. To make the most of limited annotated data, we propose a soft pseudo-label method informed by LiDAR reflectivity. Our method outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches in terms of mIoU on benchmark datasets, SemanticKITTI and ScribbleKITTI, using less labeled data. We achieve this with a 2.3× reduction in model parameters and 641× fewer multiply-add operations. Additionally, our method demonstrates significant performance improvement on limited training data, highlighting the effectiveness of using fewer annotations.
