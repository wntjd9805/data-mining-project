We present a new approach for occlusion removal that does not require external supervision. Instead, we utilize Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to directly map position and viewing angles to occlusion-free scene details. Our method also incorporates a depth constraint to optimize camera parameters and scene reconstruction in the presence of occlusions. Through experiments on various datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. For more information, please visit our project page: https://freebutuselesssoul.github.io/occnerf.
