Massive datasets such as WebText, Wikipedia, Conceptual Captions, WebImageText, and LAION have greatly advanced AI. Large neural models trained on these datasets achieve impressive results and outperform many benchmarks. However, there is a notable absence of 3D data in these datasets. Despite the interest and potential applications in 3D vision, available datasets of high-quality 3D models are limited in size and diversity. To address this gap, we introduce Objaverse 1.0, a large dataset with over 800,000 3D models accompanied by descriptive captions, tags, and animations. Objaverse surpasses existing 3D repositories in terms of scale, category variety, and visual diversity within each category. We showcase the potential of Objaverse through four diverse applications: training generative 3D models, enhancing tail category segmentation on the LVIS benchmark, training object-navigation models for Embodied AI, and creating a new benchmark for analyzing the robustness of vision models. Objaverse has the potential to drive new research directions and enable novel AI applications.
