Unsupervised instance segmentation methods aim to train models without the need for dense annotations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach called Exemplar-FreeSOLO. This method leverages a limited number of unannotated exemplars to enhance unsupervised instance segmentation. Our framework introduces an exemplar-knowledge abstraction module to extract top-down guidance knowledge from unsupervised exemplar object extraction. Additionally, we design an exemplar embedding contrastive module to improve the discriminative capability of the segmentation model by utilizing contrastive exemplar-based guidance knowledge in the embedding space. We evaluate Exemplar-FreeSOLO on three image instance segmentation datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority over state-of-the-art methods through comprehensive experiments and in-depth analyses.
