Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown impressive results in various recognition tasks, but its effectiveness in fine-grained visual recognition (FGVR) is limited. This is because SSL focuses on features that are not suitable for capturing subtle differences in FGVR. To address this, we propose a new approach called common rationale learning, which aims to identify discriminative clues commonly found across instances and classes. These common rationales typically correspond to the discriminative patterns of key parts of foreground objects. We demonstrate that a common rationale detector can be learned by leveraging GradCAM induced from the SSL objective, without using pre-trained object parts or saliency detectors. This allows for seamless integration with the existing SSL process. We achieve this by fitting the GradCAM with a branch that has limited fitting capacity, enabling it to capture common rationales and discard less common discriminative patterns. During testing, the branch generates spatial weights to selectively aggregate features representing an instance. Experimental results on four visual tasks confirm that our proposed method significantly improves performance in different evaluation settings.
