Pseudo-labeling approaches have been found to be beneficial in semi-supervised learning for computer vision and medical imaging. However, most existing methods focus on identifying samples with high-confidence pseudo-labels based on model predicted probability, which can result in the inclusion of incorrectly labeled data if the threshold is not carefully adjusted. Additionally, low-confidence probability samples are often disregarded and not fully utilized. In this paper, we propose a new semi-supervised framework called PEFAT (Pseudo-loss Estimation and Feature Adversarial Training) to improve the performance of multi-class and multi-label medical image classification. Our approach involves modeling the distribution of loss and adversarial training. We introduce a reliable data selection scheme inspired by the assumption that clean data tends to have lower loss compared to noisy data. Instead of discarding samples with low-quality pseudo-labels, we use a regularization approach to extract discriminative information from them by introducing adversarial noises at the feature-level to smooth the decision boundary. Experimental results on three medical and two natural image benchmarks demonstrate the promising performance of PEFAT, surpassing other state-of-the-art methods.
