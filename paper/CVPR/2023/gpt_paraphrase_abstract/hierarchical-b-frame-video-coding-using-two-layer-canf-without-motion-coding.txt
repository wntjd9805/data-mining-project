We propose a new B-frame coding architecture called Conditional Augmented Normalization Flows (CANF), which eliminates the need for motion coding in video compression systems. This approach offers a new direction for learned video coding. Our architecture consists of a low-resolution image compressor as the base layer, which replaces the full-resolution motion compressor. The low-resolution coded image is combined with warped high-resolution images to generate a high-quality image that serves as a conditioning signal for the enhancement-layer image coding in full resolution. This eliminates the need for a motion information compressor, resulting in significantly reduced computational complexity. Additionally, we employ a skip-mode coding technique to reduce the transmitted latent samples. While our scheme's rate-distortion performance is slightly lower than the state-of-the-art B-CANF coding scheme, it outperforms other learned B-frame coding schemes. Furthermore, our scheme achieves a 45% reduction in multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) for encoding and a 27% reduction for decoding compared to B-CANF.
