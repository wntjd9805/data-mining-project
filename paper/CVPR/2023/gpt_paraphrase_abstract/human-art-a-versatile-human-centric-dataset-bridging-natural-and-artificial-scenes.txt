Artificial humans, such as sculptures, paintings, and cartoons, have been overlooked in current computer vision tasks that focus on natural images. To address this gap, we introduce the Human-Art dataset, which includes 50k high-quality images featuring both natural and artificial scenarios. This dataset contains over 123k instances of humans, annotated with various information such as bounding boxes, keypoints, self-contact points, and text information in both 2D and 3D. The Human-Art dataset is comprehensive and versatile, enabling various downstream tasks. We provide baseline results and detailed analyses for human detection, 2D and 3D human pose estimation, image generation, and motion transfer using this dataset. By presenting a challenging dataset, we aim to inspire further research and exploration of new questions in this field.
