Few-shot open-set recognition (FSOR) is a difficult but valuable task that aims to classify a sample into one of the pre-defined, closed-set categories using only a few examples, while also being able to identify and reject samples from unknown categories. In this study, we propose a new hybrid model for FSOR based on energy estimation. Our model consists of two branches: a classification branch that learns a metric for classifying samples into closed-set categories, and an energy branch that explicitly estimates the probability of a sample belonging to an open-set category. To achieve comprehensive detection of open-set samples, our model utilizes both class-wise and pixel-wise features to learn a global energy-based score. This involves learning a global energy score using class-wise features, as well as a local energy score using pixel-wise features. The model is designed to assign high energy scores to samples that deviate from the few-shot examples in either the class-wise or pixel-wise features, and low energy scores otherwise. We conducted experiments on three standard FSOR datasets and our model demonstrated superior performance.
