This study introduces a novel framework called signal-surface collaborative regularization (SSCR) for non-line-of-sight imaging, which aims to reconstruct hidden targets using multiply reflected light. Existing methods typically require raster scanning dense points on the relay surface, resulting in long acquisition times. The proposed SSCR framework addresses this issue by providing noise-robust reconstructions with a minimal number of measurements. Bayesian inference is used to design joint regularizations for the estimated signal, the 3D voxel-based representation of the objects, and the 2D surface-based description of the targets. This is the first work to combine regularizations in mixed dimensions for hidden targets. Experimental results on synthetic and experimental datasets demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method under both confocal and non-confocal settings. The study reports successful reconstruction of hidden targets with complex geometric structures using only 5x5 confocal measurements from public datasets, representing a 10,000-fold acceleration in the conventional measurement process. Additionally, the proposed method has low time and memory complexity with sparse measurements. This approach has promising applications in real-time non-line-of-sight imaging scenarios such as rescue operations and autonomous driving.
