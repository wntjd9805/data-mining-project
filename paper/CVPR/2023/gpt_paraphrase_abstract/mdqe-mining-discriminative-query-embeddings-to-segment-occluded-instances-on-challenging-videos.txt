Current video instance segmentation methods often struggle with challenging videos that contain occluded objects and crowded scenes. This is because the instance queries used in these methods cannot effectively capture the unique characteristics of instances, making it difficult for the segmenter to accurately distinguish them. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called discriminative query embeddings (MDQE) that can successfully segment occluded instances in challenging videos. Our method involves two main steps. Firstly, we initialize the positional embeddings and content features of object queries by considering their spatial contextual information and the motion between frames. This helps to provide a more accurate representation of the instances. Secondly, we introduce an inter-instance mask repulsion loss, which helps to separate each instance from its nearby non-target instances. This further improves the ability of our method to accurately segment instances, even in challenging scenarios.Our MDQE approach is the first video instance segmentation method to achieve state-of-the-art results on challenging videos, while also maintaining competitive performance on simpler videos. Specifically, when using ResNet50, MDQE achieves a mask average precision (mask AP) of 33.0% on the OVIS dataset and 44.5% on the YouTube-VIS 2021 dataset. To facilitate further research and implementation, we have made the code for MDQE available on GitHub at https://github.com/MinghanLi/MDQE_CVPR2023.
