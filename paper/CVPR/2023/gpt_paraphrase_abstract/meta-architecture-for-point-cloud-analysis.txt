Recent advancements in 3D point cloud analysis have introduced various network architectures to the field. However, the absence of a unified framework for interpreting these networks poses a challenge for systematic comparison, contrast, and analysis. This limitation hampers the healthy development of the field. In this paper, we propose a unified framework called PointMeta to address this issue and accommodate popular 3D point cloud analysis approaches. The introduction of PointMeta offers several advantages. Firstly, it enables fair comparison between different approaches, allowing for quick experimentation to validate empirical observations or assumptions derived from the comparison. Secondly, PointMeta provides a holistic view of the field, facilitating critical examination of common beliefs and key design decisions made by popular approaches. Lastly, by leveraging insights gained from the previous analyses, we are able to make simple adjustments to existing approaches and derive PointMetaBase, a basic building block. Extensive experiments conducted on challenging benchmarks demonstrate that PointMetaBase exhibits exceptional performance in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. This validates the necessity and benefits of high-level interpretation, contrast, and comparison, as exemplified by PointMeta. Notably, PointMetaBase outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method, Point-NeXt, by 0.7% to 2.1% in mIoU, while requiring only 2% to 13% of the computation cost on the S3DIS datasets. The code and models for PointMetaBase are available at https://github.com/linhaojia13/PointMetaBase. Figure 1 showcases the segmentation performance of PointMetaBase on the S3DIS dataset, highlighting its significant improvement over the state-of-the-art method, Point-NeXt, with a substantial reduction in FLOPs.
