We present an efficient method for reconstructing global illumination and physically-realistic SVBRDFs in large-scale indoor scenes. Unlike previous approaches that simplify global illumination as multiple environment maps, we propose a compact representation called Texture-based Lighting (TBL). TBL includes 3D meshes and HDR textures and effectively models both direct and infinite-bounce indirect lighting in the entire scene. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid lighting representation with precomputed irradiance, which improves efficiency and reduces rendering noise during material optimization. To address material ambiguity, we propose a three-stage material optimization strategy based on semantic segmentation and room segmentation priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing techniques in terms of both quantitative and qualitative results. Furthermore, it enables physically realistic mixed-reality applications such as material editing, editable novel view synthesis, and relighting.
