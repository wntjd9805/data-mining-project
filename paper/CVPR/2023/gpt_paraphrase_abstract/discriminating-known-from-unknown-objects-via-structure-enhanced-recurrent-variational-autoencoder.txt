Detecting unknown objects is an important skill for humans, and to replicate this ability, researchers propose a task called unsupervised out-of-distribution object detection (OOD-OD). This task aims to identify objects that have not been seen during model training, which is crucial for the safe deployment of object detectors. The main challenge in this task is the lack of unknown data for training. To address this, the authors propose a method called Structure-Enhanced Recurrent Variational AutoEncoder (SR-VAE). SR-VAE consists of two dedicated recurrent VAE branches. The first branch utilizes the Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG) operator to enhance the structure information in low-level features, thereby improving object localization. The second branch generates augmented classification features to enhance the discrimination ability of the object classifier. Additionally, a cycle-consistent conditional VAE branch is introduced to synthesize virtual out-of-distribution features, which helps in distinguishing unknown objects. The proposed method is evaluated in various experiments, including OOD-OD, open-vocabulary detection, and incremental object detection. The results demonstrate significant performance improvements compared to baseline methods. The code for the proposed method can be accessed at https://github.com/AmingWu/SR-VAE.
