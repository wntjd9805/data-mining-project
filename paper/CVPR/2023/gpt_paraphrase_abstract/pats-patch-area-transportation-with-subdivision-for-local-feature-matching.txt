Local feature matching is a technique used to establish correspondences between two images. While detector-free methods have shown better performance, they struggle with image pairs that have significant scale differences. This paper proposes a method called Patch Area Transportation with Subdivision (PATS) to address this issue. Instead of creating an image pyramid, the original image pair is divided into patches of equal size, which are then gradually resized and subdivided into smaller patches with the same scale. Estimating scale differences between these patches is challenging because it depends on relative camera poses and scene structures, making it spatially varying across image pairs. Additionally, obtaining ground truth for real scenes is difficult. To overcome these challenges, the paper introduces patch area transportation, a self-supervised learning approach to determine scale differences. Unlike bipartite graph matching, which only handles one-to-one matching, PATS can handle many-to-many relationships. The proposed method improves matching accuracy and coverage, and demonstrates superior performance in various downstream tasks, including relative pose estimation, visual localization, and optical flow estimation.
