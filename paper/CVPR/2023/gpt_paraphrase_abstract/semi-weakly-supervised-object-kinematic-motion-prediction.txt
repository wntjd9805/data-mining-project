This paper addresses the challenge of kinematic motion prediction for 3D objects. The task involves identifying the mobile parts of an object and determining their corresponding motion parameters. However, the variations in the structure and details of 3D objects make this task difficult, and the lack of large-scale labeled data hinders the performance of deep learning approaches. To overcome these challenges, the authors propose a semi-weakly supervised approach for object kinematic motion prediction. They make two key observations. Firstly, although fully annotated motion labels for 3D datasets are limited, there are existing datasets and methods that provide object part semantic segmentation at a large scale. Secondly, while semantic part segmentation and mobile part segmentation may not always align perfectly, it is possible to detect the mobile parts from the underlying 3D structure.To address this, the authors introduce a graph neural network that learns the mapping between hierarchical part-level segmentation and mobile part parameters. These parameters are refined using geometric alignment. The network is initially trained on the PartNet-Mobility dataset, which has fully labeled mobility information. It is then applied to the PartNet dataset, which has fine-grained and hierarchical part-level segmentation. This results in a large-scale dataset of 3D objects with pseudo-labeled mobility information, which can be used for weakly-supervised learning with pre-existing segmentation.Experimental results demonstrate significant performance improvements when using the augmented data with the proposed method for kinematic motion prediction on 3D partial scans.
