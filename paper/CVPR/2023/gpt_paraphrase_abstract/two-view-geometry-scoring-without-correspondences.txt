Camera pose estimation for two-view geometry traditionally uses RANSAC, where multiple image correspondences are used to generate hypotheses and find the best model based on inlier count. However, we have found that this scoring heuristic can favor suboptimal models in certain situations. To address this issue, we propose the Fundamental Scoring Network (FSNet), which provides a score for a pair of overlapping images and any proposed fundamental matrix. Unlike traditional methods that rely on sparse correspondences, FSNet incorporates a two-view geometry model using an epipolar attention mechanism that predicts the pose error of the two images. FSNet can be integrated into RANSAC loops seamlessly. We evaluate FSNet on fundamental and essential matrix estimation using indoor and outdoor datasets and demonstrate its ability to identify good poses even with limited or unreliable correspondences. Additionally, we show that when combined with the MAGSAC++ scoring approach, FSNet achieves state-of-the-art results.
