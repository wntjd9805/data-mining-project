Gait recognition is a crucial technology for long-distance identification, gaining popularity in research and industry. However, current techniques perform poorly in real-world scenarios, and conclusions drawn from indoor datasets may not apply to practical applications. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive benchmark study rather than focusing on a specific model. The authors develop OpenGait, a flexible and efficient gait recognition codebase, and conduct ablative experiments to explore recent developments in the field. They identify limitations in prior works and propose a simple, powerful, and robust baseline model called Gait-Base. Through extensive comparisons on public datasets, Gait-Base demonstrates strong performance in both indoor and outdoor situations.
