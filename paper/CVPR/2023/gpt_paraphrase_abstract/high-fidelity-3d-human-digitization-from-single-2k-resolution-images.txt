We propose a method called 2K2K for high-quality 3D human body reconstruction from 2K resolution images. Our method utilizes a large-scale 2K human dataset and employs separate networks to recover the global shape and details of the human body. A low-resolution depth network predicts the overall structure, while a part-wise image-to-normal network predicts the finer details. A high-resolution depth network combines the global shape and detailed structures to generate high-resolution front and back side depth maps. We provide the code and 2,050 3D human models with texture maps, 3D joints, and SMPL parameters for research purposes. Our method outperforms recent works on various datasets in terms of performance.
