We present a novel approach called RHWF (Recurrent homography estimation framework using Homography-guided image Warping and Focus transformer) that achieves high accuracy in estimating homography. RHWF combines homography-guided image warping and the attention-focusing mechanism of FocusFormer to improve feature consistency and intra-inter correspondence. This approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods like LocalTrans and IHN in terms of accuracy and parameter efficiency. On the MSCOCO dataset, RHWF reduces the mean average corner error (MACE) by approximately 70% and 38.1%, while saving parameter costs by 86.5% and 24.6% compared to LocalTrans and IHN respectively. RHWF can be used in 1-scale for efficiency or 2-scale for accuracy, with the 1-scale version already surpassing most previous methods. The source code for RHWF is available at https://github.com/imdumpl78/RHWF.
