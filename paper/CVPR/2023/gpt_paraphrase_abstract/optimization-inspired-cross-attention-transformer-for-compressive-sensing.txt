The deep unfolding network (DUN) has gained attention in compressive sensing (CS) due to its interpretability and high performance. However, existing DUNs often sacrifice parameter efficiency and suffer from feature information loss. In this paper, we propose an iterative process called Optimization-inspired Cross-attention Transformer (OCT) module, which leads to a lightweight OCT-based Unfolding Framework (OCTUF) for image CS. Our framework incorporates a Dual Cross Attention (Dual-CA) sub-module, consisting of an Inertia-Supplied Cross Attention (ISCA) block and a Projection-Guided Cross Attention (PGCA) block. The ISCA block introduces multi-channel inertia forces and enhances memory effect through cross attention mechanism between adjacent iterations. The PGCA block promotes information interaction by incorporating inertia force into the gradient descent step through a cross attention block. Extensive CS experiments demonstrate that our OCTUF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of performance while maintaining lower complexity.
