Multi-instance learning (MIL) is a successful approach for classifying whole-slide pathological images (WSIs) due to their high resolution and slide-level labels. However, existing MIL methods have a limitation in that the bag contextual prior can lead to capturing false correlations between bags and labels. This limitation hinders the performance of current MIL methods. To address this issue, we propose a new approach called Interventional Bag Multi-Instance Learning (IBMIL) that aims to achieve unbiased bag-level prediction. Unlike traditional likelihood-based strategies, IBMIL utilizes backdoor adjustment for interventional training, effectively reducing the bias caused by the bag contextual prior. It is important to note that IBMIL is independent of existing bagMIL methods, making it compatible with and capable of improving the performance of current schemes. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, and the code is publicly available at https://github.com/HHHedo/IBMIL.
