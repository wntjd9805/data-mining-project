Human intelligence relies on the ability to understand abstract physical concepts and their functioning in the world through observation. This skill is acquired by perceiving the environment in terms of objects and relationships without external guidance. Recent approaches have focused on learning representations centered around objects and visually observable concepts such as shape, size, and location. However, this paper takes a step further by aiming to discover and represent intrinsic physical concepts like mass and charge. To accomplish this, the paper introduces PHYCINE, a system that can infer physical concepts at various abstract levels without the need for supervision. The key insights of PHYCINE are twofold: commonsense knowledge emerges through prediction, and physical concepts at different levels should be reasoned in a bottom-up manner. Empirical evaluation confirms that the variables inferred by PHYCINE align with the properties of the corresponding physical concepts. Additionally, the paper demonstrates that incorporating object representations with the discovered physical concept variables can enhance performance in causal reasoning tasks, specifically ComPhy.
