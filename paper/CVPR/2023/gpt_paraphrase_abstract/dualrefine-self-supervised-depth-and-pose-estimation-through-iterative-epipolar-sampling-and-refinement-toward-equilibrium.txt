The DualRefine model proposed in this study integrates depth and pose estimation in a feedback loop to enhance accuracy in self-supervised multi-frame depth estimation. By incorporating traditional structure-from-motion principles, the model iteratively refines depth estimates and feature maps using a deep equilibrium model framework. Local matching costs are computed based on epipolar geometry, which is influenced by accurate pose predictions. The refined depth estimates and feature maps are then used to compute pose updates, gradually altering the epipolar geometry during the refinement process. Experimental results on the KITTI dataset demonstrate superior performance in depth prediction and odometry prediction compared to existing self-supervised baselines.
