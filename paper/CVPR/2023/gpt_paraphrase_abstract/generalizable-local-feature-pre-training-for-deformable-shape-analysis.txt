Transfer learning is crucial for addressing problems when there is limited training data available. Although various transfer learning methods have been proposed for 3D tasks, they often operate on entire 3D objects or scenes, making them ineffective for generalizing to new classes of shapes, particularly deformable or organic shapes. Additionally, there is a lack of understanding about the factors that enable pre-trained features to transfer across significantly different 3D shape categories. To tackle these challenges, this paper explores the relationship between feature locality and transferability in tasks involving deformable 3D objects. It also compares different backbones and losses for local feature pre-training. The study reveals that learned features can be useful in such tasks, but their effectiveness depends on the choice of the receptive field size. To address this, the paper proposes a differentiable method for optimizing the receptive field within 3D transfer learning. As a result, the paper introduces the first learnable features that can successfully generalize to previously unseen classes of 3D shapes, including humans and animals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves state-of-the-art results in various downstream tasks such as segmentation, shape correspondence, and classification.
