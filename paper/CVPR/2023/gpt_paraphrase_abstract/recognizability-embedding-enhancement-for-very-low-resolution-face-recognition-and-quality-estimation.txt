This paper focuses on the challenges of very low-resolution face recognition (VLRFR), which includes small regions of interest and poor resolution. Instead of improving the visual quality, the paper proposes principled approaches to enhance the recognizability of faces in the embedding space. The authors introduce a recognizability index (RI) that measures the proximity of each face embedding to unrecognizable faces and the closeness to positive and negative class prototypes. They also develop an index diversion loss to push low RI face embeddings away from the unrecognizable faces cluster, thereby improving recognizability. Additionally, a percep-tibility attention mechanism is introduced to highlight the most recognizable face regions for better embedding learning. The proposed model is trained end-to-end and simultaneously addresses recognizability-aware embedding learning and face quality estimation. Extensive evaluations on three low-resolution datasets and face quality assessment demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model compared to state-of-the-art methods.
