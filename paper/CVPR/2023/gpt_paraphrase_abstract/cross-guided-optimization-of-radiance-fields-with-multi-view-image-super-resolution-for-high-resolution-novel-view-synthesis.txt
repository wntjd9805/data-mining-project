We propose a new framework for high-resolution novel view synthesis (HRNVS) by combining single-image super-resolution (SISR) and radiance fields. Traditional radiance fields have limitations in improving performance for high-resolution synthesis. To address this, we introduce cross-guided optimization, where we perform multi-view image super-resolution (MVSR) on train-view images during the radiance fields optimization process. This involves fusing the feature map from SISR and voxel-based uncertainty fields generated from integrated errors of train-view images. By repeatedly updating the radiance fields optimization with multi-view consistency and high-frequency details, our method significantly improves the performance of HRNVS. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to existing methods.
