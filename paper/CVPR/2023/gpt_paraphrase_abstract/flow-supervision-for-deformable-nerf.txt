This paper introduces a novel approach for deformableNeRF that utilizes optical flow as supervision. The main challenge addressed in this research is the computational inefficiency of enforcing flow constraints on the backward deformation field used in deformable NeRFs. The study reveals that inverting the backward deformation function is unnecessary for calculating scene flows between frames. This finding simplifies the problem significantly by eliminating the requirement for deformation functions that can be analytically inverted. Instead, the proposed method, based on the inverse function theorem, can be applied to a wide range of commonly used backward deformation fields due to its weak assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in monocular novel view synthesis with fast object motion, showing significant improvements compared to baselines that lack flow supervision.
