The remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) technique is used to estimate pulse-related metrics, such as heart rate and respiratory rate, from facial videos for health monitoring. While deep rPPG methods can model noise and estimate high-quality signals in similar scenarios, they may not generalize well to target test domains with unseen noise and distortions. To address this, we propose a dual-bridging network that aligns intermediate domains and synthesizes target noise in the source domain to improve the generalization ability of rPPG models. We also introduce adversarial noise generation, where the noise generator competes indirectly with the noise reducer, and hard noise pattern mining to enhance the robustness of the noise reducer. Our method is evaluated on three public datasets with different interferences, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness under various cross-domain scenarios.
