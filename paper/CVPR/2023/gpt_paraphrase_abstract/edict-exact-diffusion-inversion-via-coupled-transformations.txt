The problem of finding an initial noise vector to produce an input image in denoising diffusion models (DDMs) is important for real image editing. The current approach, using denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIMs), is unstable and can result in incorrect image reconstruction and loss of content. To address these issues, we propose a method called Exact Diffusion Inversion via Coupled Transformations (EDICT) inspired by affine coupling layers. EDICT allows for mathematically exact inversion of real and model-generated images by maintaining two coupled noise vectors that alternate inverting each other. We demonstrate that EDICT successfully reconstructs real images with high fidelity using Stable Diffusion, a state-of-the-art latent diffusion model. On complex image datasets like MS-COCO, EDICT outperforms DDIM with a two-fold improvement in mean square error of reconstruction. EDICT also enables a wide range of image edits while preserving the original image structure, including local and global semantic edits and image stylization. EDICT does not require model training/finetuning, prompt tuning, or extra data, and can be combined with any pretrained DDM.
