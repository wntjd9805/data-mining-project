Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve the illumination and quality of low-light images. Most existing methods enhance low-light images globally, without considering the semantic information of different regions. This can lead to a loss of original colors in specific regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new framework called semantic-aware knowledge-guided framework (SKF), which incorporates semantic priors from a semantic segmentation model. SKF consists of three components: a semantic-aware embedding module, which integrates semantic priors in the feature representation space; a semantic-guided color histogram loss, which maintains color consistency across different instances; and a semantic-guided adversarial loss, which improves texture generation using semantic priors. Our SKF framework is versatile and performs well in LLIE tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models equipped with SKF outperform baseline methods on multiple datasets, and SKF is also effective across different models and scenes. The code for SKF is available at Semantic-Aware-Low-Light-Image-Enhancement.
