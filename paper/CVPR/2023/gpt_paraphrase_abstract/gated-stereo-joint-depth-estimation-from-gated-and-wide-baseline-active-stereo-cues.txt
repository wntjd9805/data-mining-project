Gated Stereo is a novel technique for estimating depth from active gated stereo images. It utilizes both multi-view cues and time-of-flight intensity cues from active gating, resulting in high-resolution and long-range depth estimation. The method combines monocular and stereo depth prediction branches through a fusion stage, ensuring accurate depth estimation. Supervised and gated self-supervision losses are employed to train the model effectively. To support the training and validation process, a synchronized gated stereo dataset for automotive scenarios is collected. Experimental results demonstrate that Gated Stereo outperforms other RGB stereo and monocular gated methods, achieving more than a 50% improvement in mean absolute error (MAE) compared to the best RGB stereo method and a 74% MAE improvement compared to existing monocular gated methods for distances up to 160 m. The code, models, and datasets used in the study are publicly available.
