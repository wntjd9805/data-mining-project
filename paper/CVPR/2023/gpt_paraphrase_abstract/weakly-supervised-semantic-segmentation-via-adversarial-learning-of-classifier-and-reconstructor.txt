We present a new approach for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) that addresses two common issues with Class Activation Maps (CAMs). CAMs often fail to cover the entire object and can be activated in irrelevant regions. To overcome these problems, our framework utilizes adversarial learning between a classifier and an image reconstructor. By decomposing an image into class-wise segments, we can assess the precision of segmentation based on the inferability between segments. We measure inferability using the reconstruction quality of one segment from the others, with imprecise segments being those that can be easily reconstructed. To implement this idea in WSSS, we simultaneously train a classifier to generate CAMs and a reconstructor to measure inferability. Similar to GANs, these two models are trained in an adversarial manner, providing positive feedback to each other. Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both PAS-CAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 datasets. The code for our framework is available at https://github.com/sangrockEG/ACR.
