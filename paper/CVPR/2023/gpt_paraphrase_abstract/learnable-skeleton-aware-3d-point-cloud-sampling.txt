This paper introduces a new method for point cloud sampling, which is important for efficient analysis of large-scale point clouds. Traditional task-specific sampling methods often do not effectively explore the geometries of objects. In this study, we propose a skeleton-aware learning-to-sample method that utilizes object skeletons as prior knowledge to preserve object geometry and topology during sampling. Without the need for labor-intensive annotations, we first learn category-agnostic object skeletons using the medial axis transform in an unsupervised manner. These skeletons are then used to evaluate the histogram of local feature sizes, which guides the skeleton-aware sampling process from a probabilistic perspective. The proposed sampling pipeline, along with the task network, can be trained end-to-end using the reparameterization trick. Experimental results on three popular downstream tasks (point cloud classification, retrieval, and reconstruction) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for efficient point cloud analysis.
