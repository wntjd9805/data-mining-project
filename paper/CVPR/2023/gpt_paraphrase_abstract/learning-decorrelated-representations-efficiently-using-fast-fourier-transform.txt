Barlow Twins and VICReg are self-supervised representation learning models that use regularizers to reduce feature correlation. While these models are effective, their training can be computationally intensive for high-dimensional embeddings. The computation time for computing the loss for 𝑛 samples is 𝑂 (𝑛𝑑2) due to the regularizers being defined in terms of individual elements of a cross-correlation or covariance matrix. In this study, we introduce a modified decorrelating regularizer that can be computed in 𝑂 (𝑛𝑑 log 𝑑) time using Fast Fourier Transform. Additionally, we propose a cost-effective technique to address the development of undesirable local minima that occur with the relaxation. The proposed regularizer achieves comparable accuracy to existing regularizers in downstream tasks, while requiring less memory and faster training for large 𝑑.
