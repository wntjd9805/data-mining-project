This study focuses on the reconstruction of neurons in the adult fly brain using high-resolution electron microscopy (EM) data. Neuron reconstruction is important for understanding intelligence and neural functions. However, current deep learning-based methods for neuron reconstruction cannot accurately determine the distribution and morphology of somas (the central part of neurons) due to the lack of EM datasets specifically annotated for somas. Additionally, the process of reconstructing neurons in the full brain is time-consuming due to the large size of EM data. To address these challenges, the authors developed an efficient method for soma reconstruction in the adult fly brain. They created a high-resolution EM dataset with detailed manual annotations on somas. Using this dataset, they proposed a two-stage deep learning algorithm that accurately predicts the locations and boundaries of soma instances in 3D. They also implemented a parallelized data processing pipeline to expedite the reconstruction process for the entire brain. The authors validated the effectiveness of their proposed method through quantitative and qualitative benchmark comparisons on a test set. They also provided preliminary statistics on the reconstructed somas in the full adult fly brain from a biological perspective. The code and dataset used in this study are publicly available for further research.
