We present a novel interferometric technique for passive time-of-flight imaging and depth sensing with micrometer axial resolutions. Our method utilizes a modified full-field Michelson interferometer that utilizes sunlight as the sole light source. The broad spectral bandwidth of sunlight enables the acquisition of time-resolved scene responses at micrometer resolutions through a straightforward axial scanning process. Furthermore, the wide angular bandwidth of sunlight allows for the capture of time-of-flight measurements that are unaffected by indirect illumination effects, including interreflections and subsurface scattering. To validate our approach, we construct an outdoor experimental prototype that operates under direct sunlight and challenging environmental conditions such as machine vibrations and vehicular traffic. Using this prototype, we successfully demonstrate various passive imaging capabilities, including robust micrometer-scale depth sensing in the presence of indirect illumination, direct-only imaging, and imaging through diffusers.
