Current denoising studies aim to obtain clean images with clear structures from noisy observations. One approach is to use additional guidance images with high signal-to-noise ratios, typically acquired in different spectral bands like near infrared. However, previous guided denoising methods require well-aligned input images, whereas a more common approach is to use a stereo camera system to capture paired noisy target and guidance images. Unfortunately, current studies on cross-spectral stereo matching do not guarantee pixel-level registration accuracy and rarely consider noise contamination.In this study, we propose a novel guided denoising framework for cross-spectral stereo images. Instead of aligning input images through conventional stereo matching, we aggregate structures from the guidance image to estimate a clean structure map for the noisy target image. This clean structure map is then used to regress the final denoising result using a spatially variant linear representation model. To implement this framework, we introduce a neural network called SANet, which facilitates the entire guided denoising process.Experimental results demonstrate that SANet effectively transfers structures from unaligned guidance images to the restoration result, surpassing state-of-the-art denoisers across various stereo image datasets. Additionally, our structure aggregation strategy exhibits potential for other unaligned guided restoration tasks such as super-resolution and deblurring.
