Volumetric scene representations are commonly used for creating realistic views of static scenes and are essential for various 6-DoF video techniques. However, the rendering procedures for these representations involve making trade-offs between quality, rendering speed, and memory efficiency. Existing methods have not been able to effectively achieve real-time performance, small memory usage, and high-quality rendering for challenging real-world scenes. To address these challenges, we introduce Hy-perReel, a new 6-DoF video representation. Hy-perReel consists of two main components: (1) a ray-conditioned sample prediction network that enables high-quality rendering at high frame rates and resolutions, and (2) a compact and memory-efficient dynamic volume representation. Our 6-DoF video pipeline outperforms previous and contemporary approaches in terms of visual quality while requiring less memory, and it can render at up to 18 frames per second at megapixel resolution without the need for custom CUDA code.
