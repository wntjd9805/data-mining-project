Previous research on the ObjectNav task has focused on learning the association between visual inputs and goals during training. This association, also known as experience, provides prior knowledge of navigating in training environments. While this experience is helpful in inferring the goal's likely location in similar test environments, it has a negative impact on navigation when there is a significant difference in layout between the test and training environments. To address this issue, we propose the layout-based soft Total Direct Effect (L-sTDE) framework, which leverages causal inference to adjust the navigation policy's prediction. The framework calculates the layout gap, defined as the KL divergence between the posterior and prior distribution of the object layout, to control the effect of the experience. Experimental results on AI2THOR, RoboTHOR, and Habitat demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code for our method is available at https://github.com/sx-zhang/Layout-based-sTDE.git.
