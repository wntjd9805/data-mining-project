Point clouds are widely used in 3D sensing but lack intrinsic structural information of objects, making it difficult to establish correspondences between point clouds of deformable shapes. To address this challenge, we propose Neural Intrinsic Embedding (NIE) which embeds each vertex into a high-dimensional space while respecting the intrinsic structure. We also introduce a weakly-supervised learning framework for non-rigid point cloud registration based on NIE. Our framework does not require extensive offline basis construction or ground-truth correspondence labels for supervision. Empirical results show that our framework performs as well as or better than state-of-the-art baselines, which usually require more supervision and/or structural geometric input.
