Training deep neural networks (DNN) with inaccurate labels is difficult as the DNN may memorize these labels, resulting in poor generalization. To address this, a meta-learning based label correction strategy has been widely adopted, which identifies and corrects noisy labels using clean validation data. However, previous methods that simultaneously optimize model weights and label distribution have limitations in representation ability and label accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel label purifier called DMLP that decouples the label correction process into label-free representation learning and a simple meta label purifier. This allows DMLP to focus on extracting discriminative features and correcting labels in two distinct stages. DMLP can be easily integrated into existing neural networks or robust learning methods, and achieves state-of-the-art results on various noisy datasets, particularly those with high noise levels. The code for DMLP is available at https://github.com/yuanpengtu/DMLP.
