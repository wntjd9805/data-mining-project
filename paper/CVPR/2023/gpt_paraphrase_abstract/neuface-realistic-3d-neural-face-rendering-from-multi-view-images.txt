Realistic rendering of faces is important for various computer vision and graphics applications. However, accurately and efficiently recovering 3D facial representations from multi-view images is challenging due to the complex properties of faces. This paper introduces a new 3D face rendering model called NeuFace, which utilizes neural rendering techniques to learn accurate and meaningful 3D representations. NeuFace incorporates neural BRDFs (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions) into physically based rendering, capturing both facial geometry and appearance. An approximated BRDF integration and a new low-rank prior are introduced to reduce ambiguities and improve the performance of facial BRDFs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of NeuFace in rendering human faces, as well as its ability to generalize to other objects. The code for NeuFace is available for public use.
