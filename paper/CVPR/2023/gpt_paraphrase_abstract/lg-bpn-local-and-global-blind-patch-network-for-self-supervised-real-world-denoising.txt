Most self-supervised denoising methods fail to effectively remove real noise due to strong spatial noise correlation. Existing methods either ignore this correlation or sacrifice fine textures. This paper introduces a new method called LG-BPN for self-supervised real-world denoising. LG-BPN incorporates spatial correlation statistics into the network design to restore local details and employs a dilated Transformer block to capture distant context information. These two innovations allow LG-BPN to simultaneously enhance fine structures and enable global interactions. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of LG-BPN. The code for LG-BPN is available at https://github.com/Wang-XIaoDingdd/LGBPN.
